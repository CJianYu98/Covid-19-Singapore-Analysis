The Vanilla Chai Cinnamon packs a punch with the aromatic fragrance of Spices! Lychee Mint is refreshing and Cucumber Mint is right between the two! There's a Kombucha for Everyone! 

Kombucha is a product of fermentation is full of probiotics (good gut bacteria). These probiotics in kombucha help with detoxification and regulate gut bacteria, helping to maintain a healthier digestive system. A healthy digestive system allows you to absorb more nutrients from your food, more regular bowel movement, reduce bloating and helps general wellness! Kombucha also has high amounts of antioxidants, helping to boost overall immunity.

Think it is ok
To demand a bit more from your bottle
To demand a bit more from your wine
To pamper yourself a bit more
To enjoy that shopping luxury just a little bit more
To lie in bed for that hr you didn't have before
To say for once with love what you never said before

You know it's ok
To demand a little bit more from your husband (not wife)
And also ok to demand a little bit more from life (life not wife meh)
A little gesture from LTA for one more month of no ERP
And maybe from URA to step in to also make parking free
From corporates to now pay for fibre broadband and aircons
Because there is merit in our claim that,
on our own, we rarely stream Spotify or play games on our iphones!

It's also OK to call up your boss and demand a bit more,
But let me remind you once again, here, you are really drunk and on your own
After all it's just wine. It's a whole lot of fun but no new super power ok?

Are you are fan of the current trending Basque Burn Cheesecake or our beloved Ondeh Ondeh cake? Well, if you are a fan like me, who adores both types of cakes, then you would not want to miss this Ondeh Ondeh Basque Cheese Cake by @lovetowhisk !
🔻
The Ondeh Ondeh flavor is subtle yet strong enough to give this cheese cake a different vibe and what I like is that you can customized the flavor with the separate desiccated Coconut and their home made Gula Melaka syrup! With the addition of these 2 ingredients, the flavor of the Ondeh Ondeh is brought up front and it’s overall taste is elevated! I thoroughly enjoy this!
🔻
Instructions are provided on the many ways on how you can enjoy the cake like eating it cold or even popping the cake into the microwave oven for a extra gooey texture!
🔻
If you are really a fan of both cakes then you definitely have to try this Ondeh Ondeh Burnt Cheesecake from @lovetowhisk !

Pattern by @yarnblossomboutique

This marks my 5th amigurumi project with the stash of milk cotton yarns I purchased here in SG in May. Comparing these to the 100% cotton yarn, the latter is definitely my yarn of choice for amigurumi projects which involve plenty of small parts. Unfortunately, 100% cotton yarns are mostly made in US/ UK, with each skein abt 3x more expensive here than in the source countries. With that, I'm torn between going for the better quality materials and keeping this hobby as affordable as possible. I'm also apprehensive towards expanding the range of colours I have, lest the unused skeins end up sitting in the corner of the cupboard (just cos those colours aren't used as frequently). #musingoftheday

Meanwhile, I shall save the decision making for another day and work on projects in the pipeline. Also managed to get my hands on #zoomigurumi6 , hopefully I'll get sth completed this peaceful long weekend

Some quotes are relatable. Some quotes which I don’t understand, I’ll goggle on them like this one for today. It comes from a novel “Crossing to Safety” by Wallace Stegner. that is about friendship and love. I read a few nice excerpts of this novel and just borrowed the ebook from library. Hopefully it’s a nice read! 🙂 Made some French toast today and recreated it into my childhood house drawing again with kaya, Nutella and chocolate syrup. 🤪 But this time, I added a couple. ❤️ 
Happy Friday and it’s a long weekend! 🥳🥳🥳

Bake these melt-in-mouth German Cookies in Vanilla bean, Uji Matcha & Valrhona Cocoa flavor. Which is your favourite?

Here’s sharing the recipe with you if you haven’t tried this popular cookie recipe in my blog. 😃

.
【𝐕𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐚 𝐆𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧 𝐌𝐞𝐥𝐭-𝐈𝐧-𝐌𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐡 𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐁𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐚𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐢】
.
𝙄𝙣𝙜𝙧𝙚𝙙𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙨: (makes about 50 pieces).
.
80g Blue Jacket All-Purpose Flour
125g unsalted butter, softened at room temperature
40g icing sugar, sifted 
1 teaspoon pure vanilla paste 
125g potato starch
 .
𝙈𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙙:
.
1. Use an electric mixer to beat the butter and icing sugar till light and fluffy. Add in the vanilla paste, continue to beat until well combined.
.
2. Sift in the potato starch and all purpose flour, mix with a spatula to form a soft dough.
.
𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆: 𝑳𝒆𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒅𝒐𝒖𝒈𝒉 𝒕𝒐 𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒍𝒍 𝒊𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒇𝒓𝒊𝒅𝒈𝒆 𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝒂𝒃𝒐𝒖𝒕 10 𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒖𝒕𝒆𝒔 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒇𝒊𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒅𝒐𝒖𝒈𝒉 𝒕𝒐𝒐 𝒔𝒐𝒇𝒕 𝒕𝒐 𝒉𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒍𝒆.
.
3. Divide the dough into 8 grams balls. Roll it round and place on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Use a fork to press lightly down and dip the fork in water after each press to prevent the cookie dough from sticking to the fork.
.
4. Bake in a preheated oven at 150 degree Celsius top and bottom heat, fan forced, for about 15 minutes.
.
5. Remove from the oven. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking tray for about 5 minutes to prevent breakage before you transfer to a wiring rack to cool down further.
.
.

The current retirement age in Singapore is 62 years old (as of 2020).

My philosophy is to live life on my own terms, and there will come a point in time when I want to be financially free, and continue working by choice. 

Have you ever thought of what you want to do in retirement? 🤔Do you know how much 💰 you’ll need to enjoy life in your later years? What about the different phases of retirement? Can we then prepare for each and every one of them such that we don’t have to worry about money?

Retirement planning has no one-size-fits-all approach because we all have different dreams and are at different stages in life. So we have to put together multiple strategies to create a worry-free retirement for ourselves!

---
I've recently discovered another way to increase the protein content of my humble bowl of porridge: Soy Milk!
-
The last time I did a protein porridge, I added skinless mung beans. This time, I made the same but replaced 1/4 of the liquid with unsweetened soy milk.
-
The result is a really creamy porridge, that will keep you full for longer. One of my main gripes with porridge is how I get hungry after an hour, because it consists of just simple carbohydrates and water. With the addition of beans and/or soya milk, you increase the protein content in an affordable (and vegan) way, and create a more satisfying meal for your stomach.
-
It's up to you to throw in some veggies, an egg, or some slices of pork. I like porridge with pickles on the side, like Achar or kimchi. Or you can make your own pickles. It's really up to you to make this dish your own.

.
✅ Banyak tempat di Singapura bisa dijangkau sama pejalan kaki. Misalnya favorit kami, jalan di Koon Seng Road. 
.
💜Ini adalah salah satu nama jalanan di kawasan Joo Chiat, Singapura. Kamu harus kesini dan membawa teman untuk saling memotret! Banyak Shophouse bercat pastel yang dihiasi keramik-keramik khas Peranakan seperti ubin-ubin yang memiliki segala rupa motif yang rumit. Joo Chiat & Katong adalah lingkungan bersejarah yang harus kamu kunjungi. Selain Shophouse berwarna-warni yang lucu, ada juga bar hipster, toko antik dan juga merupakan destinasi yang tepat untuk pecinta kuliner! ⠀
.
📍How to get there
Gampang banget untuk sampai kesana menggunakan transportasi umum! Turun di Dakota MRT Station, lalu berjalan ke halte bus Old Airport Road. Naik bus nomor 33, dan turunlah di Flora East, Joo Chiat Place. Dari sana, kamu bisa berjalan kaki menyusuri Koon Seng Road!

May be an image of 1 person and text that says 'NYONYA BEAUTY TIPS HOW TO TREAT DARK CIRCLES @thenyonyasisters Nyonya'.","One of the first places where we show visible signs of ageing is our eyes. This is because the skin surrounding our eyes is the most sensitive, delicate and thinnest skin on our body.  The thinness of the eye area leaves the skin open to damage. Some of the causes of those pesky dark spots include genetics, excessive sun exposure, rubbing or scratching your eyes, a lack of iron, poor nutrition, stress and dehydration.

Are you sick of always looking tired and older than you are? Well with advancements in technology there are many products and ingredients you can use to help combat, postpone, and even visibly change the way your eyes look.

Check out some remedies that we recommend: 
1) Eye Creams
2) Eye Masks
3) Preventative Measures
4) Sleep
5) Vitamins
6) Concealers

I use LumiSpa® Accent which targets the delicate under-eye area. This device uses a soft treatment head and topical solution to gently exfoliate the skin while deeply stimulating the delicate area under the eyes.

Overall, it is important that you treat your delicate eye area by using eye creams, eye masks, taking preventative measures, getting enough sleep and consuming foods that are high in Vitamin C and K. If dark circles do persist a concealer is a great go to for a quick and easy fix.

Cheap? Fashionable? Lightweight?⁠

Nope, these are not the main reasons you should care about when it comes to choosing face masks.⁠
⁠
Look for masks that...⁠
⁠
✅ Have multiple layers⁠
✅ Are made from fabrics that are easy to wash and tightly woven⁠
✅ Bonus points if the fabric has an antimicrobial or water repellent finish, especially for the outer layer. ⁠

He knows there is no medical explanation for the resurrection.

Why then would JJ believe that Jesus really existed, truly died and then came back to life?

Read his interview to find out how being a Christian changes the way he thinks about death and life as a doctor and why he looks forward to a world where his skills will not be needed at all. #tccjesusunmasked

Beautifully cut steel tongues vibrate harmoniously together to create an ethereal sound✨perfect for meditation, relaxation, and other sound healing experiences.

🙋‍♀️ In fact, the word ""Vast"" is beautifully carved into the drum too. Can you spot it?

A RAV, with its room-fillingly warm and soothing sound is the perfect companion for meditation, immediately attracting your attention and block out distracting thoughts and sensations. 

Curious about how it sounds like? Check out our story!

To fully experience the Rav Vast and effective relaxation, join us tonight (or every Tuesday evening) for our one-of-a-kind Rav Rest class💜

243,By valzy,2363089028630168446,2020-07-28 07:43:05,by_valzy,Photo by By valzy in Singapore with @deciem.,"Adding the The Ordinary Niacinamide aka Vitamin B3 serum into my skincare routine has got to be the most timely thing that happened in 2020.

With the frequent mask usage 😷 (Yes, please wear mask everyone!), all the pesky little friends are so eager to come out to play. 

Butttt, The Ordinary Niacinamide serum helps to keep them at bay. The serum reduce oilliness, minimises pores and calm down redness or irritations on the skin. I used it both AM and PM, occasionally layering the Rose Hip Oil in the PM after applying the serum as the first layer.

Initially, I didn’t really fancy the smell and texture of the Rose Hip Oil, till a friend suggested that I mix in with my Oat So Simple Moisturiser from @kravebeauty, and it was the most moisturising and hydrating combination ever✨

Have you tried any products from The Ordinary? @deciem

⁣
1. Sleep early!! ⁣😴
2. Time yourself when you practice questions⁣ ⏱
3. Practice practice practice!!! However, keep in mind that it’s really more important to understand your mistakes for each question instead of just doing repetitive work⁣
4. Come out with a weekly to-do list at the beginning of every week ⁣
5. Come out with a daily to-do list on the day before ⁣📝
6. When planning your to-do-list, always give yourself more time than you expect to finish a certain task.⁣
7. Keep your flow of daily revision and maintain a healthy balance between leisure and study. Take productive breaks that will sharpen your mind in between study sessions such as grabbing some fruits, playing badminton with friends and getting your daily tips from @matchamentor :P⁣ ⁣🤗

May be an image of text that says 'your order made day we our rightens yours'.,"Just another excuse to eat more cake, not that I ever needed one, thank you @holiyen, @itshuiling and @peefang for gifting me @bakesbymabs’ Basque Cheesecake Bars for my birthday! All three flavours were wonderfully balanced - Original, Matcha, and Earl Grey. The modified shape of the cake made it easier to consume and also meant more burnt edges which I felt helped to counter the heaviness of cheesy center. Although the texture of the cake was pretty firm, they weren’t too sweet and each held a delicate savoury note. My favourite being the Earl Grey Basque Cheesecake Bars as the flavour of the tea was distinct without being sharp or overpowering. The taste of cheese, tea, and the dark caramelised exterior were able to meld together harmoniously too.

I showed symptoms like coughing and blocked nose after visiting Lucky Plaza in Singapore where there was a positive case of Covid19 visited the mall at 12:00-12:55 PM. I also visited the mall late afternoon for lunch. I got so paranoid by my experience did not go so well.

Public Places Visited by Cases in the Community during Infectious Period
List of public places that confirmed cases had visited for more than 30 minutes

These public places had been visited for more than 30 minutes by the confirmed cases in the community. Those who had been identified as close contacts of confirmed cases would already have been notified by MOH.

If you have been at these locations1 during these specified timings you should:

monitor your health closely for 14 days from the date of visit,
see a doctor promptly if you develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose), as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and 
inform the doctor of your exposure history.
There is no need to avoid places where confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been, as the venues have been thoroughly disinfected.

The one thing you need to get out right away is lost at the bottom of your bag. Rather than constantly waste time searching for what you need, wouldn’t it be great if it was right there every time you opened your bag? **Bag not for sale**

With homemade salted syrup drizzled all over the fuwa fuwa pillows; the airy cheese foam, mascarpone creme, and crushed hazelnuts added to the whole textural experience. The caramel offered a good dose of saltiness to counter the natural egginess of the stack and was able to balance the sweeter components as well.

Enriched with the tropical flavours, the Mango-Passionfruit Soufflé Pancakes ($14.80) was all sweet, tangy, and tart. The vibrant tasting passionfruit coulis delivering a refreshing element to the eggy pancakes while the seasonal mango was fragrant and juicy. Topped with homemade coconut sago, chantilly cream, and snow icing powder, the soft stacks was overall light on the palette with the gentle sourness of the fruits used to counter the sweetness of the dessert.

It is the idea of something around the corner. 🌈 It is the idea of hope lying somewhere in the corner. Yesterday I washed off all my favourite chocolate paintings stored in the freezer and I felt surprisingly good. That’s the beauty of this art meditation. To focus and enjoy the process, without any clutter. The end results is secondary. Good memories will stay in you forever and I feel ready to start all over again. 😊 Today I woke up really late and lazed on the bed for a long time. Also had a quick simple brunch because I wanted to do a piece chocolate painting and re-try a cake recipe again. Love the plating today because the tray is a gift from my mother and the mug is a gift from my BFF. 🥰. The dorayaki and Jenny’s butter cookies are 😋😋😋! Also highly recommending this A&F Cafe Latory Matcha Latte bought from Don Don Donki! I used to drink the Cafe Latory blended series almost daily when I was staying in Tokyo. So, this drink brings back fond memories again. Let’s have a nice relaxing and restful Sunday. 🌿

A lot of things that would not normally happen has. I must admit - I may be an adult, but I have a lot of difficulty understanding most of the things I see around me, and on the news. Cancel culture, how the BLM movement resulted in the spawning of a new type of toxic activism, people who refuse to wear masks and throw insane tantrums in response to being asked to do so, and the disappointing behaviour from all sides during this year's elections (supporters and campaigners alike).

#SGGIGexclusivegiveaways
.
As we age, our cell regeneration rate slows down, which often causes dead skin cells to build up on the surface of our skin (e.g. on our face). This not only leaves our face looking dull, rough and dry, but it also causes excess oil and clogged pores, leading to blemishes and acne. Regular & proper exfoliation helps remove the layer of dead skin cells and impurities clogging your pores, opening the way for your skincare products to penetrate more deeply into your skin, rendering them more effective! 👍🏼

For me, I have been using @euphoriasingaporeofficial 's Aqua+ Series Smoothing-Bright Soft Scrub Essence the past few weeks. This Soft Scrub Essence is an oil-free, alcohol-free gentle facial exfoliator that is suitable for oily & acne prone skin (like mine!). Whilst using it, I can literally feel my dead skin cells coming off. After rinsing it off, I felt my face becoming much smoother 😍 Btw, one of the ingredients in this soft scrub, Ac.Net™, helps fight breakouts by reducing hyperseborrhoea, hyperkeratosis, inflammation and bacterial proliferation! I was instantly attracted to this product when I saw this product highlight! 😱

Want to try out this exfoliator for yourself?

Cold bus ride, morning was oddly peaceful. I was truly enjoying the distance, the journey without feeling like i'm squished. Phase 2 - new normal is not doing well for me, with more crowds now.
Update; just saw that the @smrtsingapore has plan to remove bus 700 due to the drastic drop of passenger during this period. I have to say it's really due to the work from home situation, bus 700 has never been so empty and it's one of the happiest thing to some resident in Bukit Panjang as it made us commute to work easier. I really hope they stay. As this is the bus I took out to everywhere.

May be an image of 2 people.","Today I had completed 100 days of consecutive morning running since 17th April 2020! To mark this milestone, I planned for a run to circle around Sengkang and Punggol's PCN. Had wanted to complete the full park connector loop but due to time constraints and body not fully ready for the distance, I had to cut short and end it. Nonetheless, am very happy to achieve 18.4KM today with total move time of 2hours 40minutes! 

Today's weather is just nice and cooling. I even had the opportunity to catch sunrise at Punggol Point!

Never in my life would I imagine myself doing this. I used to think 2.4KM is not achievable. Since young, I always find myself panting very easily and having bad stamina. Had started running on and off since last year but not fully committed to it.. until circuit breaker began. The first 2 weeks of CB felt like everything was spiraling out of control. Many gurus advocate discipline so I chose one for myself - Wake up early before the sun is up and run before I start the day. I had not planned for 100 days streak but as I run daily, I felt motivated to look forward to a goal.

I had never ran more than 3KM but day after day, I pushed my distance a little and eventually hit 5KM by Day 29. I then planned for 60 days running streak. But as 60 days approached, I thought why not 75 days and then pushed it a step further again to 100 days. 100 days isn't very short neither is it very long. There were times I had felt like giving up since there wasn't any prize (except a sense of accomplishment and self acknowledgement that I could complete goals). It was especially tough around Day 40 to 50 as I slept and woke up late. There wasn't anyone looking until Day 50 when some of my friends recommended using @strava! This is a great social tool to share your workout with like-minded individuals. Having friends who know my goals makes me accountable (like waking up early).

Tomorrow, I will take a day's rest as I promised to give myself a day off when I completed this goal. I look forward to more running but hope I can train my body to run faster and longer at aerobic heart rate.","Coney Island, Punggol pcn, Sengkang pcn, Buangkok green pcn",21,6

Sedentary lifestyle or vigorous activities ⛹️‍♀️ such as running, can tense up your hamstrings. 

Tight hamstrings will inadvertently pull your hips down; reducing the healthy lumbar curve you have, and cause back pain as a result! Over time, this can affect your sitting postures, overall spine health, and even your comfort and stability while sitting on the floor! 

Try practicing this stretch regularly to restore your full range of motion, increase blood flow, and reduce your risk of injury💪 !

Our body stretch class on Thursdays and Sunday and will guide you through a series of focused poses and movement to release muscle tension around neck, shoulders, upper back and lower back, leaving your body, mind and spirit happy and relaxed after the session💜

Some became Circuit Bakers with their banana bread & others became Circuit Makers with their Dalgona Coffees. Two tribes, united by a love of food.⁣
⁣
In light of Culinarians Day, we’d like to urge everyone to give cooking/baking a go! To help make it as hassle-free as possible, we’ve curated some cool and handy gadgets that’ll make certain steps in the kitchen way easier.⁣
 ⁣
1) Timber Spatula ⁣
Dishwasher safe and BPA free, you can mix, scoop and scrape effortlessly.⁣
⁣
2) Barry Cheese/Vegetable Grater ⁣
Grate like a pro with this stainless steel & 100% food-safe plastic grater.⁣
⁣
3) YolkFrog Egg Separator⁣
With just a squeeze, you can easily separate the egg yolks from the whites.⁣
⁣
4) Bag Bunny Package Opener ⁣
Rather than tearing open a bag of flour and making a mess, let this bunny chomp through it smoothly and seamlessly without the mess.",Plaza Singapura,34,4

No Fuss! ✌🏻 I did the same for another card that just came in by calling the hotline & that was done instantly 😆 so its actually $400 in 4 mins! 

Smartypence Tip 💡
Don’t be lazy - Every pence counts in such uncertain times so check your credit card bills ALWAYS for frauds & to track your expenses. If you have problems controlling your spends, either cancel your card totally or convert your mounting credit card bills into a personal interest loan with a much lower interest rate – check with your bank for options!

Before the creative power couple embarked on this journey, they thought that pursuing success and excellence in their respective fields was a worthwhile goal.

However, over time, their successes and accomplishments ultimately felt empty whilst their failures felt debilitating. This led them to question what life was all about.

We will work hard and do our very best to prevent such a “second wave” in Singapore. 

Through strict border measures, as well as aggressive testing and tracing, we should be able to keep infection rates under control without having to impose another circuit breaker. But everyone must do their part too, and exercise social responsibility.

Be reminded as we leave our house and return that we are Super Blessed by the blessings of Psalm 23 as sons and daughters of the Lord, and that we can just rest in Him each day. 
“The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake. Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.”

今天午餐我也來烤一下 ～🤣 
但是沒有Basil  冰箱有spinach, bacon 和mozzarellas~ 
那就烤Spinach Bacon Mozzarella pizza 好了
今天做的皮 比较厚了点 然而恰恰好
因为spinach 用olive和garlic 炒后会比较湿 厚皮口感的pizza 皮  正好可以包容cheesy又比较湿的馅料 👏👏
这组合真的好味又好吃😋 改天再做 .

====
Last January, I found myself drawn to this vintage bookstore in London. After walking past it multiple times, I finally went in, because my eyes were drawn to a worn out copy of Mrs Beeton's book of cookery. It was written to teach young, new wives how to cook. Many editions were printed, and mine is from the 1913. Since then, I have come to own another even older copy, and am trying to hint to my parents that I want theirs as well.
---
The great thing about the recipes in this book is how cheap they are. They were written with costs. Of course, the value of money now is different from the value of money then. Nevertheless, some of them can still be replicated cheaply today.
Case in point: her bean croquettes.
---
I use dried beans because I see no value in paying for a tin can and the associated water content. I get mine from Albert Court Dried Goods Market. Also, don't waste your time soaking beans. It isn't necessary.
---
*1 Cup of Dried Beans (whichever beans you can get your hands on), boiled till soft (took me 1.5 hrs)
*Enough bread crumbs to give the mashed beans some structure
*Fried onions
*Salt & Pepper
*1 Beaten Egg
*More breadcrumbs to coat the croquettes
---
The beans alone would cost about 30 cents, and this makes enough patties for 4 individual meals. It goes really well with mustard on the side, or any Savoury gravy.
---
I will continue to test out cost-saving recipes from Mrs Beeton's book, making use of the cheap ingredients we can get in Singapore. If you like it, do try out the various dishes and let me know what you think of them.

How’s your post #circuitbreaker face care routine? For me, I’ve been using face masks more diligently so I can face the world with a firm, glowing skin 🤭 Recently, I’ve been using 2 Calosemi Masks that @plash_beaute introduced to me.

𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐦𝐢 𝐇𝐲𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐜 𝐀𝐜𝐢𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐨𝐢𝐫 𝐌𝐨𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐳𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐤
This mask contains Hyaluronic Acid essence that enhances the skin's moisture balance and reduces fine lines, wrinkles and dark spots! I’m loving the dewiness look of my skin after using this mask. 😍 Btw, this mask is suitable for all skin type, and is esp useful for dry & dehydrated skin👍🏼
.
𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐦𝐢 𝐇𝐲𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐞𝐥 𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐤
Have you been looking high & low for a non-injection & pain-free method to achieve a V lifted face? This mask is likely what you are looking for! 😱 Formulated with a rich blend of Aloe Vera, Nicotinamide and Centella Asiatica, this mask helps gently hydrate and nourish the skin by boosting keratin & collagen production to stimulate skin cells regeneration! I like how the 3D elastic support allows the mask to fit snugly on the contour of my face, intensifying the face lifting feeling!

I've never stayed in one place for so long, but I hope we all emerged from that period as better people.

We had 5 of us at home, and there was a cat then, and here are some of the achievements we unlocked while stuck at home.

CB ACHIEVEMENT 1: BOILING WATER A GAZILION TIMES A DAY.

My family boils water to drink. We also fed our cat boiled water. We boil water for tea and coffee. We boil water to disinfect kitchen stuff. We kept running out of water, and so we boiled water again. But before you know it, there was no boiled water again.

Comment with a 💦 if you unlocked this achievement too, and why you boiled so much water at home.

Dinner was : ⁣ 
🔺Spinach, snow pear & toasted walnuts shrooms salad in a honey balsamic dressing 

🔺 A seafood medley of Mussels, scallops & salmon broiled in a white wine sauce

🔺 Couscous Tabbouleh style coz I miss it sooooooo much

Prepare sliced shallots ahead and fry them in oil till crisp. Stir fry pork together with garlic, shallots and seasoned soy sauce. Add water and bring to boil. Simmer till soft. Approx 1.5hrs.

Fans of Indonesian food will be glad to know that @ngetehdicted (home based) serves the less typical Indonesian food here such as the Bubur Bibik and Iced Milk Teh.
🔻
Bubur Bibik consist of plain congee with sambal kang kong, sambal ikan bilis, salted vegetables and salted egg.
▫️
Iced Milk Teh comes in 4 different flavours - Original, Honey, Gula Melaka & Brown Sugar
🔻
The Congee might be simple and down to earth  but it’s indeed appetizing and definitely comforting! As for the ice milk tea, they are really good! It’s rich, creamy and fragrant tea! (think Thai milk tea)
🚛
Islandwide delivery including offices/ hospital/ school
2 delivery slots daily - lunch slot between 10am to 3pm and dinner slot between 4pm to 8pm
🔻
If this interest you, feel free to contact @ngetehdicted to place your order!

⁣
In Hazel’s newest article, she writes about how not knowing everything about your partner might actually be beneficial, and not a sign of failing chemistry. It's a hard one to process, we know 😬, but there's research to back it up! 
⁣
Hazel first identifies the main overarching dating misconception: learning more about someone →  liking them more. She then breaks down the realities to debunk that line of thinking. It might sound paradoxical at first to hear, but we promise you, it makes a lot of sense when you read the whole article and then reflect on your dating life.⁣

Providing the dessert with a sweet boost was in fact the salted caramel ice cream - a tad icy but just as satisfying. Decadent and moist, South Union Park’s bake was rich without being overly cloying as it wasn’t the typical chocolatey squares - it was somewhere between cake-y and dense. At $12, the portion was not very big but packed a great punch with the thick salty sauce and bits of crunchy candied walnuts scattered around the plate.

It all started 🎬 when the Chateau Pavie '03 vintage was rated 12/20 by the famed English Critic Jancis Robinson MW.

This came when a range of critics from Robert Parker to Wine Spectator, Decanter to the respected French magazine La Revue du Vin de France all rated it highly.

Robert Parker accused her of bias against Pavie properties owned by Gérard Perse while the rest of the world suggested perhaps she got a bad bottle.
In her defence she suggested it was tasted blind to which Parker suggested even in blinds the bottle was unmissable due to its distinctive shape (look at the Pavie Decesse 👆)

It was said the two called it a truce in 2004 but having watched the rating's divide across vintage, I think what started then has continued all these years.

Chateau Pavie 2009 which was rated the perfect 100 by Robert Parker and a host of others was rated an ordinary 15.5 by Jancis Robinson.

Pavie Decesse 2010 which was rated 96 by Robert Parker, 94 by Antonio Galloni and equally highly by a range of wine critics was rated lowly 15.5 by Jancis.

Pavie Macquin 2009 similarly got the short end of the stick from Jancis and high accolades from all others.

(There was a time in our journey as a wine merchant such low scores from a famed critic made me personally nervous. We then formed our own judgment and realized our customers were willing to put their faith in us and were always open to experiment to learn for themselves rating or no rating.)

Looking at the recent blockbuster release of 2016s, looks like the divide wouldn't be ending anytime soon.

Jancis Robinson has been known to calling it as it is but I have never come across a property whose wines show such a divide.

I have personally struggled to reconcile this difference as Pavie wines are some of the best wines that St Emilion on the right bank has to offer and bottles opened blind or not, they have always vowed the crowd.

So if you are looking for storied bottles there's nothing quite like the Pavie Portfolio. And these are some of the best Bordeaux has to offer.

Bubur Bibik consist of plain congee with sambal kang kong, sambal ikan bilis, salted vegetables and salted egg.

The Congee might be simple and down to earth  but it’s indeed appetizing and definitely comforting! As for the ice milk tea, they are really good! It’s rich, creamy and fragrant tea! (think Thai milk tea)

Rest assured that these muffins can be kept in the fridge for a week or in the freezer for 3 months. They're fairly quick and easy to heat up too if you like your muffins warm. ⁣

From working long hours, to keeping up with chores or even having a packed social calendar. How can we grow in prayer when we are so caught up in the hustle and bustle of life? 

We have to realise that prayer is a gift. There is a huge disparity between us and our Heavenly Father, the all-powerful creator of the universe (Psalm 8:3). As sinners, we should have been cut off from God. Yet he has never forsaken us, but instead, allows us to seek him continuously in prayer. He feels our struggles and cares for us. 

As we continue our new sermon series on prayer this Sunday, join us online if you're curious about why or how Christians pray! 🙏 Our Sunday Service is available from Saturday to Monday on our website or YouTube channel (you can find the link on thecrossing.com.sg).

There are lots of practical activities which your child can learn and apply in their daily lives! Read Cindy’s reviews over at her page! 

Posted @withregram • @ourmindfulpod Nature play at home can be simple and beautiful. The tactile experience, the wonderful discoveries and the excitement of a possible practical life experience - all so precious for a child.
.
Some of our favourite #athomewithnature activities:
🌿 Grow sprouts from food scraps - we have planted carrot heads, scallion bulbs, leeks, and more. Submerge veg in water for a week and transplant to soil after rooting.
.
🌿 Make tiny planters with egg shells and grow beans or seeds in them.
.
🌿 Flower arrangement - I either buy them during my supermarket runs or use freshly fallen blooms picked from our nature walks.
.
🌿 Craft work with nature loose parts.
.
🌿 Flower press - place plant between two sheets of paper and press with stacks of books. Uncover a week later.
.
🌿 Observations of veg/fruits/fallen flowers - you’ll be so surprised with what your child discovers.

May be an image of text that says 'Rumi Be a witness, not a judge.""'.","We interact and learn through our senses. They are the inputs for our experience. If we can pay attention to how we see, hear, taste, smell, touch, we are bringing in conscious awareness in the things we do; we are in the moment, or the present🍃

When we are in the present, we are simply observing and reflecting, not judging anything. It is through this process, we start to get to know ourselves better. 

Knowing yourself means understanding your strengths and weaknesses, your passions and fears, your desires and dreams. It means being aware of your eccentricities and idiosyncrasies, your likes and dislikes, and your tolerances and limitations.

Do you know yourself? 💜

Fried chicken (think ayam penyet) was still crispy and so tender! Loved the green chillis, they were real soft & spicy, giving the chicken that tangy twist. Basmati rice was a good option, very light and fluffy compared to the ‘heavier’ usual chicken rice. Overall the green chilli, chicken & basmati rice came together so nicely, really enjoyed this meal! The red chilli sauce at the side actually felt extra, didn’t need it at all. Can’t wait to eat there so I get the keropok too!

🔺 Sage Brown Butter Cauliflower - such an easy dish! 

Put a dollop (25 grams) of butter in a heated pan until it’s fragrant and foamy. Add in some fresh sage and slices of garlic. Let it cook for a bit and then pour it over the cauliflower. Sprinkled some cracked pepper over and bake for 20 mins at 180 degrees. 

The results is an nutty buttery coat on a sweet crunchy cauliflower. Oh yummmssss ...

But we have the power to take what we learn and change tomorrow. The only difference is, even if everything is temporary, we still have the ability to impact this temporarily magnificent world. The only difference is we, as people, can still live forever; as memories, lessons and smudges in the back of other people’s best experience, as lovers, as carers, as friends.

I tell you, it's in the HISTORY! 

20years ago, when you were just starting out in life 

12years ago during the last financial crisis 

Even years ago when your child was just born, when times were the toughest for a new parent on a TOTAL new journey 

So, are you going to wait another 10years? To say oh gosh, back then was the best time. 

Dm me. Let's have a look where you are right now on your financial journey.

My 3菜 became a one pot dish all done in less than 30mins! My mum always cook this 咸饭 or giam berng but I am not a fan of pork belly and mushroom. I also don't like to mix all my ingredients into my rice so I seldom make this. I added only chicken and lap cheong but it tasted just as good! The main key is to put in less water to prevent soggy rice as the chicken and cabbage releases water when cooked. See IG video for the steps :) ===============================================
INGREDIENTS:
• 2 drumsticks, skinned and cut into smaller pieces
• 1 lapcheong, cut into slices 
• 2 dried oyster
• A handful of dried shrimps, soaked
• A few leaves of cabbage, thickly sliced 
• 2 tbsp oyster sauce
• 1 tbsp sesame oil
• 1 tbsp fish sauce
• 2 tbsp huadiao wine 
• 1 tap cornflour

METHOD:
1) Fry the dried shrimps and lapcheong till fragrant. 
2) Push aside. Add in the cabbage and fry over high heat. 
3) Add in the chicken (pre marinated with all condiments) and fry till both sides are slightly browned. 
4) Add in rice and mix well. 
5) Add some dark soy sauce to achieve the colour you prefer.
6) Cook in rice cooker as you will cook your white rice. Serve hot.

I haven’t gotten used to this new normal — wearing face masks 😷 Somehow, I always end up running back home just cause I left the house without wearing one 😅 Although wearing face masks is such a hassle, I have to say kudos to ShieldMask+ for making them so much more bearable!

ShieldMask+ face masks have 4 layers of protection with a water repellent outer layer and an ultra soft antibacterial bamboo fabric inner layer that makes the masks breathable and comfortable (good thing is that I don’t feel like I’m suffocating wearing it!) 😆 In between these 2 layers, there are double filter layers for increased protection! Another feature that I absolutely love is their adjustable ear straps that are stretchy, allowing the mask to fit nicely on my face 😍 

Btw, ShieldMask+ is designed and made in Singapore so #supportlocalsg yeah! And they have just launched their SG55 exclusive designs! Swipe left to see the 3 designs 🔚 Wanna get one for yourself?

Perhaps a little of an overdose with the Hōjicha Ganache, Hōjicha Chantilly, Hōjicha Soufflé Chiffon and loose Hōjicha Tea Specks for embellishment; the different textures and taste still came together wonderfully - just look at the beautiful and distinct cross-section of the cake. The combination of the smooth, chilled, almost airy chantilly cream and the moist, fluffy sponge balanced by the intensity of the earthy ganache. I also enjoyed the fact that I found no one element outshining another. It wasn’t too sweet and in all, left a well-rounded toasty flavour. 

Thus, while Nesuto Patisserie remains closed for dine-in and walk-in, order online (www.nesuto.oddle.me) and do take advantage of their free delivery service with any purchase of their whole cake!

My family has always only made our Tim at home with pork (belly and front hock) and Assam Keping (shaved Assam fruit), however this dish has roots in Peranakan cuisine as well - theirs being a little more complex in terms of ingredients with the inclusion of duck, sour plums, tomatoes (in some cases) and a swig of brandy.
.
.
We’ve had Itek Tim at many a Peranakan restaurant, and while we love that rendition of the dish, it has always bugged me that the duck (after boiling away) ends up rather lifeless and grey leaving much to be desired. I decided to try experimenting with pulling the duck pieces out of the soup once they’re just tender, salting them generously and roasting them for good measure. Once they were nicely browned, I dropped them back in the soup for a quick simmer. Doing so gave the soup an added depth of flavour along with a deeper/richer colour.
.
.
I served this soup alongside the fried prawns with chili and salt from the previous post - a match made in heaven 🤤

This dish is part of a #dimsum spread and I have only seen this in medan (cant even find this in HK or SG). It's a deep fried prawn cake coated with a layer of special mayonnaise. When I was young, I only cared to get my fix of this Leng Hong Kien (and of course Chee Cheong Fun) if my parents brought me to the dimsum shop, and that weekend will be filled with awesomeness.
.
Thanks to this I also attempted to make my own mayonnaise and was only successful on the second attempt. I was glad that the taste turned out to be really really close to a famous dimsum  restaurant in medan (Dimsum Ayong Babura), close but not yet as perfect as theirs.

.
The Saint Emilion property of Troplong Mondot would have got the elevation to Premier Grand Cru Classe much sooner than 2006.
.
However that didn't stop the late Christine Valette and her husband Xavier Pariente from producing wines that matched the stature of other Premier Grand Cru Classes properties all those years until they achieved the formal elevation. Their 1989 is still considered one of the best bottles.

Originally part of a bigger domain that included the vineyards of famed Chateau Pavie, Troplong Mondot became independent in 1850 and acquired the present name. While the estate had been around for almost 200+yrs, it wasn't until the 1980s that the estate really got its rhythm and harmony when Christine and her husband Xavier undertook massive renovations of cellars and vineyards.
.
After all these years it still has the same 33 hectares (25 under vineyards) that it has had since 1930s.
.
The soils are rich in limestone clay and are planted primarily with Merlot with a bit of Cabernet Sauvignon and Franc. The grapes are hand-harvested and then fermented in temperature-controlled, stainless steel tanks. The wine is then aged in oak barriques (75% new) for 18 months. It is bottled unfiltered.
.
(Wine writers and critics also associate a fair bit of success of the property to the Michel Rolland, the famed Bordeaux consultant.)

The estate was sold to French insurer Scor in 2017.

While 2000 was a blockbuster vintage, as Robert Parker put it, 2001 wasn't v far behind.
.
And at almost half the price, this is a great aged, mature Claret for monumental drinking pleasure. $175 a bottle. For 6, $165/- a btl in OWC (only 1 OWC).

At $28.80, you will get the pot set, utensil set, condiments set, selected soup base, apron, toothbrush set, rubber band to tie hair, ziplock bag to put handphone, customised note and food nicely packed into containers for 1-2 pax. Although they put individual set meal but i think it’s quite a lot for me.
.
There will be an additional $15 delivery charge so try to order it with your friends or self collect for free!

The only bad thing about the pot is that the plug hole is located at the side and when you want to wash the pot, you need to make sure water doesn’t go in. Although the pot is reusable but it is quite a hassle when it comes to washing.

Stuffed Bitter Gourd (Sweet n sour) 
Hahaha ... you see, its a delicious mix of sweet sour and bitter, that will leave you craving for more 😋🤪
Dreaded a karela meal as a kid, but they are a fav now. No interesting  story there, just happened over a period of time ☺️☺️ Lets get straight to the recipe now.

Karela Prep:
5-6 pcs karela (bitter gourd)
There is no need to peel the karelas, but please do so if like it better that way. Give it a slit, top to bottom, on one side, and scoop out the seeds. Take a tsp of oil and half a tsp of salt in your hand and rub over the karelas. Cook in the air-fryer on 200° for 15-20 min. Now stuff them with the filling. Keep aside.

Filling:
Mix together --- 
Boiled mashed potato - 3-4
Garlic, minced - 1tsp
Salt
Chilli pwd- 1 tsp
Dhania pwd (Coriander) - 1tsp
Bhuna jeera pwd (roasted cumin) - 1 tsp
Chaat masala - 1tsp
Ajwain (carom) - 1/2 tsp
Chopped green chilli (optional)

Optional Step:
In a pan fry 1 big onion (sliced) in a tbsp of oil. Add some salt and haldi (turmeric) Dont over cook. Let the crunch remain. Put in the serving dish.

In the same pan, cook the karelas for 2-3 mi, turning sides. Now, move the karelas to the side, put a tsp of oil, just enough to make a tsp of jeera (cumin) crackle in it. Add some haldi (turmeric pwd) and 4 tbsp of sonth aka imli ki chutney (tamrind chutney made with jaggery) Rotate the pan a little for the chutney to coat the karela. Cook on very low heat till the liquid dries up and karelas are well coated. Put the karelas over the fried onions in the dish. Garnish with fresh coriander and lemon..

👉🏻Yup, Kawasan ini biasanya menjadi tempat tongkrongan anak muda, karena berjejer pub dan cafe! Clarke Quay merupakan sebuah kawasan hip & instagenic di Singapura❤️😍
.
😁 Kamu juga bisa lho duduk duduk saja di pinggiran sungai, di sebuah jembatan menuju Clarke quay, atau di sekitar air mancur. Banyak yang menjual minuman di 7-Eleven tak jauh dari jembatan dan kamu bisa bersantai di tepi sungai menikmati langit sore bersama kawan! ✌🏻😋

- Oily cooker hoods and hobs
- Aircon filters
- Steam sanitising your beds and sofa
- Sanitise & clean your entire toilet!
- Sanitise children bed/toys
- Clean carpets (esp those with pets at home!)
- Clean stubborn stains in oven, toasters, pots and pans!
- Anyone has a BBQ grill to clean too? This can do it too!

These fulfilling 5 months in Ellure Sg consists of happiness, hard work and sweat.It is one ☝️ of the most important milestone in my microbusiness journey.

It is quite a worrying and gloomy situation when COVID 19 and #circuitbreakersg hit us, affecting our main business.But I can vouched that my microbusiness is not affected at all! 
Distributors joined #teamfayec during this period and we are getting consistent flow of customers and steady sales figure.We even restocked every month consistently as our ELLURE TOMATO 🍅 BUBBLE MASK demand is extremely high and highly raved.Extra consistent 4 digit sales income definitely helped our team’s distributors to tide over this difficult period.

I’m definitely confident that it will continue to be highly raved and we will achieve greater heights through intensive training programs provided by ELLURE SG.Definitely not a hot and run business.Hold your hand and aim for success together! Are you ready? 😍

The tactile experience, the wonderful discoveries and the excitement of a possible practical life experience - all so precious for a child.
.
Some of our favourite #athomewithnature activities:
🌿 Grow sprouts from food scraps - we have planted carrot heads, scallion bulbs, leeks, and more. Submerge veg in water for a week and transplant to soil after rooting.
.
🌿 Make tiny planters with egg shells and grow beans or seeds in them.
.
🌿 Flower arrangement - I either buy them during my supermarket runs or use freshly fallen blooms picked from our nature walks.
.
🌿 Craft work with nature loose parts.
.
🌿 Flower press - place plant between two sheets of paper and press with stacks of books. Uncover a week later.
.
🌿 Observations of veg/fruits/fallen flowers - you’ll be so surprised with what your child discovers.

It’s often the simplest marriage of ingredients that make for the best soul food. A good example of this would be fried prawns with chili and salt. This was something my Nan (grandmother) and later my Dad would make alongside a sour mango soup.
.
.
You start off with fresh prawns that are deveined and stuffed with a simple blend of (yes, literally) red chilies and salt. The sweetness of the fresh prawns is complimented perfectly by the salty bite of the chili blend. I tend to overstuff the prawns so that some of the excess chili spills into the hot oil and gets a little charred and crispy - makes for an awesome topping. I felt it needed some green, so I decided to garnish it with some lime leaves (best decision ever).

Here we are at the beautiful ""I am"" cafe hopping!

This place serves a huge range of western food a big range of desserts.

We ordered an ice caramel macchiato($6.50), americano($5) and skillet cookie with an ice cream topping($13.90).

We think that the coffees could be stronger but we liked the dessert. The iced caramel macchiato is slightly watered down. 

The cookie is perfect and freshly made on the spot (15 mins wait). But the marshmallow should be charred a little longer and more melty. Ice cream was average.

My favourite in this dish is not the prawn but the well caramelised onion 🤭 Goes really well with a plate of white rice! See IG video for the steps :) ===============================================
INGREDIENTS:
• 6 prawns
• 1 onion, cut into thin slices
• A few sliced of ginger 
• 2 tbsp oyster sauce
• 1 tbsp sesame oil
• 1 tsp sugar
• 1 tsp soy sauce
• 4 tbsp ketchup 
• 1 tomato, cut into wedges

METHOD:
1) Fry the ginger and onion till caramelised and fragrant. 
2) Push aside. Add in the prawns and fry over high heat. Remove when it's about 50% cooked. 
3) Add in the tomato and fry for a minute. Add in all sauce. 
4) Mix well and let it simmer for another minute.
5) Add in the prawns and cover. Let it cook for another 30s or till cooked. Serve hot. ============================================================ #prawns #harlok #friedprawns #30minutemeals #30minutesrecipe #simple #sgig #sgrecipes #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodstep #instagfoodsg #singaporehomecooks #homecookedmeals #whati8today #instagfoodsg #家常便饭 #sgfoodlover #onepotmeal #comfortfoods #circuitbreakersg",,27,0

视今早的天气才决定 出门往Jurong Lake Gardens 
和住附近的友人一起晨运去
幸好天空作美 但也一早就晒到不要不要的……
目前不少设施和建设还在关闭中
也许要等Circuit Breaker 完全解放后才能开放～
不过公园很大 这些设施沒开也不受影响
有机会访西部的朋友
不妨起个早  在湖前静看日出🌅.

Having happy memories is important because sometimes this is exactly what you needed to get through rough days. Today I decided to stay at home and have a lazy Sunday with my favourite activities. My friend commented it seems a busy Sunday instead of lazy Sunday with so many activities. Lol not sure if I can get to do all of them but I think carrying out these activities leisurely at my own pace is my kind of lazy Sunday. The nice weather now is a blessing too! Looking forward to rejuvenating myself for another busy week ahead! Wishing you a lazy Sunday too!🤓🤓🤓

Making a ""hum"" sound when you exhale smoothly and evenly creates an internal vibration within your body, which gently massages your brain from inside out💆‍♀️ , soothes your nerves, and relieves tension, stress, anger, and anxiety. 

By drawing focus to the sound🎵 and vibration⚡, humming bee breath can instantly calm your mind, help relieve migraine, strengthen your memory, and improve sleep quality😴!

May be an image of 1 person.","It has been 5 months since the last hike. Luckily my stamina is still good to complete the whole trail with the steep stairs. Thanks to my ultimate duo (Yspan & R2) which makes me feel good inside out.

Targeting on Gene's expression, Yspan helps to revitalize our aging defense mechanism, promote our Youth span so that we can live more youthful years and enjoy life being more active, energetic & healthy. R2 is designed to purify & restore our cells during sleep & restore youth vitality and optimise energy production.

For a tree to gain its strength and grow robustly & healthy, it needs soil, sunlight, fertilizers, air & water. So Yspan is like sunlight & water and R2 is like fertilizers which helps our body to be robust & healthy.

As I aged, I want to age healthily and youthfully. Just like one of the leader in KL, she is now 76 years old and she looks even younger and better as compared to when she is in her 50s.

So how are you keeping healthy and youthfully?

.

Kids must have forgotten how to behave when we are in a mall, fighting over the stroller and the youngest running off from us towards the escalator. Hubby had to literally sprint after him! 
.

I made the boys stop and gave a 10 minute briefing/lecture/nag on this. Mid-way through, I took out my mask for so that my words won’t be so muffled too. We usually have briefings like these especially when we travel, because it is challenging to be able to keep our eyes on all 3 kids at one go while trying to navigate our travel itinerary. The last thing we want is to lose a child in the mall!
.

Anyway, we got the stuff we needed, had a good lunch and we were out within the hour. For those who drive, a perk of going to town this month is that there are no ERP charges! Yay! 😆",The Centrepoint,16,9

Staying home during CB with two kids had its challenges, but I'll always remember that time as the most ""present"" and ""guiltless"" I've ever felt with the children.

Dino Dig 🦖 🦴

Came across this activity by @2little_lims and really wanted to give it a try! Joseph dived straight into his Dino world, but little did he know there was a fossil world underneath waiting for him to discover 🤗
•
This little archeologist chucked the brush aside immediately and used his hands instead.. plan failed 🤦🏻‍♂️ That serious look when he pieced the bone puzzles together was a joy to watch. In 30 mins, the puzzle was complete.. and the cocoa flavored moon dough was all over him 🤦🏻‍♂️ Messy but that’s the way we like it 😀
•
So the prep work started with sculpturing the bones using Salt Dough. Mix 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of salt with 1 cup of water. This should give you enough dough for two sets of bones. Instead of using sand or soil, I decided to make some ‘earth’ out of Moon Dough by mixing 4 cup of flour with a cup of baby oil. It’s that simple.

.
👉🏻Bangunan mirip bunga Lotus ini merupakan Museum yang menggabungkan Seni dan Ilmu Pengetahuan menjadi tempat pameran super keren! Pamerannya pun berganti ganti, ada juga yang permanen. Salah satunya adalah Future World Exhibition, yang dibagi 4 section: Nature, Town, Park, Space.
.
👶🏻 Selain itu tempat ini cocok untuk wisata keluarga dengan anak-anak & Instagrammable! 😍✌🏻
.
Hacks: 
✅ Coba kamu bikin member card marina bay sands dulu (gratis dan nggak lama), bikinnya di concierge yang ada di dekat Food Court Marina Bay Sands, persis di bawah eskalatornya. Nah, kalau kamu pakai member card, bakalan dapat buy 1 get 1 tiket ArtScience Museum. Lebih murah kan?
.
✅ Kalau mau datang di hari libur atau weekend sebaiknya mulai dari jam buka museum yaitu jam 10 pagi, supaya ngga terlalu crowded! 🙌🏻🤪
.
📍How to get there: 
.
🚇 MRT : Kamu bisa naik MRT dan turun di Bayfront Station (Circle Line) kemudian dilanjutkan dengan berjalan kaki 10 menit untuk sampai di Museum atau bisa juga di Promenade Station dan Marina Bay Station.
.
🚇 Bus : Naik bus 133 dari bugis street dan turun di Marina bay sand ✌🏻

I think it was fated that we had steak for dinner. The marketplace at Paragon reduced their OP Ribeye prices by half, prompting us to make a quick purchase of two great pieces of meat instead of the one we had originally planned for (because why not right?!).
•
•
As it turned out, we only needed one of the ribs to feed our dinner party. @patricoantonio made a spiced pumpkin purée to go along with the beef, and paired the red meat with roasted Brussels sprouts and mushrooms. Za, Nura, Paul, Patrick, his mom and myself made quick work of the hearty meal. 
•

Looking at these photos is making me salivate. Taking inspiration from Paul’s repeated requests - when are we having steak made by Patrick again?

Went to Joe and Dough Cafe for brunch and it brought back memories of my coffee time with colleagues after lunch, especially sharing of the cakes! Also had an enjoyable time completing my read on Winnie The Pooh classic stories in the cafe. However, I’m disappointed that I can’t find the famous nice quotes in this book. Do those quotes appear in the series? Mmm... Anyway, it’s a sweet, funny and heartwarming read. The nice thing about wearing mask is that I can laugh out loud discreetly behind my mask in the cafe! 🤣 Then I bought more baking ingredients! Gonna try new recipes again after my yummy teabreak. Old Chang Kee curry puff is still the best! I hope I have time to paint too! Enjoy your Wonderful Saturday! 🌈🌈🌈

When people starts deflecting, I begin to reflect. 
Talk is cheap but the words hold immense power.  
 
Not exploring who's right and who's wrong.  
Instead, let’s eat some kuehs and appreciate being alive again today. We can only change what is within our power and we can start by treating ourself right.

So, after trying the one in my previous post, i tried another in the neighbourhood. 
This version was very good too! Disclaimer, it cost $1 more but it had crabsticks and tofu skin strips which I love. It seems to have less of the sweet potato or potato chewy translucent noodles though. Still good yo the point where the soup was very addictive!

I added spring onion into the pasta just because I feel like eating it! 😁
We couldn't pinpoint what the whole dish tasted like but it's something different and refreshing. Despite adding bacon, the dish still tastes pretty light. Can try it for a quick fix on weekday! 
Steps in IG Video!! ⬆️⬆️ ============================================================
INGREDIENTS:
• 4 slices of bacon, cut finely
• sliced garlic
• 6 prawns
• 8 cherry tomatoes, cut into halves
• 10g butter
• 2 chili padi and 
• 1 anchovy
• Spring onion, chopped finely

METHOD:
1) Cook pasta till Al Dante and leave aside. Leave some liquid used to cook the pasta aside. 
2) Fry the bacon in some olive oil till crispy. Leave aside. 
3) In the same pan, pan fry the prawn head till fragrant. 
4) Add in the sliced garlic and prawn and pan fry till both sides are browned. Remove prawn. 
5) Add chili padi and tomato and fry till fragrant. Add in the butter and mix well. 
6)Add in the pasta and mix well. Add in the spring onion and fry for another 30s. Season with some salt and pepper. 
7) Dish out and serve hot.

⁣
There’s a running joke that on first dates, we should hide who we are and get that relationship in the bag before the hard opinions are revealed. But this is the complete opposite of the Kopi Date Ethos 😎 ⁣
⁣
Putting a good foot forward and being mindful of yourself are pretty important during a first date; Most of us are definitely a little shallow sometimes (guilty) and as long as we’re aware of that, it should be fine! ⁣
⁣
𝘏𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳, first impressions aren't all there is to a first date -- another big part is quality of chats! Don’t listen too hard to old school dating advice on shying away from hard topics or opinions 🌱We encourage you to challenge yourself and your date! 𝘛𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘴 and throw out some debatable opinions. ⁣
⁣
The dating experience is for you to shape and mould. Approach it however you want, and if that means bringing up more serious topics, then so be it! Whatever you think is best to find someone you can click with 👏🏽",Singapore,34,3

I have known this seller for many years and three years ago I found this 3 bedroom unit for them and bought through me. 
But due to changes of their 3 kids education, they need to move near to the city. So, they approached me to sell their unit just when the circuit breaker starts.
And I’m Glad I managed to seal the deal at the highest price within the development for them on Tues and buyer exercised OTP within 2 days! 
Looking forward to assist them for their next home hunting 🤗

This dish has a few names; Mee Serani/Eurasian Noodes or Birthday Noodles as it’s more affectionately known - think of this as a Eurasian rendition of “longevity noodles” which most cultures have their own version of.
.
.
There are many interpretations of this dish from family to family, however like most, the Chan/Scully iteration is made with yellow or egg noodles, simmered in a broth of roughly diced taucheo beans, garlic, soup leaf (Chye Sim), white pepper and pork stock/water. It’s garnished with an assortment of toppings such as sliced cucumber, red chili, fried lap cheong, fried fish cake and shredded omelette. Don’t ask me if they symbolize anything specifically, to me they just taste great together 😂 .
.
.
The taucheo broth which may seem pretty salty on it’s own is perfectly balanced by the toppings once they’ve had a chance to sit in and meld with the broth a little.

Woke up one day during #circuitbreakersg and I had cravings for burger! 🍔 Why not make my own! 

Level of difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐ 
(probably cos it makes your kitchen really oily)

----

Ingredients for 4: 
. 500g of minced beef from @thebutchersg @redmartcom
. 1 tsp garlic powder
. 1 tsp onion powder 
. 1 tsp @liloikanbilis mushroom powder
. 4 @arla.sg Edam cheese slices, i like my cheese light, if you prefer sharper ones, use cheddar 
. 4 brioche hamburger buns
. Butter, for toasting the buns
. Optional: lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sauces, etc 

(1) Massage the powders into the minced beef and portion it into 4. Roll them into a ball, and gently shape them into a flat 1.5cm circle. (not too thick, unless you like medium rare burger patty. Since it's #kidsfriendly, it will have to be well done) 
(2) Heat up pan with oil, not too much because the beef has lotsa fats. See the sizzle and splatter, and flip over once one side is browned. 
(3) take patty off the pan and put a slice of cheese on it. Let the heat transfer to melt that cheese. 
(4) cut the buns into half and butter the inner sides. Place on low heat pan for a short toast. 
(5) Stack the ingredients together. 

I served with broccolini on sides and air fried lightly salted purple sweet potato fries. Finally one more day to the weekend!!

What I like about @pocolocosg is that it serves affordable Italian cuisine and it’s portion is reasonably big! Now, that we are allowed to dined in again, I’ll definitely make my long awaited trip back for their meal!
🔻
The most noticeable items on the menu are definitely the pastas and something that caught my attention was the “Grandchio!” 

This is essentially Pasta with crabmeat in Pink sauce! The sauce is tasty, creamy with chunks of crab meat in it! Besides that, I’ve tried the calamari and it also hits all the right spot for me! Would definitely love o visit this restaurant again and I would like to recommend @foodiegoh and @emily.eatingthyme to try their food too!

Smartypence Tip 💡 for Managers & Message Bearers:
🙏 Be honest, humble & empathetic (not sympathetic) to preserve the dignity of the affected workforce – it could have been you & it is definitely your colleague/friend.
🙏 Spend the time with them to explain the situation, decision process for the axe & discuss options for what’s next
🙏 Offer to write referral letters or be at their disposal for any further questions
🙏 If its possible for your industry, treat them with respect & not like work criminals by disabling their access to company property asap & walking them out.

💪For those who ‘survived’ - be nice, work harder to pick up the extra load to transition your colleagues out tactfully & be thankful you still have a job. Reduce your expenses to the maximum, save and be prepared for the next swinging axe.

Enjoy it to the utmost - but let it go without regret.🌻 This quote pretty sums up my daily process of food art and chocolate paintings. Enjoying them to the fullest and letting them go without regret. ❤️ Today, I’m eating two round Japanese pastries- Matcha Swiss roll and Dorayaki! I decided to recreate them as shells of a cute snail 🐌 and a cute tortoise 🐢. They are competing to win the “1st Tortoise VS Snail Crawlathon 2020”. Both are equally (slow), yet full of determination and perseverance to win the race. I hope this foodart motivates those who are having a rough time now. 💪💪💪 Cheers as we inch towards Friday! 🥰 Btw, my dear friend kindly analysed the winning probability and it seems that the Tortoise will win the race! 🐢🐢🐢🥳🤪🤩

So if you do choose to sleep in a bra, it is highly suggested that it is something without an underwire, made of a very soft and stretchy material. 
Your bra should not be as snug at night as it is in the daytime.
It should be much more flexible.

If you are a fan of Indonesian snacks, then you have to try these! Indonesia fried meatballs.. these are not your typical meatballs, instead it is filled with prawns and pork and is larger in size! It’s really a mouthful! Do check out their other snacks like the Ebi potato chips and Kering tempeh which is best when paired with rice or if you prefer, you can have it on its own!

Good even after the 90-minutes of travel home. Rich and comforting, the sandwich might not look like much but was surprisingly filling - loaded with roasted cremini, shiitake, arugula, cheddar, chezz americain, housemade Korio sauce, and caramelised onions. The sourdough was nicely toasted with the right amount of crustiness and a pleasant hint of tangy. Match made in heaven, the earthy-sweet mix of the sliced mushrooms and onions with sharp, bitter greens were also superb and helped to cut the heaviness of the savoury (gooey, after a quick pop into the toaster) melted cheese. Hence, like what the others suggested, I would recommend sharing this with a friend as it may get cloying at the end.

Ordered this on Grab from a ‘fake’ Putien called Putian Xinghua Delicacies for $6.20 (+ delivery was just $4) and I liked it! Thin beehoon that was not too dry/wet even after dabao. Flavourful, though no wokhei but that’s fine. Glad to have this cheaper alternative to the restaurant one. Only gripe - small portion is really small, like half that dabao box; would order the medium next time round. Also ordered their oyster omelette but it is not worthy of a mention or photo because it barely had any oysters & was basically just like an omelette (on the salty side) full stop.

今天有蛋糕吃！超开心🥳
由其是老爷 从昨晚至早上 一直问几时可以吃？😂
非常感谢 三隻猫的男主人 
昨天傍晚在车站交给我这两份蛋糕 太有心了❣️
他说迷彩戚风蛋糕是抹茶、巧克力和原味的混合
千层蛋糕 走比较健康路线 少蛋少牛油 Lapis的香料也用比较少 也许味道会不夠～ 
可那个对蛋糕有要求的老爷 大賛Lapis 👍 
味道恰好也不会太油腻 我们喜欢😘👏👏
迷彩戚风蛋糕  这组合的颜色不但好看 
加上三种不同的口味 有趣也好味😋 我也想试做呢～
再次谢谢友人亲手做的蛋糕🍰 太有爱心了🥰
.
前天烤的黑裸麦面包
培养的混合Sourdough starter 还剩一半
下午烤Dutch Oven Bread
这次加了干果的walnuts & cranberries 
增添了nutty+fruity 提升口感 👍
傍晚下雨 晩餐煮了锅热呼呼的日式咖喱
搭配黑裸麥面包一起享用～好賛哦！😋
在这非常時期 庆幸花了時間自学 如何烘焙面包
虽然只会烘焙几样 但对我来说已是很大的收穫
.
㊗️大家 周三 工作/WFH 愉快. Stay Safe 💪🏻

🌟Tempat apa sih itu min? Ini adalah arena judi terbesar di Singapore. Untuk masuk kesini, kamu nggak perlu bayar lho, alias GRATIS! Tapi, kamu harus diatas 21 tahun dan menunjukan passport. Malah untuk warga SG sendiri harus memiliki entry levy jika ingin masuk seharga S$150. Sebenarnya ini usaha pemerintah SG agar warganya nggak kecanduan berjudi✌🏻😬
.
✅Yang penasaran ada apa didalamnya, disana ada beberapa restoran dan mesin mesin casino. Sayangnya, kita dilarang keras untuk mengambil foto di dalam sana. Untuk masuknya, tentu kamu harus memperhatikan pakaian mu dan menitipkan barang-barang besar yang kamu bawa di tempat penitipan🙌🏻
.
🎰Di dalam casino ini, yang paling laku adalah Roulette dan mesin Slot. Mesin Slot cukup populer untuk yang pertama kali mencoba peruntungan. Untuk bermain mesin Slot cukup membutuhkan $S10 dengan taruhan minimal S$1😜✌🏻

📍Address: 8 Sentosa Gateway

✅ Kamu tertarik? Kali aja dapet jackpot! Hati hati ya ketagihan hihi..👀

So the colour of the cake reminds me of Winnie The Pooh and I decide to recreate the scene of Pooh sitting on the log with Piglet. Pooh, Piglet and the log are made of castella cake. So Pooh was telling Piglet “Today was a difficult day.” Piglet consoled him that “Difficult days are so much easier when you know you’ve got someone there for you. And I’ll always be here for you, Pooh.” Well, I hope nobody is having a difficult day today but if unfortunately, you are having one, do remember it shall pass soon and tomorrow is another day. I also came across many uplifting quotes from Pooh while researching on today’s foodart. So much so that I just borrowed the ebook on Winnie the Pooh from library! 🤩 Happy midweek! ❤️❤️❤️

Malabar Mosque, known as the Golden Dome Mosque is situated at the corner between Victoria Street and Jalan Sultan.
This is the only Mosque in Singapore which is fully managed by the Malabar Muslim Community.This is the place where all our Malabar Muslims gather during Friday, Aidil Fitri, Aidil Adha or any other major functions. The new outlook of the mosque also attracts people from all corners.                                                                  
Building this mosque started in the late 50s by the Malabari Community who were headed by the Malabar Muslim Jama-ath (Association that leading all the activities organised in the mosque). Malabar Muslim Jama-ath was established in 1927 and was registered in 1929 and functioned from a shop house at Changi Road. The Malabar Muslim Jama-ath’s office shifted to Bussorah Street and finally established at 471, Victoria Street where it is today.
After some period the Malabar Muslim Jama-ath with the help of the Malabar Muslims had a plan to build a mosque at Victoria Street. With this plan in mind, a stone laying ceremony was held on 10th April 1956 by the Mufti of Johor, Tuan Syed Alwi Adnan who had represented the Sultan Ibrahim bin Abu Bakar of Johor.

Ingredients:
1.	1 tbsp garlic
2.	½ tsp coriander seeds
3.	½ tsp oregano (Optional)
4.	1 large chopped onion
5.	Approximately 225g of Portobello mushrooms (or button mushrooms)  thinly sliced or diced
6.	7 eggs
7.	1 tbsp olive oil (Or any cooking oil)
8.	1 medium capsicum
9.	10 cherry tomatoes
10.	1 packet of floured tortillas (normally comes in a bag of 5-8 pcs)
11.	250g streaky bacon
12.	75g to 100g of cheddar and mozerella mix (or any cheese you like)
13.	Salt and pepper

In a medium bowl, whisk eggs with salt and pepper. Set mixture aside.

Place bacon on a skillet and cook it over low heat. Flip bacon when it starts to curl. Remove bacon when it starts to brown. Put bacon aside to cool and then chop it up. 

In medium heat, using leftover bacon fat, brown garlic. After which, add in onion, oregano and coriander seeds and stir fry for half a minute. Add in portobello mushrooms, capsicum and cherry tomatoes and let it cook. Remove from pan and set dish aside.

In the same skillet, add in olive oil then add in egg mixture and scramble it till cooked. After egg is cooked stir in dish that was previously set aside. Add in bacon.

Place tortilla sheet on a clean plate and scoop in ½ to 1 tbsp cheese then stir-fried vegetables and roll up in a roll. We rolled them up first then place roll back into the skillet burrito end first to seal roll tight. We’re toasting the skin slightly here.

Granted, not many times you are able to utter the words ‘Ooo Mommy’ after a meal, but after having a bite @ooomahmee ! The words came out naturally from my mouth! Yes! Folks, this is legit!
🔻
@ooomahmee which is a word play from the Japanese word umami, describes their signature item which is the result of mixing Truffle Oil, Capellini, Tobiko, Hotate and Ikura!
🔻
What I like is the simplicity of this dish! No fancy preparation, no overload of ingredients, just a bowl of perfectly tossed capellini where every strand is flavored with truffle. Add a side of Uni or prawn, and you’ll get the perfect dish! The seafood are fresh and are packed with ice pack so you can be assured of freshness! I mean it’s Fresh, clean and delicious, what more can you ask for?

They serve really affordable brunch without service charge (wow! Which means you get to order more with the same price)

Salted Egg Prawn Pasta ($18): a super creamy pasta with a tang of spiciness; just the way i like it! The pasta was al dente and was served with fresh prawns. 
.
French Toast ($15): Fluffy bread that was warm and soft! Served with a generous portion of fruits, espresso crumble and a scoop of espresso butter. Just got to say that their espresso crumble is so good! Tastes like the bitter version of oreo
.
Parmesan Truffle fries ($10): The truffle taste was strong although the portion of parmesan cheese was not too generous. The texture of the fries was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 
.
Cappucino ($5): Love the coffee beans they used and the coffee was not too acidic nor bitter.
.
Matcha Latte ($5.50): Nothing too special about this as the matcha taste wasn’t strong.

🌟Bentuknya menyerupai tongkang (perahu ringan yang digunakan untuk mengirim barang di sepanjang sungai di masa awal Singapura). FYI, Singapore River dulunya adalah tempat para pengusaha berkumpul untuk berdagang. Jembatan ini dinamai dari keluarga Arab terkemuka – Alkaff yang termasuk orang terkaya di Singapura pada awal abad ke-20😁

All I want is a well-rested night. Today is one of the days where I’m so sleepy coz I didn’t sleep well. 😴Maybe I’m still recovering from the 3.50am late night on last Friday. 🥱Maybe it’s the rainy weather today. 🥱 Maybe it’s the never-ending scheduling and re-scheduling of meetings. 🥱Maybe it’s just Monday blues after a long weekend. 🥱Feeling so lethargic that even the warm cozy Kagoshima imported instant ramen with hard boiled egg, crab sticks, seaweed and dumplings doesn’t help. 😅 So now, all I’m hoping for is a nice sleep tonight and a more productive day tomorrow. 💪💪💪 Btw, the ramen taste great though I prefer a more flavourful soup broth. 😋😋😋

Instead, messed up the most vital part of the recipe that resulted in an unsalvageable dough (in my opinion) but didn’t wanna waste the ingredients. The dough kept breaking and i was pretty worried.

It's not uncommon to hold tension, trauma, negativity within your body unconsciously - this is called 'Holding'. This is what makes actions effortful, your body feel heavy, and your mind feel trapped. To begin to release from holding, first explore the concept of 'Yield' - letting go, to find the balance between effort and ease. ⠀
⠀
This is one of my favourite sequences to practice when I notice holding inside my body / mind. Within this sequence, by staying close to the earth, it allows you to connect with the draw of gravity, concept with Newton's third law (Action Reaction) and meditate on the concept of Yield. As you're moving through the flow, notice any areas of unnecessary effort, and using your exhales, release and yield to the draw of the earth. Hope you enjoy :)",,16,1

初次烤Dark Rye Bread  算是成功了 
入口干香 口感扎实 带着微微的酸味儿 
加了白芝麻粒 越咬越香～ 😋 
向来对Rye Bread 有偏见的老爷 吃了一片 👍 
有點开心 終於做到了 💪🏻
黑裸麥面包 我这一区的面包店 沒有卖呀～🤣
.
PS: 用了已在培养中 散發酒香气的Apple cider sourdough starter、微酸味中混合着微微的酒香气 其实不凃牛油, 果醬或cream cheese 也可、慢慢咬嚼 越咬越有滋味～
.
PPS: Dark Rye Bread 的食材中 其中”塩”是关键 比平时烘焙的面包 使用的塩份量多一些. 这类面包比较适合夾沙拉、鮪魚、腌肉等馅料 配着享用.

Another favorite from @keongsaikbakery 😍 their cruffins are the best✨thanks @fatpigdiary again for delivering my cravings to me😂 the burnt cheese and matcha cheese are must-get! Can’t have one without the other🤭 I heat it up in the oven for 5 mins and it still have the creamy oozy core and crispy flaky outsides 👍 quite a fair bit of bakes do not pass the refrigeration test🙃 my family love the rich cheesy insides, it’s not “gelat” or too sweet😊 and the cruffin crust really is worth every penny✨

⠀
Сегодняшние сториз из терминала Jewel серьезно взбудоражили публику, так что я решила написать об этом месте побольше.
⠀
ℹ️ Начнем с того, что технически это не зона аэропорта — Jewel находится между терминалами 1 и 3, и билеты туда не нужны. Никакие. Это идеальное место для стоповера, когда на полноценный выход в город времени нет, а мерзнуть в аэропорту не хочется: десять минут — и вот вы уже гордо хвастаетесь, что кое-что повидали в Сингапуре, можно зачесть страну. Но помните: красота притягивает, а мотыльков много, так что на пустой зал не рассчитывайте.
⠀
Вот этот водопад, на фоне которого я исполняю акробатические этюды, — 40-метровый Rain Vortex. Пандемия позволила ему сохранить звание самого высокого в мире в номинации ""закрытые помещения"" чуть дольше, пока не закончат Eden Project. В какой стране, догадайтесь сами.
⠀
Водопад — сердце жемчужины. Его видно из любой точки под куполом, а в солнечную погоду глаза отрывать вообще не хочется. Лучший вид на Rain Vortex открывается не с мостика, куда все так рвутся, а с горок на верхнем этаже: попасть к ним можно за символические 5 долларов, в то время как мост съест 8 долларов золотовалютных резервов (и их он не стоит).
⠀
Настоящее волшебство начинается в 7:30 вечера. Световое и музыкальное шоу в Jewel— мое любимое из тех, что дают в ночном Сингапуре: я замираю, как ребенок, боюсь моргнуть и забываю дышать на целые 5 минут. Сейчас эта радость упразднена на неопределенный срок, и тем ценнее архивы. Видео в карусели — это, между прочим, раритет, особенная рождественская программа, которую мы подглядели в декабре вместе с @lazzygenius.
⠀
А еще в прошлом году бурлили слухи и обвинения, что царь-то ненастоящий — дескать, дизайн-проект, которому было уже лет 6, сингапурские шалунишки утащили у катарцев, планировавших расширять аэропорт Хамад. Но это уже совсем другая история, и ее я расскажу (и покажу) в следующей серии! А пока просто любуйтесь 💙",Jewel Changi Airport,263,41

Some of them need it far more.👚 Oh that’s me! As much as I try to declutter, I need pretty varieties! Be it on my clothes, shoes, bags, accessories or even my daily breakfast! And most importantly, they must be matching! 🤣🤣🤣 If you scroll through my ig on my daily office outfit, you’ll get the idea. 😚 And now, I’m buying more and more masks to match my clothes in anticipation of returning to office in the near future. 🤪 Anyway, today I tried to make new breakfast by melting shredded cheese on my meji crackers in microwave (recommended by my friend). Somehow, 2 crackers went chao-ta, and the other two joined together! 😅 So I had to add in a slice of bread with ham and cheese and got the idea of recreating all of them as laundry that are hanged outdoor to dry. Then I added this new Hersey’s mint creme wafer as a bench (this wafer is super yummy; from Cold Storage). Next, I decided to include my two nieces on the bench in this foodart and imagined what they would have said. 🤣🤣🤣 I think the completed foodart looks quite cute and fun! Happy Sunday! Long weekend always passes fast but I think we all enjoyed this happening weekend! 🤩😘😘😘

As we all move into phase 2 after our #circuitbreakersg, more of us are starting to go back to work and school. We hear you that you want a holder to keep your used masks when you take it out for meals or drinks.

We have made our mask holders specially for you. Each mask holder is lovingly handmade. Each holder is made using lightweight waterproof material so it keeps your mask clean even if the holder gets dirty or wet. Just wipe and reuse. We have improved the design as well with a separator to keep ur used mask and cash/cards/spare masks etc too. 

Wholesale pricing available. Random designs will be sent. 

In addition, what you purchase go towards giving a salary to our team of elderly crafter ladies. 

You can DM your orders or shop from www.shopee.sg/upcyclers or our new facebook shop.

May be an image of 1 person.","All mums will resonate with this: there are almost no photos of us. There might be a few with the kids and several hundred silly selfies. But really almost none of just us. @mumpacktravel actually alerted me to this fact ages ago when she started #mumsinphotos to encourage us to actually get in the pictures, to ask someone to take a picture instead of us always taking a snap of the kids. Even being conscious of it has not curbed my bad habits! So I was actually really please when @keriblitz and @fional1981 offered (unprompted) to take some snaps of me last week when we were walking in #fortcanningpark. I mean it helps that #fortcanning is incredibly beautiful and has many gorgeous places to stand and pose - I’ll post it later but there’s also this incredible staircase that from the top looks like any old staircase but from the bottom you look up and it’s magical.

Having had no real training, most of my culinary know-how comes from TV shows and Youtube. I have been totally entranced by the anime <Food Wars : Shokugeki no Soma>, about a culinary school where students challenge each other to cooking battles. This show has such a cult following that there are fan sites and fan publications detailing the recipes and legions have been trying to recreate them. 
During #circuitbreakersg, @woowaileong of @restaurantibid  who probably fits the description in the first line of this caption, had some fun and put an item on his takeout menu - a liberal interpretation of the anime’s Countdown Mapo Tofu Noodles with Lion’s Head Meatball.  Split the meatball to see “The Moon” - a golden curry sauce that spills out and makes it a whole ‘nother dish!  The meatball is not for the fainthearted at 1-1 meat-fat ratio, so please don’t attempt to eat it solo (if it ever comes back).
However it was the Ma （麻）and La （辣）of the MPTF that I enjoyed most and I had a ton of rice with it. 
@restaurantibid is now open for dining in, so this item is no longer available.  Time to get out of Netflix-n-chill mode and make a restaurant reservation to try their other goodies!",Restaurant Ibid,13,2

Hosted a workshop on last Thursday (9th July) to learn how to master professional skincare at home.

I have created a working space in one of the room for my work and business. As I'm using zoom very frequently now and in order to have virtual background for my zoom meetings, I require a green background. Thanks to my hubby for setting up this work space for me😘😘

.
🌟Pertama, kamu harus tahu tujuanmu (yaiyalah😅). Akan ada peta jalur bus lengkap dengan jadwal keberangkatan (jam berapa bus datang/berhenti di halte tersebut). Pastikan kamu naik bus dengan nomor yang sesuai. Atau, cara lebih mudahnya kamu bisa download aplikasi Google Maps / SG Buses di smarphone. Dari situ, kamu bisa tahu informasi secara real time dimana kamu harus menunggu bus, nomor bus, perkiraan jam kedatangan, halte apa saja yang dilewati, dll😉😁
.
💜Saat naik bus, kamu harus masuk lewat pintu depan karena kamu harus men-tap Ez-Link Card atau STP kamu saat masuk. Gimana kalau nggak punya kartu? Kamu bisa membayar cash dengan memasukannya ke dalam kotak. Kamu juga bisa bertanya kepada sopir harga yang harus dibayarkan dan pastikan uang kamu cukup karena nggak akan ada kembalian😅 #CityTourWithSGB
.
🔥Kalau tujuan kamu sudah hampr dekat, tekan tombol merah yang ada di tiang bus (dekat kursi). Bila kamu terlewat, kamu nggak bisa turun di sembarang jalan, jadi harus turun di halte seanjutnya. Saat turun,  keluar lewat pintu tengah (kalau ramai bisa lewat depan) dan jangan lupa tap lagi (kalau pake kartu) saat turun bus😋😋 #TravelWithSGB
.
Menurut kamu enakan naik bus apa mrt? 😜

It benefits you from head to toe 🌟 by calming your mind, enhancing digestion, stretching your inner thighs, hips hamstrings and calves, as well as strengthening your ankles and thighs!

To reap these benefits in the safest way, focus your awareness on:

⚡ Distance: The wider your legs, the easier to fold, but if too wide, you lost stability

⚡ Ankles: Point your toes slightly inward and press the whole feet down evenly. Uneven weight distribution in feet will put your ankle joints at risk. 

⚡ Knees: Be aware of the sensation behind your knees. To prevent muscle tearing caused by hyper-extension in knees, engage your thighs to lift your knees caps. This grants better protection.

⚡ Head: Instead of putting weight on your head to reach the floor further, align hips to ankles and press feet to lift the butt

⚡ Exit: Inhale while you raise up, take your time to exit. Take as many breaths as you need and pause if needed or when you encounter dizziness.

🌈  Remember, the goal of practising yoga is not to reach the floor or toes. This promotes an overfocusing on stretching and neglects the importance of engaging the right muscles for stability⛰  and strength💪 !

🧘‍♀️ Enrich your practice by learning to skillfully move your body within an appropriate range of motion in each pose. Namaste🍃",The Senses Therapy,14,1

At the end of the day, we are all voting for the good of our home. Now that election is over, it’s back to working together and staying united for the love of Singapore, Our Home. 🥰🥰🥰

•
•
Over CB, I found myself picking up new hobbies and trying out products I generally wouldn’t have thought to try, including the Digestive Herbs by @yourtea. 5 weeks in and I’m feeling happier and more balanced overall. I loved how the TCM blend was packaged into tea bags making it easier and convenient to consume. I was also pleasantly surprised by how smooth this digestive tea tasted. It was very fragrant and actually tasted like Chinese tea instead of Chinese medicine. I think this herbal blend is effective in targeting multiple issues such as digestion, “heaty-ness”, and bloating, to name a few.

If you are a fan of Indonesian snacks, then you have to try these! Indonesia fried meatballs.. these are not your typical meatballs, instead it is filled with prawns and pork and is larger in size! It’s really a mouthful! Do check out their other snacks like the Ebi potato chips and Kering tempeh which is best when paired with rice or if you prefer, you can have it on its own!

(1) A new interest in home cooking - part of the #WFH joys of whipping up a stir-fry while in an APAC-wide conference call (non-Zoom; and on mute unless it’s my turn to speak).

(2) An absolute obsession on #regrowing #alliums - i.e. chives, shallots, spring onions, garlic. From my experiments, I find that best yielding ones are shallots (those little red-pink onions). Soak their bottom bits in water until you see root growth. Then plunk them in soil with plenty of sunlight. And they will grow faster than your hair. So much so that I’ve dedicated a pot space for them permanently in the kitchen.

(3) A much reduced takeaway & dining out bill. After the first month of Circuit Breaker, I remember staring at the almost miraculous credit bill of low 3 digits - which was for 4 weeks of groceries, and my monthly tax bill.

(By the way, that’s not a shell on the #cagefree egg. It’s either a natural blood spot or an embryo. If it’s the latter, may you be reborn into a higher form of existence - Namo Amitabha 🙏🏻)

Also almost universally works great with a majority of South East Asian native dishes.

😍Cantik banget kan! Kamu bisa menemukan tempat ini di Jurong Lake Gardens. Grassland ini didominasi oleh rerumputan yang tinggi jadi super cantik buat foto-foto!👌🏻😜

✅Ada Lone Tree, sebuah pahatan yang berdiri tinggi di antara rerumputan. Ini terinspirasi oleh asal-usul industri Jurong, dan terbuat dari jeruji besi daur ulang dari jalur taman yang lama. Disini pun kamu bisa melihat burung secara dekat. Fun fact lainnya, ini bukanlah ilalang tetapi merupakan 6 spesies rumput Pennisetum😍

🌟Selain Grassland yang ciamik untuk foto-foto ini, ada banyak yang bisa kamu explore di Jurong Lake Garden. Diantaranya adalah Forest Ramble (taman bermain alami), Clusia Clove (taman bermain air, namun sekarang sedang tutup karena maintenance), Sports facilities, swimming pool & workout classes, dan jangan lupa - Rasau Walk, sebuah boardwalk berkelok sepanjang tepi air. Dan lebih asyiknya, kalau kamu pecinta anjing, disini ada area khusus Dog Run - salah satu public area yang luas di Singapura untuk membawa anjing peliharaan berlarian dengan bebas. Tentu saja, semua ini FREE. Seru!

I used what I wanted to give my girl but you can add any seafood or meat you want. ===============================================
INGREDIENTS:
• Ee mee 
• 6 prawns 
• 50g chicken 
• Broccoli
• 1 tbsp minced garlic
• Broth (I used ikan bilis) 

METHOD:
1) Heat the prawn head and dried scallops in a tbsp of oil till it's cooked and fragrant. 
2) Add in boiling water and a small pack of ikan bilis and boil for about 15 minutes. 
3) Meanwhile, blanch your noodles till 80% cooked and leave aside. 
4) In a claypot, fry some garlic and fry your seafood till half cooked.
5) Add in the broth and simmer for about 3 minutes. Remove the seafood and add 1tsp abalone sauce and pepper.
6) Add in the noodles and place your ingredients on top. Cover and simmer for another 30s to 1minute. Serve hot. ============================================================ #claypot #eemee #claypoteemee #safood #30minutemeals #30minutesrecipe #simple #sgig #sgrecipes #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodstep #instagfoodsg #singaporehomecooks #homecookedmeals #whati8today #instagfoodsg #家常便饭 #sgfoodlover #onepotmeal #comfortfoods #circuitbreakersg",,24,0

⁣
⁣
❤️Ivan Ng⁣
⁣
Over the last two months, I constantly gave my team the assurance that we will overcome this crisis together by motivating each other through Zoom workout 🏋️‍♀️ and we showed our care and love through food delivery 🚚 and I even prepared home cooked meal 🥘 for the team and got it to their doorsteps to surprise them. ⁣
⁣
As the captain of the ship 🚢 , I believe we have to adapt to situations quickly and positively😀. There is no time to complain nor wail.⁣
⁣
We need to constantly find new opportunities and solutions that will help us overcome this challenging period. 🌈⁣
⁣
Our goals should not be forgotten or compromised. The approach I take is through these 6 simple steps:⁣
⁣
1) Acknowledge the current situation ✅ ⁣
2) Adjust our mindset and attitude ✅ ⁣
3) Adapt to the new norm ✅⁣
4) Adopt new work practices ✅⁣
5) Aquire new digital skills which eventually lead us to ✅⁣
6) Achieve the best result we can get out of it ✅⁣
⁣
❤️Hannah Lau⁣
⁣
I believe that nothing brings people together like good food! We deserve to enjoy the little things in life, especially now, and I can’t think of a better way to surprise the team and kickstart their day with freshly-baked croissant🥐 by hand delivering them to their door steps. ⁣
⁣
Also, I think that communication is the key to keeping my team motivated and productive 💪 . I used Zoom as a platform to exchange feedback and ideas and just to catch up twice a week just to stay connected. New values and perspectives are created while we are WFH, and we too gain new perspectives on conquering the new norm.⁣
⁣
Through this pandemic, my leadership is put to test. I also have to be confident and trust in my ability to help the team get through this challenging period by setting a set of clear goals that can be achieved if we work as a team collectively. 🌈",,10,1
1849,cruxgosocial,2349914581698002394,2020-07-10 03:28:07,cruxgosocial,,"Rules play an important role in dictating our everyday lives. It provides guidance towards a certain objective and also brings order to chaos. When it comes to design, conforming to the basic rules will make your design well-balanced, easy to comprehend and organised. However, sometimes, bending the rule can help you be even more creative.

As designers, we should not strive to obey the standard rules but explore opportunities to break away from the norm. Find ways on how the project could dictate its own rule. Rules shouldn't dictate the project. In this way, your work will be more diversified, or even develop as a new trend and stands out from the crowd. 

For this concept, we look at how the brand could devise its own set of rules. The tilted layout influenced by a delightful ripple animation further highlight the brand vision without ruining the user experience.

Prevention Is Better Than Cure.
Truth be told, I have never purchased any form of protectants or disinfectants for my children before. Not because I do not believe in them, but I just thought that it was not really necessary when my girls are well.
.
The current pandemic taught me otherwise.
Even though there is still no vaccine for Covid-19, I feel more at ease if the girls are more 'protected' while they are out; masking up and taking precautionary measures. The girls now have fun spraying themselves (or each other) with Bioshield Kiddie before they head out! (Swipe left to see meimei even applying them to 'protect' her armpits🤣.)
.
The Bioshield Kiddie spray caught my attention because it actually protects our little ones BEFORE exposure to germs and bacteria, unlike sanitizers that kill germs AFTER exposure. This organic spray creates a layer of protection on the skin, giving our little ones protection for up to 4 hours!
.
@bigbigmummybrownies would like to gift 3 lucky winners a bottle of Bioshield Kiddie spray (60ml) each! Worth $19, inclusive of delivery.
.
To stand a chance to win, simply:
1) Follow @bigbigmummybrownies and @venetia.ngin
2) Like this post
3) Tag one friend per comment
4) Share this post to your IGS & tag us both for additional chances to win. [Optional]

Good luck! 🤞
Contest ends on 16 July 2020 at 1200.
Winners will be chosen at random and announced on the same day!

The limited-edition gift box ($22, $7 for delivery) featured 1 illustrated card of choice (4 designs to pick from) and a small assortment of bakes - two jam cinnamon sugar donuts (blackcurrant & pear), four mini scones and a serving of gula melaka butter whip.

Filling the alluring fried confections were berry jam and pear confiture jam, both lightened with a little custard that delivered a smooth, creamy texture. Tangy and sweet but not overly so, the Berry Jam Donut was totally my jam as it held a very pronounced yet natural taste of berries - a tartness that complemented the flavour of the fluffy yeasted donuts. The Pear Confiture Jam Donut, similarly, was well-balanced and made a great pair with the sugar-dusted dough. Much like a mellow spiced pear dessert, the combination was refreshing and somewhat summer-y.

Crumbly, buttery and oh so good, the tender mini scones were great on their own but fantastic with the gula melaka whipped butter. Godly, the whip was so fragrant and soft. I am not usually one to have my scones with butter and so I surprised myself when I finished it all off. Toasting them up also added a nice little crunch and that heat gently melting the butter was “chef’s kiss”.

There are so many different ways to ask someone if they are doing well this season. 🌈⁣

Some people choose to send a surprise food package to their family and friends and some others, hanging out over Zoom for drinks, games or just to catch up. 🥳⁣

These little actions may seem unimportant to you but for some others, it means the world to them. To know that someone cares and that they are not forgotten. ✨⁣

Bakesale set will resume next weekend (18/19th July)! We will be taking this time to R&D new flavours and products. 

Refer to highlight for menu.

As a new home-based baker, we are still learning the ropes of managing the business -  knowing how many orders to take in, tracking inventory and cost, being active on social media etc - and trying to strike a balance between baking, work, family, social life and sleep! But we are enjoying every step of the way and it has been super fulfilling! All of your likes and tags motivate us so much!

Thankful for a supportive family & friends circle (who are all slowing growing *ahem* sideways from testing all of our bakes 😅) and our lovely dfordough family! We look forward to bringing you better bakes!

Side note: We feel the constant need to come up with new items and flavours all the time to keeps things here fresh! Do you think it's important or just keep to a few good items only? Leave a comment!

#SGGIGexclusivegiveaways
.
Remember the previous Cream Mousse Body Wash giveaway that has just ended? Due to the overwhelming response for that, we have yet again partnered with another #sglocalbusiness to host a giveaway on another Cream Mousse🚿 This time, it is the Triptych of Lune’s Creamy Mousse Body Wash from @beautyholics_sg 😍They have sent us their 2 most popular fragrances — Honey & Milk and Neroli.

The main ingredients of the Honey & Milk fragrance Cream Mousse (Manuka Honey, Hydrolysed Silk and Milk Extract) make it an effective moisturising body wash suitable for people with rough, dry or dull skin as they help repair damaged dry skin, retain moisture in the skin and promote self-repairing skin barrier. After using the body wash, I felt that it has made my skin soft and supple. 😍

The Neroli fragrance Cream Mousse, on the other hand, is a mild & gentle body wash that is suitable for sensitive skin. Its main ingredients are Purslane (that is anti-inflammatory and stimulates the skin’s healing process), Allatoin (which is a gentle ingredient that soothes and moisturizes the skin) and Ceramide (which reinforces the skin protective barrier).
.
🌟 𝗚𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 🌟
.
Two (2) winners will each win a set of Triptych of Lune’s Creamy Mousse Body Wash. Each set consists of 2 bottles of Creamy Mousse in 2 different fragrances (Honey & Milk and Neroli) from @beautyholics_sg (worth $52/set).

Note: Winners have to bear $3.50 courier fee.

What you see here is a product of science. 
Our SCOBY, grown through multiple testings of fermentation environment, made to create future brews.

Scobies are also known to brewers as pellicles, created by the bacteria known to Kombucha, Acetobacter aceti. The bacteria is responsible for converting ethanol from the yeast into acetic and gluconic acid through aerobic respiration (oxygenated system).

Happiness need not be spectacular. 🦖 Yeah happiness is having a relaxing and no-agenda day with someone you love. But I think it’s also very enjoyable to have a day of me-time with no agenda but just eating and doing your favourite stuff! 🥰🥰🥰 Today, I made a quick trip to Northpoint City during lunchtime to buy some fresh flowers for the week! So my lunch also consist of favourite snacks that are re-created into a Dinoland. I have a cute dinosaur made of Dough Culture’s Goreng Pisang, a tree made of Bengawansolo’s egg tart and Prima Deli’s eclair, and a rainbow made of Bengawansolo’s kueh lapis. I think my Dino looks quite cute! 🥰🥰🥰 Happy midweek and it’s a short working week!!!! 🤩🤩🤩

⠀
Method-⠀
⠀
1. Saute garlic, add prawn heads, shells & tails till fragrant & the colour changes to orange. I added a few star anise & cloves while frying the prawns to bring out the fragrance.⠀
⠀
2. Soup base:⠀
 -Water ( I estimated it by using my ramen bowls as measurements & added 2 1/2 bowl full of water )⠀
- 1 tsp Black pepper, salt & brown sugar ⠀
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce⠀
- 1 tbsp light & dark soy sauce⠀
- Chilli powder to taste ( I love spicy so i added more😋)⠀
⠀
I added the mixture above to the home made prawn stock & set my pressure cooker to the soup mode.⠀
⠀
3. While waiting for the soup to cook, blanch water spinach & bean sprouts separately in boiling water. Boil eggs & noodles separately as well. Portion the noodles, spinach, sprouts & eggs into bowls individually.⠀
⠀
4. Once the soup is ready, strain all the prawn heads,shells & tails. Bring the soup to a boil & blanch the prawns until they just turn pink. ⠀
⠀
5. Ladle hot soup over the individually served bowl. Sprinkle some fried shallots on top & serve!🤗⠀

⁣
Sometimes, something your date says might get the gears in your head turning. In your enthusiasm, you can’t help but butt in with your own opinions. This isn’t especially bad if done once or twice. But it will most definitely become very frustrating for your date if they're being interrupted constantly, and that isn't gonna be a good look for you. ⁣
⁣
That excitement is great and welcomed! But channel that into making your conversation as satisfying as possible for 𝘣𝘰𝘵𝘩 𝘰𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶.

===
Kimchi. We all know what that is. But did you know that there are two types of kimchi? The fermented, really sour stuff is what you use for cooking. Fresh kimchi, or geotjeori, is what you have as a side dish. The difference is in fermentation. Regular kimchi would be fermented for two weeks. That is what makes it so sour. Geotjeori is freshly made, and has barely begun to ferment. That said, it is still very flavourful - sweet, spicy, slightly tart, slightly Savoury, and with tiny bursts of ginger. Which is why geotjeori is such a perfect go to with rice or porridge.
*
Here's something about me - I hated porridge, growing up. Absolutely hated it. Now though... It comforts me, especially on cold, rainy days.
*
Today, I made a protein-rich mung bean porridge (nokdu-juk). That, plus Baechu-Geotjeori made for a lovely lunch. If you want an added hit of protein, you can add a fried egg too. I fried the egg for the bloke, but had porridge and geotjeori for myself. It was so satisfying.
*
Of course, if you want the benefits of fermentation, go with fermented kimchi. You won't get that from geotjeori. Even if you do leave it to ferment a little first, for a few days, you won't get as much of the health benefits as you would from kimchi.

Ever since the start of the pandemic in Singapore, we have been trying hard to secure disposable masks from reliable sources for our loved ones and ourselves. So when we knew about locally manufactured face masks by @wellmbyavs, we were elated! 

Why WellM masks?
😷Their masks have been tested by TÜV SÜD PSB Singapore. The reports are posted on their website so you can be assured!

😷Fulfils the following criteria. 
✔3 ply high quality 
✔BFE > 98% (high filtration efficiency)
✔Water repellent
✔Non toxic
✔Comfortable

😷Support local!! Being self-sufficient is really important. We saw how prices of masks surged due to high demand and limited supply. Since we may have to continue wearing masks for quite a while, having a local manufacturer to provide a steady supply of masks is essential. #sgunited

❗PROMO CODE❗
WellM has kindly offered a 10% discount for our Instagram friends! Use promo code 10TMK for 10% discount off all products, valid until end of July 2020. They carry a range of essential products such as face masks for adults and children, hand sanitizers and face shields. Check them out at WellM.sg. Stay safe everyone!",,143,14

Pretty good pizza served at @bellapizzasg which specializes largely in Neopolitan style where the emphasis is producing a crust that has the perfect balance of crispiness and texture yet is able to retain the juices of its fresh ingredients.

Their lasagna was very good too and really surprised with their generous amount of beef! Unfortunately, I ate it while I was taking pics of the pizza!😅

F&B are open. Watsons, supermarkets are open. 
All other shops, clothes, The Body Shop, Marks & Spencers, H&M, luxury boutiques are closed during this period. It is like a ban on shopping except food and household stuff! No movies, no karaoke, no nightlife...nothing.

How do we survive without shopping and entertainment? But we did.

Choose from over 20 types of honey, and over 8 types of healthier choice toppings such as Honeymill Honey Jelly, fresh passion fruit, lemon, aloe vera and wolfberries for your honey drink!
🔻
The honey drinks are indeed impressive and really tasted refreshing with their fusion of honey and fruits! Their cakes were equally impressive! I would not have thought that with the addition of honey to these cakes that we would get a soothing sweet flavor with a hint of honey aroma! These are indeed the perfect sweet treats!

昨天的麻婆豆腐有剩余
今天的午餐搭配讃岐烏冬麵和小白菜、簡單吃～ 
之前见不少友人买”老干妈” 都説好吃
连家乡同學也说👍 我和老爷平日不大吃辣 
煮麻婆豆腐也只用辣豆瓣酱不加辣油～🤣
同学说”老干妈”不会太辣 
如麻辣香鍋内的微辣花椒 那个程度我是可以接受 
不过住家附近的超市 卻沒见过老干妈
終於在The Rail Mall的cold storage 见有卖 
买了油辣椒回去試試～ 昨晚煮麻婆豆腐放一湯匙試試..
這辣度和花椒口味 不但提升味道 还不錯吃呢！
同学说豆豉油辣椒、風味鶏油辣椒也不错
下次要买来试试～.

2️⃣ᴄᴏɴɴᴇᴄᴛɪɴɢ ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴍᴏᴛʜᴇʀ ɴᴀᴛᴜʀᴇ⛰. Outdoor activities can help you feel grounded, deepen your connection to the environment and enhance your appreciation for the beauty around you.

1️⃣deep cleansing our pores can greatly help to reduce the white heads and black heads and pimples too
2️⃣when our pores are not clogged, skin is well detoxed and cleansed, skin care products can also absorb better 
3️⃣to help maintain, clean, healthy and radiant skin.

So I highly recommend Origins clear improvement charcoal mask👍👍This clay mask has active charcoal powder and white china clay to help deep cleanse the pores, draw out pore-clogging impurities ,absorb excess oil which in return can reduce white heads , black heads and pimples and your skin will be smoother and brighter.  Using this mask twice a week and apply a consistency thick enough to cover your skin tone and rinse off after 10mins. 

Charcoal mask is for all skin types, especially oily and combination oily skin. Charcoal Honey 🍯 mask is for dry and sensitive skin .

It was easily accessible, there were even vending machines to order it & it just warms the tummy 🥰 ⠀

Saute white onions till fragrant, add beef slices in & lightly stir fry till there is a slight tinge of pink. Add salt,pepper,yakiniku sauce (conventional sauce consisted of sake,mirin & soy sauce!) & simmer for around 10-12 minutes. In the meantime, steam the vegetables & eggs for about 6 minutes (for the perfect runny yolk consistency!). Once it's done, assemble brown rice,beef,veggies & lastly add that poached egg on top!🥰 Sprinkle with some condiments like sesame seed & roasted seaweed if you would like. Itadakimasu!🙇‍♀️⠀

The good news is, nightmares do end! 🥳And you wake up from it with a CHOICE to either 1️⃣ dwell in the bad dream, or 2️⃣ continue to move forward and live life.

It may sometimes be easier to just let it be, and give up on the bigger picture. 🤷🏻‍♀️ But you’re not doing yourself, and the people around you any favours!

- 🍄 Think the mushrooms are a must have, makes the burger much nicer, juicer
- 🧅 Love the caramelized onions
- 🐟 Salmon patty was interesting, real chunks of salmon in a loose patty; very different from usual fish burgers
- 🍔 Buns were soft & fluffy, not drenched in grease
- Between the Wagyu & normal beef burger, both are good; the wagyu is thicker & hence more ‘beefy’
- 🍟 Truffle fries kind of a miss, probably because dabao & it becomes cold/soggy 
Would say it’s a good burger & one I would go back to!

Pretty good pizza served at @bellapizzasg which specializes largely in Neopolitan style where the emphasis is producing a crust that has the perfect balance of crispiness and texture yet is able to retain the juices of its fresh ingredients.
🔻
Their lasagna was very good too and really surprised with their generous amount of beef! Unfortunately, I ate it while I was taking pics of the pizza!😅

If you are happy now, there is nothing else to accomplish. Indeed, if you become concerned about whether you will be happy tomorrow or even five minutes from now, you will forget to be happy now.🦄 Be Present because being present is a present too! (Opps, I’m sounding like E.C plan. 🤣🤣🤣). Have been out the whole day in my favourite NEX Shopping Mall, spent quite a bit on shopping and eating my favourite soufflé pancake at Tamago-En (very yummy) and Egg Fried Rice at Din Tai Feng.

.
🙌🏻Henderson Waves merupakan jembatan yang memiliki arsitektur bentuk gelombang. Bentuknya mirip seperti cangkang dan mempunyai ceruk-ceruk tersembunyi, sehingga pejalan kaki bisa duduk bersantai melepas lelah!🔥
.
🌟Jembatan ini cocok untuk rekreasi akhir pekan lho! Siapkan sepatu yang nyaman dan air mineral yang cukup, soalnya harus menaiki tangga sebanyak 12 lantai! Menjelang malam, LED akan menyala menghiasi jembatan ini dari pukul 7 malam hingga 7 pagi. Henderson Waves berjarak hanya 5 menit dari Vivo City!❤️
.
✅ How to get there: naik MRT lalu turun di Harbour Front Station. Setelah itu lanjut naik bus di halte tepat di depan Vivo City Mall (no. 145 atau 131). Setelah 2 pemberhentian, kamu bisa turun dan berjalan kaki! Sangat mudah kan? 👍🏻

Tag teman kamu dan ajak kesini!👇🏻👇🏻

自Circuit Breaker Phase 2 解放 己过了约一个月～昨天早上和老爷到Daily Farm的Singapore Quarry晨运去～ 好一段时間沒來这一帶了、也許是疫情期間人手不足、公园內有不少地方杂草众生～ 幸好蚊虫並不多沒被叮咬😅 记得去年到访时湖里还见到不少鲤鱼、是下雨的关系吗？一只都沒见到🤣 虽说这天也很热、当穿过绿树林的时候 感觉冶愈～.
.
PS: 最后2張是马来西亚铁道KTM列车的废线跡之一的陸桥、这铁道在2011年6月30日被废止、之前还能上去桥上看看景色、不过目前己被封住进行工程中、查询URA网站～那一帶尚留下的Bukit Timah Railway Station 将要翻新成Heritage Gallery! 相当期待呢！.

I tried but I kept missing out until @macqueza sent me their Acwell UV cut cushion! Maybe also coz during circuit breaker I just stay home n I don’t make up much. I feel the need to add sunscreen into my regime! I use it after my moisturizer, it is very lightweight and there’s no white cast after applying!

.
A cab stopped infront of me, and the uncle yelled in Mandarin, “Where are you going? I can take you nearby. Just $5, we wont go by the meter.”
.
I was not expecting that. I was looking at my phone before he stopped. I faltered and defaulted to my play-safe answer, which was to decline him.
.
Then I watched him drive off. I watched him drive slower than the average car, knowing that he was having his eyes out for passengers.
.
Aye, then the guilt started to eat at me. I definitely had $5 to spare for someone who was desperately trying to make a living during those days where almost nobody were out, but I was so used to playing safe, just say no when in doubt or when caught unexpectedly.
.
Im ashamed that saying no to someone in need has become the easier and more intuitive option. The moment I realised that, the uncle was already out of sight. I couldn’t retract my words. It would have been just $5 from me, but so much more for him.
.
It’s going to take more from me, to actively work against this learnt response that serves nobody. It has also taught me to be more empathetic towards those who default to “no” in unexpected and tight situations. By no means are these justifications for the actions I chose then, but with it brought to awareness, I learn and do better.
.
I hope it’ll be the same for you too, as you’re reading this and it has been brought to your awareness as well. Have a blessed sunday ♥️

As Tammy Strobel says, it’s cheap! She radically simplified her life by smart-sizing.

I loved the fruitiness of black currant and the opulent purple color not to mention the seductive nose when it’s first opened at around 6pm yesterday. However I don’t think I got the best out of this prestigious wine mainly because I didn’t decant it properly or it’s possibly dull stage now. I wouldn’t even imagined that it is Lafite (honestly I haven’t drank much of Lafite 😅) yet I would still think it’s A very good quality Bordeaux wine. It was rather tertiary, leathery towards when it’s more opening up and has got unbelievably long finish with polished tannin. Fairly enjoyable wine to celebrate the 4th of July although the best is yet to come 😜 Chloe’s Score 4.4/5",,54,3

This seafood joint is best known for its delicious lobster rolls. It was originally founded in New York, but has expanded to many outlets across America.

It also has over 10 branches in Japan, where it is extremely popular. 

The Singapore outlet has a seating capacity of 30, but will only accommodate 15 to 20 diners due to social distancing measures.

Food delivery will also be their number one priority, in light of the COVID-19 situation.

——————————————————————
#SGGIGexclusivegiveaways 
.
I have accepted @organicskincaresg ‘s 3-week face mask challenge and have been using their BeautéSaine Blue/Black/White Rice Face Mask, one for each week last month! These masks are 100% natural, chemical-free, preservative-free & additives-free. Additionally, they are loaded with USDA Certified Organic Essential Oils, which aid in anti-aging, reducing wrinkles & moisturizing dry skin.

𝐁𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐤 - This anti-bacterial & anti-inflammatory mask consists of Blue Clay also known as ‘Healing Clay’ and Rice, which increases skin collagen, releases clogged pores and improves blood circulation, enabling cell renewal 👍🏼.
𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐤 - This mask gently exfoliates your skin and is packed with anti-oxidants that reduces inflammation and redness. It contains Activated Charcoal which pulls dirt and oil from your face 😍.
𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐤 - This mask is made from the combination of gluten-free white rice & pearl powder known for its ability to reduce pore size and improve texture. It enables skin rehydration & moisture, brightens your skin tone naturally and allows for skin firmness and elasticity.

After using them for 3 weeks, I‘m truly in love! Honestly can’t stop singing praises about these masks to my fiancé 🤭 Words can’t do these masks justice so I hope you guys get a chance to try it out for yourself!

Meant to be a surprise, each week sees a different assortment of their signature viennoiserie in cute two-bite sizes (that is depending on the size of your mouth).
.
A mix of sweet and savoury, the flavours in Bakebox 4 were a smashing hit - I might have lucked out as I enjoyed all of them. One out of the two sweet options, the Almond Raspberry was a classic twice-baked almond crusted croissant coupled with lovely raspberry jam. The other was a freshly baked Kopi Gao croissant filled with robust and smooth coffee cream. Great chilled or slightly warmed, it was made for fans of the brew.

The first smell that hits your nose even before opening the box, their Truffle croissant was insanely good in my opinion. Loving the heady aroma, I appreciated the airy texture and that the taste of truffle seemed to have infused beautifully into the buttery pastry. Topped with a blanket of shaved cheese, it added a tinge of saltiness and the earthy truffled mushroom pate sandwiched between was heavenly!

Perhaps paling, by comparison, the Egg Mayo croissant wasn’t as intriguing in terms of the flavour profile as the rest; but was nonetheless delicious with the considerable amount of savoury egg mayo stuffed in and sitting on the flaky pastry.

Who cares about onion breath when it comes to their Spring Onion croissant! Transforming the known Taiwanese street snack into wonderful golden baked goodies, Sugar Thieves’ fun take on 葱油饼 was amazing. The savoury bits of fragrantly pungent spring onion and mildly tart sour cream tied harmoniously with the buttery, crispy bread.

Hence, keep a lookout for their upcoming bake box tomorrow! The ordering form opens up at noon every Monday, while stocks last.

Here is what i did to cultivate mindfulness today, which happens to be a Miracle day as there are three auspicious ⭐️(Star of Benevolence, heavenly empress and heavenly wizard). 

In ancient days, Sages use these stars to manifest miracles. Today the 4th of July also happens to be Independence Day in the 🇺🇸 the fact that we are able to have a large amount of independence and freedom in our 🇸🇬 is well, somewhat something to be mindful of, and grateful for. 

So today my theme is to practise gratitude. 

SUPER GRATEFUL 🙏🏻 for finally being able to build a terranium after 3months and i have no idea it will bring much revelations to me by the end of the day. Initially, I thought it is just a bunch of plants and a nice jar to hold the sand and decor together, but the whole experience has been sensorial and surreal. We saw the actor from Ah Boys to Men in our class but not even that can take my attention away from my terranium😆

Terranium is a great way to be mindful of current activity and to exude your inner persona. Sometimes, you really just may be surprised!

Here’s what i enjoyed most: 

1. The Advisory: without which i guess i will galang gaboh and anyhow assemble. But with guidance, i was able to appreciate if i want moss for closed terranium or succulents for open terranium after hearing the pros and cons. How much soil to compact in, size of gravel to put in first, how to choose the plan which has gd roots and how much to trim, how to maintain it, whats tools to use to brush off soil remnants on my plants upon completion. It ensures a hiccup free experience and outcome, and help me to troubleshoot the screw-ups like when i didnt even realise one of my succulent dont have roots. I think this is a great activity for PARENTS to bring their🧒

Finally we are able to dined in for some well deserved piping hot pot of Dashi Broth! Well, Not just any broth, but broth from @marusaya_singapore ! 
🔻
Over at @marusaya_singapore Dashi Broth is prepared meticulously with Marusaya’s signature Dashi. Dashi is the foundation of Japanese cuisine and is prepared from an amalgamation of two ingredients: kombu and dried bonito flakes. The most popular type of Dashi is prepared from Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes). Katsuobushi is usually produced by simmering, smoking and drying for a year. Here at Dashi Master Marusaya, it takes two years to process using Rishiri kelp and Satsuma 2-year-old hongare-honbushi. This tedious process has enabled them to produce delectable, nutritious and healthy Katsuobushi which abounds with umami flavours. Their dashi is 100% natural and does not contain MSG or other artificial seasoning.
🔻
Choose between the signature Dashi Shabu Course featuring seasonal appetiser, chawanmushi, assorted sashimi (3 kinds), seasonal dish, dashi shabu, udon or porridge and dessert. And choices of A4/A5 Wagyu Beef or pork! Or..
.
For Diners who prefer to go for just the Dashi Shabu can opt for their dashi Shabu Set with shredded vegetables in pot and your choice of meat A4/A5 Wagyu or Pork and Homemade Chicken Meat Ball in Hotpot and either udon or porridge.
🔻
I mean if we are allowed to dined out, then it’s either you go big or go home!☝🏽
From L to R
▫️ A4 Wagyu Dashi Shabu

▫️ Dashi Oden
▫️ Taberu Katsuobushi (Half Dried Bonito Fish Jerky)

Since the patties were pretty humongous in relation to the table rolls I had, I decided to cut the patties into four🤣 I marinated the patties with salt,pepper & a dash of yakiniku sauce also from @donkisg . ⠀
⠀
My burger consisted of sautèed white onions, button mushrooms, baby butterhead lettuce, cherry tomatoes ( didn't have a whole tomato in my fridge 😋), shredded cheddar & mozzarella cheese, & the star of the show, wagyu beef patty done to medium 🤤 The sauce came from the teriyaki sauce which I used to saute with the onions, & it is so fragrant! I also buttered up the table rolls & grilled it on both sides to have that slightly charred buttery taste😍 I would say this is one of my favourite dishes, the patty was done just right, immensely juicy & tender & everything just went together so well🤤 I think I need to try this with bigger brioche buns next! Have a wonderful weekend guys🥰⠀

Bracelet: SVALBARD [$89.90]
Crystals: Scolecite Angel Wing Fluorite, Kyanite and Pearl
Material: 18K Rose Gold plated

Scolecite Angel Wing Fluorite [USA] 
Scolecite Angel Wing Fluorite, a powerful healing stone, which connects to the heart. Its calming energies alleviates stress and anxiety. Scolecite angel wing fluorite cleanses and stabilises the aura and is extremely effective against computer and electromagnetic stress. Fluorite also corrects geopathic stress and heals the earth. Psychologically, Fluorite dissolves fixed-pattern behaviours and dissipates repressed feelings. This is an excellent stone to balance the body, mind and soul.

Kyanite [BRAZIL]
Kyanite is a powerful amplifier of high frequency and helps to stimulate psychic abilities and intuition. Its grounding spiritual vibration helps to facilitate dream recall and promotes astral body travelling. Kyanite stimulates the throat chakra and aids with self-expression and speech.

Fresh water pearl
Pearls symbolize Purity, Transformation, Honesty, Wisdom and Integrity. It is known to be calming sand helps one manage their temper, useful in strengthening relationships. This iridescent beauty helps improve memory and concentration. It is also believed to treat digestive disorders and the soft organs of the body.

.
Due to its natural characteristics, some crystals, pearl and jade may have natural inclusions or surface marks even after being polished. You may expect slight variations in color and size due to studio lighting or variances in computer and mobile phone screen calibration. We do, however, strive to ensure that screen colours are true to life, as much as possible.

Please note that the crystal, pearl or jade you receive may not be exactly the same as the one featured in the photo as every crystal is unique in appearance and may have some natural inclusions or color variance. We may change the size of the beads or type of findings to suit the wrist size of your request.

Delivery
Orders are generally dispatched within 5-7 working days after receipt of payment.

The giant size cookies ( Double chocolate chunk and Sea salt) are crispy on the outside and soft and moist once you sink your teeth in it! And with a surprise chocolate filling in it too! Other flavors include Double Chocolate Walnut!

⁣
👉Hotel Marina Bay Sands adalah hotel bintang 5 yang menyediakan fasilitas super lengkap! Salah satunya, Infinity Pool yang berada di level 57. Kenapa sih hits banget?⁣
⁣
🌟Pemandangan pencakar langit singapura⁣
Dimana lagi bisa berendam di rooftop dengan pemandangan paling indah di Singapore?⁣🥺😜
⁣
🌟Spot selfie terbaik⁣
Kolam renang sepanjang 150 meter ini selalu ramai dengan orang berfoto dan tentu, anginnya yang super kencang karena diketinggian. Kalau mau agak sepi memang harus datang sebelum jam 8 am (pool buka dari 6 am - 11 pm)⁣👌🏻
⁣
🌟Eksklusif!⁣
Akses kesini khusus tamu hotel aja (yang menginap). Harga kamar permalamnya di banderol mulai dari SGD 379 (tergantung view dan lantainya, makin tinggi lantainya, semakin mahal!)😅
⁣
✅ Tapi, kamu juga bisa menikmati lanskap singapore dari ketinggian yang sama tanpa memesan kamar hotel. Kamu bisa ke Sands Skypark yang dibuka untuk umum dengan fee entrance sebesar SGD 19 (sedang diskon mulai 1 july, namun dengan pembelian tiket online) 😋🙌🏻

If you are experiencing back pain, shoulders pain, or headaches😨, this is in fact, the perfect pose for you.⁠
⁠
Many practitioners have the perception that it is all about the arm strength. This is not true. To harness inner strength and stability without shoulder injuries, you need to get your body alignment and muscle engagement right👍 ⁠
⁠
✔️ Focus on distributing your body weight evenly by integrating the power of your abdominal muscles, lower back, spine, arms, palms, legs, and heels.⁠
⁠
By maintaining a neutral body alignment against the horizontal pull of gravity, Chaturanga has a positive impact on your critical health🤸‍♀️. Regular practice will help strengthen and stabilize your back and core muscles, which enhances our ability to maintain a healthy posture when doing daily activities👩‍💻.⁠
⁠
Chaturanga can be challenging yet rewarding. Practising Chaturanga is more than just physical,💗 it’s character-building.⁠

❤️Lim Xin Hao⁣
⁣
In the beginning of Circuit Breaker period, I felt pretty lost as this has never occurred to me for the past 7 years of my career. ⁣
⁣
However, I know that I cannot stop doing sales. As a manager, I have to stay positive and show my team that it can still be done.⁣
⁣
Initially I was quite reluctant in doing video calls 👨‍💻 to communicate with clients as this is not a norm for me. With that, what I did was to first set up a teleconference with my clients. I will then proceed with a video conference via Zoom or Webex to do my presentation in details  and to clarify any further questions before sealing the deal! 🎉⁣
⁣
❤️Ivory Zhang⁣
⁣
Even though Circuit Breaker means all the retail shops are closed, there is always online shopping. As an avid shopper 🛍, I am motivated to work hard so that I can binge shop especially when it is just a click away!⁣
⁣
During this time, I’ve also learnt new platforms to help me conduct my meetings - Zoom and Webex. This allowed me to get some face to face time with my teammates where we will motivate each other and to keep ourselves going to produce the sales results we desire. 🌈",,16,1

Confinement is a period for our body to recuperate and recover from childbirth. Chinese have a 30 days confinement practice while Malays and Indians practice 40 and 44 days respectively.

Originating from the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the herbal concoction of the confinement soup focuses on promoting “Qi”, nourishes the blood, replenishes energy lost during childbirth, strengthen the joints and promote milk supply.

MuMu Mummy's 30 Days Premium Grade Confinement Herbs are selected by hand, vacuum-sealed for freshness and labelled for our ease and convenience. If you have watched my previous IGs on how to use @mumumummy.sg pre-packed herbs for soup, you'll understand how easy it is! Add herbs, add meat and Voilà!

This package has all the necessary nourishment that helps our body recuperate and re-energise over a 30-day period. Coupled with plenty of rest, your body will revert to its original condition in no time!

Stay tuned to my IG stories from next week onwards for more reviews of @mumumummy.sg prepacked confinement herbs!

.
放縱一番過後，總要面對體重秤的無情數字攻擊🙁。不吃都吃了，也沒辦法把吃下肚子的糉子拿出來啊～所以，在正餐前後請加進CM LESS的X2-S跟SHAPE，#阻脂鎖糖 同時 #燃脂排油，再配合PUF-X去除水腫！
.
另外糉子主要是由糯米製成，但是如果一次性吃下大量的糯米，胃又沒有在工作時間內把糯米完全地研磨、消化掉，可能就會直接排到腸道裏面去，引發宿便及好菌數量下跌⬇️的煩惱。所以如果你有吃比較多的糉子，請加上CLEATOX跟 #瘦瘦菌，排清 #宿便＋補回被糯米K.O.的好菌吧。
.
其實在端午前後訂單已經很多，只是端午後要亡羊補牢的孩子更多！很多人都會問大家都拿哪套產品🤔，基本上大家都是訂購Intense PLUS++配合瘦瘦菌跟PUF-X (Step 4) 的，至於單品就每件都有不少的長期用家，以上給大家參考一下喔～

Good news ! The folks @soupnco_sg has  introduce new comforting rice dishes to pair with their lovely fish soup as well as their special fusion Chee Cheong Fun in lontong (sayur lodeh) gravy!
🔻
They are:
▫️Sliced Fish Pao Fan
▫️Chee Cheong Fan Kuah Lotong
▫️Sliced Fish Soup with Rice
.
Im personally someone who nearly needs rice for every meal and I’m glad that now I can pair these delicious soups with it! Choose between the Pao Fan for a more wet, and flavorful rice since it’s soak into their fish broth or a more conventional approach with the rice being at the side as you pour your soup over!
🔻
A good option is to get the Chee Cheong Fan Kuah Lotong! This my friends, is indeed one of the best lotong style curry I tried with the curry being flavorful, lemak and the kick from the chili is just so perfectly done! On top of that, it comes with 2 huge prawns/begedil and a boil egg! Highly recommended!👍🏽

For Sophie, its a transition from being an only child to having to share her physical and emotional space with a tiny and demanding being. 

This is why I try to read together with her about having a new baby in the house. I feel it is a great way to help her gradually understand what's going to happen when C is born and what changes she can expect.

Thankfully, paying through @Atome.sg helps me to regulate my expenses by spreading out my payments over three 0% interest instalment plans so I don't have to pay a huge sum upfront every month! Shopping now and paying later with 0% interest instalment doesn’t get any better than this 😉

Here’s how 2 winners can stand a chance to win $50 shopping vouchers from @atome.sg, which can be used at any of their merchants like @shoplovet and more!! All you have to do is just:

1. Follow @Atome.SG and me
2. Like this post
3. Comment below what you’d buy using the vouchers 😉

So cooking dumplings is a good choice. Then I had the idea of showcasing the 4 games I have been playing very often now with the kids. Monopoly Junior, Donkey, Old Maid and Five Stones! Sorry that my five stones looked super bloated because I was so engrossed in painting that i overcooked them. 🤣🤣🤣 Are these your childhood games too and do you remember how to play them? Well, guess what. I don’t know why but I’m always losing in the card games and Monopoly Junior. 😓 Even the kids concluded “Gugu is not good at playing cards.” 🤣🤣🤣 So, adults please do not think that with your playing experience, you will definitely beat the kids. 🤪 Happy Thursday! The week is ending soon! 😍

May be an image of 1 person.","“Because of the virus, my trip to the Caribbean and a road trip around the US were halted. I’ve managed to keep my travel itch at bay by watching travel-inspired Netflix shows. I recently also bought a jigsaw puzzle for the family just so we have something to do offline.

Once the circuit breaker is lifted, the first order of things is to reunite with my boyfriend in Hawaii. Thereafter, I’m looking forward to embarking on my very first van life journey – living out of a van travelling slow, whilst exploring the National Parks in the US.

I decided to become a full-time travel blogger because there was nothing that fuelled me more than working on something I believed in. Rather than working to appease people and slogging hard for someone else's dream, I wanted to make my own dreams a reality.

Travelling, to me, is a process of self-discovery. The most important lessons all came from learning more about myself through travelling. It has made me more humble, patient, open-minded, resilient, confident and easy-going.

Being able to meet people from different walks of life – be it a skydiver, plastic surgeon, pilot, mountaineer or surfer – I’ve learnt to see life through different sets of eyes and cultures. That has taught me to be more proactive in life.

Time will pass you by before you know it. So now, I’ve learnt to weigh my decisions according to whether I’d regret something if I didn’t do it here and now. Seize the day – carpe diem – because so many opportunities only come once in your lifetime!

Coming from a city like Singapore, I found myself falling in love with the simplicity of a rural town when I lived in Fox Glacier in New Zealand. I never thought I’d be able to survive having no car – and with the supermarket being a three-hour drive away – but hey, I did!

I had some crazy adventures in New Zealand that I’d never get to do here, like gliding, skinny dipping, overnight hikes and helicopter rides to the summit of a glacier. Immersing myself so fully in these incredible, rare landscapes is something I’ll cherish forever...",,63,10

Bad posture can lead to weakened core muscles, tendons, and ligaments, which can cause overall body deconditioning and even weight gain.⁣

The stay-home situation might have done a number on our fitness levels, but keeping your muscles strong can be as simple as sitting up straight, doing light stretches, or taking a short walk. These everyday activities can keep supportive muscles like your abdominals and back active.⁣

If you still need extra help strengthening your core muscles, the 𝐄𝐏𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐫 can effectively accelerate your progress.

⁠
Chalk time is a great time for the kids to let their creative side be released, but with some restrictions (only on the floor, not on the walls because it's easier for mummy to clean).⁠
⁠
My daughter will draw the family, or write her name. She practices what she learnt at school. It's wonderful to see how much she's learnt and how her writing has improved over time.⁠
⁠
My son is starting to draw dinosaurs and monsters. It's a great way for him to practice his fine motor skills. How to hold the chunky chalk in his hands. How to draw the shapes that he wants.⁠
⁠
At the end of the drawing session, they love the clean up the best, since they get to have some water play.⁠
⁠
Now that the kids are back in school, as much as I love the time I get to work uninterrupted, I do miss spending the day with them.⁠
⁠
What do you miss most about the Circuit Breaker period? For me, it's the time with the kids (which is also the most frustrating part of the Circuit Breaker).⁠
⁠
What would you have done differently if (when) we have the second lockdown? Would you be more prepared when the second wave happens?⁠

For something foolproof, look no further than the Original “Ban Guan”. A classic with the bits of turnip packed generously in the glossy, smooth skin; the unadulterated sweetness of the vegetable was mellow and rounded. I enjoyed the textures and the milder flavour profile; however, I haven’t tried enough soon kuehs to make a good comparison.

Dialling up the flavour with its earthiness, the Chives “Gu Cai” Soon Kueh felt a little more substantial with the accompaniment of minced meat and dried shrimps. The translucent skin was of the perfect thickness (a little chewy but ultimately soft) and perfumed lightly by the coat of aromatic oil. Each order of their soon kueh comes with chilli and sweet sauce.

Apart from their stuffed pillowy kuehs, their Yam Abacus Seeds “Suan Pan Zi” ($5) tasted homely and much stronger of the root vegetable as compared to those I have eaten in the past. Soft and a tad chewy, the dimpled beads were not too starchy or greasy. There were also pieces of tau kwa and chunks of mushroom found in the dish. If you need some spice, enhance the flavours with their blend of chili sauce, Hot Mama Chilli ($3/ bottle).

近来家里吃面包的次数变多了、不禁想起那段在北欧的日子、天天吃面包也不会腻、由其丹麥的面包种类不但非常多、连不大被亞洲人接受的sourdough Rye Bread 居然成为我的最愛！丹麥人也和法國人一樣、法國人早上买baguette , 丹麥人买Danish、真的非常好吃😋来到丹麥记得光顾被皇家认定的面包店 、只要见到店家看板上有着帶上皇冠的”Danish Kringle”(绕成结型）就是了！印象深刻的是在面包店外见停放的Baby car、好奇一看有baby在裡面睡覺💤 想起这在北欧国家是極為常見、他們认为小嬰兒愈早接触新鮮空氣愈好、特別是疾病猖獗的冬天、戶外比室內安全～ 这在亚洲国家不可能发生、会引起大骚动呀🤣.

Kemsin Kanehe amsin'.","A couple of months ago some online writing friends got together and decided to put together an anthology of #lockdownstories 

It has since morphed into them creating a small press called @birchmoonpress Go follow them and find out what they’re all about.

Anyway, I submitted a piece called Twenty-twenty Vision. Actually it had a longer title at first. But I chose that name because it seems to me that if you are paying attention this year is doing every damn thing it can to open all our eyes a little wide and help us all see more clearly.

It’s helping us see what really matters. From #blacklivesmatter to the simple fact that acquiring more things and getting more done in a day was never.the.point. 

And it’s helping us see what needs to change. Whether it’s lifestyle habits or cultural systems of hatred and greed that are destroying our planet and our souls! 

Anyway, reading back what I wrote again as they prepare to launch this Friday this quote jumped out at me. Why?

Firstly, because my inner editor wanted to changer the word order. 😂 Too late now. 

And secondly, because this is something I have always been learning. And forgetting and learning again. 

People invest all this value in things which ultimately are not that important. The little things have been the big things all along.

.
👉🏻Anderson Bridge adalah jembatan kendaraan yang membentang melintasi Singapore River. Terletak di dekat muara sungai di Area Sentral Singapura. Jembatan ini juga dinamai sesuai dengan Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner untuk  Federated Malay States, Sir John Anderson😁
.
🙌🏻Jembatan Anderson dibangun antara tahun 1908 dan 1910, sebagai perusahaan patungan antara pemerintah kolonial dan pemerintah kota setelah reklamasi tepi selatan Sungai Singapura. Tahu nggak sih, selama Pendudukan Jepang di Singapura (1942–1945), kepala penjahat yang terpenggal digantung di Jembatan Anderson lho, sebagai peringatan untuk mencegah warga negara dari melanggar hukum. Hiiiy! 👻👻
.
🌟Jembatan yang dikukuhkan menjadi monumen nasional ini terletak di dekat The Fullerton Hotel dan bagian dari sirkuit di Grand Prix Singapura, yang pertama kali debut pada 28 September 2008✅
.
👉🏻Ada yang pernah lewat sini?😁😜
