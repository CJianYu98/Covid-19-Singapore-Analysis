May be an image of text that says '@NO23COLLECTIVE No. 23 COLLECTIV Why do you need a Social Media Manager? TYPE SOMTHING No. 23 COLLECTIVE'.,"You must be wondering... DO I NEED A SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER (SMM) FOR MY BUSINESS? 🤔 ⁠
⁠
With everything shifting online, having a good social media presence for your business is more important now than ever. Here's why you need a Social Media Manager:⁠
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁠⁣⁠
⚡ It can save you time⁣⁠: ⁣⁠
Running a business isn't easy! When you have a million other tasks to do, having a Social Media Manager can help you take all those time-consuming tasks off of your plate, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your business.⁠
⁠
⁣⁣⚡ Boost Engagement:⁠
A SMM will create content that is meaningful and relevant to your audience. When your brand is well represented, you will definitely generate new leads.⁠
⁣⁣⁣⁠
⁣⁣⚡ Let’s you focus on the bigger things: ⁣⁠
It is okay to not enjoy every aspect of owning a business. You might want to concentrate on the bigger things and really dislike completing the mundane, day to day stuff like coming up with creative captions and captivating content for your social media platforms. A social media manager is generally very well versed in this particular type of task and can definitely take that off your hands and enjoy doing it! ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁠⁣⁠
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁠⁣⁠
You love your business, you really do. ⁠Why not give it the proper social media presence it deserves?⁠ Send us a DM @no23collective to schedule an intro call and let us know what you need!⁣﻿⠀⁣⠀⠀⁠

25,,2430682447709574206,2020-10-29 14:18:27,familytrippers,,"Meet Dr Izz and the experiment he did today. 

Today was Izz’s last day of school with @playdatesg PD Adventurers programme. I still remember how a year ago, I struggled with the decision on whether to enrol him for this programme because it will mean having to inconvenient my dad to fetch him from school 3 days a week. 

We went ahead with the plan and for close to 3 months, dad dutifully fetched him from school.  In March, we ended up having to serve LOA, and Izz attended school for a few days only before #circuitbreakerSG happened.

When Izz’s school reopened in June, hubby and I took turns to send and fetch him from school and we no longer had to activate my dad. Amazing how things worked out by themselves and my biggest worry about having to inconvenient him became irrelevant, masya-Allah. 

Amidst all that, Izz has had such precious learning moments with @playdatesg , like this video of him here (even his brothers are curious about the experiment and are asking to try this at home!), I have no regrets signing him up for the programme. Here’s wishing @playdatesg all the best in the next phase of their journey and we can’t wait to see them make a comeback, much stronger and better than before! ❤️

Earlier this year and during circuit breaker, we were connecting and sharing how we navigated our own versions of lockdown.

About Sutajio:  It actually means studio in Japanese and they aim to design and produce well made lifestyle products.  It started with @juuyeow a self employed emcee/host who lost all event work due to Covid-19.  She started crafting and selling items to get by.   
  
Danli, is a producer who wears many hats and has experience in the fashion and creative field.  She brought the brand their first 20 customers!

I love the weather today! It’s cooling and pleasant. Perfect weather for some intensive branded toast art! Branded toast art is always exciting and satisfying because there is no room to undo/erase or wipe away mistakes. This time, I decided to increase the difficulty level and challenge myself to painting the Burberry logo. 😅 There are many confusing details in this logo (which I only noticed when I started painting) and I hope I got them right. 🤣 I think the end results look quite cool and perfect for a mid-week brunch! 🥰🥰🥰😎😎😎

.
1- Gum disease is not that common
.
On the contrary, gum disease is extremely common. .
2- don't have cavities so I can't have gum disease
.
Cavity-free doesn’t ensure you are in the clear where gum disease is concerned.
.
3- Having gum disease means I will lose my teeth
.
Not so! You don’t have to lose any of your teeth to gum disease if you practice good oral hygiene.
.
4- Bleeding gums during pregnancy is normal
.
While it’s true that some women develop a condition known as “pregnancy gingivitis,” it’s not true that everyone experiences this.
.
5- Bad breath can be an indicator of gum disease
.
Persistent bad breath or a bad taste in your mouth can be an indicator of gum disease and other oral diseases so it is important that you uncover what’s causing the problem.
.
6- I have diabetes and therefore I will also have gum disease.
.
If you have diabetes, you are at greater risk of developing some oral health problems, including gum disease, but it can be controlled so it's important that you are extra diligent with your oral health.

My youngest, who is 7, couldn’t have picked up cycling at a better time, joining us on exploratory rides around Singapore’s park connectors - his record being a 17km ride around the Marina Bay Area! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Many a times, I catch myself stopping along the way to marvel at the simple things I used to take for granted, such as the sunset, the glistening on the water and the breeze on my face.

Hope the change in pace and lifestyle has brought some unexpected joys in your life too?

It was strange presenting a set on stage without an audience but glad to be able to play. And it was an honour to play for my alma mater!

I wrote this tune Circuit Breaker Blues, during Singapore’s #stayhome period earlier this year, presenting it first time with the band. A simple #blues tune that  speaks a little about our #lindyhoppers condition of not being able to #partnerdance but focusing on #solojazz movement instead.

(Not sure if the fall off the log constitutes a kickass rhythmic break step 😅)

Looking forward to being able to play live again at some point

Today is an extremely sunny day! So it has been a while since my last Foodart and I decided to make something nice like my kind of “fastfood” experience? My set consist of baked luncheon meat prata skin “French fries” (inspired by KFC fries) and home baked Lemon butter cake, cheese and egg “cakewich” (inspired by Starbucks panwich). Then I got ambitious and painted the KFC uncle and Starbucks mermaid. I haven’t been painting for a while too and really enjoyed this little chocolate art! 🥰 Pleasantly surprised that I completed all in time for a nice lunch! Happy lunch! Oh the new Starbucks limited edition instant Toffee Nut Latte is amazing! Love it!!!🤩🤩🤩

Interesting fact: Do you know that coffee was discovered by a goat herder?
It was said that coffee was discovered by a goat herder in Ethiopia in the 1500s. He saw his goats eating coffee cherries. Afterwards, he observed a change in their behavior; they gained a high amount of energy and they didn’t sleep at night.  The herder shared his findings with local monks. After they made their own drink from coffee beans, they realized they could stay up all night and pray. Word spread to other Ethiopian monks and soon after reached all across the civilized world.",Singapore,35,1

話說三个月前 友人成功申請了尚在开犮中的新加坡西部Tengah区的新組屋、沒想到下个月要选單位和楼层！
有这么快😲⁉️ 于是今早來到了Toa Payoh的HDB Hub來看看新組屋的模型～ .
.
Tengah 是新加坡政府打造的第一個全新的Forest Town, 其建设也将与周围的森林环境融为一体、Tengah也将被打造为智能市镇，如采用太陽能發電、智能照明系统与雨水采集系统节省水电，每个单位都将装置智能配电板和插座、以及提供智能家居设备、也是全岛第一個可以集中提供中央冷氣的组屋区、比传統的空调系統更节能源～ 另外也是首个“无车”市镇中心、釆用多层设计实现“人在地上走，汽车地下行”的概念，让居民能自在地步行或骑脚踏车穿行～
.
相當令人期待的綠化新镇呀！這庞大的工程予計2050年完成😳.

⁠⠀
What started as a slight sore throat grew into body and headaches, so I went to the neighbourhood clinic to get some lozenges 🤭 Answering 'YES' to the question 'do you have a temperature >37.9', running nose, sore throat, headache or nausea"" was already strange, then the doctor told me it was MANDATORY that I go to the National Centre for Infectious Disease (NCID) for a swab test due to my symptoms 🏥⁠⠀
⁠⠀
I went to the NCID straight away and was assigned a seat. The doctors came over with laptops and machines on wheels (which they call 'cows' 🐄🛹😝) and asked me a lot of health questions to assess which tests I had to take, including a neurological test and x-ray ☠️⁠⠀
⁠⠀
And of course, the swab test.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
The swab is actually three parts: The long cotton swabs are poked down your throat and two nostrils 👃🏼 It's like having a pap smear done on your nose: Intrusive and very uncomfortable.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
The nurses had a cardboard basin on standby, as the throat swab hits your gag reflex 🤢 Thankfully, I didn't vomit but it made me tear and coughed very hard for a while. The good news? My activated runny nose made the nose swab less painful 😅⁠⠀
⁠⠀
👨🏽‍⚕️🩺👩🏻‍⚕️ Really, salute to the doctors, nurses and cleaners who keep us safe. Whilst COVID-19 can feel more distant for some of us, it is their reality every single day.⁠⠀
⁠⠀
So please, continue all the advisories of wearing your mask, not touching your face, sanitising and staying home when you can 😷⁠⠀
⁠⠀
Do you know anyone who has done the swab test? Tag them here so we can exchange swab stories! ⁠🙊",NCID National Centre for Infectional Diseases,44,26

Life’s unexpected moments... back to when it was late May, my mum told me on Monday night that our almost 18.5yo dear fam doggo, @happieharrie was not feeling too good. I had a video call with him that night and he seemed alright. He even smiled at me. On the very next day - Tuesday, I was prepping ingredients for plans to cook mala hotpot for Wednesday’s dinner. Not too long later, I received news from my family that I would have to go back to bid farewell to Harrie boy as he was critically ill. I remember being very upset and threw these ingredients in the freezer in a frenzied and flustered flurry, along with keeping my sourdough starter in the fridge before we left. 

Two weeks after his passing, only then did I have the courage to look at these frozen ingredients (luckily, did not spoil 🤭) to start cooking and complete this dish. I am so glad I did as my family, especially my mum, enjoyed this homemade mala dish. 🥰🌶🥘🍛 Best part of this is adding as many ingredients and spice in the mix as you wish to. My sinful favs r absolutely tons of Taiwanese/Oriental sausage 🌭, luncheon meat 🥩, potato 🥔, enoki and shiitake mushrooms 🍄, along with the wonderfully textured beancurd skin and black fungus. Adding lotus root 🍠 will not hurt either. 🤤😋 It simply adds flavour to the pot of life. Appreciate the goodness that is present in your life. The present is a present 🎁 in all sense of the word. 

Taste note: to reduce sugar level for the next round as the HDL seasoning does not seem to be as intensely salty as before.

昨天有事和老爷下城 
终于带了很阿宅的老爷来享用琥珀天丼
个人认为这家的天丼 可以㜩美在东京吃过的天丼
老爷有給👍 但他说心中认为好吃的天丼
依然是沖縄的 “海鲜食堂 太陽 ティーダ “ 🤣
今年无法出游 阿宅老爷 就请你將就一下啦～
顺便到附近的滨海湾酒店 看看新开幕不久 
苹果首家水上Apple Store~ 进入需要予约 无法Walk-in
只好到外面拍照 📷 看起来就像是漂浮在水面上的一个球体
白天 其周身的玻璃面板 反射着天空和周遭的景观
晚上 球体像个灯笼 下方会点亮呈现不同层次的颜色
下次要予约好才再访～.

友人送来的自家制 渔家娘惹沙爹酱、老爷因痛风 目前无法吃海鮮、就用在平日煮的食材里～做了Satay Chicken Pizza🍕 搭配了紅䓤、青椒、黃梨、芝士、雞胸肉
把沙爹醬混合 Peanut butter 凃一层在pizza 皮上方
剩下的混合雞胸肉 把食材都放在Pizza后  240度放进烤箱 8-10分鐘 即可！這Satay Chicken Pizza 真的很可以👍 芝士多少会把辣酸味中和 然而辣度变得剛好适合我們的味蕾 老爷大赞！👏👏.
.
晩餐弄了 印尼式的溫蔬菜沙拉 Gado Gado 🥗
可以把沙爹酱 混合Peanut butter + 花生碎+蜜糖 等
做為酱汁～ 昨天的晚餐試做了❗️調过的酱汁变得浓稠 伴蔬菜享用～ 真的很不錯👍 花生碎的口感和Peanut butter 把甜味提升 對不大吃辣的我们来說 味道恰好 😋 意外的这沙爹醬 沾虾餅吃也很搭 👍 .

 [Giveaway 🥳 If you realized you are mad about bananas but have only tried Banana cake so far, here's what you're probably looking for ✨]
•
@madaboutbananas are your-not-so-ordinary artisanal banana products 😉 — It was my first time trying a banana pudding and it was silky smooth and an addictive combi (anything w biscoff is my fav) altho a tad sweet! 🤤Also, choose from interesting toppings for your original Banana loaf if you like, including Reese peanut butter cup/walnut/chocochip/butterscotch! Texture wise, it was light and moist to enjoy!! 😋👍🏻
•
Featuring 📸:
🍌🍞Banana Loaf ($20) + Additional Topping ($4)
🍌🍮Biscoff Banana Pudding 16oz ($15)
•
In collaboration with Mad About Bananas, we are giving away a set of pudding & loaf (worth $39) of your choice to 1 lucky follower! 🎉 
All you have to do is:
1) Follow @thehungertrack & @madaboutbananas
2) Tell us in one sentence why you want to win & tag 3 friends (increase your chances by tagging more friends!)

前天友人送来了 Homemade 的渔家娘惹沙爹酱 叫我试试～ 平日家里很少用沙爹酱 打开瓶子 尝了一口醤汁...唉？这味道 😮 ... 比較接近紅亞參咖哩 卻有著酸辣和㣲甜的滋味 
搭配海鮮料理最对味！比如 鱼、虾、苏东、虾婆、啦啦 等但是我家老爷因痛风 目前无法吃海鮮 ...😭 要做什麼好呢？
這味道也让我想起在马来西亚 常吃的Ikan Bilis Bun ～
好久沒吃了 不如动手做看看～ 
用这沙爹醬 取代Sambal 于马铃薯、红葱、小魚乾和糖
快炒一遍 做为馅料 ～ 尝一口...這醬汁配马鈴薯好搭喔 😋 
面包 烤出來後 請老爷試吃一口....👍👍👏👏 😋
味道真的很好 虽然不是用Sambal 但真的很可以👌
下次要再做Ikan Bilis Bun ❣️.

大家 生活愉快！平安幸福 🙏.

What are your rewards in life? 
It’s TGIF and pancake Art day again! Missing Japan travelling and a mascot that has always been on my mind is Donpen from Don Quijote! I miss spending long time browsing at the store in the wee hours before returning to hotel. In fact, hubby always say: the location can’t be too bad if there is a Donki in the area. 🤣 I’m glad that there are Don Don Donki stores in Singapore now which I can patronize to fix my Japan food cravings though nothing is comparable to the mega stores in Japan! 🤩 Anyway, adding a few shots of me being featured on the opening day of the first Don Don Donki in Singapore! Can you spot me?! 🤪🤪🤪 Looking forward to the weekend!!! 
🌈Mac X Donpen🌈ingredients: 
Sausage McMuffin with egg, hotcake, harshbrown, raspberries, blueberries.
Paired with Starbucks instant caramel latte.

It’s been awhile since we last posted *apologies for the radio silence*. I haven’t been cooking as often as I would’ve liked to lately because sometimes it takes a lot out of me emotionally. This happens every once in awhile especially so when I miss my dad a lot. Sometimes, though, that’s the exact thing that brings me back into the kitchen, which brings me to this dish I made a couple of weeks ago.
.
.
.
My dad used to take my family to this Hakka style Yong Tau Foo (Niang Tou Fu) stall along Upper Thompson Rd. We’d never go without him because it’s a bit of a drive from our house. I try to do a little something in the kitchen on the 9th every month to honour him and I thought what better way than to try making it at home for @nikvoon and my mum for dinner. 
.
.
.
The yong tau foo items are pretty standard finds, but the key thing about this Hakka version is the sauce made with Taucheo (which I’ve developed quite an affinity for as of late) - a delicate balance between subtle sweetness that amplifies the natural saltiness of the Taucheo. Suffice to say it was a slam dunk this first attempt. Definitely doing this more often.

I want to rave about my favourite brand of shoes!! @anothersolegirl is a local shoe brand that sells these incredibly comfortable and stylish leather shoes for women. I bought my first pair when I saw them at a pop up store many many years ago. I now own 6 pairs and wear them in rotation everywhere - office, brunch, shopping, travel.

All of their shoes are made of soft, buttery premium leather and comes with a breathable, sports footbed that gives superb ergonomic support. To add on to that, their designs are stylish and timeless. This is really comfort without having to compromise on style. I am over the moon excited to work with them to bring you this giveaway and an exclusive $10 storewide promo code!

And may everyone has more shiny days than dull ones this week! 
It has been a while since my “branded toast” series so I decided to do a COACH themed toast today by drawing the horse carriage logo on my bread. It could have been better if the pot from my kitchen cabinet didn’t fall and caused a dent to the bread. Blessing is: I’m not hurt and I could still touch up on the logo. 😆 I think it look quite ok overall! Oh I also created some cookies sides to complement the toast. Fine afternoon weather now and hope it continues to stay cooling. Happy Mid-week! 🌈🌈🌈 
🐴COACH Toast🐴 ingredients: 
Bread, butter, fried egg, ham, cheese, Jenny’s cookies, Tim Tam, Bourbon choco & coffee biscuits, raspberries, corn.

好久没做Pisang Goreng了～ 🍌
一炸好立即被家里的老🐵 吃光了 😂.
有一段時間沒有买Avocado
因為價格贵 前天在NTUC见到Mexico产的Avocado
價格合理 便买了 沒想到第二天就很快变色
今天已經軟了 趕快打成smoothies 
加了點Lemonade汽泡水和煉奶 还不错 👍
每次见到Avocado 就会想起
家乡的Avocado Milk Shake 和Avocado的季節 
目前家乡又因疫情再次進入封鎖狀態 ....
希望疫情早日結束 恢復日常 🙏

那个向来不太要吃苦瓜的老爷
煮了这道苦瓜焖鸡肉 加老干妈黑豆豉

有时候不知要煮什么 把食材放上去煎烤就行了

These days, it’s important to pay attention to hygiene. Frequent hand washing or use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers can strip off the natural layer of oil, resulting in rough, cracked and dry skin!

The solution? Hand creams and lotions! We know the unpleasant feeling of slathering on a thick, greasy layer on the skin 😫. Try our lightweight lotions today, which are specially formulated to hydrate without leaving residue on the skin. Perfect for our hot and humid climate!

From the nursing schedule to the changing of diapers to the bathing, dealing with regurgitation, even labeling of milk bags etc, Aunty Xueling emptied her bag of motherhood tips and tricks to make me less of a noob. I’ve adopted some of her good habits and am still using them till date. 

I’m so glad that our paths crossed through @pemconfinementnanny and I can’t recommend her enough. Aunty Xueling was truly the calm to my nerves back then. I still can recall (very vividly 😆!) myself screaming “Auntyyyyy!!!” when bb Gen merlion-ed her entire milk intake for the first time and we froze, not knowing what’s happening or what to do. 😅

If there is just one tip to share, it is to shadow your nanny in the final week of the confinement period and try everything yourself while she watches over you. We did this and definitely felt more equipped caring for bb Gen afterwards.

This week I’m working from home again! So it’s back to Foodart and I need to finish the leftover sliced bread. So I gathered many ingredients to make eating almost expiring bread a more enjoyable experience. 🥰 Love the Happy straw because it makes the whole Foodart happier! 🤩 Happy Monday, Happy Week everyone! 😄
😋Pretty Toast Ingredients😋: 
Japanese butter spread, ham, sliced cheese, green tea milk spread, peanut butter, nutella, scrambled eggs.

May be an image of 1 person and standing.","Been wanting to talk about this for a while but never found the chance so... since today marked my 100th @webarre class, I guess today is as good as any!

If you follow my stories these days, you would see that I post about fitness A LOT. The truth is - I’m actually very new to this fitness community and I’m actually amazed at how much my life has changed in the last 10 months.

I went for my very first studio class on 24th December 2019. I remember going alone to a Meltdown class at Haus and looking very out of place in my free running tee shirt and FBT shorts (whilst everyone was in their nice activewear 🤣) and finding the class ridiculously hard.

You see, fitness has always been an “on-off” part of my life, partly due to circumstance and partly due to a short attention span. I was in dance all my life (from age 3 all the way to university) but stopped dancing when I started working in London. I picked up gymming because we had a beautiful gym in our office in Canary Wharf but stopped when I injured myself flying off a treadmill (yes, I did, I went down in history in CC london for this embarrassing incident). I didn’t pick up fitness again until late 2017 when I became obsessed with running for 4 months (which resulted in 8 races completed, 2 of which were half marathons!) but then stopped soon after because work got hectic and wedding planning came into the picture. Before I knew it, two years had flown by and my trainers were just collecting dust at home.

Something “clicked” during my studio class on 24th December 2019 though. I had just resigned from my private practice job and was about to embark on a 9-week funemployment break before my new job starts in March. Most people take funemployment as a chance to travel the world but I was determined to “do something that is good for me”, especially after 2 years of long hours, stressful days and neglecting my physical and mental health. Despite my very “fish-out-of-water” first class, I loved it and subsequently booked my next class on 28th December (spin at Absolute!) and my third class on 3 January (barre at Webarre!). I was hooked and the rest was history.

Add to your Skin Care essentials, RUBY-CELL INTENSIVE 4U MIST.

A portable mist with moisturizing and astringent effect. What's with the Astringent?

If you have oily skin that's prone to breakouts, you might add an astringent to your daily skin care routine. Astringents may help cleanse skin, tighten pores and dry out oil. 
Source: healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/astringent

Why Ruby-Cell Mist has ASTRINGENT Benefits? It's because, it contains Portulaca Oleracea Extract or Purslane.

SKIN CARE BENEFITS: Purslane owes its anti-aging properties to Vitamin C, copper, and manganese, powerful antioxidants that stimulate the production of Collagen. Collagen is the ultimate anti-wrinkle remedy that prevents premature graying.

Source: organyc.net/2018/09/why-purslane-is-a-hero-ingredient-for-women-with-sensitive-skin/

So, are you still not convince? RUBY-CELL INTENSIVE 4U MIST is a sure Skin Care MUST-HAVE!

 “I will let nothing stand in my way!” 
The SBSA077 Blue Jade Edition displays the most iconic female character from the video game - Chun Li. It exudes much details from the dial and bezel work that recalls her outfit since 1991, to the leather strap with ornate dragon motif on the backing of the strap. Simply a singular watch that encapsulates the power of Chun Li

和老爷聊到年末、本应今年未将在沖縄渡过 
奈何今年因疫情无法成行 谈话中聊到2年前在东京跨年
突然”那甜味的蛋卷 新加坡有卖吗？” 
他说的甜蛋卷是伊達巻き(Date-Maki) 
日本正月的御節料理中不可缺的伊達巻き
年未时期各大超市都可以买到 給老爷吃後
他立即喜歡上了这帶甜味的蛋卷
在日本是用ハンペン(日式魚饼)比較不Fishy
但是附近的Donki 沒卖 只好用魚漿代替
加入鸡蛋、味醂、料理酒、砂糖 用攪拌器打均後
用小火慢慢煎 用竹簾巻起 冷藏4小時定型  伊達卷就完成✅
老爷吃一口👍 “但是有一點Fishy “ 🤣  味道还是可以的～
在Donki 买了Kinki 魚的一夜干、很好味😋 
也买了北海道的𩸽鱼(Hokke Fish) 期待中～.

㊗️大家 周末愉快 平安幸福！.

Salmon Mentai Don $12.90 
Beef Sliced Don $14.90
Charcoal Chicken Bao $3.30 

Love the minimalistic and chic interior, went on a slow Monday and this cafe/ restaurant was already bustling with hungry patrons by 1pm! 

What’s Bao Makers without their Baos right???? Taking normal baos up a notch, their perfectly crisp charcoaled chicken with their specialty sauce complemented the sesame bun perfectly. Soft and tender with the crisp from the chicken. Mmmmm. 

Salmon Mentai was generous with their mentaiko sauce and was so filling ! Super yummy from this “small bowl” and definitely filled me up for the rest of the day.

Facebook 的回忆顯示 5年前的今天在紐約🗽 犹记当时本应在6月出发、奈何四月动了大手术、延迟至10月才出犮前往纽约. 突然想起了这本在纽约图书馆附属的书店内购买的panorama pops、还有影片中的cubebot, 拿出来玩玩和翻阅...居遊的三星期 分别住宿在华尔街、Chelsea和Upper East, 不赶景点 漫遊纽约 留下了不少美好的回忆❣️

这系列的panorama pops 也有其他国家版本、如日本、法国、英国、香港澳门、澳洲等、价格约美金$10左右、是件很不錯 滿值得收藏的纪念品、相当推荐👍.

㊗️大家 工作愉快 平安幸福！.

Well i should just give myself a try.
Ordered no sugar add no creamer tea. (in fact i cant rmb what have i chosen)

Masking Day 1 of Day 13
🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
I love Mary Kay masks but today I will share One of my favourite masks (or should I say multi-masks) that I love doing because of the many benefits it provides — which is our detox specialists, the Mary Kay Clearproof Charcoal Mask+Botanical Effects F2 mask!!

🖤This Clearproof Charcoal Mask known as the ""purifying magnet"" can help deep clean the skin, thoroughly detoxify, greatly enhance the health resistance. You’ll love how the mask soaks up excess oil to deliver a smooth, matte appearance.
 .
🤍 This Botanical Effects F2 (for normal skin formula) mask deep cleanses as it gently exfoliates and restores radiance. Adapts to your skin's needs, leaving it looking healthier & feeling nourished. Normal skin is treated to the antioxidant powers of frangipani flower and water lily. Formulated without synthetic dyes or added fragrance. Simple skin care suitable for even the most sensitive skin.
.
Above all the benefits, most importantly, I get to share this masking time with boy. I help him do the charcoal mask once a month. So why not? 🥰
.
💓I am mailing out 20 samples  of charcoal mask 
Pm me if you want to try

.
.
.
On 7 April 2020, Singapore started its lock down (we call it circuit breaker, aka CB). There was restrictions on movement and also social activities. Even though Singaporeans are permitted to run outside, I still try to minimise running outdoors. I started to do more indoor workouts. During this period of time, I also started to jump rope.
.
.
.
The fact is, I am not unfamiliar with jumping rope. I used to jump rope every now and then. I love the fact that it is a good cardio exercise that makes me really sweat. The first video here is taken in 7 Jan 2020. Notice my poor form with my arms outstretched and my high knees when doing ""double unders”.
.
.
.
On 18 April 2020, I decided that I want to pick up jumping rope seriously. Since then, every single day, I make it a point to jump rope. The second video here is taken on 25 April 2020, one week after the start of my jump rope journey.
.
.
.
Fast forward to now (6 months later), I am still jumping rope daily. I’ve picked up a lot more tricks, and my form and speed has improved. The jump rope community on Instagram is amazing and I’ve certainly learnt a lot from many talented individuals in the community. The third video here is taken on 5 Oct 2020. Don’t think I will be stopping this amazing exercise soon! 💪🏻 Glad that I found a new passion 😁",Singapore,11,3

Some popular items include:
🍝 Tom Yum Salted Egg Pasta w Chicken Cutlet
🐟 Fish & Chips w Alscampi Sauce
🍗 Salted Egg Popcorn Chicken
🍟 Bolognese Cheese Fries
🌈 Rainbow Fantasy Cake w Ice Cream

The pasta came piquant and tantalizing with a good combination of savoury and spicy elements, derived from salted egg and tom yum. The mussels and prawns were fresh while the chicken was crispy, pairing well with the accompanying creamy sauce.

The fish & chips was interesting with the dipping of the alscampi sauce, which comes with mussels and prawns 🦐 The fish was fried to perfection, very enjoyable overall.

Do also order their salted egg popcorn chicken or the bolognese fries, both having pretty generous portions. It is simply addictive and scrumptious, perfect for sharing with friends or family 😋

Round up your meal with the Rainbow Fantasy Cake w Ice-Cream, a dessert filled with many colours, including the crispy flakes, decadent rainbow cake filled with luscious cream within, and the accompanying 3 scoops of ice-cream for maximum indulgence 🍨

Elliana Patel is 12 years-old and attends UWC East.  She has always been interested in social justice issues, particularly around gender and racial inequality.  Elliana is a pretty spectacular child for a few reasons but here are some of her accomplishments:

#AmbassadorForADay
Last year, she won the Expat Living’s ’Ambassador for a Day’ contest where she was one of the girls chosen to spend a day with a female ambassador in Singapore and was featured by both, Expat Living and the U.S. Embassy, Singapore.

#SlimeTime at 10!
When Elliana was just 10 years old - she launched her business “SlimeTime by Elliana” where she was a party entertainer making slime at children’s birthday parties. She observed keenly as to what the kids enjoyed and made efforts to improve her business and made her first earnings as well.

#CommunityService
Elliana’s family strongly believes in giving back. “As a family activity, we volunteer together at Willing Hearts. We also try and build in a service component on our holidays. On our last vacation to Turkey, we worked with a local NGO delivering meals to Syrian refugees in Istanbul,” adds the enterprising tween.

#ClimbEveryMountain
Elliana thought of a unique way of adding adventure and staying fit during over circuit breaker. Her entire family committed to climb to the height of Mt Everest (8,848m) using their condo’s stairwell!  Elliana ’summited’ under 30 days by climbing 28 floors 89 times! Stay at home certainly was dynamic for this family.

Thank you @nehafpatel for sharing this with us.

If you know of any kids with an inspiring story or a special talent, please email us at info@growbeyondsg.com.

A: Pomfret fish is the most sought after fish in Southeast Asia! Its white flesh is delicate and soft, PLUS it doesn't have a super ""fishy"" flavour.

——————————————————————
#SGGIGexclusivegiveaways
.
Most 3-ply / 4-ply face masks on the market are very hard to breathe in, which is why most people tend to opt for 2-ply instead. But for protection against airborne viruses, 3-ply / 4-ply masks are still more effective with their in-built filtration layer 😷 With @zilingzzl’s 4-ply reusable Satin Masks, you get the best of both worlds! 

The 4-ply mask from @zilingzzl has a Satin Silk outermost layer that helps repel water, 2 layers of anti-microbial filters and a soft & breathable dri-fit innermost layer for absorbing moisture. There are also adjustable & elastic ear loops and built-in adjustable nose wire. And the best part of all? It is superrrr comfortable to wear and superbly breathable, especially for a 4-ply face mask! 😍

She also has a wide selection of colors and sizes available (S, M, L)! For Satin Silk, she has Black, White, Navy, Rose Pink, Lavender (the one I’m wearing), Dark gold, Mint green, Lilac, Silver, Bronze and Wine red. For Cotton, she has Kaki, White, Black, Navy, Dusty pink and Cream. 
Btw, apart from Satin Silk and Cotton, @zilingzzl also sells Tweed and Lace face masks as well as a wide range of scrunchies.

#SGGIGexclusivegiveaways
.
Do you remember our previous @geekgirlsociety Silk Mask giveaway? Today, we’re collaborating with them again✌🏼This time, we’re giving away both their new & improved Mulberry Silk Face Mask and their new product line, the Silk Scrunchies.

@geekgirlsociety's silk masks are made from 2 layers of 100% mulberry silk and are hypoallergenic. Their masks now come with nose clip, and there are also stretchable & adjustable ear loops and a side slot for filter (P.S. they include a complimentary PM2.5 filter with every order too) What’s more, their masks are superbly soft, lightweight and comfortable to wear 👍🏼 Right now, they carry this silk mask in 5 colors: Autumn Bronze, Taro Lilac (new), Royal Blue (new), Rose Pink and Pearl White.

Apart from masks, they also sell matching silk scrunchies — a perfect addition to my hair accessories collection. Scrunchies made from pure mulberry silk are gentle to the hair and help protect your hair by reducing friction. This, in turn, reduces pulling, tugging and hair damage. @geekgirlsociety’s Silk Scunchies come in 2 sizes (Slim and Medium) and 5 colors (Lilac, Beige, Rose, White & Blue).

Well, finally im in my 70s, yes, there's alot of ups and downs during the process but i keep my mindset strong. My mindset is stronger than before as ive tasted the small acheivement and now im craving for more better results. 

Its true, you wont always be motivated, there are days you feel like giving up, do not stop, just take a short break and be present, remind yourself why you started in the 1st place. 

In the beginning, i was ""oh man i need to lose 45 kg in order to achieve my ideal weight? That's alot"" Yet here i am, lost 20 kg and 25 kg more to go! 
Ill try my very best to get my ideal weight by the end of year. 

Most of my pants doesnt fit me anymore and i have to pin them / sew them (anyhow) 😅. Basically my waist is getting smaller but my hips ... not so much! I know what i have to do. 

How about you? 

I am thankful for my team, having coachee under me is a motivation, seeing them putting in so much effort and wanting the best, makes me motivated to do better to be a great example for them 🥰 

Are you interested to get the same results? Let's go thru this journey with me 😍

Tag your buddy!

The connection is simple. And someone is waiting for you. Smiling. 🌻Happiness is McDonalds breakfast and pancake drawing on a Friday! 😍 Spent some time bonding with my 2-year old younger nephew yesterday and he’s no longer a baby though I always struggle to understand his baby language. 🤣 So, yesterday he was trying to ask me to draw “...bus” for him. Yet he frowned when I drew a bus.. then he started singing..PJ Masks~~~ PJ Masks~~~ 🤣🤣🤣 He was so happy when I drew his PJ Masks! So today 姑姑 draw another PJ Masks for you again! ❤️I think most mummies with boys are familiar with PJ Masks. 🤪Quite cute little Superheroes and I finally realised their differences today (apart from the colours). 😅  TGIF and hope we all have positive superheroes power like PJ Masks to carry over the weekend! 💪💪💪🌻🌻🌻

Queenstownは都会に近いけど、その辺りのHDBは古くて、お年寄りが住む古い町と認識されてますが、ここ近年では古いHDBが順次建て直しされ、Condoも多く立ち、IKEA、ホテルやモールなどオープンされ、また近代的で洒落た新しいコンセプトのHDB景観も加わりました〜その代表がSky Terrace@DawsonとSky Ville@Dowson👍 チャイナタウンのThe Pinnacle@Duxtonと同じくスカイガーデンがある団地です❗️写真はSky Ville@Dawson, Sky Terrace@Dawsonのすぐ隣り、建物はチャイナタウンのThe Pinnacle@Duxtonと似たような同じ設計でした❗️ちなみどちらも屋上は共有のテラスで、住民でなくても出入り自由❣️特にSkyVille@Dawsonの屋上は見晴らしが良くてお勧めです〜.
.
この辺りにまだ沢山の英植民時代Black & White Houses(プール付き)が有るとは 凄いですね〜もちろん値段も普通のHDBより高い、丁度5年MOP(Minimum Occupation Period) 満期で転売許可、property guruでSkyVilleの転売価格を見ると…同じくコンド並みの値段です😱.
.
前陣子和友人到IKEA Alexander 购买东西后 来到近处 Queenstown的Dawson区来看获得设计奖最高荣誉的政府组屋. 这里分享的是Sky Ville@Dawson、就在Sky Terrace@Dawson 的隔壁、其外观设计 咋看一眼 有像牛车水的The Pinnacle@Duxton (新加坡首个超过50层楼高的政府组屋). 和The Pinnacle@Duxton 一样、 Sky Ville@Dawson 也设有Roof Top Garden (47 Floor)、不过这里不收费(Sky Terrace 也是) 从这里可以360度 眺望Queenstown, Commonwealth 周边的景色, 沒想到周围还保留了不少英植民建筑(有游泳池）、也可以见到Sentosa, Labrador Park和Pasir Panjang Terminal. 看了网上的设计图、Sky Ville由12栋组层於菱形排列並通过空中花园连接成型、除了47楼分别在3,14,25,36楼也有Sky Garden 连接每栋楼～也刚好MOP5年 看了一下 转售屋价... 😲 价格一样可㜩美私人公寓呀！👍

㊗️大家 平安幸福！身体健康！Stay Safe 💪🏻.
