A soft rain falling. Leaf buds opening to spring. A cuckoo calling. Here’s happiness. 🌈 Eversince we started working from home, I now prefer cloudy or light drizzling weather to hot sunny afternoons! As much as I miss face-to-face interactions with my colleagues and friends, I have somehow grown so used to the current lifestyle. I wonder if I will get used to the daily commuting (standing on train) to office, late dinners, insufficient sleep etc. 🤣 For now, let’s all enjoy the work life balance and whatever life throws at us now. ❤️ Today I made baked luncheon meat fries packed in prata skin! 🤩 And I didn’t want to waste the egg wash so I made shredded fried eggs too. 😋😋😋 Oh I tried to create a wooden table texture with my chocolate syrup but not that obvious. 🤣Happy Monday and happy week! 🌻🌻🌻

Often, you will realize you gain more in return (perhaps in other ways) by giving without expectations. Alternatively, let’s start by staying kind. ❤️ Sunday was a bright sunny day, and I think it will be perfect day to view Mt Fuji. I miss my time in Japan especially the short stint in Tokyo 3 years ago. I wonder how have my classmates been? A short period of fate brought us together from different parts of the world. Always grateful for that break and the biggest takeaway: 天下没有不散之筵席. I’ll think of them at times and hope everyone is doing fine! So on Sunday, I did what I’m best at: Shopping for hours in my Mt Fuji mask- from Northpoint city to Causeway point. ❤️

As we move forward in our 8 week challenge, we should slowly start to see the changes happening. Your body may also be getting tired as your motivation has allowed you to train hard and often. Make sure to spend time on looking after your recovery. Quality sleep is essential, but so is hydration and making sure your body is limber and flexible to handle the stresses of your workouts. 

Make sure you chat to our coaches to know more about this 💪🏽

I got some clams recently and decided to make this because it adds so much flavour to the broth. The broth tastes amazing with so much seafood in a pot. Plus, not much seasoning is needed.

I always thought you need a specific type of noodles but I used the egg noodles from @wulihaonoodles and it goes really well. Pair it with some sambal belachan 💯💯. I am going to make this for my family and in laws and I am sure it will be a hit! ===============================================
INGREDIENTS:
• @wulihaonoodles egg noodles
• Clams
• Pork Lard (optional) 
• 6 prawns
• A few stalk xiao bai cai
• Half onion, sliced
• tau pok, cut into small pieces
• A few shittake mushroom, sliced
• 500ml chicken broth
• 1 tbsp sesame oil
• 1 tsp soy sauce

METHOD:
1) Pan fry garlic and onion and prawn head till fragrant
2) Add in taupok and mushroom and fry. Add the chicken broth. 
3) Add in condiments and simmer for 5 mins. 
4) Add in clams and vegetable and simmer for 30 seconds. 
5) Add in the noodles and simmer till noodle is cooked. 
6) Drizzle some Chinese wine and serve hot. ============================================================ #oldschool #putien #clans #noodles #15minutemeals #instadinner #instafood #15minutesrecipe #simple #sgig #sgrecipes #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodstep #instagfoodsg #singaporehomecooks #homecookedmeals #whati8today #instagfoodsg #家常便饭 #sgfoodlover #onepotmeal #comfortfoods #circuitbreakersg",,43,1

Funnily enough, though they are famous for their crispy ""dancing fish"", we usually prefer to order meats. Last night we tried their barbeque duck with percik sauce (really excellent) and their oxtail (extremely tender though I found the style a tad too sweet). I love their egg dishes so we had their flossy prawn #omelette. For veg we had #sambal kailan with prawn, which had a great spicy kick. We supplemented these with yellow rice (not shown).

The last time we visited was before #circuitbreakersg, so certainly glad to be back!

I've always thought it was a small compact shrub till I saw it looking quite different after #circuitbreakersg . It became tall (about 1.2m here), with larger leaves and a more porous body. It became clear that it's distinctive white and pink new leaves (probably where its variety name comes from) were a result of regular pruning.

This plant is a caterpillar host plant (see the chewed up leaves in pic 2), and has little green flowers hidden among the stems (which passersby will never see 😅)

Cellapy was born under the belief that “Beauty begins with healthy skin” – it solves the root of skin problems beginning from each skin cell.

I have here the 𝗔.𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗿 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 that helps to: 

💧 Strengthens skin barrier
💧 Soothe skin sensitised by external irritations
💧 Promotes skin regeneration
💧 Improve skin elasticity

I've been using this for 2 weeks now and it has really helped the post-blemish flaky skin that I've been facing because of the blemish I get due to frequent mask wearing.

My skin feels really plump and hydrated. When so many dermatology clinics in Korea are selling this, you know it's good. 😊

Together with @cellapy_sg, I'm picking 3 winners to receive a free 𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗖𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗽𝘆 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘀 + 𝟭 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝘀𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝗔.𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗿 𝗟𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺 each! To participate,

1) Please follow @cellapy_sg and @ngjuann
2) Comment in the link below to let me know by 2 Sep and I'll randomly pick 3 of you! 😘

Food looked so good that I forgot to take a proper pic. I got their weekday lunch deal which was $14.90 net for a main+ soup with garlic bread + drink. Mine was the Fish & chips with Tom yam sauce (recommend the add on request of 49 spice level for ppl who can take spicy food!!), with mash potatoes and garden salad. Can I just say that their serving is sooo humongous??? Their fish is almost twice the size of my huge palm and they gave 2 scoops of mash potatoes. The highlight is their tomyam 49 spicy sauce, super shiok for a spice lover like me. Highly recommend this place which has great service too.

Let me learn from you, love you, bless you before you depart. Let me not pass you by in quest of some rare and perfect tomorrow. Let me hold you while I may, for it may not always be so. 🍀 Normal days are rare. Treasure even the most normal day as it usually holds something special - which you will realize only when it’s gone. During this CB, sleeping well or through the night become rare for me. So if I were to sum up the week, it’s the first in a long time that my sleep quality has improved. Maybe it’s the newly invested silk pillowcase, maybe it’s the pillow mist, maybe it’s the new pyjamas . 😅 In any case, I don’t want to jinx it so I continue to use present tense...sleep well. Sleep is so important- even more important than exercising. When you have good sleep, you have more energy to focus and work well. Your mood improves, everything also 看得顺眼。😆So if you are blessed to sleep easily and well, please treasure it! 🤣 It’s again the last working day of the week! TGIF everyone and enjoy the weekend! 🥳🥳🥳 Btw, a friend commented my coffee stencil art today looks like a goldfish! What do you think? 🤣

So do be generous with giving, caring and sharing. ❤️ busy day yesterday as I went out for lunch and to buy some cake ingredients. Wanted to replicate the chocolate fudge cake for my family to try. Tried a new dining place and I’m quite puzzled by this Ham/boiled egg creation. It’s creative, interesting but just doesn’t taste nice. It’s hard and bland, and doesn’t go well with the croissant. Sometimes, maybe it’s good enough to just stick to the basics- gently grilled or just original cold ham + diced hard boiled eggs with mayonnaise in a croissant. 🤣Other than the disappointed lunch, my day was still fine! 💐 Wore spring-looking nice floral mask, bought new flowers and baked a chocolate fudge cake again! This time, I made an effort to make it more decent looking. I hope it taste good too! Looking forward to eating it tonight! ❤️

@cheeselads was started to make artisanal cheeses more acceptable and enjoyable, especially for people new to cheese. They believe that there’s no right or wrong way to eat cheese, just ways you have not tried before.

Just like cheese and kombucha, an unexpected yet delicious pairing🤩Sparkling and refreshing, kombucha makes a wonderful palate cleanser for cheese platters🥂.

You can now order and enjoy our petite sized kombucha together with their cheese platters under their Beverage Add-ons! 

P.s. they also make their jam, hummus and chewy nougats from scratch😋",,76,1

Throw back to the time when I wanted to do an in-house maternity photo shoot during circuit breaker here in Singapore!

I drove everyone mad to get the right shot specially my camera shy mate 😄so much so I ended up with 3 maternity photo shoots of different themes 😛

Sharing here theme 1 - 
Modern Love 🤎 

Look close my watch wasn’t charged, we were sweating like crazy thanks to Singapore humidity and I am happily flaunting my protruding belly button 😅 #realitybehindamaternityphotoshoot

The Pinnacle @ Duxton sebenarnya adalah perumahan publik tertinggi di Singapore, disana juga ada Skybridge khusus penghuni condo. Dek observasi yang untuk umum buka pukul 09: 00-21:00 setiap hari. Yang mengejutkan, dek observasi ini tidak mengenakan harga yang fantastis! 💰💰

❤️Pemandangan 360 derajat dari puncak The Pinnacle nggak kalah bagus. Kalau menatap ke bawah ada atap-atap oranye di Chinatown dan view ke CBD yang menjulang tinggi. Deck ini memiliki taman dengan sejumlah sunloungers yang tersebar dan hanya menerima 200 orang umum untuk masuk setiap harinya😁
.
📍How to get there: Kamu bisa ke Blk 1G, Level 1 dan cari Kantor MA. Staf akan mendaftarkan kartu dan meminta pembayaran. Pembayaran dilakukan melalui cash dan dihargai SGD 6 per entri. Setelah pembayaran, ambil lift di Blk 1G ke lantai 50, dan lanjutkan menuju pintu masuk pintu masuk. Bisa juga kok pakai EZ-Link!

The joy you got from your previous achievements will carry you through. 🍀 oh I experience mental block very often, be it baking, foodart, chocolate painting or Japan travel blogging. Currently I think the mind block still exist for my blogging, which hopefully will achieve a breakthrough soon. ❤️ Anyway, today I decided to create my economical fried beehoon with a lady. This time, I purposely painted different facial features- long narrow single eye-lid eyes, rounder nose, straight eyebrowns and round face. More oriental looking but still pretty! I need to practice on drawing facial features. 💪💪💪 After lunch, I had nice chocolate fudge cake which I baked last night. 🤩 Happy midweek everyone! 🤗🤗🤗

With the current situation, self care is much more needed, specially in taking care of skin to release that tension and stress. Go to Lightful C skincare to achieve that bright and radiant looking or simply cheat it with instant radiance just with Strobe cream and Fix+

Mama used to send her in around 9am.
.
Luckily jiejie's primary school also started staggering timings & her P2 level got the 740am arrival timing (from 720am previously).
This meant that papa had to transform into a race car driver, sending meimei in first, followed by jiejie.
.
Those who have kids in childcare know that, sometimes we have to Q to enter, especially with the stringent checks now, the waiting time is prolonged.
There were a few times whereby jiejie's school teacher messaged me to check why she was not in school yet even at 740am. 🤦‍♀️
.
But what to do, because meimei's school is near one of the foreign workers' dormitories & we take the same LRT line as the workers when I send and fetch her, I think it's best that papa still remains a race car driver, for now la.
Most importantly meimei has gotten used to the early mornings so mama can 放心 abit.

A month into the 2month Circuit Breaker had me worrying about work and finances, this unprecedented time also had me reevaluating priorities in life, but most important i received peace and comfort praying and reading the word.

Scallop & Salmon served with Pesto Pasta, another fuss-free lunch!

I'm using Organic Fusilli & Pesto Sauce from @AlceNeroSG. Thankful for ready sauce when you need a quick fix.

Scallop & Salmon were seasoned lightly with Salt, Garlic & Pepper before cooking. Topped with crispy Garlic bits & toasted Walnuts for the crunch.

There's an ongoing promotion @foodsomaniasg. Hokkaido Scallop is currently selling at a discounted price of $33 for 1kg (UP $38) and Chilean Salmon Fillet (500g) at $13 instead of $15. 🛒 Head over to foodsomania.com for your online quality grocery shopping.

.
👉🏻Apatuh min???! Kok namanya serem banget!😨😨
.
🌟Puncak Hungry Ghost Festival tahun ini jatuh pada tanggal 2 September 2020.  Nah di periode bulan hantu ini, orang Tionghoa meyakini, pintu neraka sedang dibuka dan roh-roh akan berkeliaran dan mengunjungi keluarga mereka👻
.
👉🏻Orang-orang Tionghoa akan membakar dupa dan uang kertas, memberi makanan dan juga doa untuk menenangkan roh-roh tersebut. Di jalan juga biasanya ada penampilan seperti tarian, nyanyian atau chinese opera untuk menghibur roh-roh. Tapi ditahun ini, semuanya berubah agak sepi, misalnya Getai Show yang menjadi online dan kuil kuil hanya melayani sedikit orang untuk memenuhi aturan jarak yang aman.
.
🌟Festival ini biasanya diadakan di kawasan Chinatown. Biasanya sih kamu bisa lihat berbagai sajian makanan atau dupa di sudut sudut jalan. Ada yang pernah ke SG pas periode hungry ghost festival? Share dong pengalamanmu~

The government has lifted some restrictions and implemented new ones as we move towards a new normal.

👀 Here are some things you can expect from September: 

✔️ General travel to Brunei and NZ

✔️ Reduced stay-home notices for travels from low-risk countries 

✔️ Resumption of all outdoor classes in public places at SportSG sports centres, parks and HDB common areas

✔️ Odd/even entry restrictions to Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza on weekends (based on your NRIC/FIN)

✔️Exemption of the 1-metre safe distancing requirement in lifts

✔️ No loud music at F&B outlets to discourage patrons from speaking loudly and decrease the risk of droplet spread. Also refrain from booking multiple tables for large gatherings or maintain limited interactions between tables. 

✔️ Small-scale live performances may soon resume too!

It is an astounding gift. 🌻Happiness is a gift from God: it’s up to us to discover the kind of happiness that works for us. Guess I will be eating bread very often these few days. So today I chanced upon two cute ig images of a poodle and Miffy. I tried to recreate them on my bread, using peanut butter and Nutella. (No white bread, so it has to be a Nutella Miffy). I even tried to create some fur-like texture with my bamboo skewer. I think the final product looks quite cute! 🥰 This is a filling brunch consisting of 3-4 slices of bread, 1 hard boiled egg and a cup of tea and it’s making me sleepy. I’m glad I have aircon, flowers and cafe style jazz music to get through the afternoon. 🎼🎷🎹 Feeling calm and therapeutic while wfh. ❤️😌😌😌

Alhamdulillah... Allah buka hati ini untuk join program menurunkan berat badan.

Bukan saja saya dpt turunkan berat badan secara sihat ke paras ideal-weight, banyak lagi info kesihatan yg diraih dari program ini

Sebenar nya samada kita kurus atau gemuk, badan kita ada lemak jahat atau visceral fats yg menyelaputi organ2 badan kita.. cuma jumlah nya saja berbeza. 

Mungkin banyak atau mungkin sedikit bergantung kpd tabiat kita iaitu jenis2 makanan yg kita ambil selama ini.

Penting bagi kita ambil kisah bagaimana nak kurangkan lemak2 ini sbb lemak2 jahat ini adalah silent killer... iaitu penyakit yg timbul tanpa menunjukkan tanda2 awal

We tried the prawn soup and the dry prawn noodles with intestines and came to the conclusion that this place is only popular because it’s open late. Also, the dry noodles seem to be preferred as the chilli is the store’s highlight. Still, it’s not something that we would purposely make a trip down for again.

For a 24hr establishment we expected them to be well stocked with ingredients, but to our dismay, there were no beansprouts or kangkong left for our noodles. Boy, were we glad though that we had arrived earlier because the group that ordered after us did not have pork slices for their noodles - rationing is  probably why their ingredients are not so generous. Soup-wise is slightly better than average where you can taste the prawn essence after hours of boiling - with no fishy taste.

There is a sign indicating that customers could have a 1 time soup top-up, which is great to warm up your stomach at night. When we saw it, we were pleased, but when we asked for the soup top up, we were also given an extra ingredient - an additional eye roll.

Other than that, this place is nothing to rave about - just a late night eatery

The internet saved us by giving us Tiktok, Netflix, Youtube and other streaming platforms to pass the time. Some of us got a little more creative and were inspired by the countless haircutting videos to try and become an impromptu hairdresser. Which of the above have you done while you were stuck at home? Tag a friend and comment below the activities you completed!

On a more serious note, after months of circuit breaker, it is normal to lose our connection to the environment beyond our houses. We may have started feeling socially inept due to the constant isolation. Texting your ex might then come as a safe choice, either out of boredom or vulnerability, or because meeting someone new in the current situation just seems unlikely.

Our S.T.E.A.M. class for preschoolers – Kinder S.T.E.A.M. is one of the very few classes in Singapore that offers a true S.T.E.A.M. curriculum. It is a pre-primary science class, that includes all other aspects of S.T.E.A.M., like technology, engineering, art and math, all rolled into one class. 

In the same class, the children could be dabbling with an experiment involving milk (learning about breaking down of fats in milk), then constructing a robotic arm, using q-tips to create a skeleton art piece, then learning about even and odd numbers in relation to body parts! The general knowledge gained, learning to ask questions, think creatively and problem solve, is what would be highly beneficial in a child’s learning journey. 

Benefits of S.T.E.A.M. in early childhood:
- Develop critical thinking 
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Introduces various avenues of learning 
- Promotes exploration and asking questions 
- Increases love for learning 
- Builds communication skills through collaboration 
- Hones creativity

.
2 sizes down since started exercising a couple of months back ( yes and during #circuitbreakersg / lockdown ) and watching what I eat.
So the wife got me these as ‘trophies’ - a new belt and some new pants! Haha.
.
Staying fit and healthy from as little as 10-15 mins daily is possible! Some exercise is better than NONE.
Try it!
.
The real trophy for me would be if I could be fit and healthy to live long enough to walk the daughter down the aisle, help the son choose a fine wife ( like his mum) and to take more snow mobile rides with the wife.

Staying fit : A little everyday is better than none.

‘TWIX’ $ 18
Burnt Caramel Bavoris ,Dark Chocolate Sorbet , Peanut Crumble Chocolate chips

YUZU CHEESECAKE MANGO JELLY $18
yuzu cheesecake ; mango jelly , sea salt caramel ice cream 

Damage : $$$ ($60 for 2 desserts and 1 drink)

We liked the TWIX as the chocolate mouse is really rich and it doesn’t feel too overwhelming even after a few bites . We just want more ! 

Yuzu cheesecake was mediocre , but the sea salt caramel ice cream stole the show ! Would be better if the ice cream portion is a little bit more.

For this price point , we were expecting something more ( in terms of taste and portion). But overall we were pleased with the presentation and the food. But it’s definitely not something you can afford to have every other day. But the place is perfect for special occasions and special date nights (Super dim and romantic lighting) 
Setting was rather dark and sexy. Something for a change . Not your usual dessert place.

A lot of people always commented that I am blessed with thick and long hair. You might not know that I have sensitive scalp and poor health conditions which lead to frizzy hair, hair loss and lots of grey/ white hair. For me, I would say that I am truly blessed with good people and services around me. 

Thanks to @junmingjoonmin and team of @crescendohairdressing 
for taking great care of my #haircut / #haircolouring / #hairtreatment / #hairrebonding and #scalptreatment for coming to 3 years. Using the premium #hairproducts and giving me good advices on #haircare. 

Mucota Treatment is excellent and it does not contain any harmful chemicals like formaldehyde.

Naturally Soft, Smooth & Silky Hair 
* Nano Size Technology 
* Natural Moisturing Factor 
* Cell Membrane Complex 
* Long-Lasting Treatment (up to 8 weeks) 
* Ultimate Shine & Softness

I am indulged with the organic hair treatment products and during #circuitbreakerperiod , Jun Ming advised me what kind of hair colouring treatment which I could get from Watson or Guardian Pharmacy and WhatsApp-ed me to arrange appointment once his hair salon could attend to service me again. 

My sincere gratitude towards his kindness, friendship and attentive services. Being a business owner is not an easy journey, I could see his passions, perseverance and politeness towards customers, no hard sell, patience explanation towards some of their requests (I.e. he strongly discouraging me to bleach my hair. He would always tell me “I would like to see you having long and healthy hair instead”) 

After #circuitbreakersg , whenever I am at the hair salon, I could see how they take precaution measures by taking temperature, scan QR code, disinfectant the seating area and giving hand-sanitisers to customers. 

Hair salon is an essential personal hair care services industry and important to make customers feel welcome, relax and valued for service. The moment you step out, you will be happy to feel good and look good. Give me a 🙌🏻 if you agreed ☺️",Crescendo Hairdressing at Djitsun Mall,210,27

It’s salted egg and tomyum feast here @49seats! Really love how flavourful the dishes here ✨ .

We had the .
🐟🐣🍟Fish and Chips with Tom Yum Salted Egg Sauce .
🐣🦐🍝Tom Yum Salted Egg Pasta with Chicken Cutlet (Level 49 Spicy) .
🐣💥Salted Egg Popcorn Chicken .
🍬🥤Sour Plum Cola .

Ok so for both main dishes I ordered Tom Yum and Salted Egg sauce and... no regret at all ✨✨✨ This sauce really is something else guys.. the creamy, aromatic sweet and tantalising salted egg sauce joined forces with the bold yet fresh and slightly tangy and spicy tom yum. Soooo good!! If you haven’t try this combo, please try it soon. They really complement each other harmoniously ☀️✨ .

The fish and chips is soo big tho! 🐟🐣🍟 Its deep fried perfectly making it has this crispy golden brown colour exterior! The fish itself is breaded with breadcrumbs and still so tender, juicy and tasted fresh 😋 its served in a bed of straight cut fries and generous amount of tom yum salted egg sauce with prawns and mussel .

For the pasta 🐣🦐🍝 we just gotta go with level 49 spicy 🌶🌶 Happy that i could still endure the heat, tho admittedly i drank after my 2nd bite 🌶🧊 Aside from adding more spicyness to the sauce I noticed there are more chilli padi too in here! This dish really wakes me up and served with huuge chicken cutlet, mussel, prawns and lala! .

Popcorn chicken also has a generous amount of sauce which i loved! 🐣💥 i like that the size of it just nice ✨ not to big that it will distract the experience, but also not to small that you could only taste the batter ✨ .

Aand i found my new fave drink too, sour plum cola! 🍬🥤its fizzy, sweet sour and slightly salty. Definitely it will quenches your thirst after a delectable meal here ✨ .

Thank you @foodirectory.sg for making all of us hungry !

We had actually intended to go to #hakataikkousha across the street, but there was a bit of a wait and we were too hungry / impatient. 

So we decided to go to the empty ramen restaurant nearby –  a warning sign I guess? Maybe I ordered the wrong dish, but I must say I was a bit disappointed. Hub's #tonkotsu broth was decently rich but my #blacksesame ramen (2nd pic) was really quite bland. The soup wasn't even very hot, and the pork, while generous, was tough and chewy. Noodles and ramen egg was decent. 

Their saving grace was the gyoza, which was tasty and juicy 🥟🥟🥟. Anyway, now I still want to go to the other ramen place, which we haven't been to since #circuitbreakersg. Oh well, maybe next week!

Faham konsep present moment, kita hanya ada saat ni (NOW). Satu saat kedepan pun belum tentu lagi kita masih ada untuk selesaikan perkara yang kita letak ""nanti-nanti"" tu.
.
Bila fikirkan DIRI SENDIRI, kita patut dah rasa motivated dah untuk buat sesuatu tu. If dah rasa tak best berat lebih, dah tak selesa badan sendiri, dah makin tak sihat, cuba duduk depan cermin tanya diri sendiri ""Adakah ini yg you deserve? Adakah ini your goals?""
.
If jawapannya tak, do something! Kita hanya dapat result hasil usaha kita bila kita put effort buat sesuatu yg membantu kita achieve goals kita

One activity that we are thankful that reopened was SWIM.

JO LOVES THE POOL.
I remember him bugging me everyday during #circuitbreakersg when he can go back to swim. When phase 2 happened and then swimming was OK to resume, we jump back in almost immediately.

I think it's not so much about 100% safe anymore... But how do we carry on with life and adapt with the COVID-19 situation. We are constantly observing and never complacent about our decisions. We just have to weigh everything and make the best call we can ever make.

I'm glad that even before COVID-19 happen, AquaBambinos have already been very cautious about hygiene, sanitation, temperatures and even class size.
This period is not easy and we surely hope we can all ride through this and emerge stronger than before. 💕

🌟Pertanda baik nih buat traveler! Mulai tanggal 1 September, general traveler dari Brunei dan New Zealand bisa masuk ke Singapore tanpa STAY-HOME-NOTICE! Tapi mereka harus di tes covid-19 pada saat kedatangan. Durasi SHN (Stay home notice) juga dikurangi dari 14 hari menjadi 7 hari untuk beberapa negara, seperti Australia (excluding Victoria State), Macau, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, dan Malaysia. Traveler dari negara-negara tersebut juga harus tes covid-19 sebelum masa SHN-nya di Singapore berakhir😊
.
🌟Pengunjung dari Brunei dan New Zealand perlu mengajukan Air Travel Pass (surat permohonan yang akan dimulai pada 1 September nanti) antara tujuh dan 30 hari sebelum tanggal kedatangan. Mereka juga harus bertanggung jawab atas tagihan medis jika mereka memerlukan perawatan medis untuk Covid-19 saat traveling di Singapura💛

Took an umbrella and went to the Kopivan, wanting to buy some hot dishes... only to see them packing up early for the day because of the rain. 😐 So I made myself a ham, cheese and egg bun, a hot matcha latte and painted this raining foodart. Nice day to relax before the new week begins again. The rain has stopped now. Time to go out and buy some groceries in my Mickey Mouse mask. Enjoy the cooling Sunday. ☁️☁️☁️

It's been a while since I had time to post on Instagram, but here's the second project we (@syncroony ) had embarked on during CB period. 😝 #throwback
.
I'm super grateful for the chance to play an even bigger role in this, as one of the female leads and, once again, editing the videos together to produce this heart-warming piece. It's a tribute to the frontline and 'essential' workers, covering the song ""Lean on Me"" by Bill Withers, emphasising our gratitude towards those who work hard to help keep society going during this tough period.
.
Am also super tickled that the video has garnered 1000 views on Youtube and is also part of NLB's growing COVID-19 archives. 🥰 I'm glad that the message has reached so many and I hope that it has brightened our audience's day! ❣

From their signature blancmange roles to hokkaido vanilla cream cupcakes and double flavor classic chocolate and almond coffee cake, each of them had very soft and moist sponge and flavorful fillings.

I especially loved their signature coffee gula melaka rolls ($14.90) because of the thick, rich blancmange filling, which is like milk pudding. The intense aroma of coffee and gula melaka was very pleasant, and the aftertaste of this roll was much lighter than other cakes.

The hokkaido cupcakes ($15.90) were another attention grabber due to its fluffy outer puffs loaded with creamy vanilla fillings. These puffs really reminded of the moist cakes I had in Japan due to its high quality fresh vanilla cream.

The classic cakes ($17.40) came in two flavors, chocolate and almond coffee and these were much for dense and heavy compared to the swiss roll. Chocolate cake was very fudgy and thich, which went very well milk and the coffee cake’s faint scent of almond was especially pleasant.

@hotpot_master_delivery delivers high-quality hotpot you have in restaurants right infront of your doorstep so you can enjoy it conveniently at home! I had the privilege to try the super value hotpot set starting from $68 and it was amazing. 

It comes with two soup base, Suan La Fen and Super Collagen, so you can have best of both world from the numbingly spicy mala soup to savory chicken collagen soup. 

The steamboat ingredients included assorted vegetables such as mushrooms, cabbage, corn and meat selections included crab stick, chicken and pork. I loved how this value set also included the hotpot masters’ specialty dishes: drunken chicken, tobiko prawn paste and grilled salmon roll. Adding the drunken chicken to the collagen soup resembled eating ginseng chicken soup and the grilled salmon roll was extremely tender and went very well with the mala soup base.

@hotpot_master_delivery also provides the yuanyang pot and induction stove as well so you really don’t have to worry about any set-ups. The whole set includes not only the condiments and various sauces but also the disposable paper plates and cutleries!

Do you yearn to have a brighter and more radiant complexion? Personally, I find my face complexion to be considered as dull. Foundation works wonders on me, but sometimes I wonder, wouldn’t it be better to have a brighter complexion even without foundation? 🤔 Sharing with you guys the Beverly Glen Laboratories’ Brightening Care Trial Set that I've tried. This trial-sized set includes a facial cleanser (Clay Wash 15g), a toner (QuSome Lotion 20mL), 2 serums (skin rejuvenator C Serum 5mL & intense brightener QuSome White Essence 5mL) and a moisturizer (QuSome Moisture Rich Cream 7g). As @bglen.sg's SG office turns 1 this month 🎉, we have collaborated with them to giveaway this Brightening Care Trial Set to not only one, but FIVE (5) winners — read on to find out how you can be 1 of the lucky 5!

After 7 days of using this #bglensg set, I find that it has definitely lived up to its name because my skin has noticeably brightened! Swipe left 🔚 to see my before/after pics. Btw, both photos are taken at the same location under the same lighting at around the same time of the day + no edits (so oops, you will see my pimples too!) ok, you get my point 😉

Beauty is the larks gliding over dark blue clouds. Beauty is the snowflakes drifting down on my head. Beauty is the moonlight creeping up behind huge mountains. Beauty is for plants growing higher, higher, and higher. 🍀 This quote came from a 10- year old. So sweet! Nature is beauty. Simplicity is beauty. Smiling face is beauty. ❤️ The toast Box Kopivan is here again this weekend. I missed it yesterday coz decided to eat Mac breakfast instead. Decided to patronize the van this morning! And I created a fun Tic-Tac-Toe game with the peanut toast! 🤪 Do you think it will be a draw between Doraemon and me? Oh I’m wearing my new Mt Fuji inspired mask today! I miss Japan travelling! Every. Single. Day. ❤️ Happy Saturday! 🤩

These amazing “cooked” braised pork belly arrive frozen at your door step so all you need to do is just heat them up before you eat! I briefly simmered mine for 10 mins and it was as good as freshly cooked kong bak pao. 

For the buns, I steamed them using the rice cooker for 8 mins and it came out to be soft and hot, just nice for my pork belly. Adding cheese on my braised pork belly buns was extremely delicious as well.

The handmade prawn balls also came in frozen state that were already deep fried, so just toss them on your air fryer for 10 mins and they become very crispy outside and moist inside! They went very well with chilli and mayonnaise as well🙆🏻‍♀️

We shared a bunch of appetizers including their giant #burrata, tuna #crudo and #tegamino (fried egg with truffles) 🍳. Then, we had a veal #ravioli (with cheese fondue) and the highlight of the night, a large #ribeyesteak. Honestly by then I was quite full!

For drinks, we started with cocktails and moved on to a #nebbiolo, one of my fav wine grapes 🍷🍇. 

Food and service were excellent and it was great to see the restaurant bustling with life. We had ordered takeaway from them during the #circuitbreakersg as well, but of course it's not the same.

This rich, hearty shepherd's pie had very generous fillings made up of seasoned minced meat and assorted diced veggies, that was topped with perfectly baked mashed potatoes. The pie was very soft and creamy, each mouthful being flavorful and filling. This wholesome pie is made from scratch using the freshest ingredients and it was delivered hot so it tasted even better. @mypiesp specializes in three different pie flavors (pork, beef and chicken), and I just love how they don't try to save on the ingredients because the pies are literally loaded with fillings. My personal favorite was the beef pie because it went so well with the creamy mashed potatoes!

These flavorful Blackout Brownies are absolutely chewy and fudgy. 

Although the plain ones were already nice enough due to its thick and rich chocolate-y flavor, my favorite was the Speculoos brownies! The caramelised cookie dough at the core of the brownie gave the right sweet-salty touch, bringing the flavor of this delicacy to a whole new level. 

The Black Forest had a very interesting flavor as well, due to the dark pitted cherries at the core of the brownie. 

All of the brownies were very smooth and moist, and I liked microwaving them for 10-15 seconds to have it warm, which was absolutely delicious. 

Although I usually have my brownies with milk or coffee, I tried them with one of @bakked.sg 's Colonial Tea Blend, which was a fragrant Earl Grey tea. 

The scent of chamomile and citrus was very soothing and surprisingly went well with the sweet brownies.

No preservatives and MSG have been added to these roasted, all natural chillis and they come in varieties of flavor. 

I started with the original flavor and because these chillis have been deseeded to reduce the spiciness, they didn't have the overwhelming ""hot"" taste. 

The Mala Crispy Chillis had the nice ""numb"" effect after every mouth so if you are a fan of mala, this is definitely the flavor you want to try. 

My favorite was the Cheesy Cheese flavor because the cheese powder went extremely well with the spiciness of the crispy chillis. 

The bestselling Tom Yum flavor had the addictive tangy sour taste and because these are low in calories, I felt less guilty finishing half jar at one sitting!

Refer to @chillilor.sg to get these crispy chillies!🌶

This creamy Thai Green Tea Crepe Cake (S$35 for 6"") is made with Thai green tea imported directly from Thailand, leaving no artificial aftertaste in every flavorful mouth.

Each thin crepe layer is covered by thick, rich green tea cream that isn't overly sweet and the generous amount of cream in each layer makes the whole cake extremely smooth. 

Although the cake itself is already good enough, adding the green tea sauce brings the flavors of the cake to a whole new level. 

The gooey bitter-sweet green tea sauce makes the cake even more moist and delectable.

If you are a fan of crepe cakes and green tea, this amazing confectionery is definitely a must-try. They also have a Thai Milk Tea flavor which is another eye-catcher.

The Half and Half ($34/box), consisting of original + hazelnutmaste flavor is an august exclusive menu. The original brownies boast the classic thick and rich chocolate flavor, crispy outside and soft and moist inside. These are absolutely fudgy and chewy which go so well with fresh milk!

The new addition to the delectable family are the hazelnutmaste brownies. The crispy hazelnut filling sandwiched between the fudgy brownies made the brownies even more flavorful and aromatic. These brownies are definitely worth the calories!

Good things are meant to be shared, so here is a giveaway event to my followers in Singapore🇸🇬!

As a fan of any banana dessert, the Classic Banana Pudding was absolutely delicious! Filled with layers of creamy pudding, bananas and regal biscuits, every mouthful of this rich dessert tasted heavenly. I loved how this banana pudding didn’t have the artificial banana scent! 

The Ondeh-ondeh soul jar was very unique yet addictive, especially if you are a fan of gula melaka and coconut! The coconut flakes' crunchy texture complimented the spongy cake very well. 

The Lemon Chrysanthemum flavor had the aromatic lemon scent the moment I opened the jar and the tangy taste of the lemon extremely went well with the cream.

Lastly, the banana bites were soft and moist like muffins and went well with my black coffee.

May be an image of 1 person and text that says '12 EROM nsα 3 Colgate 6'.","I haven’t visit the dentist for more than 6 months so I need a better toothbrush to remove the plaque that’s building up. Colgate ProClinical B150 Charcoal Battery Toothbrush has up to 20,000 strokes per minute and unique multi-directional cleaning. It is slim, lightweight and comes with a 2 minute timer. After using this toothbrush, I realise that I’ve been brushing my teeth for more than 2 minutes all these years. So most of the time the toothbrush stops abruptly when I’m not even done brushing. It will be good if it comes with an indicator after 1 minute so that I can adjust my speed according before it switches off automatically. Overall this toothbrush is quite effective in keeping my teeth clean. 

I am still not comfortable visiting the dentist at this stage. What about you?

Anyone here missing authentic Taiwanese food? Check out @LorBakPng’s lor bak. It may remind you of your travels in Taiwan!
.
Everything is made from scratch per batch of orders by Yvonne’s mom who hails from Taiwan. Because of the pandemic, they decided to start selling their delicious Lor Bak and have been receiving great reviews. Most Lor Bak in Taiwan is 90% fats, however they’ve tried to pick meat that is a little leaner but still has enough fats to give you that melt in your mouth feel. I personally like the meat to fat ratio as it provides a good bite. 

They also sell a Spicy Minced Pork dish, another signature dish. Its very very spicy and fragrant because of the fermented black beans. In fact it’s so super spicy a little goes a long way! Painfully good! 😂
.
So here’s your chance to try out some Lor Bak. I’m going to pick three winners to win the following each:
- 500g lor bak + 2 eggs (U.P $15)
- 300g spicy minced pork (U.P $7.50)
.
How to win?!
1️⃣Follow @LorBakPng, @365days2play and @edward365 
2️⃣Like this post and send some love to our accounts 
3️⃣Tag your (real) friends. One friend per comment line. One tag = one entry. Tag as many friends as you like. 
4️⃣Include the comment “I would love to try @LorbakPng’s Lor Bak!” per tag 
5️⃣Giveaway ends 31 August 2020 Monday 2359hr

The pancakes are delicious but the portion is too little as compared to competitor’s which offer a bigger serving for similar price. Guess it’s good only as a dessert but not aa a meal. (Then again, the pricing doesn’t justify it as a dessert.) The long waiting time also greatly compromise the overall experience. 😑In any case, the tiramisu pancakes and salted caramel pancakes are yummy! Maybe I should just cook salted caramel syrup and make my own pancake at home. Another disappointment during lunch break was not being able to find any chiffon cake pan in the mall. Haiz. Now that cake ingredients are back, the baking utensils are out of stock. 😞Other than that, the day was okay- wearing my new pretty mask, grabbing some sales during lunch shopping and having old Chang kee during teabreak. So I still managed to smile for the day. 🍀🍀🍀

Adding a beautiful depth of flavour, the pockets of savoury cheddar was fragrant and intensified with the hints of rosemary. The cheddar wasn't too sharp in my opinion and provided an umami quality too. Deliciously and subtly tangy, the sourdough was surprisingly soft in the middle with a slight chew and a fabulously crunchy crust. However, great on its own, the toast tasted even more sublime with Farine Affair's compound butters!

Made with a mixture of herbs, spices, and other condiments; the Cafe de Paris Butter ($14.80 for 125g) was so aromatic. Herb-tastic, it is best served with toasted sourdough but also good with steaks. With gentle earthy notes, the Porcini Butter ($11.80 for 125g) lends a somewhat meaty flavour that is very addictive as well and goes superbly with toasted sourdough, pasta, broiled proteins, and even steamed vegetables.

""Mottainai is an ageless Japanese wisdom of interacting with the world such that we fully appreciate what exists, treat it as precious and make full use of its potential.""

The concept of Mottainai is to harness the potential of recycled organics through scientific innovation and methods such as reducing landfill, re-using olive and carrot by-products, recycling carrot leaves, respecting our animals and reconnecting with nature. 

The spirit of @mottainai_lamb is in its sustainable food production, where food is produced to nurture and sustain. How inspiring is that!

Sabun Collagen diperbuat dari bahan-bahan organik. Tanpa S.L.S atau S.L.E.S, sejenis agent pembuih yang boleh buat kulit kita kering dan sensitif.

Sebab itulah jika yang kerap menggunakan pencuci yang ada campuran 2 benda ini, anda akan mengalami keradangan kulit. Kulit juga akan jadi sensitif.

When trying to slim down, many people track their progress by stepping on the scale. Maybe you were happy by the low number you saw or suddenly became depressed because the number was higher than usual.

Sarah & I had been there before, so you are not alone so you don't have to be depressed about it. The number on the scale doesn’t tell you much about your health; all it tells you is your relationship with gravity.

There is a vast difference between weight loss (to which most people look at) and fat loss!

That is why in this video we are sharing with you the difference and why you should be more focused on fat loss than weight loss.

Presenting @letsjiaklaksa ! This home base store offers dry Laksa! And to be frank, I’ve taken many dry laskas in my life and none really made the cut! Well, at least till now!

This dry Laksa is indeed good! It’s noodles has soaked up all the ‘broth’ and every mouthful has its creamy fragrant shrimpy flavor! Love the texture too as it is rather moist so re-heating won’t be an issue’

May be an image of text that says 'SUNDAY SNIPPETS HOW CAN WE PRAY FOR THE CHURCH AND THE WORLD? The Crossing Church'.","Most of the time our prayers are for the 5Cs - comfort, cure, career, courtship and children. God listens to every single prayer with great delight and understands the troubles of our hearts. 🥰

Philippians 4:6 tells us not to be anxious about anything, but in everything through prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, to present our requests to God. While it is good to pray for our needs, we can become more kingdom-focused like Apostle Paul.

His prayers were heavily centred around God's will and work in His world. He prayed for wisdom, to live out the gospel, to stand firm in Jesus Christ and for gospel proclamation. 🌍

As a church, may we become more kingdom-focused by continually praying more for wisdom, our walk with God, to stand firm in Christ and to proclaim the gospel. 🗣

If you’d like to learn more about Jesus, join us online on Sundays! Our Sunday Services are available from Saturdays to Mondays on thecrossing.com.sg/exploring-the-crossing/sunday-services/

To find out more about Christianity, go to thecrossing.com.sg/the-good-news/ 🎊 or link in bio!

Running until 21 August, this year’s program covers topics including food sustainability, composting, urban farming, plastics and energy efficiency.

Here’s one that particularly caught our eye — a discussion with @nlb.singapore and @wwfsg on rethinking our relationship with plastic in our shopping habits and daily life. 

Eye popping facts from the event blurb… Did you know that Singapore households have generated an extra 1334 tonnes of plastic waste during the circuit breaker? That’s the weight of 92 double decker buses! 

Also, the frequency of households who bought their groceries online has jumped by 50%! Imagine how much extra packaging waste has been created… 

If you, like us, are interested about this topic, come join the webinar this coming Thursday, 20th August (7-8pm) through the link in our bio! 😉

From ideation of each of the individual shows, to the preparation, execution and running of daily operations. From hosts, to talents, crew and staff all working together.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It was a mammoth effort to pull it off, a crazy one never done before in my life, and I have a stellar cast to thank for pulling through.

Over the course of the next few weeks, I will be mixing in throwbacks and some funny behind-the-scenes footages taken from the past 5 months into this IG journal of mine, to go with motivational posts and photos of everyday friends and people I hold dear to my heart.

Also highlighted the character’s features with chocolate syrup!  I think the final product looks quite pretty, especially with chiffon grass created from my baked Pandan Chiffon Cake. This is a unique pairing as I don’t think we will ever spot Kitty hanging out with Mickey elsewhere! 🤣 I might do this sandwich foodart again soon coz they look really cute! 🥰 ❤️❤️❤️

10 minutes from home felt like thousands of miles from reality.

The Barracks Hotel Sentosa was once a British artillery outpost, home to soldiers from afar. Now lovingly restored, the hotel transports world-weary wanderers to the golden age of travel, when travel was– and still is– a stylish art form, filled with marvel, romance and discovery.

75 HARD CHALLENGE

4. 10 minutes of reading of a non fiction book a day: I’m reading #TheArtOfWar

前陣子老爷观看电视剧正好故事背景是NYC 🗽
问”Hummingbird Cake 会难做吗？”
这蛋糕是老爷在NYC 几乎每次经过Magnolia Bakery就要买的 (“城市与欲望” 剧中女主常光顾买Red Velvet cupcake的Bakery)  嗯… 看了食谱 不会太难 
但选了只做一层的recipe ～ 初次做怕失败呀🤣
烤好后叫老爷试试味道 ～
老爷 👀 👍 说有像 下次可以试做两层 🙄
Humming Bird 蛋糕 其实很像Carrots Cake 
不同在加了缶头pineapple 块、香蕉泥、辛香料等
这蛋糕在美国南部很常见 
名称源自加勒比海牙買加的国鸟 蜂鸟”Hummingbird” 
蛋糕造型可华丽 加入五颜六色的食用花点缀 艳丽夺目.

.
📌Remember to save this post down and refer to it later!📌
.
.
⚠️HIIT workouts generally combine short bursts of intense exercise with periods of rest or lower-intensity exercise.⚠️
.
1️⃣Proper form is essential 👉 Bad form can put too much strain on the joints, work the wrong targeted muscle💪 groups and make you susceptible to injury.
.
2️⃣HIIT👉supposed to be short, intense. ⚠️To reap the benefits of HIIT you need to attack it with a lot of energy💯. You won’t reap the strength and cardio benefits from leisurely going through the movements.☝️
.
3️⃣Work to Recovery ratio👉 The duration and number of your ⚠️work and ⚠️recovery phases you perform will depend on your 💪fitness level and training goals.
.
👉For Starter/Beginner 1 to 3 ratio⚠️ 📌ie. 15 secs work phase and 45 secs recovery phase
👉Slowly progress to Immediate (1 to 1 Ratio – ⚠️📌ie 20 Secs work and 20 Secs recovery) 
👉Advance ⚠️📌(2 to 1 Ratio- ie 20 Secs work and 10 secs recovery)
.
Small breaks in between for you to work hard during work phase.
.
📌⚠️3 Smart ways to bring your HIIT to next level, ☝️REMEMBER to save it down for reference or share🔊 it with your friends who might find this useful.

#saltedandhung was very much better than my untrustworthy memory purports to recall - exquisitely balanced, umami bomb flavours that these words + photos fail to adequately convey:
1. 1BITE -CHEESEBURGER 
wagyu #beeftartare, beef fat smoked ketchup, pickles

2. 1BITE - uni umami panna cotta, yuzu, pickled radish, kelp oil, nori cracker

3. 1BITE - FISH & CHIPS
chickpea chip, pea purée, caviar

4. TIME, LOVE & PATIENCE
IPA #sourdough, #whippedlard with chilli oil, #wakamebutter 

5. TREASURES OF THE SEA
#rawscallops, #caviar, yuzu sake, chilli granita

6. SURF & TURF
crayfish, lemonade & charcuterie broth

7. HEART & SOUL
housemade charcuterie - duck breast, bresaola, ?

8. THE WHOLE FISH
Pearl #grouper, #bonecrumb, charcoal 
Kinda #nosetotail but with fish flesh and bones and skin. Especially cool: #fishbone roasted then infused with local soy sauce for a month. After that the bones are dried and blended to a powder. 

Will experiment with this if/when we have another #circuitbreakersg.

9. HOMELAND
#kangaroomeat, beetroot, cauliflower 
Woah, so tender and tasty. I’d look at the local roadkill a little differently next time we’re doing road trips Down Undah. Kidding.

10. MEAT, BONE & FIRE
wagyu #tritip, bone marrow, ash
That pear and shiitake reduction with bone marrow butter? Superb.
.
Right use of #modcuisine - where the medium (dehydrated things, powders (not used:gels, foam)) does not overshadow the message (properly cooked food with balanced punchy flavours).

As the birthday girl said at regular intervals throughout the meal: “everything I’ve put in my mouth has been good!”.

So much in this world that is so delicious!

Yes, the trending cake has to be the Basque Burn cheese cake, but for a change why not try something different like the Indonesian cheese cake?
🔻
Their version of a cheese cake is basically a spongy cake filled with buttercream and shredded cheese on top! And the one from @jakartastreetfood.sg is excellent! It’s already pre-cut into bite size, and it’s moist, soft and high fragrant! together with the shredded cheese on top, it’s the perfect balance between sweet and savory! Very good I must say!

Have you heard of / tried this popular Shero Ching Medical Cold Compress Mask? We are so pleased to be able to collaborate with @rabbitlootsg to giveaway 4 boxes of this cosmeceutical mask! 😍

The Shero Ching Facial Mask is a medical-grade mask that helps repair, hydrate & moisturize the skin and add radiance to dull skin. The mask comes with extremely stringent pharmaceutical quality standards and does not contain any preservatives. Btw, it is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin 👍🏼 Prior to applying the face mask, I refrigerated the mask for a cold application (P.S. It is stated that the mask is more effective with cold application ❄️). After using it for a week, I felt that my skin has become smoother and my previously large pores have become less apparent 😱 There’s also a non-oily glow that’s left behind! Want to try it for yourself?

Try this little sweetheart from a property with some v royal flair 👑 and at a lovely price point.

Domaine de Baronarques is an old estate, dating back to the 17th Century, when it was called Domaine de Lambert. 

The estate changed several hands in the interim over the next two centuries. It got its rightful place and was transformed when in 1998 the Rothschilds of First Growth Chateau Mouton Rothschild acquired and reinvigorated the estate.

Over the next 5 years, the Rothschilds poured their heart, money and passion to return the estate to its rightful place and to its modern  day glory. 

Located in Languedoc, in the commune of Saint-Polycarpe, near Limoux, the Domaine is a single 110-hectare (272-acre) estate, 43 hectares (106 acres) of which are planted with vines.

The vineyard is subject to the climatic influence of both Atlantic and Mediterranean oceans, ensuring optimum sunshine and balanced rainfall. Also close to the Pyrenees, the parcels are at an altitude of 250 to 350 metres, tempering the summer heat.

In 2003, Domaine de Baronarques was also awarded the AOC Limoux rouge appellation, newly created by the Institut National des Appellations d’Origine (INAO). 

A blend of 48% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Syrah and 10% Malbec. Ageing is in 25% new and 75% 1-3yr old oak barrels.

 The wine has a lovely nose of black fruit aromas, rose, tobacco with hint of chocolate and vanilla. Offers v polished tannins and a wonderful long finish.

$42/- per btl (usual $47/-).

Painted a lot during Circuit Breaker and this is one of my unrealeased works. I have a thing for not releasing some of the art I do because I am so particular with how I present my artworks and recently have been hating doing art but shifting my focus to better my craft on my own pacing and stop overthinking things. 👩🏻‍🎨

Well the answer is simple. Our belief is to go slow. We craft our Kombucha to be palatable for everyone (kids included). 

Start with half a glass, poured over ice cubes and observe how your body feels a few hours after. (Enjoy them with tonic/sparkling water if the taste is too strong for your liking) 

If your body reacts well to it, go ahead and gradually increase your consumption! You may experience symptoms like tummy aches, flare-ups and even body aches that occurs due to toxins being encouraged to leave your body! 

If that happens, drink plenty of water and get some rest in before slowly easing back into small amounts of Kombucha after your body grows acclimated to it.

We encourage you to drink them in the morning, on an empty stomach to best experience it’s benefits. However, there is no precise time in which Kombucha must be consumed. It can be consumed in the morning as an extra morning boost during a work out, in the afternoon to combat that office lull or in the evening after dinner as an alternative to sugary desserts!",Singapore,59,4

While many NSmen feel relieved or find that extra time has been extended to them...

The thing is... you can't put a pause on your own health and fitness.

That's why we consistently have to watch our diet and exercise daily if not regularly.

It's definitely not easy for a fact. 

I've been through what many had gone through. Getting overweight in the past while working at a 9-5, plus having to complete my degree after work got me stressed up till I reached a weight of 86kg.

Probably the heaviest my body ever gotten.

But I put in my time and focus to burn my fats off till eventually I flipped the numbers to 68kg.

At first I didn't know it was possible until I attained that goal and the rest was history.

Now, helping more and more people in their weightloss journey. 🚀

So are you still not hitting your fitness goals or always ended up failing to kickstart your weight loss goals?

Maybe you just need a personal trainer like myself.

I was once in your shoes so I know how I can help you.

But first, you have to help yourself by letting me in to help you.

And the fastest way to get started (and it's FREE), is to follow me here on IG and let me be your motivation to get you started.

You can even feel free to drop a comment or DM me.

I even have a foolproof method that's on my blog, link's on Bio. (You definitely want to check it out 👆👆👆)

... for I'm always here to help. 😉",Singapore,7,1

Watch her share about how compelling the person of Jesus is to her, why she believes He is worth surrendering her entire self and identity for, and why she is assured that none of it will be in vain.

Jesus’ inclusivity and love is radically different from what society tells us. In Jesus, we see God himself in the flesh and we see God take on human suffering. In Jesus, we find that God is not asking us to do something that he hasn't already done himself.

If the person of Jesus could really provide rationally plausible explanations and emotionally satisfying answers to life’s big questions about existence, morality and injustice, why not take a serious look at the claims of Jesus? 🔍🔍🔍 #tccjesusunmasked

You can forgive us for this judgment error. You see, we were coming from a round of buying Pichon Lalande and Cos d'Estournel bottles from 1996, 2009s and 2010s. The price to value of Brane-Cantenac vis-a-vis other classified 2nd growth seemed almost ridiculously unbelievable. 

And yet that is how it has been over the last decade. 

Chateau Brane Cantenac is no longer in the shadows of some of its illustrious neighbours yet the bottles across the top vintages '05, '09, '10, '15, '16 offer the best value among second growth bottles.

The wines have always been rated v well over the last decade. So we are always on the look out for offers on these.

The Lurton family that runs the estate has owned Brane-Cantenac since 1925,. The Grand Vin comes from a single parcel of 40+ hectares.

They have also partnered with the academia for decades and extensively carry out their own research: be it wine making, or vine grafting & growing, oak ageing or modern practices in cellar management.

As Jane Anson from Decanter described it post a vertical tasting at the Chateau in 2018, ""Brane is never the most showy of wines and yet it has become one of the most sought-after names in Margaux, impressing through the most beautiful layering of aromatics and textured, confident fruits, perfectly encapsulated in the 2005 and even the undervalued 2012.""

2005s can be yours for $185 a bottle (normally $205). Just the last few bottles.

First time trying @medicube_sg products! There is so much hype 💙 about this brand and I actually never got to trying it. This is medicube's Ultimate Pore Care Set with 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗻 pore tightening effects 💪 and helps to regulate excessive sebums - both of which I need help with. 😳🙊.

💫 Medicube Zero Pore Pad 
💫 Medicube Zero Pore Serum
💫 Medicube Zero Pore Cream

The Pore Pads are such a joy to use. It functions like a toner and the dual-textured toner pads inside are so well soaked in their patented botanical formula! The embossed side is great for exfoliation and it really helps to remove impurities. I really see my dead skin cells on the pads every single time I use it!The silky side gives you the soft glow and clean feels. 🥰 it! My skin is well prepped to properly absorb the serum and cream. My skin sure feels so well taken care of! 🥰🥰

I wonder when I will be able to go back to Tokyo. Anyway it’s a rainy early morning and the Toast Box Kopivan is here again (last day for this week). I heard so much about their popular Curry Rice and decided to try it today. Omg. It’s really not bad! I would say it is better than their laksa and fried mee siam! So I think the curry rice will go to my top 3 list (the other two items are the Peanut thick toast and pork floss bun). I also recreated my curry rice set into a scene during the “National Sailing Championship 2020.” 🤣 My chicken wings and Tau Pok are recreated as sailing boats ⛵️ and I use seaweed to cut out 3 stickmen. I do think this foodart send out some relaxing vibes yah? 🤪 Hope tomorrow will also be a not-so-humid day. ⛵️⛵️⛵️ Counting down to Friday.

For an indefinite period of time, face masks will remain part of our #ootdsg. That is why I'm constantly on a look out for fashionable face masks that can not only provide me with the necessary protection, but also match my different outfits. Thinking of dress down Fridays, what comes to your mind? For me, it's definitely DENIM! 👖

I was stoked when I first saw the denim duckbill masks @myprintitsg is selling! They carry the masks in both dark denim and light denim 😍 Not to mention, these face masks are fairly breathable and comfortable to wear. The masks also come with stretchable ear loops and filter slot. @myprintitsg can also help you customise the face mask by adding your name/initials on it so that you can easily identify your masks from your family menbers’ 😱 If you like these denim masks as much as we do, you are in luck!

One (1) winner will win a set of Denim Face Mask from @myprintitsg (1 set includes 2 pieces of masks — 1 in Dark Denim and 1 in Light Denim) with free delivery inclusive. Winner can also choose to customise the face masks by adding your name/initials on it.

▪️Unagi 🐟 (got mine from @shopee_sg @theseafoodcompany.sg flash deals - 3 large unagi for $34!) 
▪️Egg 🥚 
▪️rice 🍚 
▪️cucumber 🥒 
...
1) cook the rice using rice cooker, put the unagi on a plate and placed it on top of the rice during halftime.
2) cook the egg in boiling water for 7 mins, put it in ice water for 5 mins to get #onsenegg ! If not #hardboiledegg  look good too😂
3) cut the cucumber into slices or if u have a shredder just shred it into strips.
4) combine them all on top of the rice and serve!👍💕

• HEALTHY FATS: Yes, we do need fats for our body. Good and healthy fats helps us to lose bad fats. Yup! Eat fats to lose fats. 

• WEIGHT LOSS FRIENDLY: Salmon is rich in protein & low in calories. Which helps increase your metabolism rate. Psssst, it helps with the belly fats too. 

• IMPROVES BRAIN HEALTH: Fatty fish / fish oil helps in reducing depression, decrease anxiety, lower risk of dementia. 
So you see, eating healthy is not only about losing weight. But it is also about having your whole body and organs healthy for a long period of time.

.
But pet shops weren’t allowed to sell any “pets” then. They were however, said the uncle with a knowing nod, allowed to sell food for pets. And so we acquired a $1 plastic bag of #feederfish that were destined for a short life either due to dodgy genes or fulfilling their destiny as some pet’s #livefeeder lunch, whichever would be the earlier. 
.
“Don’t be too happy; will die soon ah,” said the petshop uncle cheerfully as he waved goodbye to me and the bag of #mollyfish.
.
Turns out they were rather tenacious #mollies, and instead of self-destructing after a few weeks, have flourished and even propagated.
.
No idea how the fry survived since the Internet says the fry need to be separated into a #breederbox or risk being eaten.
.
And actually, no idea what the mollies eat since we haven’t ever fed them. Hopefully, their omnivorous diet includes all extant mozzie larvae.
.
Could be an inspirational metaphor for tenacity in a time of pandemic, recession, job losses, world conflict, environmental crisis. Or could be a visual parallel of #Matthew6*. 
.
Now we need to acquire some algae dudes to clean those walls.

“Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?
And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” (Matthew 6:26-33)",,41,8

Under the #newnormal many of us are working from home full time or at least partially under staggered work arrangements. We all have appreciated some unlikely benefits of Lockdowns but at the same time, Working from Home is not that rosy especially for health 😒

Here are my 2 cents on making the most of the #wfhlife while maintaining health quotient high.
⬇️⬇️⬇️
📍FOLLOW THE ROUTINE - When we are #wfh there is natural tendency to slack. Since we don't have to get ready, commute and go to the office, we tend to get a bit casual about time. To avoid this slack, it's best that we follow some routine. Get up on time, have breakfast, take shower and look presentable for meetings sets the ball rolling for an active day. 
📍GET ADEQUATE SLEEP - Disruptions in the sleep time and duration has been one of the major challenges that I faced in the initial days of #circuitbreakersg . Just because we are at home doesn't means each night becomes #netflix night 😱 I have made it a point that I get at least 6-7 hours of #beautysleep even while WFH.
📍DRINK ENOUGH WATER and keep yourself hydrated - When I am at home, I tend to drink less H2O and that's not a good habit. So now what I ensure is that there is always my @thermos_singapore on my table. Water is life even during #wfhlife 
📍EAT MODERATELY - Working from home means snacking more and eating more ? Yes very much possible so to avoid become a balloon it's good that we control the tongue. Eat lesser quantity of food and include lots of #greens and #fibre 
📍MOVE - There's always a danger of becoming a couch potato that's prone to attract Weight gain, UTI, bloatedness, gastric and many more lifestyle diseases. So what I do is - go on long walks with my hubby, go for grocery shopping, go and sweat it out in condo gym at least a few times in a week. #moveitmoveit 
📍CREATE CONDUCIVE WORK FROM HOME ENVIRONMENT - If possible, get a separate room, comfortable chair and table and ergonomic devices like this laptop stand from @homelyconnect that helps me to keep #rightposture 
.
What's your mantra to keep fit while WFH? Share with me 💚

Don’t know since when, even having a nice sleep without interruptions become a luxury. 🤣 So since it’s raining, it would be really nice to eat some warm comfort food. Best part is the Toast Box Kopivan is here again! Now from my new home office view, I can spot the Kopivan directly. It’s so distracting because I’ll think about Toast Box food all the time! 😅 Anyway, I went to get early brunch the moment rain stopped. My first time eating Toast Box Laksa! Not too bad except there is no cockles and the prawns are not super fresh. But the broth is ok and overall, not too bad! Also managed to do a quick chocolate sketching of what I’m eating! 🤩 Hope this cooling weather continues throughout the day! ❤️❤️❤️

1064,Vanessa Kou,2373787855657750899,2020-08-12 01:59:45,vanessa_kou,Photo by Vanessa Kou in Singapore with @soulsugarbakes.,"Having gone a little bananas over the many bakes I had bought last month, I completely forgot to post about @soulsugarbakes Banana-tastic Soul Box! At $25, each dessert box comes with 3 Soul Sugar Cookies, 3 Banana Bites, a levain New York-style Red Velvet Cookie, and a jar of Banana Pudding.

Pretty hefty, their Red Velvet cookie ⁣⁣breaks apart to yield a soft interior with generous chunks of white chocolate, a hint of cocoa and vanilla. A tad sweet (even for me), the richness of the molten chocolate after warming the cookie was slightly overwhelming to finish in one sitting. Hence, I would recommend sharing or perhaps balancing it with bites of their Soul Sugar Cookies.

A classic chocolate chip cookie done right, the Soul Sugar Cookies were made with brown butter and flaky sea salt. Soft and chewy, they were not too rich and the dash of salt really helped to accentuate the bits of chocolate studded in the bakes.

However, my favourite item was none other than their Banana Pudding which is marketed as the first of its kind in Singapore. Layered with Regal Marie biscuits, the chilled golden pudding was creamy, luscious and each spoonful brought back childhood memories of me dunking the exact biscuit into warm milo. Though the biscuits became soggy, the best part is having them absorb all the flavours and lending the dessert a pleasant vanilla taste. I could also get bits of mashed bananas in every bite and overall it wasn’t too sweet.

A close second after the pudding, the Banana Bites were really good too. The buttery muffins were surprisingly moist, light, fragrant, and best enjoyed warm. Mixed in with chocolate chips and shredded coconut, the banana flavour is less pronounced in comparison but had a great texture. The crunch from the coconut and the small pockets of sweetness from the chocolate was the icing on the cake.

But still warm! Anyway I did a lot of spring cleaning yesterday and shifted my workstation to a room instead of at dining table. So now I have a new home office view, new environment and new table display! Today I’m eating the coffee butter cake that I baked yesterday. So I was thinking hard of recreating it into something brown and decided to carve it into Mr Bean’s Teddy Bear! 🤣 Of course, Mr Bean needs to come into the picture. I think the competed foodart is quite cute! 😆 Oh just gotten news that the Toast Box Kopivan is coming to the estate again tomorrow and also next week! Hoho~~~Hope tonight will be more cooling and that I can sleep throughout the night. 😌

Beef pepperoni, pork chorizo, pastrami, mozzarella, chipotle mayo, salsa, salad with vinaigrette, poached egg

Warm and toasty sandwich with generous filling! So good!

[John Lemon Waffles] 🧇 
Buttermilk waffle, housemade lemon curd, blueberries, strawberries, passion fruit puree, thyme crumble, vanilla ice cream from New Zealand Natural

The house made lemon curd really elevated the dish by bringing a really nice tartness to the otherwise sweet dish. The vanilla ice cream is really high quality and paired really nice with the waffles!

May be an image of 2 people and text that says 'THREE TIPS TO MAKING EXERCISE SIMPLE The Nyonya Sisters @THENYONYASISTERS'.","Beginning an exercise program can be intimidating if you have never incorporated regular exercise before or if you haven’t engaged in regular exercise for an extended period of time. Here are three simple tips to incorporate an exercise plan into your TR90 program.

1. Start out easy. Gradually working into physical activity helps you avoid getting too burned out after the first time. Muscle soreness often accompanies novel physical activity, and easing into a new activity can help to prevent this discomfort. Try start out at 15 to 30 minutes for 3 to 5 days a week, and then gradually increase the intensity and frequency.

2. Have a plan and stick to it. Having a plan removes the guesswork from exercise. It becomes easier to accomplish if you already know what you are going to do and how long you are going to do it. Your daily schedule can become busy quickly, and scheduling physical activity into your daily routine ensures you don’t leave it out when time gets crunched.

3. Finally, pick an activity you enjoy. The more you dread the activity, the more likely you are to leave it out of your busy schedule. Walking or jogging enjoyable routes, aerobics or zumba classes, or bike riding are great ways to exercise in an enjoyable way. Whatever activity you select, consistency is the key. By being physically active 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week, it becomes easy to add the benefits of exercise to your weight management efforts.

Kusu Island terletak sekitar 5,6 Kilometer di selatan Singapura,  termasuk dari salah satu “The Southern Island” Singapura. Kusu berarti “Kura-Kura” dalam bahasa Hokkien☺️🙌🏻
.
🐢Kamu bisa mengunjungi Kusu Island saat ”Kusu Season” (sekitar bulan September-November) dan akan ada banyak orang yang pergi kesana untuk memberi penghormatan di Kuil Da Bong Gong. Di dalam kuil, kamu bisa melempar koin ke lonceng di tengahnya, lalu membuat permintaan☺️☺️
.
🥳Di Kusu Island juga terdapat 3 Kramat (kuil dalam bahasa melayu) di puncak sebuah bukit yang dipecaya akan memberikan kekayaan, kesehatan, dan kesuburan. Untuk ke tempat tersebut, kamu harus mendaki 152 tangga! Dan perlu diingat, kamu dilarang untuk menginap atau camping di pulau ini👌🏻
.
📍How to get there: Pulau Kusu dapat dicapai dengan kapal feri dari Marina South Pier sekitar harga SGD18 untuk 1 tiket pulang-pergi.

#wfh has made me more conscious of #selfcare. Sometimes I find myself eating my breakfast, lunch and dinner all in front of my computer 😳😳. I feel pressured and obliged to be more contactable than when we were all in office.

So during this long #ndp2020 weekend, I did chores that relaxed me, spent hours on my sofa just lying around reflecting on my personal journey, vid-calling my fanily and just doing whatever I wanted to. #contented 😊

I hope you guys are having a restful weekend too. =)

Like everything and everywhere around me is messy, disorganized and 看不顺眼. So I’m going to clean and tidy the house today. 🤣 Anyway before I start my housewife chores, I wanna be a tai tai and enjoy this set of trio atas cupcakes sent by my BFF! All three flavours (original, citrus and mint) are really YUMMY!!!!!! My BFF is really such a sweet, lovely, kind and warm person ❤️❤️❤️and her deliveries of flowers and food always made my day! 🌻🌻🌻 Oh! I also tried to elevate my coffee stencil art by doing my initials “JW” above the rose. Not too successful though. 😅 If there’s time, I think I wanna bake a coffee cake today (since I finally managed to buy Hersey salted Caramel chips) and maybe a chocolate painting! Let’s all have a productive off-day today!!! 💪💪💪💪💪💪

The  LO asked for salmon and the family loves it! I am going to try making with shabu beef the next time round. The sauce is enough for at least two rounds so you can store it in a bottle and refrigerate for next round! Swipe to see my sizzling pan! ===============================================
INGREDIENTS:
• 5 cloves garlic, minced
• 1/4 onion, cut into small pieces
• 50ml soy sauce
• 50ml honey
• 2 tbsp oyster sauce
• 1tbsp slurry (1 tsp cornflour with 1 tbsp water)

METHOD:
1) Fry the garlic and onion till fragrant.
2) Add in the rest of the sauce and slurry and simmer for about 5 to 10 minutes till the onion softens.
3) Use a blender and blend the mixture till you get a smooth solution. Add the amount you like onto your rice.

IMPORTANT UPDATE Please read!'.,"It's been 4 months since we first launched Belanja Eat. We started this as a community-led initative, with the intention for it to serve as a stop gap for those in need of a meal during these tough times, while helping out our neighbourhood hawkers. Thank YOU for coming forward to get this going, you have shown us that kindness is still alive and well in our community.
From 10 Aug onwards, the Belanja Eat team will stop updating and monitoring of the Belanja Eat map and stall directory, our social media accounts, our email address and feedback form.
However, we do hope this initiative will still continue for as long as there are meals being Belanja-ed out there! If you know of others who need support beyond just a meal, do check out supportgowhere.gov.sg for available grants and funds for those hard hit by #Covid19 or otherwise.
***
IMPORTANT
For Belanja Eat stall owners:
- If you would like to continue with Belanja Eat after 10 August, please do! The Belanja Eat poster will still be available for download on our website.
 If you are still using the existing poster with the BE team contact details (QR code and WhatsApp number) at the bottom, please fold it down as they will no longer be monitored. Note that the BE team will not be updating the stall directory on our Belanja Eat map or any feedback support after 10 August.
- If you would like to stop Belanja Eat on 10 August, simply take down the Belanja Eat poster on 10 Aug, when you close for the day.

Being featured in this year's National Day Parade show as a protagonist and profile is a huge honor, something I had not expected when we started the ""Bottle Project"".

Since we returned to the lab in Phase 2 of #CircuitBreakerSG, I am hopeful for change. Change in our society and #Singapore because I have witnessed so much strength, graciousness and have seen so many acts of kindness from fellow Singaporeans. The acts of heroism and sacrifice from our frontline workers and essential workers motivates me everyday to see how and where we can contribute.

I always stress that our ""Bottle Project"" wouldn't have been if not for the COLLECTIVE efforts and contributions from the Community. Each and everyone of you who walked in to drop of 1 or 2 bottles. YOU contributed in the fight against #Covid-19.

So to all my fellow #Singaporeans, contribute in anyways we can, every little bit is part of a larger Collective effort that will help us rebuild our beloved country as we try to find our way out of this pandemic. #togetherwearestronger 

I am extremely humbled to lead an incredible team here at Fawn Labs. Team mates who have shown leadership, strength, humility and resilience. They have sacrificed their own time and sleep to support this vision of giving back because we have the lab and capability to contribute. The reason why I work so hard everyday since we decided on taking up ""Bottle Project"" during Covid-19 and other Sustainable projects is because I want to ensure voices like theirs is heard.

Here at Fawn Labs, we believe in building a safe environment to share and learn, a journey to empower each other and raise awareness on issues related to #Sustainability and #CleanBeauty. We want to impact communities with the right knowledge and we want to give back where we can. To start with a ripple and watch it grow into a wave and beyond.

To each and every #Fawnling who has supported and encouraged us through this period, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. We welcome all of you to come and join us on this journey.

When we were younger in primary school, National Day was a BIG thing because there is half day in school, school celebrations to watch and free gifts to take home. When we were in our teens, National Day become a happy day that we don’t have  to do school work and go to school! When we joined the workforce, National Day become a public holiday to sleep in and go out with friends. Now, National Day become a day to celebrate with family members. It become an occasion for family gathering. ❤️ In any case, I still managed to spend some time in the afternoon to prepare simple foodart of flying jets (using herseys chocolate mint wafers) and my favourite DayPlus Chocolate Orange Bun, and coffee stencil art of ❤️ and “SG”. Also showcasing my new gold cutleries and hydrangeas cup and saucer. 🥰🥰🥰 Happy birthday Singapore and We Love SG! ❤️

🎀𝐆𝐈𝐕𝐄𝐀𝐖𝐀𝐘🎀
""Ai Jiak Ba Hu Mai?""
was probably the one of the most repeated questions I've heard during mealtimes in my growing up years. 🍽
(It means ""want to eat meat floss or not?"")
.
Being raised in a Teochew household by my grandparents, porridge was probably consumed at least 5 times a week. 
My grandmother, the head chef, thought that Ba Hu was a perfect companion to porridge, and it was undeniably so. 🤤
.
It was only after becoming a mother myself that I was introduced to healthier versions of Ba Hu - Salmon Floss & Tilapia Floss!
The benefits of fish need no further explanation👍.
Under @Eessentialsg, Mamacooks Fish Floss recently went through a facelift to bring to you a cuter, more compact and thicker box, 3 sachets per box! Simply drop a box into your bag and you're all set to go!
.
@Eessentialsg would like to gift 5 lucky winners, YES you read right, FIVE, a set of the following each:
1) Salmon Fish Floss (Seasoned for 9M+)
2) Tilapia Fish Floss (Seasoned for 9M+)
3) Tilapia Fish Floss (Unseasoned for 6M+)
.
To stand a chance to win, simply:
1) Follow @Eessentialsg and @venetia.ngin
2) Like this post
3) Tag one friend per comment
4) Share this post to your IGS & tag us both for additional chances to win. [Optional]
Good luck! 🤞
Contest ends on 10 Aug 2020 at 1200.
Winners will be chosen at random and announced on the same day!

Did this in Phase 1 for @mm2singapore 's ""Love within"" challenge! Though I didn't win, I am glad I can now share this! The way I feel about this film can't be changed by criticism and not winning, and I'm glad I've made something I felt genuinely proud of.

A huge thank you to those who helped me here and there with my artistic wants and my technical needs: @sheamisenmusic, @partybells_ @joshuachristiantan @kloudyclown, @haikelzambri. You guys helped elevate my film to this level and I'm so grateful.

This was a story I wanted to tell after hearing about a close friend's struggle. And I can't believe I pulled off this film almost entirely by myself with limited equipment, filmed on a phone, picking up editing skills along the way, acting directing, lighting and writing this piece.

The cherry on top of those struggles was being 1st AD and locations manager because I have 8 people living in my house( it's truly difficult) with loads of stuff lying around and I never would have thought I could pull this off.

Please do like and share this short film if you enjoy it! It goes a long way.

When you see a whole grilled chicken on my feed, it means ""I am not in the mood to cook, but I want good food"". I have seldom made grilled chicken as a special dish, its always been a quick thing where it takes 5-10 min to marinate, and the rest of the work is done by the oven 😆 But if the marination is reasonably ok, you get a good meal.
This one ... stuffed it with carrot, potato, lemongrass, onion, ginger, garlic. Marinated in lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, my favourite 5 spice powder, salt, honey and a tbsp of youghurt to bring all the ingredients together.

A pretty tedious process every morning - perfecting the roast and battling with the heat each time. Slabs of pork bellies are roasted till the skin is charred and then scraped off to reveal the golden-brown crispiness before chopping into serving portions.

Makes it worthwhile when returning customers complimented us on it ☺️

Though the drinks were of low-viscosity, they didn’t taste diluted as the flavours were pretty prominent. My favourite being the Sakura & White Peach, packed in blue, as upon the first sip I could taste the hint of floral followed by the delicate sweetness of peach. The tanginess of the yoghurt was also more of an aftertaste. In pink, the Rose & Strawberry was slightly sweeter in my opinion, and tasted a tad artificial to me. However, it is a good pick for those who don’t usually enjoy the sourness of yoghurt and was light overall with a nice balance of the key ingredients.

To order, DM @ snackit.sg. 1 carton (10 bottles) is priced at $28 (+$5 courier) while 2 Cartons (20 bottles) goes for $50 with free courier service where you can mix the flavours.

Indeed, we had a wonderful time at their restaurant last night, and the food and service was excellent.

【 Recipe 】Creamy Lemon Penne with Mushroom & Smoked Duck

Been thinking of Pasta al Limone after seeing @thekitchenettetales Angie's post last week. Haven't had this almost forgotten flavour for a long long while. And yes 🙋‍♀️ I support her to include pasta as breakfast staple because Pasta is Life 😆

Sharing another under 30-min recipe here.
🍝 Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add salt & pasta. Cook pasta according to the timing indicated on the packet. Drain well & reserve some of the pasta water.
🍝 Melt butter with olive oil in a pan. Sear the duck breast skin side down till crisp. Flip over and cook for another couple of minutes or so. Remove & let it rest for a while before slicing thinly.
🍝 Using the same pan sauté mushrooms until slightly softened, add chopped garlic. Stir fry till the garlic turns light brown before pouring in cooking cream.
🍝 Let it simmer for a little before adding lemon zest & juice. Add cheese and let it thicken slightly.
🍝 Add the cooked pasta, freshly chopped parsley, sea salt, black pepper and a few tablespoons of pasta water (if required). Mix well to coat the pasta evenly.

Original/Black Pepper Smoked Duck from @Foodsomaniasg is selling at $5 for 200-220g. Head over to foodsomania.com for your online quality grocery shopping. Free delivery for purchase above $60 and receive free gift for payment made via Paynow.

Seng Siong and Grace, married for 33 years and parents of 3, share their experience of Jesus' comfort throughout their journey of losing their youngest son, Elliot, to a rare form of cancer (spindle cell sarcoma).

In Elliot's 9-month battle with his cancer, they learnt to rely on Jesus for strength. They also held on to the promise that Jesus was in control and there was a good purpose for their suffering. #tccjesusunmasked

As a freelance yoga teacher for the last 15 years, we find ourselves in situations like these every now and then, but in my entire lifetime in this, it’s never been as drastic and long drawn out as 2020 has been. I have learnt to embrace the fact that class cancellations are not in fact, a loss of income, but that a predictable source of income has been disrupted, and that I have the freedom to create new ways to manifest what I need. I have learnt that no matter how long I have had classes on schedule or students, that they are not my classes and that I do not have ownership of my students or their practice. I have also taught long enough to know that the ones who find connection, will find their way back if we are meant to journey together again. I have learnt that newness always presents itself, and to be ready to let go to allow the new in, and for that to happen, I have to constantly evolve to serve the purpose that is my life’s work. The way I teach today is almost completely different from what I was doing at the beginning of my journey, and yes, I see myself doing this probably for the rest of my life. I have had to start from scratch several times over, and each time teaches me that in evolving, I grow resilience, calmness and clarity. #singaporeyoga #2020vision #fitnessfirstsg #sgyoga #tittibhasana #sunset #fusionopolis #circuitbreakersg #lifein2020 #resilience #weareinthistogether #yoga",,229,36

The restaurant serves mainly Singapore and Malaysian zi char mainstays. I must say the dishes we tried were all very good. Very homely and comforting fare and I'm already making plans to bring my parents to try the food as I write this.
.
These are the items we tried, and they are only available for a limited period, which is a pity because though ought to be mainstays!
- Pan-fried Vermicelli with Assorted Seafood $16.80
- Stewed Roasted Pork with Diced Chilli in Claypot $16.80
- Stir-fried La-La in Curry Sauce $16.80
- Seafood Paradise Signature Creamy Butter Crab $88
.
The fried vermicelli is definitely a must try. Love the smoky savoury flavour of the gravy and the texture of the noodles. A dish well done. And the crab! Some will not like the sweet butter sauce but I loved it. I had 3 bowls of that sauce and I polished off 3 mantous too. The crab was sweet and succulent too, and the flesh came out easily. If not for the pricing, I would love to have this again.

A little snippet of what a young prospect in his early 20s told me when we are discussing his financial priorities and how he want to allocate his money, “you can be young without money, but you can’t be old without it. I have seen friends of my parents suffer because of the lack of retirement planning and I’m super glad that my parents did. Hence I want to follow their footsteps and ensure I don’t burden anyone in future.”

He said that in front of his dad while we were discussing his needs and wants. The proud yet humble smile on the dad’s face was etched in my memory and I’m really really touched by how mature he thinks. 

P.S. if you are keen to know what I’ve been sharing, dm me to find out 😛

The worse things seemed to get, with the world falling apart at the seams, the more it seemed that we should just screw this shit and see if we can experiment. I wasn’t exactly sure what the final product was going to look like, but here we are, and oddly enough, the show has already begun to take on a commemorative aspect for me - a memento mori, a signifier of how close we all came to the other side, for a while back there ...

All this time at home has caused me to do a massive clean out and reevaluate spots that I never really used before.

I added a few lanterns with bug repellent candles, two large comfy chairs at the other end of the balcony, and a few more fun accessories and 💥(boom) instant upgrade! How gorgeous is this rug?!

In general, you should weight yourself about once a week or every other week. If you are trying to lose weight once a week is best. If you weigh yourself too often you may be discouraged by normal fluid shifts. It is best to weigh yourself in the morning, before breakfast ✌🏻😍

Recently, I chopped my pocket & took that courage to purchase an apple pencil which I always wanted even knowing that I've zero talent in drawing. I started with a blank space with nothing in my mind & I asked myself - why did I even spent this money to buy this stupid pencil. 😡 I felt demoralised because no matter how I tried to pen down that image in my mind, it just comes off with nothing. 😅 But I believe that as long as you're willing to learn, nothing is actually impossible? As least that's what I believed & has been keeping me going so far. So since I've no talent in drawing, I decided to go for YouTube where many talented artists posted their artworks or even best; TUTORIAL! 🙈 So I was browsing through & came across this YouTube video by @makoccinos. It was easy to follow & I managed to come out with a slightly better piece than ever. 💜 Drawing is really very relaxing for me & I really hope I could improve better the next round.

What’s important is the courage to continue and persevere on after crying and the courage to smile after crying. 😊 Today I made an effort to sneak out at 10.40am to buy from the Toast Box Kopivan. Again, some hot food items are already sold out! 😱 Still, I managed to buy dry Mee Siam, Pork Floss Toast and a few Pork Floss buns that have just arrived.  The buns are really soft and nice. I wish this Kopivan comes once a week! 🤣 Then I recreated my food into a beautiful lady. I just drew the facial features, so I don’t know who this person is. 🤣 Just a pretty lady who is smiling through her teary eyes? Finally we are approaching end of week soon.... everyday is getting a little more weary than before. I need to figure it out soon. 💪💪💪

The tom yum pasta was enhanced by the salted egg which made it rlly flavourful. The sides were yummy too! Despite the restaurant being crowded, customer service was on point 💯

It’s not everyday that @nikvoon and my cravings intersect, so when they do, I definitely make it count. Nik: “Hmmm fish head curry sounds good” Pat: “Done”.

My inner uncle gets a huge kick out of buying fresh whole fish over the counter from the fish monger. Nothing beats the value of a whole fresh fish. The selection that day was a little limited but I managed to get my hands on a nice medium-sized white snapper as well as a slightly larger grouper head. I’m the only one in my household who actually eats the heads in fish head curry, so more for me!
.
.
.
The distinct tang of the Assam lifts and cuts through the rich curry which was balanced out with a smidge of grated palm sugar (instead of plain ol’white cane sugar) for an added depth of sweetness - a worthwhile experiment. This curry goes great with fluffy white rice and some freshly fried up papadum for good measure (this isn’t an Indian curry, but why not right?).
.
.
.
Fun fact: Nyonya style Assam Fish Head Curries don’t use any kind of milk/dairy, but instead they use toasted jasmine rice that’s grounded fo a fine powder.

A somewhat normal life resumes but I'm determined to eventually showcase all of my meals during Circuit Breaker ! 😬
.
Good stuff, Good stuff! 💖
.
Day 28: Duck Mee ! (This brings queue every day here in Bangkit Road and they close really early in the afternoon. It's literally the only time I accept Yellow Noodles. The secret is in its sauce, tender duck meat and chilli! 😍😍😍)
.
Day 29 : @pizzaboysg and @dessertstorysingapore ( I'm quite a fan of pizzaboy's garlic pizza and hawaiian pizza! It's also the first time we ordered in desserts during CB!) 😋
.
Day 30: Wanton Mee from Bangkit Road ( Absolutely delicious!! Its QQ alkaline noodles drenched in slightly starchy sauce.) 🥰
.
Day 30 dinner : air-fried fish, cabbage and thai chilli fish with rice! (Home cooking!) 😝
.
Day 31 : Yong Tau Foo with Dry Noodles @kookeeyongtowfoomee . (Oho, another noodles. This one had me at its hakka style transparant sauce! I could have 3 bowls of these noodles. YTF here is standardized.) 🤗
.
Day 32: Tonkotsu Ramen from @tagakiramen !! ( This is where my first love for ramen begun years back! Economical, no frill, well made broth~) 🥰🥰
.
Day 33: 4 Dishes ""Point Point Rice"" with cabbage, spinach, sweet and sour pork and steamed egg! ( I must have been really hungry ) 😆

When you can’t fit into most of your clothes, take ‘em off. 😂 While some of you turned into lean, mean exercising machines during #circuitbreakersg, I turned into a recipe-churning, cooking machine. 👩🏻‍🍳 I put all of my time, effort & energy into #cherylwritesacookbook, released a smaller ebook version of @smitteninthekitchen which raised $12,700 for @foodfromtheheartsg & totally stopped working out. 😭 Moving forward, I promise to take better care of myself & find a better balance between work, play, food & fitness. How have you been coping with juggling it all? 💋

I think it’s a spiritual understanding of real joy within you. Anyway, today is an exciting day for the property as we welcome the Toastbox Kopivan into our premises. Since 9am, I kept peeping out from my balcony at the ordering queue to the food van. Finally at 11.50am, I sneaked out to queue. By the time it reaches me, everything is sold out except sandwiches, drinks and Tau Sah Piahs. 😱 So I bought 2 sets of ala carte Kaya Toast and 2 Tau Sah Piahs and my collection number is 164! Business is brisk! The van is here for another day tomorrow and I MUST queue earlier for more food options!

Have you been seeing more and more silk masks appearing in your IG feed? Cause that’s what is happening to me right now! Stylish silk masks seem to be a trending thing now.. and I’m so happy to be able to own my first-ever silk mask, courtesy of Geek Girl Society 😍 (P.S. We are giving 1 lucky follower a chance to win one for free too - scroll down & read on!)

@geekgirlsociety ‘s silk masks are made from 100% mulberry silk (with qualified certification) and are hypoallergenic. The ear loops are not only stretchable, but also adjustable! What’s more, there is a side slot for you to insert your own filter. ♻️ At the moment, @geekgirlsociety carries this silk mask in 3 colors: Golden Beige (the one I’m wearing!), Royal White and Rose Pink.

Btw, if you are wondering, this mask is super comfortable to wear. I wore it out on a date the entire Saturday and I DON’T have the “I want to rip this mask off” ‘s thoughts hahaha some masks really do give me such thoughts 😂 Also, have you ever faced the problem of needing to shout through your masks while ordering cai png? With this mask from @geekgirlsociety, you absolutely don’t need to scream through it anymore! My voice was so loud and clear that my fiancé kept having to shush me as I habitually shouted through my mask 😂

No matter what may happen in life, nothing will be able to touch true happiness. 🌻 This quote reminds me of something that I read online about the importance of education... studying hard is important because it will open up more opportunities in our career choices in future. So you earn freedom in your career paths. Today is the first time that I simply have no inspiration for any foodart even though I tried. I tried to paint something but ended up washing them off. So I compensated with a nice Melody-themed plating. Btw, I’m eating baked prata skin stuffed with tuna! Tomorrow is gonna be exciting as we just received notification that the Toast Box van will come to the Estate for 2 days from morning to mid-afternoon! Omg! Imagine having breadtalk buns and toast box items right at the doorstep! 🤩🤩🤩 I’m so excited though I’m not exactly a Toastbox fan! So tml brunch will be Toastbox! 🤩

This is a variation of a moon salutation that I love to practice in the evenings, during the new moon, full moon, during menstruation or when I'm low on energy but still want to moon. With no 'vinyasa's, it's a little less energetic, but extremely nourishing and adequately stimulating for the body. ⠀
By incorporating standing postures (triangle, goddess, star) it's still fairly grounded; by including asanas close to the ground (low lunge, skandasana) it allows you to connect with the draw of gravity. As you're moving through the flow, notice any areas of unnecessary effort, and using your exhales, release and yield to the draw of the earth. Hope you enjoy :)",,13,1

He goes to gym frequently and sometimes he can over exert himself and resulted in back pain and soreness.

That's where he would request me to help him release his tension and body aches using the galvanic spa. Look at how the gel changes to yellowish sticky which symbolizes lymphatic toxic being extracted.

One device with multiple usages for scalp, face & body. ❤❤ Ageloc Lymphatic Drainage Spa is a form of very light massage using ageloc technology to encourage lymph flow in the body. 

It is particularly good for:
- detoxification
- edema
- pre and post surgery
- cellulite treatments 
- scar tissue
- spider veins
- redness and acne

""Ai Jiak Ba Hu Mai?""
was probably the one of the most repeated questions I've heard during mealtimes in my growing up years. 🍽
(It means ""want to eat meat floss or not?"")
.
Being raised in a Teochew household by my grandparents, porridge was probably consumed at least 5 times a week. 
My grandmother, the head chef, thought that Ba Hu was a perfect companion to porridge, and it was undeniably so. 🤤
.
It was only after becoming a mother myself that I was introduced to healthier versions of Ba Hu - Salmon Floss & Tilapia Floss!
The benefits of fish need no further explanation👍.
Under @Eessentialsg, Mamacooks Fish Floss recently went through a facelift to bring to you a cuter, more compact and thicker box, 3 sachets per box! Simply drop a box into your bag and you're all set to go!
.

1) Salmon Fish Floss (Seasoned for 9M+)
2) Tilapia Fish Floss (Seasoned for 9M+)
3) Tilapia Fish Floss (Unseasoned for 6M+)
.

.
1️⃣ Indian Mural @ Kampong Glam
Mural bertema suku Indian kayak foto diatas pasti sering kamu lihat di socmed. Lokasinya berada di dekat jalan utama, membuat mural di Haji Lane, Kampong Glam ini mudah untuk ditemui!
.
2️⃣ Coffee Story @ Near A.R.C
Bergambar  bapak – bapak arab lagi bikin teh tarik, ada uncle – uncle yang rebus kopi dan ada anak anak nuangin espresso. Mural yang ini berada di sisi tembok sebuah coffee shop bernama A.R.C. Buat nyari mural ini kayaknya lebih gampang cari A.R.C dulu, baru ngintip ke tembok di depannya. Lokasi A.R.C ada di 29 Sultan Gate.
.
3️⃣ Satay Club @ Kampong Gelam
Kalaupas lagi lewat Jalan Sungai Pinang nggak akan kelewat sih karena warnanya cerah dan lukisannya lumayan besar. Adanya tepat di depan Hotel Nuve. Lukisannya ada 2 tema, yang satu tentang keluarga yang lagi makan satai ramai-ramai dan di sebelahnya ada tukang satai juga.
.
4️⃣ Treehouse @ Jalan Sultan
Gambarnya berupa pohon dengan deretan ayam di pojok bawah. Yang ini mungkin agak jarang keliatan. Lokasinya memang nggak jauh dari hostel 5footway inn Bugis. Tepatnya di Jalan Sultan yang dekat persimpangan dengan Beach Road.
.
👉🏻Kampong Glam adalah perpaduan yang indah antara sejarah dan budaya dengan pemandangan trendi. Banyak art street warna warni dan dipenuhi banyak toko!🥰

Things got worse when the cleaning service fee doubled their pricing back in 2018. We were forced to make the change to use disposable plates and utensils instead.

Of course, we too understood the importance of sustainability and the pollution caused using plastic packaging daily but then came Covid-19, and everyone viewed single-use packaging as a better packaging alternative from a hygiene point of view. We were actively sourcing for a sustainable option but prices for most eco-friendly packaging were not very pocket friendly for us. 

But today, we are happy to share that we found THE option! Using new sugar cane fibre boxes that don’t cost the earth each time you indulge in our biryani 😉 We also encouraged customers to bring their container to enjoy takeaway discounts at the stall and help reduce the use of plastic packaging on earth.

Tiny steps to help make the world a better place. What do you guys think?

As you've realized, this time I gave prizes to every participating student! I used to give prizes to the top performers of each category in the past concerts I've organized,  but I realized that there are some students who are just way stronger than others and they keep getting the prizes. This has led to some of my students being discouraged as they have also put in effort - one of them cried when she reached home after the previous concert. So, this time, instead of rewarding students according to how well they have played for the concert, I decided to award them according to their individual strengths and efforts. In my studio, there is no best or favorite student. You are all my favourite. 😄👍🏻

「肚腩＋腰間贅肉，都好討厭啊！！！😢😢」應該有不少人每天看著自己的「游泳圈」，然後不禁便會道出這句話吧……編便是其中一個，心裡總是默默想著如何把它拋走！但編建議的並不是要追求低體重，而是必須以一個✅健康方式來改善身體線條！
.
Y小姐的個案正正符合編所說的，Y小姐在一個月前開始飲用CM LESS修身系列，雖然體重只下降了1.7公斤，大約3.75磅，卻完美對付頑固肚腩😍，輕鬆變回平坦的小腹。不忌吃，不運動，亦能有如此效果！（編還是建議大家保持適量運動，效果更佳喔😎😎！）

想了解更多吧😜？編來安利一下這個系列，排便＋鎖糖＋燃脂＋排水＋加強代謝一套全包。吃下去的產品，健康＋安全才是最大考量吧！（舉手同意！）而CM LESS修身系列是經香港政府認可獨立化驗証實，❌不含315種常見西藥及瀉藥的喔～Y小姐手上拿的便是STEP 4 – 排水去腫，特別適合經常臉腫腳腫的朋友～配方採用法國及美國專利成分👨‍🔬，有效極速趕走多餘廢水，改善血液循環🌪起床看到自己的水腫臉，編便會習慣性從抽屜裡拿出一包STEP 4沖水喝下去🤫。最重要的是每次皆能即日見效，重獲巴掌臉！想要即日消水腫的神奇體驗，編非常推薦你選購這盒⭐水腫救星⭐喔！

Things are starting to look up in Singapore and I’m pretty hopeful for the rest of the year. Not hopeful about travel back home to the USA, as any leisure travel still seems many months away, but just hopeful that we won’t need to lockdown again. Masks are mandatory here and we check into everywhere we go with our ID and a QR code. It took a while to get used to and get the kids onboard with mask-wearing (kids above the age of two need to wear them) but they were pretty excited about their storm trooper face shields and are used to all the hand washing and sanitizing. We can have up to five people in our house so play dates are back on which has been a game changer for the kids. They love being able to see their friends, and frankly I love getting to see mine. Things are slower but that’s actually been a really nice change. After that 145 day stretch at home, our family is relishing these little victories.

For a few moments let yourself be that child again.🎀 I didn’t read the quote of the day till I returned home from brunch. Coincidentally, I feel the joy of a child again today buying stuff children likes. 🤣 Today on my way to brunch, I chanced upon an ex-classmate’s fb account. We lost touched after Sec school but I remembered her as a fun loving person who took nice photos. So I was really happy that she is a photographer now! Omg! 🥰 I hope she will accept my FB friend invite as I would love to reconnect with her! Next, I found a pretty corner in the cafe that I went several times but did not notice. It’s a high bar table facing a wall with nicely hanged pictures. 🥰 I had a nice quiet moment with my ear plugs and ebook and delicious brunch. After that, I unknowingly walked into Chateraise and bought a big family cooler bag of 12 assorted ice-creams! Omg I’m not exactly an ice-cream person but I think I will like them. (Hubby might like them better!)🥰 Then, I went to Cold Storage to buy newly arrived pretty flowers and took the last box of Hersey’s Mint Creme Wafers off the shelf. This mint wafers are really nice if you are a mint person like me. 🥰 Finally, went to NTUC to buy my favourite SA Kromco Ruby Apples. These apples are not as hard as the New Zealand ones. Didn’t noticed the apples were 1-for-1 till a kind NTUC auntie pointed out to me at the self checked-out counter and urged me to get 1 more pack! Omg I simply love getting “1-for-1” offer! On my way to get the additional pack of apples, I saw my favourite Starbucks Caramel Latte stacked up in a new shelf! No wonder I couldn’t find it earlier. 🥰 Oh and I learnt to play my first song on my ukulele - You Are My Sunshine. 🥰 All very mundane stuffs but enough to make me happy on a Sunday. Next, I’m gonna try my best to bake a nice cake for my parents tonight. 🥰❤️ Happy Sunday!

You know it's good when your LO keeps asking for another helping. The photos did not do the dish justice cos I took the pictures hastily as my friends were waiting for lunch. I love the outburst of flavour when we cut open the baking paper before serving. You can add some wine to enhance the flavour too! ===============================================
INGREDIENTS:
• 1 slab of salmon
• 1/2 potato, sliced thinly
• 1/2 onion, sliced thinly
• A few cherry tomato, halved
• 3 cloves garlic, minced
• 1 stalk coriander, minced finely
• Olive oil

METHOD:
1) Spread the potato, onion and lay salmon on top of 2 pc of baking paper
2) Add the cherry tomatoes, garlic and coriander. Drizzle a generous amount of olive oil on the fish
3) Seal up the fish in the baking paper
4) Place it in the AF for about 12 min at 200 degree celcius. 
5) Remove and cut open the baking paper. Serve hot.

Dan semua diundang untuk menengok Istana secara virtual!🥰

✅Selain ada tur virtual sekitar Istana, ada juga preview National Museum's latest live interactive series ""Zoom into History"" dan juga the Asian Civilisations Museum's virtual galleries! Buat kamu yang penasaran, jangan lupa buka facebook jam 10 pagi waktu Singapura besok!🥰

💜Alih alih pameran udara yang mengesankan, parade militer, dan pertunjukan multikultural dan kembang api yang menakjubkan, tahun ini akan dirayakan dengan serba digital. Tanggal 9 agustus nanti akan dimulai dengan morning parade,  jet tempur F-15SG yang mengitari pulau, paduan suara virtual, hingga kembang api yang diatur di 10 wilayah sehingga bisa dinikmati dari rumah! 💗💗

Let’s spend our precious long weekend wisely! It’s boring but I’m eating bread again because hubby says we have to finish the bread before it expires tomorrow. So I tried to find the most interesting way to eat it! Pairing my sliced bread with canned tuna, cheese and a special star fried egg using my new Daiso egg mould. It looks like I’m eating a lot of sandwiches but actually it’s just 4 slices of bread. Perception okay. 🤣 Oh I also placed in my all time favourite- Bourbon Ajisalon assorted rice crackers! This is my no 2 favourite Japanese titbits. My no 1 is the fried noodle chicken snack. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ What a filling brunch! 😋😋😋Happy Saturday! 🤩

Bone is a poor conductor of heat, it takes longer for bone to heat up! So when you grill steaks with bone-in, the meat that is touching the bone winds up being less cooked and therefore having a smoother (buttery) texture, which when eaten with connected meat that is slightly further away, you get a lovely flavour and mouthfeel😋 YUM.

(用蕎麦粉烘焙的花型饼干）这像花形状的京都伝統焼菓子叫「そばぼうろ」(Soba Bouro)。以蕎麦(Soba)粉、小麦粉、蛋和砂糖製成的烘饼。咬一口、在口中散發出淡淡的甜味。使用蕎麦粉、口感独特＋非常脆。Donki Sg 可以买到 $5.5 /1包.
