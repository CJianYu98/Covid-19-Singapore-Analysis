In SG, we had not duly restricted air travel nor insisted on precautionary mask usage. By end February, masks were required and some expected a sort of lock-down - but meanwhile it was much business like usual. By the time the circuit-breaker was announced to be put into effect a fortnight later, there was already six weeks or more for MOM Enforcement unit to ensure the FW dorms and communal living supervisors will have implemented the same strict (if not stricter) norms than what was recommended for Singapore generally. This did not happen. The few cases seemingly from Mustafa then were reported and when testing - and only then - were implemented at the affected dormitories that the situation (of clusters erupting) became known as the data showed it had escalated prior to testing. The eventual handling was excellent but the cost of caring for the 50,000 odd infected, not to mention 'exposed' persons has yet to be revealed. The Opposition should call for an independent Public Inquiry into that matter, not for fault finding, but because it represents what has to be accepted as a real, known risk, as long as we have hundreds of thousands in this type of communal living, not to mention aged homes, student dormitories and the such. The data will help us in the future. But Mrs Teo must cooperate and not conceal critical information however condemning. üïäüíê",2020-09-04 00:03:43+00:00,272
