an eclectic mix of local guided tours and workshops in december will offer a behind-the-scenes look at geylang's red light district and migrant worker dormitories, singpost's mail distribution centre and the kelongs off changi point, in the inaugural my community festival.

other programmes include tours around toa payoh’s funeral parlours, where an undertaker will show participants how bodies are prepared for funerals, and visits to traditional craftsmen including tay guan heng, who is believed to be singapore’s last joss stick maker.

the festival is being organised by my community, a non-profit organisation that promotes community heritage by managing community museums and holding neighbourhood tours and festivals.
