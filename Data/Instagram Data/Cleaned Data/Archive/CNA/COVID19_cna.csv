Think about it: Your phone is the first and last thing you touch daily, which means you’re putting an inordinate amount of microbes on it – and these thrive there because of the heat from the devices.

Citing a study done on the coronavirus, Dr Jyoti Somani of the Division of Infectious Diseases at National University Hospital pointed out that the virus can survive on common phone materials such as glass, metal and ceramic ""on average about three days in our local climate"", and ""a shorter period of time on aluminum.” If you’re afraid that cleaning with alcohol might damage your precious (and expensive) phones, try using a solution that’s one part rubbing alcohol (with an alcohol percentage of 70) and one part water to dilute it.

And it’s always best to use phone covers and have a screen protector – cleaning these is safer than a naked phone. Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #coronavirus #COVID19 #hygiene #health #handphone #mobilephone (Photo: Pexels)"

The magazine’s inside sources have also revealed theatre closures have had a big impact on profit margins, with revenues in markets like Hong Kong and Taiwan dropping by 50 per cent and sales in Italy grinding to a halt.

Volunteers dressed up as pocong – traditional ghostly figures in Indonesia that are typically wrapped in white shrouds with powdered faces – walk the streets to basically scare villagers into staying at home.

At first it didn’t work because people actually went out to catch them walking around, but organisers have since changed tactics – they’re now launching surprise patrols. And it seems to be working. According to one resident, “Since the pocong appeared, parents and children have not left their homes. And people will not gather or stay on the streets after evening prayers.” Boo!

Singapore’s Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong made the announcement on Apr 14. Individuals who are caught refusing to wear a mask will be fined S$300 on their first offence, while those who flout the rule a second time will be fined S$1,000.

Foreign residents caught breaching these rules might have their work passes or permanent resident status revoked.

There are some exemptions: Children below the age of two don’t need to, and adults who are exercising (running and jogging) only need to put once they stop.

But that begs the question – how do you clean your reusable cloth masks? Experts say you should wash it as often as you wash your underwear, meaning after every use. You should also boil it in water once in a while.

The 99-year-old war veteran has become a celebrity by raising at least £6.4 million for Britain's health service with a walk around his garden during the COVID-19 crisis.

Captain Tom, who has used a walking frame to move around since breaking his hip, has set himself the target of walking the 25m around his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday later this month.

The story has lifted the hearts of a nation stuck in lockdown for the last month and weary of the relentless wave of grim news. Moore had originally aimed to raise £500,000 but that target has been smashed as media attention from around the globe has zoomed in on his garden in Bedfordshire, central England.

His son-in-law Colin Ingram said Moore wanted to give something back after receiving such good care from the state-run National Health Service (NHS) when he broke his hip two years ago and in subsequent hospital visits. ""We said we'd give him a pound a lap, and thank goodness I didn't say I'd match any money he raised,” quipped Ingram.

Raising money for the NHS has given Moore a new lease of life and the veteran has no plans to stop, even though he is due to hit his 100-lap target on Thursday morning. Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #CaptainTom #walking #fundraising #coronavirus #COVID19 #inspiration (Photo: Reuters)"

The five-member fictional team made its debut on the Gov.sg website on Apr 21 but was taken down less than a day, with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) saying it’s “undergoing a review” after receiving a lot of feedback about the characters.

Virus Vanguard was a collaboration between Gov.sg and art collective Band of Doodlers. The plan was to create a comic series to convey the different aspects of the ""circuit breaker"" measures aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. But some characters were criticised for too much levity while others felt the emphasis could have been on healthcare workers.

But one character drew much of the flak – MAWA Man, a Manchester United-supporting character who really doesn’t like Liverpool FC. The name, Must Always Walk Alone, was a jibe at the latter’s motto You’ll Never Walk Alone. An online petition by LFC supporters to withdraw the character received more than 500 signatures.

Band Of Doodlers founder Mas Shafreen has apologised, saying the characters “came across insensitive… A group of us, including myself, wanted to create superhero characters to show appreciation for our frontliners, including healthcare workers, and how we can battle this together.” Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #VirusVanguard #superhero #MAWA #YNWA #LFC #coronavirus #COVID19 (Photo: Gov.sg)"

Won’t lie – that week was pretty stressful. I could hear sirens and police helicopters every night, and the occasional sound of gunshots.

The best defenses against bathroom contagions are a mask, social distancing, limiting the surfaces you touch with your hands and hand hygiene.

1. Consider larger bathrooms with multiple stalls because they have more air circulation.

2. If someone exits a bathroom stall or a single bathroom right before you, try waiting at least 60 seconds before entering – especially if the toilet seat lid is up, signifying more plume.

3. Skip the paper toilet seat covers. They are likely placebo – we have no idea if they offer protection from bacteria or viruses – and they could easily be contaminated with toilet plume, so touching them with your hands could be a source of infectious transmission.

4. If you need to dispose of a menstrual product in one of those little containers, touch the lid with a wad of toilet paper and sanitise your hands after. Those lids are among the worst surfaces in the bathroom stall: Touched by many unwashed hands and showered with infectious plume.

5. If the toilet has a lid, close it before you flush so it traps the plume. Think of the lid as a mask for the toilet.

6. If an automated toilet is flushing, step back because those things spray.

7. How you dry your hands after washing probably doesn’t matter; paper towels or dryers are likely equal. But do avoid shared, reusable hand towels.

8. Get out of there quickly. Chatting in bathrooms is the new smoking in bathrooms – it’s a relic of the past. If you have to open a door to exit, use hand sanitiser after you leave.
