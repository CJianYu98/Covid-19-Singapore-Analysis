The urgent need for support from landlords is a sentiment many restaurant owners share. “There is so much rental pressure on restaurants where the operating cash flow is just two months out. If restaurants and retailers don’t get help from landlords, we cannot survive. (The landlords) have made so much money from us tenants over the last few years and now is the time they really have to step up to help us,” said Cynthia Chua of Spa Esprit Group, which includes establishments like Tiong Bahru Bakery.

Substantial rentals are not the only challenge facing Singapore’s restaurants today. “There’s a lot of uncertainty as to when produce is coming in. Right now, we can get fish locally or from Malaysia, but with meat (mostly from Australia), the worry is what will happen when stocks here run out” said Cheek and Cloudstreet chef-owner Rishi Naleendra.

But the greatest challenge is the lack of traffic. Relish’s Willin Low said: “If people stop coming out, then there’s no point in keeping a restaurant open.” Read the story on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #Singapore #food #restaurant #F&B #coronavirus #COVID19 #safedistancing #socialdistancing (Photo: Instagram/Tiong Bahru Bakery)"

SPOT is a robodog that reminds people to keep to safe distancing measures and she made her debut on May 8 as part of a two-week pilot trial conducted by NParks and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group.

SPOT will be deployed along a 3km stretch in the River Plains section of the park during off-peak hours. As well as broadcasting messages (the voice is female, in case you're wondering) reminding visitors of social distancing measures, SPOT is fitted with cameras and analytics tools to estimate the number of people in the park. These cameras will not be able to track or recognise specific individuals, and no personal data will be collected, said the authorities. The robot, built by Boston Dynamics, is controlled remotely but accompanied by at least one NParks officer.

Should the pilot prove successful, NParks will consider deploying the robot during the morning and evening peak hours, and also study plans to send SPOT to other parks such as Jurong Lake Gardens. SPOT is also being trialled at the a COVID-19 community isolation facility at Changi Exhibition Centre, to deliver essential items such as medicine to patients. #robodog #Singapore #SPOT #safedistancing #exercise #cycling #jogging #park (Photos: AFP, Reuters)"

It looks like that creepy robodog in that Black Mirror episode. Except that “this one’s a jaunty yellow,” he joked.

But Colbert said he preferred his dog to be “cuter, cuddlier and less dystopian” and suggested an alternative: The Bennybot 9000. Which is basically his pet dog Benny, who is “ready to be deployed in public parks to spread his message of safety – and steal your shoes and bite your thighs.” Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #StephenColbert #robodog #Singapore #safedistancing #socialdistancing #Netflix #BlackMirror #Benny #pet #dog #dogsofInstagram (Photos: YouTube/The Late Show With Stephen Colbert)"

Those who can include children aged 12 and below, and people with health conditions that have a hard time breathing or have medical difficulties wearing masks for long periods of time. Face shields will also be allowed for people who are speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture-style setting (and are able to maintain safe distancing).

Aside from sticking to groups of five, wearing masks and safe distancing, what else should you do at the restaurant? Here are a few extra tips you might want to consider.

SCENARIO 1: GOING IN AND SITTING DOWN
If possible, try to scoot out of your seat without touching it. Or ask for a table with regular chairs if you’re not good at hands-free scooting.

SCENARIO 2: YOU’RE HANDED THE MENU OR A TABLET TO ORDER
Consider using the napkin or a tissue to hold and flip the menu. If you’re given an tablet, place it on the table to minimise contact. Maybe ask the waiter to take your order instead. Wipe the iPad’s screen with an alcohol wipe before using it. After using the menu, disinfect your hands immediately.

SCENARIO 3: TIME TO EAT – AND REMOVE YOUR MASK
Place the used mask on a clean tissue, and clean your hands before eating or drinking, and clean your hands again before putting it back on. Alternatively, keep it in a resealable bag instead of leaving it on the table – or change to a new mask after a meal.

SCENARIO 4: YOU’VE CHOKED ON CHILLI OR DRINKS AND NEED TO COUGH
It’s good practice to cover your mouth with a tissue – and dispose of this and clean your hands after.

SCENARIO 5: YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
Use a piece of tissue or toilet paper to open the door. If you want to be extra safe, apply alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you return to the table.

SCENARIO 6: TIME TO PAY – CASH, PAYWAVE OR CARD?
The best option is contactless payment. If you have no choice but to pay with cash or card, don’t touch your face after you’ve put your change or card back into your wallet. And use the alcohol-based hand sanitiser the F&B establishment has provided after you're done with your transaction.

CHOOSE A GYM THAT IS WELL-VENTILATED
Exercising outdoors is still your best bet. If not, choose a gym that’s spacious and well-ventilated – and the air’s not recirculated, if possible.

WIPE DOWN EQUIPMENT BEFORE AND AFTER USE
Avoid touching those nasty respiratory droplets on the kettlebells or medicine ball from fellow gym-goers by wiping these. Other tips include laying down a towel when using gym machines and bringing your own gear when applicable.

WEAR WORKOUT GLOVES IF YOU CAN’T WIPE
If pausing mid-exercise to disinfect is not practical, wear gloves. And don’t use your phone when you’re wearing them to avoid contaminating it. When you’re ready to hit the shower, remove the gloves first, then your mask.

DON’T SPOT YOUR BUDDY DURING WEIGHT TRAINING AND AVOID GROUP CLASSES
Safe distancing, folks.

SPACE OUT AND BYO YOGA MAT
To disinfect your mat, spritz both sides with a disinfecting spray before and after every use.

IT’S OKAY TO CHALK UP
CrossFitters, powerlifters, boulderers and climbers count on chalk to keep their palms and fingers dry, and improve their grip. But the use of chalk also means it gets everywhere – even the very air you breathe. Can COVID-19 hitchhike on those fine chalk particles and get inhaled into our lungs? The odds are low.

TAKE CARE IN AND OUT OF THE POOL
Can COVID-19 spread through the water in swimming pools? Currently, there is no evidence demonstrating transmission via swimming pool water – and proper pool maintenance and use of chlorine helps too. But take care, when you’re out – if shower rooms are crowded, just wash up at home.

In her version, which you can see on her Instagram account, Chong (or her Ah Lian persona) sticks with the usual snow-filled background that is synonymous with the original meme, but she also included images of the coronavirus floating around as she sings into a bunch of flowers.

The lyrics, translated into English, remind people about the “Virus floating around / Don’t play the fool” and also to wear a mask and wash your hands “if not, COVID won’t be gone.” “We are still in Doskong Orleng (Dorscon Orange) ok!” she wrote.
