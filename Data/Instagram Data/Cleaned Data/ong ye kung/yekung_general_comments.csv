8,"Crowne Plaza Changi Airport is our airport hotel. Recently, three workers there got infected with COVID-19, most likely from foreign air crew who stayed there during their layover. 

So the hotel closed, and worked with @moh_singapore and CAAS to implement tighter procedures to keep the staff and guests safe. 

@cpchangiairport recently opened again. I visited them to see the changes. 

The hotel is now only open to foreign air crew, no staycations. 

It is divided into Green and Amber zones, depending on potential exposure to the virus. 

More measures were taken to ensure foreign air crew stay in their rooms, with contactless laundry and food delivery. 

Much care is taken to ensure staff working in the Amber zone wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and are properly trained. 

Some 180 staff have also gone for vaccination. 

What left me the strongest impression was the kitchen and restaurant. It is a Green zone, where staff prepares the food and packs them. Across the demarcation of the restaurant is an Amber zone, where staff in full PPE collect the food to be delivered to the rooms. 

I met the kitchen staff, Ms Thulasi, who just returned to work after being infected with COVID-19. She said her symptoms were fortunately mild, and she was in very good spirits and just got her vaccination. When she was down, all her colleagues were quarantined, and all the management staff chipped in to help cook and clean the kitchen. 

There was a lot of positive spirit in this hotel despite what happened. I think that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why it has been voted the best airport hotel in the world.",2021-02-15 02:15:55+00:00,"Great story, thanks for sharing!",2021-02-15 14:07:49+00:00,5

In the year since, together with @singaporeair Group, we have brought home thousands of Singaporeans from all corners of the world. 

At the same time, we worked with our international partners so that foreign nationals could make their trips back. 

These operations required meticulous planning and close co-ordination, within and outside of Singapore. We are grateful for their support. 

It shows the unique Singapore spirit. We never leave our own out in the lurch.

COVID-19 has made us use technology to work smarter, and demonstrated that even as more people return to office to work, the peak hour rush and crush is totally unnecessary. 

So for staff who need to go back to office, I urge employers to have them travel off-peak. 

The Public Service is taking the lead, and the MOT Family is doing our part. 

At @ltasg, officers can report to work at 7.30am or 10am, or work from home for at least 50% of the time. @motsingapore too has similar practices.

It is a significant step. Most activities will resume, except certain larger scale ones with close interaction activities, that have potential to be mass spreading events. Social gatherings should have a maximum of five people. 
All the things we miss - sitting in coffeeshops or restaurants, bubble tea, tuition and enrichment classes, meeting up with boyfriends or girlfriends, can all resume. 
It took us a lot of sacrifice to get here, after a fairly long circuit breaker period, and a careful Phase 1 opening. But during this time, all of us co-operated, and we suppressed the virus transmission. 
From here, it is up to us again. We will all take care of our personal hygiene, adopt necessary precautionary measures, look out for one another. That way, we keep the virus under control in Phase 2. While we are all eager to meet up with friends and socialise, we will do so safely. No need to all rush out on Friday - everywhere will be full. Can take our time a bit, and ease into our social activities again. My daughter already told me I must wait for my Father√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Day dinner.

But the first step, on 2 Jun, should be a cautious one, to re-open schools safely. We will progressively bring back students to schools and Institutes of Higher Learning. 
How?

First, we will prioritise the return of those who need a higher level of care, like students in Special Education schools, as well as graduating cohorts who needs to prepare for national exams. 
Second, for students not in graduating cohorts, we will have a weekly rotation system so that different levels of students take turns to come to school and to do HBL. So for primary school, it will be P4 and P5 coming back to school and P1, P2, P3 doing HBL in week 1, and the reverse in Week 2. P6s will come back every day.

We aim to gradually have all students fully back in school after two cycles of weekly rotation, or four weeks.

We will also continue to support high needs students and children of parents who need to work and cannot find alternate childcare arrangement, and allow them to come to school on their HBL week. 
Many students will be excited to return to school. Parents may be looking forward to school opening too, especially if they have to return to work. But I am sure parents are also worried about their children√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s safety. Rest assured that we will take whatever precautions we can to ensure the well-being of all students and staff. 
Third, we will implement a stringent safe management system, including screening of anyone that comes into schools, good hygiene habits, group separation to prevent inter-mingling of students from different classes, and safe distancing which include the wearing masks/face shields by teachers and students.

First, we will prioritise the return of those who need a higher level of care, like students in Special Education schools, as well as graduating cohorts who needs to prepare for national exams. 
Second, for students not in graduating cohorts, we will have a weekly rotation system so that different levels of students take turns to come to school and to do HBL. So for primary school, it will be P4 and P5 coming back to school and P1, P2, P3 doing HBL in week 1, and the reverse in Week 2. P6s will come back every day.

We aim to gradually have all students fully back in school after two cycles of weekly rotation, or four weeks.

We will also continue to support high needs students and children of parents who need to work and cannot find alternate childcare arrangement, and allow them to come to school on their HBL week. 
Many students will be excited to return to school. Parents may be looking forward to school opening too, especially if they have to return to work. But I am sure parents are also worried about their children√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s safety. Rest assured that we will take whatever precautions we can to ensure the well-being of all students and staff. 
Third, we will implement a stringent safe management system, including screening of anyone that comes into schools, good hygiene habits, group separation to prevent inter-mingling of students from different classes, and safe distancing which include the wearing masks/face shields by teachers and students.

I can fully understand. This is an important milestone for you and your parents. But unfortunately, it is currently not safe to hold ceremonies. We don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to trigger a cluster of infections. Then a happy occasion will become a tragedy. 
I never attended any of my graduation ceremonies. I was lucky to receive overseas scholarships for my Bachelor√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s and later my Master√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s degrees. When I finished my undergraduate studies, I was immediately summoned to return to Singapore to serve my bond. Years later, when I finished my Master√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s, I rushed back because our first baby was going to pop anytime. So again I missed my graduation. 
The first time I donned a graduation gown was in 2015, after I became Minister for Education, and attended NUS√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ Commencement ceremony as guest-of-honour. 
Today, I am just glad I had a good education and can put what I have learned to good use.  I have never lamented not having attended my graduation ceremonies. I missed them for reasons more important than attending them. 
In a similar vein, after 23 years of marriage, my wife and I hardly remember our wedding dinner or ceremony, but we remember the times we spent together and bringing up our children.

If you are in your final year, trust me, years from now, you will not miss the graduation ceremony. You will remember that you graduated in an extraordinary year in history, where the human spirit was put to the most stringent of tests, and kindness and love in our communities helped us pull through.

In a similar vein, after 23 years of marriage, my wife and I hardly remember our wedding dinner or ceremony, but we remember the times we spent together and bringing up our children.

If you are in your final year, trust me, years from now, you will not miss the graduation ceremony. You will remember that you graduated in an extraordinary year in history, where the human spirit was put to the most stringent of tests, and kindness and love in our communities helped us pull through. 
But do mark the occasion at home with your loved ones. Take a nice picture and have a nice meal with your family. But I am sure you can come up with much better ideas to celebrate the occasion than mine.

I can fully understand. This is an important milestone for you and your parents. But unfortunately, it is currently not safe to hold ceremonies. We don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to trigger a cluster of infections. Then a happy occasion will become a tragedy. 
I never attended any of my graduation ceremonies. I was lucky to receive overseas scholarships for my Bachelor√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s and later my Master√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s degrees. When I finished my undergraduate studies, I was immediately summoned to return to Singapore to serve my bond. Years later, when I finished my Master√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s, I rushed back because our first baby was going to pop anytime. So again I missed my graduation. 
The first time I donned a graduation gown was in 2015, after I became Minister for Education, and attended NUS√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ Commencement ceremony as guest-of-honour. 
Today, I am just glad I had a good education and can put what I have learned to good use.  I have never lamented not having attended my graduation ceremonies. I missed them for reasons more important than attending them. 
In a similar vein, after 23 years of marriage, my wife and I hardly remember our wedding dinner or ceremony, but we remember the times we spent together and bringing up our children.

If you are in your final year, trust me, years from now, you will not miss the graduation ceremony. You will remember that you graduated in an extraordinary year in history, where the human spirit was put to the most stringent of tests, and kindness and love in our communities helped us pull through. 
But do mark the occasion at home with your loved ones. Take a nice picture and have a nice meal with your family. But I am sure you can come up with much better ideas to celebrate the occasion than mine.

It really doesn‚Äôt make sense to on one hand,  call for draconian safe distancing measures and ironically, at the same time allow school to continue to run as normal albeit with measures and precaution.  It‚Äôs the biggest mass gathering in sgp right now.  Truth is, classes itself have at least 30/40 pax, and 300 at the cohort level.  It is almost impossible to maintain measures at all times.  Just drop by any school at any given day and have look at the lack of safe distancing at drop -offs and pick-ups as a case in point.  Kids may be less susceptible to the virus but are not entirely immune too.  They may also he asymptomatic carriers that go on to pass these to family members or others within their community.  Yes, it may not be inconvenient for working parents or parents of lower income brackets to miss work.  So pls make it optional.  Having schools open (even with caution) lends  little credibility to your argument.  There are always ways to tweak around a situation.  Pls look into it.  Thank you!",2020-03-31 13:04:00+00:00,194

COVID-19 test results, and soon, your vaccination status, may become very relevant information at the check-in and immigration counters for cross border travel. But they will need to be easily verifiable.

Airlines are foreseeing this. So @singaporeair is working with International Air Transport Association (#IATA), and #Affinidi, a local technology company founded by @temasekseen, to start a trial on digital verification for COVID-19 tests and soon, vaccinations.

Accredited labs will issue a health certificate - a QR code on mobile or printed on paper - to passengers, to be scanned and verified easily and securely by airlines and immigration officers using an app.

Hopefully, with the support of IATA, various airlines and authorities around the world, this can become the norm, and replace the yellow book.

I applaud the industry√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s initiative. @motsingapore and #CAAS will support this as much as we can, to make this a regional or international practice. We are #OneAviation team.

Zoom cannot replace some face-to-face business meetings, e.g. signing agreements, or discussing with key teams, getting to know key partners in person.

Connect@Changi, will provide the first of its kind facility to enable such meetings to be carried out safely.
