5,"Yesterday, some businesses such as barber shops, confectionery stores and pet supplies shops resumed operations again after a three-week closure due to stricter circuit breaker measures. These business premises will have to ensure strict precautionary measures to protect the public, such as safe distancing and wearing of face masks.

Businesses and workplaces that reopen have to adopt the SafeEntry app — a digital check-in system developed by @smartnation.sg and Digital Government Office to facilitate contact tracing. I am sure many of you have already used this — scanning the QR code with your phones, or checking in with your NRIC or SingPass app when you enter and exit a supermarket or mall.

Tapping on technology to help with contact tracing is one of the ways to manage the easing of the circuit breaker measures. While I understand this is inconvenient, we will learn and get used to it.

Looking around the world, you will realise that it has not been easy for countries to resume activities — with many seeing infection rates increase after doing so. So even after the circuit breaker period, we must continue to take precautions. Do remember, there is no need to rush out to the shops — go out only if you have to, exercise social responsibility, wash your hands regularly and wear a mask when you are out. Let us continue to stay vigilant and fight this battle together!
