2,"Parliament passed the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill today, after vigorous debate.
 
I support the Bill. Having served as a policeman for the first part of my public service career, I have seen my share of heart-wrenching crimes. In many cases, we are only able to deliver justice, by judiciously collecting and investigating the necessary evidence. This is our solemn duty to the victims and their families. We must enable our police officers to protect our people and keep Singapore safe. 
 
At the same time, we must respect personal privacy. The Bill today provides an important safeguard ‚Äî that the data collected through contact tracing systems will be used only for that purpose except where there is a need for police investigations relating to seven categories of serious offences, including murder and rape. 
 
Minister @vivianbalakrishnan, who oversees our Smart Nation effort, gave a very clear account on how we balance the needs of fighting COVID-19 with the privacy of our people, while ensuring that justice is also achieved for serious crimes.
 
The trust of our people is critical to containing the virus. I‚Äôm glad that over 80% of our people are using TraceTogether. The Bill passed today is an additional step to safeguard this trust. 
 
COVID-19 remains a clear and present threat. We must continue to remain united behind a shared purpose to overcome this crisis, and emerge even stronger as a society.
