13,"“Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much”. These were the words of Helen Keller, an author and educator, who became blind and deaf at a young age.
 
Her words continue to ring true decades after her lifetime. Indeed, this is the spirit of Singapore Together, where we pull together our energy and resources, to help the vulnerable among us. The pandemic has disrupted lives, especially for those who are disadvantaged. But I’m heartened that many have stepped up.
 
Together with @edwintong and @tinpeiling I met staff and volunteers of the Care Community Services Society (CCSS) this morning, and several of their corporate partners. CCSS provides support for families, seniors and children who need extra help. Some of their corporate partners have been supporting CCSS for many years.  Although the volunteers have found it more difficult to run their operations, they have also been pleasantly surprised that many more people are coming forward to help.

Edwin, Pei Ling and I witnessed the launch of the SG Cares Volunteer Centres @ Geylang, which will be operated by CCSS. This new centre  seeks to grow volunteerism, build capabilities, and connect partners in the Geylang area to meet the needs of the local community.

To emerge stronger as a society, we must rally more Singaporeans to play a more active part in building our shared future. As we overcome the crisis and progress as a society, we must not leave anyone behind.
 
This latest SG Cares Volunteer Centre will add to our efforts to galvanise communities to action. I hope that the measures that I announced at #SGBudget2021, to encourage giving and support for our social sector agencies, will bring even more people to donate and volunteer.
 
My thanks to the team at CCSS and all our charitable organizations for your ‘heart’ work! Let us work together to build a caring and inclusive #SingaporeTogether.

24,"Last year, I launched the Singapore Together Emerging Stronger Conversations (ESC) as a platform for Singaporeans to reflect, share their stories, reimagine a post-COVID Singapore, and to forge a way forward through this crisis of a generation. ESC builds on the Singapore Together movement launched in 2019, for us to build a democracy of deeds and a society in action.&nbsp;

If you have participated in any of the ESCs this past year, you might be interested in today’s ESC report. It takes stock of what fellow Singaporeans like yourself have shared at these conversations over the past months.&nbsp;

Our future is bright and hope-filled, when we work together as one Singapore on ideas, issues and solutions. The ESCs are ongoing and you can also be a part of it by accessing the online ESC report at www.sg/EmergingStrongerConversations.&nbsp;

⁣
This is the commitment of @ntucsingapore, and is also a commitment that my Cabinet colleagues and I share.⁣
⁣
Our unionists played a key role in helping our workers and businesses during this crisis of a generation — maintaining a good pulse of the ground situation, helping affected workers transit into new job opportunities, and strengthening support for vulnerable worker segments.&nbsp;⁣
⁣
The crisis is far from over, but our collective tripartite effort to preserve livelihoods and protect our workers has borne fruit. Yesterday, the Ministry of Manpower reported that unemployment rates fell for the second consecutive month in December 2020, with resident employment rebounding to pre-COVID levels.⁣
⁣
For #SGBudget2021, I had a dialogue with more than 200 union leaders on Wednesday evening to hear their perspectives and gather feedback on where we can do better. As usual, they were candid, constructive and collaborative — a hallmark of our brand of tripartism.⁣
⁣
Growing our economy and rebuilding from a crisis will always be a tripartite effort. Just as we had recovered from and thrived after previous crises, I am confident that we can overcome COVID-19 and emerge stronger.",2021-01-29 11:41:01+00:00,If only we have #EveryWorkerMatters boss,2021-01-29 14:57:55+00:00,5
37,"Wishing our Hindu community a fulfilling and meaningful Thaipusam!&nbsp;

With the pandemic, celebrations might be more muted, but no less meaningful. In my usual commute past Tank Road over the past week, I could see preparations underway – with a large tentage providing shelter, and barriers to guide the safe movement of devotees. Many devotees were able to offer their prayers at Sri Thendayuthapani Temple today, and prayer proceedings were also live streamed online.&nbsp;

As we mark the Hindu community’s holy festival, it is also timely to reflect on and appreciate the race and religious harmony that we have achieved over the past decades. Yesterday’s detention of a youth who was planning to attack two mosques was a stark reminder that our peace and stability must not be taken for granted.&nbsp;

As our society becomes more diverse, we must work even harder to build a shared future with a stake for everyone, and keep at bay the forces of division and polarisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

As much as COVID-19 has stressed healthcare systems around the world, the virus has also given new impetus for healthcare innovation. Human health and potential are key pillars of our R&D plans for the next five years, which I announced last month. I am also glad that the drive for innovation is pervasive across all our public healthcare institutions.⁣

This partnership brings together CGH’s clinical and research expertise and Shimadzu’s diagnostic and analytical capabilities.&nbsp;⁣

51,"A year since the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in Singapore, the virus has taken the world by storm. 

I was invited to speak at the inaugural @temasekshophouse Conversation yesterday on “Do Good, Together"" on COVID-19 lessons for Disease X. 

The lessons from SARS in 2003 put us in a better position for COVID-19. But COVID-19 also taught us that the nature of each virus, and indeed, each crisis, is different. There will be more lessons to be learnt, and some to be unlearnt, before this crisis is over. The key is to stay nimble and learn as we go. But I shared the fundamentals that will strengthen our overall resilience in preparation for the next global pandemic — continued investment in science and tech, enhancing global cooperation, and strengthening our sense of solidarity and unity in good times.

I thank @temasekfoundation for organising this series of conversations. I hope that the event has galvanized more stakeholders — including companies and philanthropies — to further step forward to overcome COVID-19 and build a more resilient future, for Singapore and the world.

I plan to send off 2020 with gratitude, and enter 2021 with determination.
 
My gratitude is for everyone who made it possible to bring us safely through the year — our courageous healthcare workers who kept us safe, our essential workers who kept us going, and volunteers in every field who continued to look out for those in need. I am also thankful to my colleagues in the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19, the Emerging Stronger Taskforce and my team at @mof_sg.
 
Most of all, I am grateful for Singaporeans’ unity, resilience, solidarity and fortitude this year — for having so much heart and spirit, and for adapting to the crisis and adhering to safe management measures, and for inspiring, encouraging and supporting one another through this period. You have kept me going, and you have been my reason to keep working hard.
 
My determination for 2021 is to ensure that we emerge from the year stronger as we gradually resume a greater degree of normalcy and rebuild our economy. There are many unknowns and uncertainties ahead, but as long as we stay united and grow our adaptive capacities for change, we are in a good position to deal with the challenges ahead.
 
As we approach the last few days of 2020, do join me to thank the people who have made a difference to us and our loved ones this year. Do remember to stay vigilant even as we embark on Phase 3.
 
So how do you plan to face the new year?

I plan to send off 2020 with gratitude, and enter 2021 with determination.
 
My gratitude is for everyone who made it possible to bring us safely through the year — our courageous healthcare workers who kept us safe, our essential workers who kept us going, and volunteers in every field who continued to look out for those in need. I am also thankful to my colleagues in the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19, the Emerging Stronger Taskforce and my team at @mof_sg.
 
Most of all, I am grateful for Singaporeans’ unity, resilience, solidarity and fortitude this year — for having so much heart and spirit, and for adapting to the crisis and adhering to safe management measures, and for inspiring, encouraging and supporting one another through this period. You have kept me going, and you have been my reason to keep working hard.
 
My determination for 2021 is to ensure that we emerge from the year stronger as we gradually resume a greater degree of normalcy and rebuild our economy. There are many unknowns and uncertainties ahead, but as long as we stay united and grow our adaptive capacities for change, we are in a good position to deal with the challenges ahead.
 
As we approach the last few days of 2020, do join me to thank the people who have made a difference to us and our loved ones this year. Do remember to stay vigilant even as we embark on Phase 3.
 
So how do you plan to face the new year?

148,"Hosted Japanese Minister of Administrative Reform Kono Taro for lunch this afternoon, together with @maliki_osman. He is in Singapore for a working visit.

I first met Minister Kono when I visited Tokyo last May to speak at the Nikkei Conference. Since then, COVID-19 has taken the world by storm, and disrupted our lives and livelihoods. Thankfully, digital technology has given us some degree of normalcy during the crisis — enabling us to stay in touch with our loved ones, purchase food and essentials online, continue with work and business meetings virtually, and adapt our business operations.

During lunch, we discussed the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation in our countries and globally. We also had a good exchange on how we can accelerate the digitalisation efforts in our governments.

Minister Kono spent some time in Singapore early in his career, when he worked for Fuji Xerox. He fondly remembered our local delights. Glad to have the opportunity to reacquaint him with chilli crab and with his favourite local fruit — durian!

I look forward to deepening the partnership between Singapore and Japan in the years to come.

216,"@gptwsg 2020 does more than recognise our great workplaces, it also recognises the spirit of resilience, grit and resourcefulness that our people have shown during COVID-19. 

Not surprisingly, the best workplaces put the health and safety of employees first — take decisive steps to protect their workers while empowering them to continue with their work.

But great workplaces also take care of their total wellbeing. Some of this year’s awardees send regular encouraging notes to employees and tend to the mental wellbeing of their team members. A great workplace also inspires and supports its employees to care about others, even in difficult times. 

Congratulations to all 13 Great Places to Work in Singapore’s recipients! You have made a commendable achievement in a difficult year. I hope you will continue to inspire other workplaces. You can read more about the Great Places to Work in Singapore here: go.gov.sg/gptwsg

⁣
We are ready to progress to Phase 3 in two weeks’ time, on 28 December. Looking back, we have come a long way since the Circuit Breaker. We brought the situation under control thanks to everyone playing their part and adhering to safe management measures. We have also boosted our pandemic defence by building up testing capacity and strengthening contact tracing.⁣
⁣
With Phase 3, one significant change is that groups of up to eight will be allowed, up from the maximum of five today. We will also allow more people at religious services and live events. Phase 3 will likely be with us for some time and we must continue to remain vigilant, as COVID-19 is still raging in many parts of the world.⁣
⁣
PM also announced that the first shipment of vaccines will arrive by the end of this month. If all goes to plan, we will have enough vaccines for everyone by Q3 2021. We also supported local efforts to develop a vaccine. Our researchers also developed test kits, including a neutralising antibody test kit that can check whether a vaccine is effective. Biomedical sciences is a deep capability that we will continue to grow as part of our Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan.⁣
⁣
As a key aviation node, Singapore can play a crucial role in the transportation of vaccines. In particular, vaccines require good cold chain management as they have to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius. The global distribution of vaccines will aid in our recovery as a logistics node. To strengthen our position as a logistics node, our Emerging Stronger Taskforce has also convened an industry-led Alliance for Action to enable the end-to-end digitalisation of supply chains.⁣
⁣
Now that vaccines are available, we can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. As we enter Phase 3, we can hopefully look forward to a better and brighter 2021. But we must continue to remain vigilant and not let our guard down.⁣

We also supported local efforts to develop a vaccine. Our researchers also developed test kits, including a neutralising antibody test kit that can check whether a vaccine is effective. Biomedical sciences is a deep capability that we will continue to grow as part of our Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan.⁣
⁣
As a key aviation node, Singapore can play a crucial role in the transportation of vaccines. In particular, vaccines require good cold chain management as they have to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius. The global distribution of vaccines will aid in our recovery as a logistics node. To strengthen our position as a logistics node, our Emerging Stronger Taskforce has also convened an industry-led Alliance for Action to enable the end-to-end digitalisation of supply chains.⁣
⁣
Now that vaccines are available, we can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. As we enter Phase 3, we can hopefully look forward to a better and brighter 2021. But we must continue to remain vigilant and not let our guard down.⁣

⁣
We are ready to progress to Phase 3 in two weeks’ time, on 28 December. Looking back, we have come a long way since the Circuit Breaker. We brought the situation under control thanks to everyone playing their part and adhering to safe management measures. We have also boosted our pandemic defence by building up testing capacity and strengthening contact tracing.⁣
⁣
With Phase 3, one significant change is that groups of up to eight will be allowed, up from the maximum of five today. We will also allow more people at religious services and live events. Phase 3 will likely be with us for some time and we must continue to remain vigilant, as COVID-19 is still raging in many parts of the world.⁣

The better we can protect ourselves from cyber-threats, the better we can use technology and the internet to enrich our lives and connect with one another, while keeping ourselves and our families safe.

Some of you may know — my first job was as a policeman. As a policeman, I learnt that the job of a policeman is not just to catch criminals and keep residents safe, but also to make friends with our community and support our community to be the best that it can be.&nbsp;⁣

Delighted to launch the annual Christmas Wonderland event last night. Had the chance to explore the dazzling Luminarie installations and this year’s highlights — the Path of Tranquility, and the Spalliera light installation that was handmade by Italian craftsmen. Inside the Flower Dome, the Poinsettia Wishes display is set amidst red, green and white floral arrangements. 
 
Poinsettia Wishes was lovingly put together and designed by the Ambassador of Netherlands to Singapore and Brunei, Margriet Vonno. I was moved by her story on how she picked red and white flowers — to reflect her milestone in life after she was declared cancer-free this year, and also as a tribute to Singapore.

⁣
This is an extraordinary year for all Singaporeans. We are in a good position today in the fight against COVID-19, thanks to the dedication and hard work of our Public Service. I thanked our public service leaders for steering their agencies through this very difficult year. I am proud of the grit, innovation and dedication that our public officers have shown, and for the sacrifices that they have made.⁣
⁣
The ability of our public service to work together as one to overcome COVID-19 has been a tremendous source of strength. We must sustain this momentum beyond the crisis, and expand our efforts to work with our businesses and communities. This way, we can tap on the strength of our diversity to forge a new social compact post-COVID.⁣
⁣
As we fight the pandemic, I am glad that our public service leadership continues to plan for the longer-term. COVID-19 has changed our operating context very significantly. And we will need to re-examine our strategies and policies in virtually every domain to emerge stronger from this crisis.",2020-12-04 14:23:48+00:00,"An efficient, effective, strong, stable, capable, reliable, innovative, dedicated, committed, non-corrupt and a good people's caring government means a better and brighter future for Singapore and Singaporeans!",2020-12-06 09:34:20+00:00,25

They, together with my Permanent Secretary, Directors and members in various divisions have supported me, @lawrencewongst and @indraneerajah on our four Budgets and two Ministerial Statements. They worked on the details of economic and social programmes to support our workers, families and businesses in Singapore in a most challenging year.
 
They have all been working non-stop since the beginning of this year, with the work becoming even heavier and more intense as the global COVID pandemic situation worsened and disrupted life and businesses. My special thanks to my MOF team, and to all staff in our public agencies and partners who have been working so closely with us!
 
We have started work on #Budget2021. I met some business leaders this afternoon to get their assessment of the current economic outlook, and discussed with them how the Government can partner businesses to emerge stronger. Lawrence listened to grassroots leaders’ Budget-related feedback over the weekend, and Indranee is kickstarting a series of Pre-Budget Conversations tonight. And we will have more sessions in the coming weeks.
 
Everyone can play a role — please join us in the Budget 2021 journey by sharing your ideas. The Budget reflects our collective needs and aspirations as a society, and charts our direction as a nation.

During my dialogue with DHL’s Christopher Ong and BT’s Wong Wei Kong, I shared that the pandemic has been a time of stress for workers and businesses. We see that some businesses have stayed resilient, as they committed to innovation and adapted to change early. Business leaders must also take care of their workers during these challenging times, helping to redesign jobs and reskill workers.⁣
⁣
I was also happy to catch up with the four award winners including Forrest Li, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Sea Limited, who won the 2020 Businessman of the Year Award. Together with his co-founders, Forrest grew Sea from strength to strength. Sea just announced they will be creating 500 new tech jobs for both entry-level and mid-career candidates. The company’s success shows that our companies are not constrained by our limited geography, especially in the digital world.⁣
⁣
NTUC @fairpricesg’s @seahkianpeng received the Outstanding CEO of the Year. He led NTUC FairPrice staff during the circuit breaker to ensure accessibility of essentials. Singaporean Jessica Tan, also the Co-CEO of Ping An Group, was awarded Outstanding Overseas Executive of the Year. While AEM Holdings Ltd took the Enterprise Award of the Year — a recognition of how it is advancing with advanced manufacturing solutions and intelligent automation.⁣
⁣
Congratulations to all our 2020 award winners! In these difficult times, you are beacons of inspiration for our businesses in their journey towards recovery, transformation and growth.⁣

⁣
I launched the the Global-Asia Insurance Partnership (GAIP) at the virtual Singapore⁣ International Reinsurance Conference 2020 on Monday. GAIP is tripartite partnership between the global insurance industry, regulators and academia. There are many structural protection gaps facing Asia, but pandemic risk and climate risk are two critical areas that demand our immediate and collective attention. The initial focus of GIAP will therefore include these two strategic risks.⁣
⁣
Behind every crisis is an opportunity. We can learn the lessons from COVID-19 and work together to create a more resilient and better future for all of us.⁣

On location, was a small group of us, including @vivianbalakrishnan and @s.iswaran. And we had almost 2,000 participants from around the world attending virtually. There will be more of such hybrid events in the future, as we resume more economic and social activities.⁣
⁣
This is one manifestation of how digital technology is transforming how we work and live. COVID-19 has brought out the value of digital technology more clearly and accelerated the pace of change. But as more people go online, crime and threats have also gone virtual. There are also other risks and downsides that we must address early.⁣

The best way to ensure that the digital arena improves our lives, accords with our values and improve the global commons is to work more closely together and strengthen international cooperation. This is especially important at a time when the rules-based multilateral order that has underpinned decades of growth and peace is under pressure.⁣
⁣
As we realise our vision to be a Smart Nation, we must further deepen our cybersecurity capabilities. I was happy to announce that the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore launched the Safer Cyberspace Masterplan tonight.⁣
⁣
As the digital space expands, we must strengthen cybersecurity through greater cooperation between countries, across businesses, and with our peoples. It is incumbent on each of us here to do our part. Only then can we create a safer and more secure cyberspace.⁣

389,"Had a good interview with @ch8sg’s Focus (焦点) programme for a two-part feature to mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Singapore-China diplomatic relations.⁣
⁣
Our diplomatic relations with China may only be 30 years old, but our friendship has much deeper roots. Over the years, our exchanges, including at the political, economic and people-to-people levels, have expanded and deepened significantly. Bilateral cooperation has continually evolved to take into consideration the priorities and strengths of both countries. Our cooperation has also grown and expanded in depth and scope in a wide range of areas. Cooperation with all countries is also especially important amidst the uncertainty and changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Singapore will continue to deepen our collaboration and relations with ASEAN member states, and with the rest of the world.⁣
⁣
During the interview, I also shared my thoughts on how the relations between both countries have evolved, the challenges and opportunities we face, and how we can continue to scale new peaks through greater collaboration.⁣

很高兴在时事节目《焦点》新中建交30年的特备节中分享我的感想和看法。⁣
⁣
新中两国虽然只有30年的外交关系，但是两国之间的友谊可以追溯到更久以前。长期以来，新加坡和中国在政治，经济和民间交流上有着紧密，多方面的联系。两国的合作兼顾彼此的需要，双边项目也横跨多个领域。接下来，新中关系要与时俱进，两国要探讨如何共同应对挑战，并且在新的领域合作，让双边关系更上一层楼。冠病疫情也带来许多不确定性和变化，这使我们与世界各国的合作变得更重要。新加坡也会继续加强与亚细安和世界各国的关系和友谊。⁣

407,"I had two matters to attend to before MPS this evening.
 
The first was a fire that broke out at a HDB lift landing along Bedok South Road last night. Thankfully, the fire was put out within minutes and no one was hurt. The fire was caused by discarded items at the lift landing area. My thanks to the @myscdf for handling the situation swiftly. I discussed with the Town Council how we can avoid such incidents in the future.
 
Following that, I headed to Bedok CC to check on the mask collection. The second round of free masks distributed by @temasekfoundation started today. Bedok residents can collect your masks anytime from now till 4 October. You can also collect your masks from vending machines at Bedok Interchange, Bedok CC or our RCs. Do visit mask.stayprepared.sg to check the nearest location for mask collection.
 
To keep everyone safe, each of us must do our part, from disposing unwanted items properly to wearing a mask when you are out. Only then can we protect what we cherish and have worked hard to build.

This inspiring line captures the dedication and hard work of the team at @doverparkhospice, as they continue to innovate and provide the best care to their patients despite the circumstances. 

As an Asian society, dying and death remain difficult conversation topics for most. Palliative care has made great strides since the hospice movement in Singapore started in the 1980s. But more can still be done to raise awareness of palliative care, especially with our population ageing rapidly. 

Dover Park Hospice has also come a long way since their founding in 1992. It has expanded its services over the years to better cater to the growing healthcare needs of our population. 

The generous support of donors helps keep Dover Park Hospice going. I was happy to support their first virtual Sunflower Charity Dinner. With generous support from individuals and businesses, the dinner raised more than one million dollars. 

If there is a silver lining from this crisis, it is how this virus has strengthened our sense of common purpose as a nation and brought out the best from each of us.

⁣
COVID-19 is a clear and present danger, but it will fade at some point. On the other hand, the threat of climate change is existential, and will be with us for generations. So even as we fight the virus, we are also building for the future. MOT, MND and MSE released their Addenda with plans on how we can strengthen our connectivity to the world and rejuvenate our city, while placing sustainability at the heart of what we do. We must build a low-carbon and climate resilient future, that is greener and more livable, in partnership with our people.⁣
⁣
And we must also defend what we have built up and our way of life. These efforts are highlighted in MINDEF’s and MHA’s Addenda. When COVID emerged as the new invisible enemy, both agencies pivoted their operations to contribute to this fight. I am confident that our servicemen will continue to protect Singapore from existing and new threats.⁣
⁣
But even as we build for tomorrow, we must help our people get through today, especially in sectors which are hardest-hit such as aviation and construction. We had earlier announced additional targeted measures to help these sectors through these difficult times.⁣
⁣
Together, we can overcome this crisis and emerge to a brighter, greener and more resilient future.⁣

The evening show was a loving tribute to our Singapore. It took us through the adjustments that Singaporeans have had to make, how our people have stepped up and supported one another, and how communities and individuals came together and paid tribute to frontline fighters.
 
It was a moving performance. Our deep appreciation to the performers and crew. They not only put in a huge amount of effort to practise and rehearse. But in order to keep everyone safe, they went through two swab tests and stayed at home, apart from rehearsals. I spoke to a few performers, who told me they were usually freelance dancers. Because of COVID-19, they were unable to perform and were glad to have this opportunity to do so. Let’s do our best in our fight against this virus, so that we can progressively resume our lives.
 
Special thanks to @filmr, the Creative Director for the show, to BG Frederick Choo and our NDP Exco, as well as to all performers, support staff and volunteers, for putting up a memorable parade and evening show despite the challenging environment.
 
A big THANK YOU to everyone!

This year’s Parade was held in the midst of COVID-19. So it has been scaled down. But it was no less meaningful. Our Guard of Honour contingent, wearing masks, marched with determination, to the majestic tune of our Combined Band. Our state flags fluttered with dignity in the air, carried by our Chinook helicopters. The presidential gun salute, executed on the Padang field, brought the roar of the guns at close range. Then six F15SG fighters roared over the Padang in a salute to the nation.⁣
⁣
This year’s highlight was our tribute to our frontline heroes. Sixteen individuals staff, representing tens of thousands of frontline workers — including our nurses, doctors, ambulance crew, enforcement officers, safe distancing ambassadors, and volunteers — in this fight against COVID-19 received the nation’s salute!⁣
⁣
Another first was how the Parade was brought to different parts of Singapore. Our F15SG fighters flew across eight hospitals, to pay tribute to our healthcare teams. Our state flag flew across Singapore. Our Navy, Police Coast Guards and MPA vessels sailed in formation. Our Red Lions landed in the heartlands, to loud applause. Our ever popular mobile column went to different parts of Singapore, greeted by cheers.⁣

今年，我代表李显龙总理，宣读华语的国庆献词。⁣
⁣
每年的8月9号，新加坡人都会一同观赏国庆庆典，欢庆我国独立建国。不过，今年因为冠病疫情的影响，国庆庆典别于往年, 以体现全民一心， 克服逆境。 今天，我们在政府大厦大草场举行规模较小的庆典，以及在全岛七个地点举行庆祝仪式。每一个地点都有它的象征意义，代表我国对抗病毒的工作。⁣
⁣
现在，我们比任何时候都更需要保持团结坚韧，以应对严重的经济衰退。接下来，更多公司可能会倒闭，更多员工会被裁退。不过，这不是我们第一次面临经济危机。也许这次危机会持续更久， 但我相信我们一定能够克服它。政府推出了多项援助计划。每个人也要贡献自己的一份力量，同舟共济。这样，我们才能走出危机，越战越勇。⁣
⁣
我也希望在不久的将来可以和国人，一起返回滨海湾浮动舞台庆祝国庆。政府已宣布把浮动舞台改建成永久建筑，称为“卫国广场”。它将肯定国民服役人员为新加坡所做出的贡献。这也会是一个老少咸宜，同欢共乐的场所。⁣
⁣
让我们一起心手相连，坚毅向前，克服挑战，让新加坡再创辉煌。",2020-08-09 02:00:17+00:00,"Happy birthday Singapore and congratulations to all Singaporeans today. Singapore is the only country in the world lead by a Chinese diaspora. A tiny island outpost devoid of natural resources, she was thrust into independence against her will. But she dug her toes into the muddy sand and became a first world nation. May you continue to flourish and prosper under the enduring leadership of your PM. Majulah Singapura! 🇸🇬 🇸🇬",2020-08-09 06:12:23+00:00,69

Sung by local artiste @benjaminkheng and conducted by Darrell Ang, this emotive yet charming number is a rallying call for all of us to “stand together, heart to heart” during this pandemic. It was nice to see and hear the musicians performing outside of their usual concert hall (but not at home 😉). 

Also, to mark our 55 years of our diplomatic relations with Australia, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra will be performing virtually alongside the @melbournesymphonyorchestra in a cross-border orchestra performance titled “Songs from Home” this Friday (7 Aug). This highlights the longstanding close bonds between Singapore and Australia, as we stand in solidarity with each other in this pandemic. 

You can watch the performance on the @singaporesymphony’s Facebook Page.

600,"This Sunday at #NDP2020, we will be paying a special tribute to the hard work and dedication of our frontline and essential workers who have been giving their all since COVID-19 hit our shores.
 
During the morning parade, @thersaf F15SG Roar of Unity will pay tribute to our frontline and essential workers who have been keeping Singapore safe and well. 16 frontline and essential workers from different vocations will be present to “receive” the salute. The F15SG will then make a series of tribute passes over eight hospitals. The state flag flypast will also make its way over the heartlands. You can catch the flypasts from your homes, at your windows or along your corridor. This is part of our efforts to bring NDP into the heartlands.
 
Let us come together this 9 August to celebrate Singapore’s birthday and stand in unity as one nation.
 
You can find out more about the parade happenings, state flag flypast and mobile column routes, and more at the NDP website (www.ndp.gov.sg).

To date, more than a million packs have been distributed. Residents shared that the pack is practical and meaningful, as it contains masks, thermometers and hand sanitisers. For the little ones, (besides the snacks) the instant face tattoos and handheld flags are hot favourites!⁣

NDP2020 will be conducted in a very different way, compared to previous years and from what was originally planned. The NDP Exco shared with me their challenges on how they had to adapt to the circumstances and quickly reconceptualise NDP when COVID struck, similar to how our people and our businesses had to adapt to the circuit breaker and a new normal.
 
Sitting at the Padang and watching the parade rehearsal this morning, it reminded me of our inaugural National Day Parade back in 1966. Both were simple parades held at the Padang.
 
My thanks to Chief of Defence Force Melvyn Ong, BG Frederick Choo, Chairman of NDP Exco and the team this year for changing the NDP so swiftly to ensure that we can mark our National Day in a safe but meaningful way.

⁣
To speed up the testing process even further, A*STAR also developed a robotics lab system — the Rapid Automated Volume Enhancer (RAVE). When used together with the RESOLUTE 2.0 kits, two sets of these made-in-Singapore systems can process close to 4,000 tests per day.⁣
⁣
I am very proud to see our R&D ecosystem working in close collaboration to give our fight against COVID-19 a boost. I thank the research teams involved for their hard work in reaching this milestone, within a short span of six months.⁣

Many were out and about enjoying breakfast and doing their grocery shopping. I was pleasantly surprised by how digitally savvy our residents and stall owners are! Some stall owners shared with me their plans to embark on digital platforms, while others have already done so. They told me that residents enjoyed the convenience of shopping online, and in the process, provided feedback to help stall owners improve their platforms. 

In my many chats, I reminded many of our residents and seniors that we are not out of the woods yet and must remain vigilant. We must do our utmost to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 in our community. Let us continue observing a high level of personal hygiene, protect ourselves and take good care of our health.

They ask me to protect Singapore, to keep everyone safe, to make sure younger Singaporeans can continue to work and take care of their families. We are very fortunate that, in Singapore, our earlier generations, who have already built up so much of the country, continue to watch over younger ones.

My team and I are determined to give our pioneers and seniors the care they deserve, and to honour their spirit of providing for and protecting future generations.

⁣
Met families coming together across generations, across East Coast, indeed, across the island, to have a good breakfast in the heart of Bedok.⁣
⁣
Our team got to hear the whole range of feelings in a family — a father proud of his son’s achievements in school, a grandma cheering on the younger ones, an adult who is concerned that his elderly parents stay safe from COVID-19. I could really see and appreciate your love and your hopes for your families. I can also see that families love being in Bedok and East Coast.⁣
⁣
I am glad that we have new homes at Bedok Beacon, Bedok South Horizons and Bedok North Woods coming up that will offer more options for young families and allow them to stay close to their parents. And, in a few more years, the new Bayshore housing precinct. New stations on the Thomson-East Coast Line will also make getting anywhere faster and easier.⁣
⁣
Meeting all of you further strengthens my wish to make sure the young and old in every family can stay safe during this crisis, fulfil their potential in life, and lead happy, meaningful lives.⁣

953,"PM @leehsienloong has just announced he will call for the General Election now. He explained in his broadcast why he decided to do so.

Elections have to be held by April 2021, which is less than a year away. Our fight against COVID-19 will be long. The road ahead is full of uncertainty. The next few years will be critical, and the actions we take now will chart the course of our nation for decades to come.

The decision to hold an election in the middle of a pandemic is not an easy one to make. But given the profound uncertainty ahead, and the challenges that we must tackle as a nation, it is important that we do so now, when the situation is relatively stable. The election will give the new Government a fresh, five-year mandate to bring Singaporeans together to overcome this crisis.

We will fight COVID-19 as #SingaporeTogether. More than ever, we will need a government, with a strong mandate and a long runway, to lead us out of this crisis.

Surely, the act of being able to vote is an Important one. If we are now at the start of a pandemic where things are worsening, one can understand but in this situation, it feels more opportunistic than necessary. The mandate was given to the government for a five year period and that’s to navigate Singapore through what these 5 years may bring, pandemic and all. The coming election is to choose a government that people have faith in and feel will bring them through the next 5 years.

995,"Our past, present, and future — from the top floor of The Treasury.

This was where I recorded my national broadcast on the last day of Phase 1 when the roads were still empty. The empty roads were a stark reminder of the crisis we are facing.

From this vantage, you can see the Singapore River, edged with rows of shophouses. This used to be our historical lifeblood. This area is rich with our heritage — the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall is nearby, and next to it, the National Gallery and Padang. In the distance, our economic growth is reflected in the ever-changing city line. In clear sight, Parliament House, with our national flag flying high, a symbol of our independence.

Across 200 years of sweeping change, we overcame the odds and grew from Singapore to Singaporeans.

Today, we are less than 200 days into what will be a long-drawn pandemic battle. We must draw on the wits and will of our people to fight COVID-19 as #SingaporeTogether.

This fight is as much about the present as it is about our future. How we respond to this crisis in the next five to ten years will chart the course of our nation for decades to come.

We shall not only overcome this crisis, we will emerge from it stronger — as an economy, as a society, and as a people.

You can tune in to my broadcast tomorrow on my Facebook Page, on free-to-air TV, or on the PMO YouTube channel (www.youtube.com/pmosingapore). ⠀

1007,"Most activities will resume today, as we start Phase 2.

There will also be a gradual resumption of religious activities. Congregational and other worship services can resume, with safeguards in place and no more than fifty worshippers. @mccysg released the details yesterday.

The last few months have highlighted how religiously diverse we are as a society. Looking back, we had to observe Qing Ming, Good Friday, Vesak Day, and Hari Raya Puasa very differently this year. It is not uncommon to see different places of worship in the same locality. It is not out of the ordinary for our religious leaders to work together for the common good.

Earlier this week, I briefly joined the meeting of the National Steering Committee on Racial and Religious Harmony. I had the opportunity to speak to some of our religious and community leaders — to thank them for being resilient, for adapting to the crisis, and standing in solidarity with people of all faiths.

Religious harmony is not something that readily happens in other parts of the world. It is not something that we should take for granted. Diversity is our strength. Especially in a crisis, we must focus on what we have in common, and work together. Only then, can we emerge stronger as a society from this crisis.

1009,"Congratulations to the 374 graduands of the 117/19 Officer Cadet Course commissioned as officers of the Singapore Armed Forces today!⁣
⁣
Usually, the parade’s Reviewing Officer will speak to the graduands, their proud families and all the attendees at the SAFTI Military Institute’s parade square. In this instance, the parade was replaced with eight commissioning ceremonies. It was surreal to do the address in my office via a video message — a sign of how we have had to adjust our normal routines in the midst of this pandemic. The good thing was that I managed to be “present” in each ceremony to congratulate the newly-minted officers! I have every confidence that they will Lead, Excel and Overcome as they take on leadership roles and defend Singapore with fortitude on the frontline.⁣
⁣
The SAF has been playing an essential role in our fight against COVID-19. More than 6,000 men and women from the @mindefsg and the SAF have been mobilised to support containment efforts and provide medical aid. They have gone above and beyond the call of duty to manage the virus and deter external threats at the same time. A big thank you for doing your utmost to protect Singapore and Singaporeans!⁣

1022,"Glad to hear that the third round of masks collection in Tampines has been smooth and well-received by residents. I was also heartened to hear that we had residents stepping forward to volunteer and help with the distribution — this shows our gotong royong spirit is alive and well in Tampines.

I hope you will find this latest version of the mask more comfortable as new materials were used to optimise comfort and improve resistance to droplets. There is also a smaller size for kids below 12.  You can check out the care instructions for the masks here: vimeo.com/415442232.

You can collect your mask at all Community Centres islandwide till 14 June. Aside from the usual manual collection counters that open from 10am to 6pm daily, you can also use the mask vending machines that operate 24/7. Do bring along your IC and the ICs of your household members to collect on their behalf.

Our Tampines residents can collect their masks at the vending machines at Central Plaza and @tampinescentralcc in @ourtampineshub, or any RC as well as CC nearest to your home.

This islandwide exercise would not have been possible without the support of @pafrenz, @mindefsg, @temasekfoundation, @govtechsg, @astarsg, @ntu_sg and many other community partners and volunteers working behind the scenes — thank you everyone for the hard work.

Like Singapore, our closest neighbours will be celebrating Hari Raya Aidilfitri under exceptional circumstances this year. We discussed how COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our societies and economies, and the measures we have put in place to protect our people. In my conversations with leaders in the region, they shared with me that the Muslim community understands the need for these precautionary measures. They have also taken these changes in their stride. What is most important is to celebrate the spirit of caring for and supporting one another.⁣

1098,"To support our employers to retain their workers, the Government has announced the Jobs Support Scheme. From 28 May, more than 140,000 employers will be receiving over $4 billion in wage payout. ⠀ ⠀

The upcoming payout is for the month of May, with the enhanced circuit breaker measures. Employers will receive 75% wage support for their local employees (capped at the first $4,600 of wages paid). Some shareholder-directors will also qualify, an enhancement announced earlier.⠀ ⠀

Our wage support for companies in Singapore is very significant — in total, we have committed more than $20 billion under the JSS over three Budgets — Unity, Resilience and Solidarity. I urge companies to use the JSS wage subsidies to retain their workers during this difficult period. ⠀ ⠀

Some companies are doing well, and have returned the funds — thank you! I hope the rest which are also doing well will do likewise. Many companies and individuals have also been donating to worthy causes that they support. You can find out more on these causes at @giving.sg (www.giving.sg).⠀ ⠀

You can refer to the @mof_sg press release for more details at www.go.gov.sg/jss17may.⠀ ⠀

MAS announced the program in April but then I realize each bank can design their line which one they can choose the accept and reject . and DBS seems to be the most stringent comparing to OCBC and UOB.

1103,"My fellow Tampines MP @cheng_lihui started a Sew Love SG initiative, mobilising residents to volunteer to make masks. Over 300 volunteers have responded. Li Hui sent them the fabrics, then the volunteers cut, sewed and distributed these masks to residents who needed them or sent back to the Tampines Town Council for these to be distributed.⠀
⠀
Over the last few weeks, more than 28,000 masks of all sizes, colours, and patterns have been hand-sewn by our volunteers.⠀
⠀
These have been given to families, migrant workers, and will soon be given to students in Tampines and frontline staff to show our support. Students and residents also made lovely bookmarks to show appreciation for frontline staff.⠀
⠀
I am touched by this care and concern that our residents in Tampines, and our people around Singapore, have shown for one another as we battle COVID-19. A big THANK YOU to all, for showing our heart, spirit and resilience during this time.⠀

1170,"Today is #EarthDay.

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Sea levels are rising, and weather patterns are changing. These have very significant implications, especially for a small island state like Singapore.

This year’s Earth Day takes place against the backdrop of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Ironically, COVID has given us a glimpse of what is possible, if we cut back on emissions. Waterways, once polluted, have cleared. The smog in many cities has lifted.

People are now waking up to bluer skies and clearer waters. But the scaled-down economic activities and restrictions on daily living come at huge cost. These painful measures will have to be gradually lifted when the pandemic wanes.

This global pandemic will pass at some point, but the global emergency that is climate change will not. Unlike COVID, climate change is a ""boiling frog” — we can be easily desensitised to the gradual rise in temperature and lulled to its consequences.

Countries have shown that we can move decisively and in concert, much like we did in response to this global pandemic. Post-COVID, there is room for all of us to act more swiftly and in unison to tackle climate change.

We can and should ""build back better”, to find a better balance between human activity and environmental protection. The ""new normal” that comes out from this pandemic can be a greener and more sustainable one.

Countries have shown that we can move decisively and in concert, much like we did in response to this global pandemic. Post-COVID, there is room for all of us to act more swiftly and in unison to tackle climate change.

This year’s Earth Day takes place against the backdrop of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Ironically, COVID has given us a glimpse of what is possible, if we cut back on emissions. Waterways, once polluted, have cleared. The smog in many cities has lifted.

It is very encouraging to see our volunteers sewing at home, making masks for our seniors, our children, and our vulnerable groups.

This is the spirit of the Singapore Together movement in action. This is one way we can strengthen our social fabric during times of crisis, rather than let the pandemic fray us at the seams.

With each of us doing our part, I look forward to a richer, stronger and more diverse tapestry of our society post-COVID-19.

This underscores the urgency of the G20’s task to bring countries together to take coordinated action to deal with this pandemic.

In better circumstances, our meeting would have been held in Washington DC at around this time. But in these extraordinary times, we are meeting via video conference from our offices.

COVID-19 is a global pandemic that requires a global response. There is still much uncertainty over how this pandemic will pan out. The virus is also impacting countries on multiple fronts — healthcare, economy, financial stability, and social resilience.

Our top priority is to contain the spread of the virus. I called on G20 members to share information, accelerate R&D, and make the best use of digital technology in this fight.

At the same time, we must deal decisively with the economic impact. Countries will need measures to cushion our businesses and households, preserve capabilities, and ensure financial stability. They must also take collective action to assist the poorest economies.

The post-COVID world, however, is likely to be a different one. Having more frequent meetings via video conferencing might well become the new normal. But what will never change is our sense of common purpose and our desire to improve the lives of our people — across continents and borders.

1251,"Minister @masagosz set out the Government’s ‘30 by 30’ vision — to meet 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs locally by 2030, as part of our effort to improve food resilience. I am very glad to see the project is well underway. The plans we put in place years ago have turned out to be quite timely as they will give us a buffer against global disruptions to food supplies due to unexpected incidents like COVID-19.

Today, I visited Apollo Aquaculture Group and Max Koi Farm, to look at our progress in the aquaculture field. Glad that the partners have brought local fish farming to new heights — literally! — with Apollo’s new 8-tier vertical fish farming facility. Eric and his team have been doing research, and making many innovations in fish farming. I am impressed by their creative and innovative fish farming techniques. Although they have been at it for many years, they are still constantly challenging themselves to do better — it’s a spirit that we should all adopt.

I believe every Singaporean can play a part to contribute to our ‘30 by 30’ vision. Do support our local farmers by purchasing food produced in Singapore. Be open to different and new food options. Last but not least, reduce food wastage as much as possible.

Minister Masagos will provide more details of the plan in the coming months. Adopting innovative ways to cultivate a part of our food needs is an important way to boost Singapore’s food resilience.

1261,"Sat down for a live interview with @cnbc's Sri Jegarajah and Martin Soong on Monday. In a clear sign of the times we are living in, Martin interviewed me from his home.

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed one of the most serious challenges to the global economy, even more so than the Global Financial Crisis or 9/11. As I shared during the interview, our immediate priority is to build resilience, protect jobs and livelihoods, as well as help viable companies stay afloat. All this while we tackle this crisis on three fronts — public healthcare, financial, and economic.

With expectations of a weaker economic outlook, MAS has eased its monetary policy. I reiterated during the interview that our firepower for managing this is fiscal policy — I am glad we have our past reserves for this purpose, to enable us to do more to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 if the situation calls for it.

Even as we work to stabilise our economy, we must look to the future at what it will be like in a post-COVID world. Let us continue to support one another and together, we can emerge stronger.

In these uncertain times, we can take heart that our unity and resilience will see us through to better days.

Definitely not when it comes to COVID-19. Singapore’s most famous contractor is back to give advice on how to keep yourself and others safe during the coronavirus outbreak. The steps may be easy to follow but they convey a serious message — our own personal hygiene is the very first line of defence against COVID-19. Do remember these steps and practise them diligently!

Local director @jackneock rewrote the lyrics of his original song ‘不要认为自己没有用’ into a rallying call for Singaporeans to stand together in the fight against COVID-19. The messages and certainly the sentiment of the original song are still relevant now — how we should not feel helpless, and we can all play a part to make things better. How? Simple acts such as washing your hands, avoid spreading fake news, as well as supporting our doctors and nurses, and public officers who are on the frontline.

1332,"I recently posted on an initiative by the Tampines Kindness Movement, which encourages residents and visitors at @ourtampineshub to pen down notes of appreciation to our frontline healthcare workers, staff and volunteers for their unwavering dedication. ⠀
⠀
On behalf of Tampines, I sent some of the message boards, together with a handwritten card, to our frontline warriors at the National Centre of Infectious Diseases and @tantocksenghospital — to thank our doctors and nurses for their commitment to protect Singapore and Singaporeans (and also to cheer them on Valentine’s Day!).⠀
⠀
If you want to play a part and send them your well-wishes, you can participate in this meaningful ground-up initiative by StandUpFor.SG, calling on Singaporeans to express appreciation and support to our healthcare teams who have been battling on the frontline against the COVID-2019.⠀
⠀
Do pen down your messages by hand, take a photo, and upload it on social media with the hashtag #BraveHeartSG! The Stand Up For SG team will be printing out these notes of encouragement and sending them to around 5,000 medical personnel islandwide as a Valentine’s Day gift to all of them. I’m sure this will definitely bring warmth to their hearts. I hope more will come forward to spread joy and appreciate one another, not just on special occasions, but every day.⠀

#SingaporeTogether",2020-02-09 11:18:23+00:00,"Dear DPM, First, as a born and bred citizen, I thank the government for its great efforts in coping with this crisis. My purpose of dropping a message here is to request the government to review and enhance on “Total Defence Concept” after this crisis. All societies will have its own vulnerabilities and so do we. I felt the Total Defence Concept has not been ingrained into our lives and much needs to be done. I hope the government would take the opportunity (a strange word to use in times of crisis) to digest our weaknesses. For one, I hope we can differentiate between “Government readiness” and “Citizen readiness”. I think we are weak in the latter. The psychological and mental state of our people are generally lower than government readiness. The gap should be reduced. As examples: 1.  In these “soft aspects” for instance, taking care of one’s health (drinking lots of water for instance) is not only to keep us healthy. It is at this times that our healthcare system will be put under strain. So if we stay away from falling sick, it will allow the medical healthcare providers and system to focus on infected citizens; 2.  Crisis management should be integral to our education system starting from the young – why hoarding is un-necessary and selfish, keep your hands away from un-necessary touching. 3.  Reduce the “shows” of total defence exercises across neighbourhoods that I felt are primarily non-effective and more “illustrative”. Place more focus on citizen readiness on other aspects. 4.  Have policies that address businesses that exploit the crisis. This is simply immoral and whilst it is demand and supply – the only apparatus that can close the valve and send the right message is the government. Minister CCS has already taken actions – but please make sure these people / businessman are brought to light and penalised. If it means taking away their licenses, then perhaps that should be considered. Singapore is too small to allow multiple cracks. Thank you.",2020-02-10 01:57:08+00:00,327

1383,"My thanks to our Town Councils and cleaners for stepping up their efforts to keep our housing estates clean during this period. Minister @masagosz visited Tampines Green Terrace yesterday to observe how these practices are being put in place in Tampines.

@nea_sg has been working very closely with Town Councils to increase the frequency of cleaning in high-traffic premises and common areas in our neighbourhoods. Our cleaners have been working extra hard to keep the environment around us clean. Do show your appreciation when you see them, and also do our part by keeping our living and work spaces clean and litter-free.

Do continue to take care of your personal hygiene and be socially responsible. Stay safe and stay united — together, we can get through this difficult period.

1398,"Visited @rasasentosa this afternoon to meet with frontline workers, together with @ng.chee.meng and union leaders. The first and third imported cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus had stayed at the hotel. While it is less crowded, I was glad to see that the staff were in good spirits.

Safeguarding the well-being of our people remains our top priority. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has stepped up precautionary measures in the past week to reduce the risk of both community spread and the risk of more imported nCoV cases.

At the same time, the economic impact of the outbreak is understandably weighing on people’s minds. The Government will provide targeted support to sectors that have been directly impacted, such as the aviation sector, taxi and private hire car drivers, hotels and tour agents.

The situation is rapidly evolving. Depending on how the situation progresses, the impact on our economy could intensify. The Government is prepared to support our firms and workers in the event of a broad-based economic slowdown. We will continue to monitor this closely and implement decisive measures as needed.

Full details will be shared at #SGBudget 2020 on 18 February.

We can emerge stronger as long as we continue to work together.

1402,"Happy to celebrate Lunar New Year together with friends from different races at the @singaporechineseculturalcentre - Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations Spring Reception 2020 yesterday. This is uniquely Singapore! ⠀
⠀
Even amidst our festivities, we are mindful of the many challenges ahead, from overcoming the current Wuhan coronavirus situation, to transforming our economy in order to create new opportunities for Singaporeans. We will continue to invest in our people and strengthen our social safety nets so that no one is left behind in our progress. As long as we stay united as one people, I am confident we can overcome our challenges and build a brighter future together.⠀

Wishing everyone a happy, healthy and prosperous Year of the Rat!⠀
