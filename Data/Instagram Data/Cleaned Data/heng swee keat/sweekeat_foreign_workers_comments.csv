1,"As we move into the last quarter of the circuit breaker period, our priority is on how we can gradually re-open our society and economy. This will not be easy. If we open up too quickly or without the necessary safeguards, we risk facing a new wave of infections. The experience of other countries opening up shows how agile the virus is.⠀
⠀
We have seen a large number of cases in our migrant worker dormitories. In the coming months, we will need to systematically and progressively recover all dormitories by testing and clearing all the residents. We will also be putting in Safe Working and Safe Living measures to protect the well-being of everyone.⠀
⠀
Our agencies and the Inter-agency Task Force have responded swiftly and systemically, and made good progress in managing the situation in our dormitories. A big thank you to our frontline workers, NGOs and companies for your commitment.⠀
⠀
We have been able to respond to this crisis because of the deep capabilities that we have invested and built up over the years — in the SAF, in our biotech sector, in our engineering and infrastructure sectors, in our healthcare sector and many more. These capabilities have been quickly mobilised and adapted to respond to the situation.⠀
⠀
As we shift into the next phase of our fight against COVID-19, we must continue to plan and invest ahead. We must stay highly vigilant as we progressively resume more activities and have more people return to work. Businesses, workers and the community must continue to adapt as the pandemic evolves. The road to recovery will be long, but we can and we will overcome this together. ⠀

12,"We are almost at the half-way mark of our circuit breaker.

We are currently going all out to contain the outbreak in our foreign worker dormitories. We are actively testing our workers, and this is one reason we are seeing a big wave of new cases.

Thankfully, most who tested positive are only showing mild symptoms. The measures taken in our dorms will require some time to work, and we are scaling up our community care facilities in anticipation of a higher load in the coming days and weeks.

In the wider community, there are some indications that the circuit breaker is starting to take effect. But these are still early days and we are concerned about the number of undetected cases in the community, as that will lead to further transmission.

This is why we must all stay at home, unless absolutely necessary.

Our healthcare and essential workers are at the centre of our COVID-19 fight. But what has made a big difference is that every part of society has chipped in. You have made sure that those on the frontline are appreciated, our frail and vulnerable are cared for, and our foreign workers are provided for. You have looked out for those around you, in ways big and small.

The spirit of #SingaporeTogether shines through during these challenging times. The coming weeks will be even more critical. We need all hands on deck. We need to act in unison. Together, we can overcome. We will have time later for reflection — to learn the lessons, and to collectively shape our shared future.

In this most difficult chapter of our generation, we must persevere, stay united and emerge from this stronger. (MOM Photos)",2020-04-19 14:25:23+00:00,You and the Singapore Gov are doing a great job of protecting us in very tough times - thank you!,2020-04-20 01:18:41+00:00,19
