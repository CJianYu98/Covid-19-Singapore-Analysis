Chinese New Year celebrations have been relatively muted this year due to Covid-19, but I’m glad it hasn’t dampened spirits, especially for our students who have gamely kept up with mask-wearing and safe management measures in schools. 

There is still a long journey ahead of us, but step by step, we can emerge stronger together. May the Year of the Ox usher in strength and fortitude for us all!",2021-02-26 11:18:51+00:00,"👏👏👏wonderful children, beautiful play... multi racial 🙌👏",2021-02-26 12:45:14+00:00,6

48,"居安思危 - to remain vigilant in times of peace. We learnt this through a painful time in our history - the Japanese Occupation, and it remains a very relevant lesson today as we grapple with the current Covid-19 crisis. 

Many thanks to the @sccci.official for organising the War Memorial Service for the past 54 years, and for launching an e-book this year capturing the stories of those who had suffered through the Occupation and significance of the Civilian War Memorial. 

The best homage we can pay to our forefathers and pioneers is to continue to hold fast to the spirit and values of Total Defence, as we work to overcome this pandemic, and build a better Singapore.",2021-02-15 13:22:29+00:00,"I recently read this book called “The House on Silat Road”, by Si-Hoe SS to my 9 year old child. Talks about their life from 1941-1945. Very interesting and real life story on their time during the Japanese occupation. I can feel that my child was bewildered that Singapore had such a history and it was a very good history lesson for her. Makes her appreciate the peace and prosperity that we are enjoying now. She inquired more about total defence day, the significance of it, the sounding of the public warning system, the purpose behind it.Great book that perhaps schools can introduce the children to. Lest we forget.",2021-02-15 13:33:33+00:00,105

86,"At today’s IPS SG Perspectives Conference. It has been a while since I attended an event like this. But with pre-entry rapid antigen tests and strict distancing rules we can ensure it’s safe for everyone. 

The theme of the conference was aptly titled “Reset”. Indeed we must be prepared to reexamine all our operating assumptions and paradigms to prepare for a post-covid world. In particular I shared my thoughts on the resets in policy thinking, lifestyles and mindsets that we need for the future. My hope is that we can all work towards a fairer and more equal society, a greener Singapore, and a nation with a stronger spirit of solidarity and shared purpose.

It’s a social resource sharing platform that connects people with the community around them, making it convenient for neighbours to share resources and help each other. Users have offered to help their neighbours print documents and explain medications, look for running buddies, and give away items like extra masks and even microwaves and bicycles.

A key topic we discussed was the role of technology in education. There are many views about how best we should utilise and integrate technology in teaching and learning. But the starting premise should always be centred on human needs, and that of our students.

We must therefore work to harness technology in a way that supports our students’ learning needs, well-being and holistic development. This way, technology becomes a force for good in education: to enable, inspire, and uplift every child, and to help prepare them for a rapidly changing future.",2020-09-26 10:55:54+00:00,Thanks for another good conversation,2020-09-26 11:17:31+00:00,5

Yesterday, we announced our plans to further expand testing in the community. From 1 July, we will test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection when they see a doctor.

706,"Singapore will be entering Phase 2 of reopening after 18 June 2359. This means that from Friday onwards, almost all businesses will be able to re-open, be it retail, F&B dining-in or personalised consumer services. The key requirement is that individuals must maintain safe distancing of at least 1 m at all times, and if that’s not feasible (eg when dining at a table), then each group will be limited to a maximum of 5 persons. Sports, gyms, playgrounds, and other public facilities will open, as will similar facilities in condominiums and clubs. Small group gatherings of up to any 5 persons can also resume, and households may receive up to 5 visitors at any time. 
There are a small number of activities that will take more time to resume. These are activities where large numbers of people are likely to come into close contact, often in enclosed spaces and for prolonged periods of time. They include religious services and congregations; large-scale events and venues; and entertainment outlets like bars, clubs and karaoke outlets. We will continue to work with these organisations and business owners on the safe management measures that are needed before they can open.
Phase 2 is a significant step forward in our reopening process. But please do not treat this as a signal to relax and let our guard down. 
Businesses must take the rules seriously. Do not rush to open if you are not ready, because you will be putting your own customers and employees at risk. All of us must continue to exercise individual and social responsibility. There’s no need to rush to go out this weekend. We should continue to limit our close contacts, even if we can now meet in groups.

768,"Spoke last night about our plans to adapt and live with Covid-19. To re-open safely, we've strengthened our testing and contact tracing capabilities. In the longer-term, an important part of the solution is a vaccine. If and when a vaccine becomes available, we will make sure that every Singaporean who needs it gets it, and at an affordable price. 
But it will take a long time for any vaccine to be ready.  So we have to be realistic and gird ourselves for the challenges ahead. We can no longer go back to life before the circuit breaker. Our expectations, lifestyles and norms will have to change. All of us - businesses, organisations, and individuals - will have to make adjustments to the way we do things, and some transitions will be difficult.  But as one united people, we will get through this together, and overcome this crisis of our generation.

875,"Many thanks to all who have worked hard over the past few weeks to bring down infection rates in the community.  Because of our collective efforts, we can now exit the circuit breaker and resume activities in phases starting from 2 June. 
The first phase of re-opening will be done in a careful and calibrated manner. More Singaporeans will be able to return to work, and students will go back to school. But many restrictions will still be in place. I know some were hoping to be able to go out freely - to start dining out and meeting their friends. Unfortunately, all this will have to wait. 
I hope everyone understands why we have to be cautious. We cannot risk the virus flaring up again. We also must not sacrifice all the efforts that we’ve put in over the last few weeks to bring the outbreak under control. 
Some businesses will remain closed in the first phase. They include retail shops and those offering personalised services. The government will continue to extend support to these businesses and their workers. DPM @hengsweekeat will announce the details of these support measures in Parliament next week. 
We expect to be in Phase 1 for a few weeks. If the infection rate in the community remains low and stable, and the situation in the dormitories remains under control, then we will be able to move to Phase 2, where we will allow social activities and F&B dining in small groups, and re-open more consumer-facing businesses, as well as public spaces and sports facilities.

All 19,800 foreign workers housed at the two dorms would be quarantined in their rooms for the next 14 days, authorities announced on Sunday. "" Analysis : quarantine for 14 days ? This is NOT good enough. I bet Singapore will get worse. If this is the method we use. Study how S. Korea and Taiwan do it. They dont take chances. Look, you have 19800 foreign workers quarantined for 14 days. Day 1 : say detected 5. Day 2 : no symptoms. Day 3. No symptoms. Day 4: detected 25 infected. So these silent 25 could have carried the virus since day 2. So by day 14 : if you released all into public, there will bound to have some that are""silently"" infected with no symptoms that were affected by A from day 1 to B in day 2 then to C D E F in day 5 and XXXXX in day 13....etc. 19800 foreign workers ? Very very serious consequences. Correct way to do it ? Like what S. Korea did. Like what WHO said : Test Test Test. MOH have this chance to test all 19800 now that they are being quarantined. Just do it. For the safety of all locals. If you dont test and released them all after day 14, and say 5% are silent carriers (about 900 infected pax released into the public), I think it will be catastropic for Singapore. Dear Minister, you are working hard, no doubt about it. Aprreciate that. But please think twice about the current strategy MOH is deploying. Is really not good enough. Especially for these huge group of 19800 pax. Thank you. @leehsienloong@gankimyong@ongyekung @teocheehean @ng.chee.meng @khawboonwan Note : 19800 in 2 dorms ? Singapore hopefully can learn something from the Cruise Ships case studies / experiences. They were released after quarantine with NO symptoms. Afterwhich ?

Then a few hundred. Then a few thousand. Then tens of thousands. And a few hundred / a few thousands infected China nationals then went all over the world. And now ? More than 1.2 mil infected. UK, Italy, Spain, France, USA the same stories. It all started with a few, then a few hundred. And then ? Exploded. Out of Control. Like Italy. Like Spain and etc. Singapore started with a few. Now ? More than a thousand. There were ""many overlook"" Singapore Govt made. One of them : letting in tens of thousands of Malaysians before Malaysia borders lockdown. My feel is? Singapore Govt tried to balance $ making (aka economy) with virus crisis management. So a bit here . A bit there. Some good measures here. Some loopholes there. In the end ? We get to ""nowhere"". Is our economy intact by ""this balancing act"" ? No. Because is serious now, we have this ""circuit breaker"" (much like a lockdown). Our economy went from bad (in Jan) to worse (in Apr) . My frank assessment is this : what ""saved"" Singapore from ""explosion phase"" is : our very good healthcare systems. BUT bear in mind, once the community spread get out of control, from a thousand can easily shoot up to tens of thousands. Touchwood. Should that happen, not even Singapore World Class healthcare systems can save Singapore residents. Singapore would be like Italy. Spain. USA. I am sad, worried, very disappointed. Yes we have good Govt. But I feel our Govt was ""too complacent"". Initially our Govt countered it like SARS. Flashback (CNA 1 Feb) : Dr Brenda Ang : “We have a few SARS veterans here. One of the things I said at the first briefings (for the Wuhan coronavirus) was don’t worry, we have been through this before. We can handle it.”“I saw Singapore's first SARS case, I’m still alive and standing,” she said. On how widespread the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to be, Dr Ang said current literature suggests that even people who are exposed to the virus do not necessarily get infected.“It probably isn’t that infectious, (even though) people are wearing surgical masks all over the place.” (UNQUOTE). @leehsienloong@gankimyong@ongyekung",2020-04-06 18:33:31+00:00,366

I just saw a CNA clip - reporter was doing interview with a pair of sisters who HAD just returned from the UK at their home :(( This is a prime eg why a quarantine at home won’t work. Some people are just not going to abide by the rules to stay inside their rooms at all times (except to use shower/toilet) the moment they reach home from the airport. Members of the family are inevitably exposed who then go on to infect others in the public. We should follow HK , send returnees to govt facilities.

For those travel returnees on LOA, if they are infected and they go out to the public community, e.g. packed supermakets , packed hawker centres, packed mcdonald's, packed malls, there is a likelihood of an ""Uncontrollable BreakOut"" caused by these travel returnees on LOA who may be infected. If a hawker doing say popiah is being infected by the infected, and if she continues to roll her popiahs with some mild symptoms, and unaware consumers eat them, the chance of infection is there. If that happens, all these contact tracing apps will not be that relevant anymore. If Singapore becomes the next Italy, it will be ""too late"". Singapore will then be in a very disastrous situation. Economy will be 10X maybe 100X worse than the current bad situation. Bear in mind this : Singapore society is closely compact and one of the world's highest density population. Can you afford to close down all mrts and bus servicces like what China did. We must take a pre-emptive approach in anticipation of ""the worst possible scenario"" and instead of ""let's see how then react"" . The latter was what Italy , many European countries did. They waited to see how to react. When the crisis exploded suddenly and situation out of control, then they react. But, it was ""too late"" That is  fire fighting approach, not fire prevention. I worry a lot. For families, friends, fellow Singaporeans. Reason : Indonesia. I guess Indonesia will be the next Italy due to their ""reported behaviour e.g. attend large groupings even when their Govt bans them"" as well as ""their Govt citing high costs this high costs that even for Covid-19 testing for many of their potential patients"". Once Indonesia explodes like Italy, I dont think they can do containment as well as ""exploded Korea"".

Though it’s late, it’s the right move forward. Everyone should be treated as a suspect case and be tested upon arrival, and not just those who present symptoms at the border (which I believe is the protocol now). Mass testing has proven to be the tipping point for South Korea. We need to nip it in the bud - test, isolate, treat. Time is crucial, we can’t afford to wait for symptoms to show up then have patients present themselves at the hospital. If we can gift the Philippines with 3000 test kits surely we can do it for our fellow returnees? Also, at this point we should make it mandatory to wear mask. Wearing one is essential in the fight -  just look at China, Taiwan, SK, HK. “Wear one only when you’re sick” is not medically correct at this point in time. Experts in China have said people shed virus even before symptoms are present. Only by wearing a mask can we protect ourselves and people around us. I know there’s a shortage of masks in Singapore which makes it unfortunate but we can use cloth recyclable masks or any home made ones. When everyone wears one, it doesn’t matter if one’s quality is better than another. It really has helped those countries in containment. That’s certain. But to tell people that healthy people don’t need to wear one is just plain wrong, pardon me for saying. I’m writing as a concerned Singaporean - we must look at the above countries and learn from them. My next worry is when Malaysia ends her lockdown and thousands of people start to cross the causeway into Singapore... since it’s been proven with our recent imported cases that most don’t show symptoms at the border (meaning temperature can no longer be used as a gauge), how then? Thank you and the team once again for the hard work. We appreciate it and to the frontliners who are doing such a incredible job , it’s going to be a much tougher fight but together we shall overcome.",2020-03-24 13:00:27+00:00,390
