2,"The National School Games (NSG) has always been one of the highlights for our students athletes, so I’m sure many are looking forward to the resumption of the NSG this year. 

As the risk of Covid-19 transmission is still present, we are taking a more calibrated approach by resuming 12 sports with minimal contact and intermingling between students. Even as we work towards resuming normal school life and activities, the safety and well-being of our students remain the top priority. 

Don’t be too disappointed if your sport is still suspended - keep training and stay engaged in your CCAs in schools. For all athletes participating in the Games this year, enjoy the process and all the best!

6,Always enjoy doing house visits at this time of the year as it’s a chance to “bai nian” and wish our residents well for the year ahead.

13,"In the recent two weeks, new cases and clusters have emerged. They are likely the result of increased activities over the year-end period (typically new cases present themselves with a 1-2 week lag). Our vulnerabilities have gone up, and we cannot afford to take any chances. The situation can escalate rapidly especially with Chinese New Year coming up soon. Remember cases spiked after CNY last year, and we had many clusters then linked to CNY activities and gatherings.

So we are making a pre-emptive move now to tighten our measures. Under the current rule, home visits are allowed for up to 8 visitors at any time. From 26 Jan onwards, we will limit such visits to 8 distinct visitors per household per day.  For those who are planning to go out visiting, we strongly advise that you minimise your physical gatherings. In particular over the CNY period, visit your family members only, and do not exceed more than two visits per day. 

When dining out, keep your masks on if you are not eating/drinking, and refrain from singing or talking loudly. So during the lohei, masks must remain on, and there should be no shouting of auspicious phrases. For reunion dinners, keep to one table of not more than 8 pax and ensure there are no multiple table bookings, or intermingling across tables. 

I know many will be disappointed at these new restrictions especially over the festive season. But I hope everyone understands why they are necessary. The virus is raging everywhere in the world. Many places in Asia that have successfully controlled the infection are now seeing a rise in cases. Places like China, Taiwan and Hong Kong have all imposed curbs on their CNY celebrations. 

Likewise, we must be mentally prepared that CNY this year will not be the same as before. It will be quieter and more subdued. We will need to stay disciplined and vigilant. I seek everyone’s cooperation on these new measures. If we all do our part, we can continue to keep the infection under control until we get the vaccines out to everyone in Singapore later this year.",2021-01-22 15:28:26+00:00,"Mr Wong, I am not disappointed.

47,"Entering Waterway Primary this morning, I saw our P1 students walking in hand in hand to school with their parents. Many of them were nervous and excited when I met them in the canteen, where they were to bid goodbye to their parents and head to their classrooms. 

But surprisingly, despite first-day jitters, I didn't see any tears. Instead, there were lots of smiles and encouraging words. Teachers were on hand to reassure the P1s and provide close attention to those who needed it. The Principal Mrs Wee told me that with the other levels staying home today, the extra pairs of hands really made a difference in helping to smoothen this transition, and to help the P1s get used to the Safe Management Measures in schools.

But it has not been clear that the message now is that because of evidence of community spread, we are not to gather even in groups of less than ten for casual or recreational purposes. For instance, some think it is acceptable to go with a few friends to window shop to break the monotony of life, or to meet at a restaurant as long as there are not more than ten people, because the message that we should only go to malls on essential errands etc etc and its rationale are not loudly and clearly communicated to the public. People very much desire to cooperate at such a difficult time as this but because new implementations and advisories are ever so fast changing, I feel it is important to state loud and clear in plain terms and esp the rationale behind each stricter level of advisory.

Finally someone with ""great common sense"" is doing it. My question is : what are our human resources-rich Govt doing all this while ? What are our top civil servants doing ? What are our agencies EDB TDB A*STAR MTI doing all this while since Feb 18 when Minister Lawrence Wong was mooting with the idea of producing our own masks?. Dear Minister, you are a good & hardworking Minister. But a couple of million masks a month may not be enough. Can our Govt support Razer in (1) help him to expedite in setting up the factory with our ""Govt agencies"" rich resources and industrial contacts (2) our Govt to chip in and ramp up the production scale to at least 15  mil to 30 mil masks a month. This will help create some jobs too. This will help ""boost confidence"" if people are going out in public and our Govt to enforce ""All to Wear Masks"" when in public places, in view of the heightened risks as compared to Jan situation. Especially in MRTs, Buses, Supermarkets etc *News Recap 1 : ST 19 Feb : SINGAPORE - Singapore is looking for new sources of supply for masks and developing capabilities to manufacture them locally as other Asian countries clamp down on mask exports, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong has said.""In recent weeks, some places like Taiwan, Thailand and India have banned or tightened regulations on the export of masks,"" he said in a written parliamentary reply on Tuesday (Feb 18). *News Recap 2 : CNA 1 Apr : SINGAPORE: Singapore gaming company Razer announced plans on Wednesday (Apr 1) to set up an automated face mask manufacturing line within 30 days to produce ""a couple of million certified masks"" each month.

We are now doing virtual press conferences for our Covid-19 updates to further minimise contact and keep everyone safe,2020-03-31 12:12:25+00:00,"*Suggestion / Feedback* for ""Enhanced Safe Distancing Measures announced by PM Lee on 3 Apr"" : NTUC FAIRPRICE SHOULD * 1. Set quota purchase by ID basis . Ask NTUC IT to do this. E.g. if S68xxxxxxx buy 2 sets of toilet rolls on 3 Apr, he can only buy another 2 sets say at least 1 week later. Once he makes a purchase, his ID and purchase data will be input by the cashiers / NTUC systems. * 2. Impose this measure : allocate say 60% of ALL your stock SOLELY for ONLINE PURCHASES. Why so ? Simple reason : enhanced distancing measures. If you dont believe, you can go to all NTUC outlets now. Now is 5 30 pm (3 Apr). (after PM Lee just gave his speech). All will scramble to panic buy. This is human behaviour everywhere in the world. This will result in ? Large crowd gatherings at NTUC outlets. This defeats the ""enhanced distancing measures"" purpose.  If there are large crowds formations due to panic buying, the community spread risks will increase (meaning more may be infected. Just like those large crowd religious gathering examples). This is extremely risky and dangerous. But why 60%stock allocation for online 40% for in-store? Cos there are people who dont know how to use computers/ go online etc .

I can see that you are working very hard as the Taskaforce Co-Chair,  so thank you for that. As a commoner, I cant formulate policies, I cant contribute much. As an indvidual, I can only help by being ""socially responsible"", which I have been doing since Jan. However, I feel that I can also contribute by giving feedback & suggestions, sharing world info with the Govt & etc. E.g. I shared this info : Japanese Flu drug Avigan was said by China doctors to be effective in the treatment. I am not a doctor, but no harm sharing this info for our medical experts to ""further look into it"". Bear in mind China rarely ""praises"" or ""give words of endorsements"" to Japanese-linked whatever. So today my feedback is : repeated many times. agreed by some in the public : daily MASKS wearing when going out is IMPORTANT for more effective containment. Singpost. It says they do ""daily precautionary checks with temp checking"". Was it very effective ?  After so many weeks, still think it worked like SARS ? All over the world, including ground zero China said carriers may not have fever for days even if they are infected. So, yes temp checking can keep out / contain some with obvious symptoms BUT fail to contain those infected for days without much symptoms such as fever. Is this so hard for our Govt to understand ? By enforcing everyone to wear masks when outside in the public help to minimize the transmission risks, especially from those without fever symptoms. China enforced this and was quite successful. So Singapore, why why why ? Is it because we have not enough masks ? Is making our masks Rocket Science ? Cant our Govt who just budgeted tens of $billions crisis $ allocate $30 mil to assemble a large masks assembly lines to produce a million masks a day ? Cant our Govt employ hundreds of unemployed / laid-offs to work in this mask factory ? An un-infected meeting an infected with both wearing masks = double protection. An un-infected meeting a silent infected with both not wearing masks = Disaster . Think about it. I always wonder what would Lee Kuan Yew do if he were tasked to handle this crisis ?  @leehsienloong @gankimyong @ongyekung @khawboonwan",2020-03-28 06:10:53+00:00,359

Latest News 28 Mar (France 24 TV) : "" France has ordered from China, a billion masks"" . If Singapore can quickly assemble a large assembly line(s) for making a million masks a day for Singapore use, by doing so will 1. More effective in our overall containment efforts 2. Create jobs for hundreds / thousands. With enough masks, if we enforce everyone to wear masks in public, this will surely, surely reduce the community transmission. Without such enforcements, silent virus carriers without much symptoms will continue with not wearing masks and move around in public, thus causing more infections. Then what will our Govt do ? More contacts tracing. After sometime, it will become almost impossible to do ""effective contact tracing"" and Singapore will then be at high risks of becoming the next Italy or Spain (sudden spikes in cases, exploded, healthcare system breakdown etc) This is highly possible if our Govt become complacent (means while doing good in some areas but also flawed / overlook in other areas) @leehsienloong @gankimyong @ongyekung @khawboonwan @teocheehean @lawrencewongst",2020-03-28 18:27:24+00:00,174

"" Link :  https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3077345/coronavirus-why-so-few-infections-singapores-health (UNQUOTE) This article in some ways praised Singapore Govt and this will make many Singaporeans proud. However, there is one important info in this article : (QUOTE) "" Experts suggest this has been more than just luck, pointing to a case in which 41 health workers were exposed to the coronavirus in a Singapore hospital yet evaded infection.The workers had all come within two metres of a middle-aged man with Covid-19 who was being intubated, a procedure which involves a tube being inserted into the patient’s trachea. The procedure is seen as being particularly hazardous for health workers as it is “aerosol generating” – patients are likely to cough. The workers had not known at the time that the man had the virus and all were quarantined after he tested positive. However, on their release two weeks later, none of them had the virus. The case has come to widespread attention partly because the workers were wearing a mix of standard surgical masks and the N95 mask, which doctors see as the gold standard as it filters out 95 per cent of airborne particles. “That none of the health care workers in this situation acquired infection suggests that surgical masks, hand hygiene, and other standard procedures protected them from being infected.” (UNQUOTE) See the MAIN POINT  here? Strong Evidence: WEARING MASKS ARE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION. Govt must act fast to produce our own masks, enforce everyone in public to wear masks, this will surely help in the overall containment.

How China with more than 1 billion population managed to have some effective containment was mainly due to domestic provincianal borders control. E.g. they locked down Hubei province, think they also locked down Zhejiang province. Main point : Malaysia Covid-19 crisis situation seems to be getting worse. It would be wise if both countries Singapore and Malaysia work out together to extend the borders lockdown. Figures show that a few hundred thousands of people crossed the borders daily (to and fro). This is extremely dangerous if the infected in Malaysia are much more than what was reported in the news. A few hundred thousands daily crossingsof Malaysia Singapore borders. This is no joke. And our Govt must seriously look into this to avoid becoming the next Italy. Once exploded, no amount of contact tracing can help to do effective containment. Not even lockdown after ""exploded"". Chinese saying : ""No Health No Wealth"" Health comes 1st. When Singapore is still within control, economy though bad is still manageable. BUT if Singapore exploded like Italy, any lockdowns, any closure of public transport, our economy will be much much worse than current (already bad) situation. So our Govt most important task now : to prevent Singapore from becoming the next Italy. At all costs. And the next thing to look out for : borders control with Malaysia. @lawrencewongst @leehsienloong @khawboonwan @hengsweekeat @teocheehean @gankimyong @ongyekung @vivianbalakrishnan",2020-03-23 03:06:35+00:00,238

Our economy will be 10X 100X worse than the current (already bad) situation. Indonesia is getting worse and had not hit the peak yet. So is Thailand. So is Philippines. Malaysia is getting worse. ASEAN very likely will explode to become the new Epi Center if ASEAN Govts dont do containment as well as Korea or China. Read this news (source TODAY) : "" KUALA LUMPUR — Doctors, nurses and other medical staff at Malaysian hospitals are treating Covid-19 patients in DIY protection gear made from everyday items like dustbin liners because there is a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).Such self-made gear is clearly inadequate and puts medical frontliners in danger of becoming infected with Covid-19 themselves.At present, 19 medical frontliners in Malaysia have come down with Covid-19, of which 11 are now warded in intensive care."" Singapore must NEVER open borders with Malaysia for at least the next few weeks. A few hundred thousands movements to fro daily. With Malaysia healthcare not up to par, infected Malaysians will flock/self-dump into Singapore if we open borders.
