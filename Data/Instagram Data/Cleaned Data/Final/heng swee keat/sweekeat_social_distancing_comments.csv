0,"It’s the final weekend before CNY, and also the final stretch before #SGBudget2021. Taking some time away from my Budget preparations, I joined my fellow East Coast Advisers yesterday to see how our residents and stallholders in East Coast are taking to the tighter safe management measures for the festive period. We also took the opportunity to distribute oranges and exchange greetings with people we met.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Glad to see residents in good spirits and getting ready for CNY, with groceries, flowers and bright decorations! Many appreciated the need for tighter safe management measures, such as a cap on the number of daily visitors each family can receive, given the global situation and the emergence of new, more contagious strains. Let us continue to do our part, to keep our loved ones and our friends and neighbours safe.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Thanks to all who came over to say hello to us, and to our many volunteers who helped with the visit. Stay safe and healthy!",2021-02-08 12:36:38+00:00,Very Good of You to exchange Chinese New Year Greetings with your East Coast Residents and Stallholders!,2021-02-08 13:10:54+00:00,17
13,"Last weekend, I joined our Bedok Orchid RC volunteers to distribute goodie bags to some 500 residents. In the hustle and bustle of CNY preparations, we did not forget our vulnerable and needy families.⁣
⁣
I was most concerned about our elderly residents, and kept checking that they were keeping a safe distance and not having to queue for long. When I urged them to take care of their health during this time, many of them rattled off the safe management measures to me. They reminded me to eat and rest more, told me which colours I should wear more often! The less mobile seniors we visited in their homes were also quite cheerful. It is really good to see our seniors well and in good spirits. Hope they will continue to stay well, and we can all spend more time together when the situation allows.⁣

Thank you to Sian Chay Medical Institution for your donations that brought joy to our residents’ day. And thank you to our Orchid RC volunteers for caring for the residents.⁣

I find that they are generally lacking in nutrients. A girl in our school is from the needy family and used to fall sick so often. A year ago, I decided to give her and her dad weekly supply of fruits and I find that their health improve significantly. She told me that they could not afford fruits.",2021-01-24 07:55:43+00:00,79
23,"Today marks one year since Singapore confirmed our first case of COVID-19. The year since then has been a revelation about ourselves and who we are as a people.&nbsp;

We have stood in solidarity with one another, and remained steadfast in the face of adversity.&nbsp;

There have been difficult moments and many livelihoods are still at stake. But with everyone playing their part, we managed to contain the virus and have regained some normalcy. It is a hard-won progress — but when we look at the experiences of countries around the world, the battle is far from over. The virus can easily wipe out our efforts if we are not careful.

We must stay alert to the changing situation and adapt quickly. There has been an increase in community cases recently. During my walkabouts, a number of residents also shared with me their concerns about the increasing crowds at public spaces. With Chinese New Year coming, the many festive gatherings could easily turn into new clusters if there are undetected community cases.&nbsp;

What we have today is hard earned. Tightening our measures pre-emptively avoids requiring much more severe measures downstream. @lawrencewongst and @gankimyong shared the latest measures, which will begin next Tuesday. Visits will be limited to eight distinct visitors per household per day. If you are heading out, do not visit more than two other households per day.&nbsp;

I thank everyone for your understanding, and for continuing to remain vigilant. With vaccination underway, I encourage you to take the vaccine when it is available to you. In the meantime, have a safe weekend!&nbsp;&nbsp;

In our walkabouts, you can always feel the warmth and vibrancy of our East Coast community. I have heard many uplifting and inspiring stories from residents and hawkers I encountered, and I have shared some of them in my photo captions.⁣
⁣
A resident also related to me how apt that a hawker centre is called 小贩中心, as all the hawkers are very passionate in their culinary craft, as they put their “heart” (心) into the dishes that they prepare. And customers enjoy their meals and chat with their friends and families with their hearts! 🍜⁣

There are also many wonderful spots in East Coast that you can explore — Changi Beach Park, Changi Village, Pulau Ubin, and East Coast Park just to name a few. But do check the visitorship levels using NParks’ safe distancing portal to avoid crowds: https://safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg.⁣
⁣
If you decide to head out, do continue to stay vigilant and exercise social responsibility — observe safe distancing, adopt safe entry and wear a mask. Have fun during your break!⁣

98,"I was sad to find out that my friend Mr Eng Liat Kiang passed away last Friday.

In these COVID-19 times, his family held a private funeral.

If there had been a wake, it would have included many younger entrepreneurs, partners and friends who have come to admire Mr Eng’s achievements, though not so many comrades of his age. You see, Mr Eng passed away at 102. When I last caught up with him, even as a centenarian, he was still going to work every day! His career — from working in a provision shop to being founder-chairman of Sin Heng Chan Group — is even older than our nation.

When the Japanese Occupation threw his first business into disarray, he took to selling garlic and onions by the roadside. He, and those of his generation, have braved many crises. Each time I spoke to him, I learnt something from his experiences and his attitude to life and business. He could take any hardship, he was always ready to find and make the most of opportunities even in crisis.

I trust that this never-say-die spirit lives on and stays strong in all of us. The community is also grateful for all he has done for the community. My deepest condolences to Mr Eng’s family.

翁烈强先生于2020年3月27日逝世。由于冠状疫情，翁先生的家属已经在上个星期五举行私人丧礼。

享年一百零二岁的翁先生，一生抱着永不言败的精神，一次又一次地创造事业的高峰。他是杰出的新加坡潮籍企业家，在艰苦的环境下白手起家，凭着顽强的意志力，开拓事业。随后，翁先生开创的新兴栈集团还打入东南亚、中国、中东等市场。去年一月，我在潮州八邑会馆《新加坡潮人故事》英文版的发布活动和翁先生相遇。他和我分享了丰富的人生经验。我非常尊敬翁先生，他不仅在自己的事业上取得成功，也为社区做出了很多贡献。我希望国人借鉴翁先生百折不挠的精神。在此，我向翁先生的家人表示深切哀悼和慰问，望多多保重节哀。 (Book launch of “The Story of Singapore Teochews” on 12 January 2019.)",2020-04-01 05:59:33+00:00,He sounds like quite a man.😥,2020-04-01 06:04:35+00:00,6

118,"Today in Parliament, we put in place stricter safe distancing guidelines. We are organised into two teams — Red and Blue. Our seats in the Chamber were also spaced out — a first in Parliament’s history.

I hope people understand that we must all do our part. As Kim Yong and @lawrencewongst pointed out in their Ministerial Statements today, all the measures we have in place will only be effective if we all do our part and are socially responsible. Our frontline healthcare workers, together with our public officers, are giving their all, working around the clock looking after patients, protecting Singapore and our people.

38,000 people are now serving their Stay Home Notices (SHN). Many of them have returned from countries that are hard hit by COVID-19. More will return in the coming days. We expect the number of new cases to go up.

@kshanmugam_ told the House of several cases of irresponsible behaviour — a few individuals who were on SHN were unwell, but still went to work and even participated in social gatherings. The police will be investigating these cases and those caught flouting their SHN will be charged in court.

Do your part — practise safe distancing, seek medical attention promptly if you do not feel well, stay at home if you are supposed to. Only when each of us does our part, can we protect our loved ones and the people around us.

It is timely that this special meeting of the G20 FMCBG was convened to discuss the COVID-19 situation. We face an extraordinary challenge on three fronts — public health, economic and financial fronts. I gave three sets of suggestions on how we can tackle this pandemic together — one for each front.

I am glad that G20 members have sent a strong signal that we are united in tackling COVID-19 – to take a strong and coordinated international response to address the pandemic. And a big thank you to the G20 Chair Saudi Arabia for leading this.
