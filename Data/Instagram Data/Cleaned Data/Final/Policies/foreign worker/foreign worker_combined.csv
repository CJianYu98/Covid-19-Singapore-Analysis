⠀
We have seen a large number of cases in our migrant worker dormitories. In the coming months, we will need to systematically and progressively recover all dormitories by testing and clearing all the residents. We will also be putting in Safe Working and Safe Living measures to protect the well-being of everyone.⠀
⠀
Our agencies and the Inter-agency Task Force have responded swiftly and systemically, and made good progress in managing the situation in our dormitories. A big thank you to our frontline workers, NGOs and companies for your commitment.⠀
⠀
We have been able to respond to this crisis because of the deep capabilities that we have invested and built up over the years — in the SAF, in our biotech sector, in our engineering and infrastructure sectors, in our healthcare sector and many more. These capabilities have been quickly mobilised and adapted to respond to the situation.⠀
⠀
As we shift into the next phase of our fight against COVID-19, we must continue to plan and invest ahead. We must stay highly vigilant as we progressively resume more activities and have more people return to work. Businesses, workers and the community must continue to adapt as the pandemic evolves.

In the wider community, there are some indications that the circuit breaker is starting to take effect. But these are still early days and we are concerned about the number of undetected cases in the community, as that will lead to further transmission.

320,82,"Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. That’s why we have been steadily building up our national testing capacity. 
From an average of 2,900 tests per day in early April, we are now able to conduct more than 8,000 tests per day. We are continuing to expand our testing capacity in the coming weeks and months. 
To date, Singapore has tested about 2100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the testing figures are 1600 in the US, 1100 in South Korea, and 1000 in the UK. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up more cases. 
In our migrant worker dormitories, for example, we have been testing around 3000 workers every day (including the workers that are asymptomatic), and will continue to do more tests.  So far, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about 1 in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6500 per 100,000). One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community. We are also doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes and senior residential homes, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers.
As more testing capacity is brought on-stream, we will gradually expand testing to the wider pool of workers. This expanded testing regime is of critical importance in enabling us to safely resume economic activities beyond the circuit breaker period.",2020-04-28 02:22:36+00:00,"keep going sir,you’ve our backs 💪🏽",2020-04-28 02:51:07+00:00,7

325,93,"Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. That’s why we have been steadily building up our national testing capacity. 
From an average of 2,900 tests per day in early April, we are now able to conduct more than 8,000 tests per day. We are continuing to expand our testing capacity in the coming weeks and months. 
To date, Singapore has tested about 2100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the testing figures are 1600 in the US, 1100 in South Korea, and 1000 in the UK. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up more cases. 
In our migrant worker dormitories, for example, we have been testing around 3000 workers every day (including the workers that are asymptomatic), and will continue to do more tests.  So far, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about 1 in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6500 per 100,000). One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community. We are also doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes and senior residential homes, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers.

327,96,"We are going all out to suppress the virus outbreak in the foreign worker dormitories. 
It’s a massive undertaking involving many people on the frontline - SAF and SPF officers, officials from MOM, as well as our healthcare doctors and nurses. 
They are going into the dorms to actively test the workers and isolate the infected ones from the healthy, and to ensure their overall well-being. The vast majority of the workers are young, and they tend to have very mild cough/cold symptoms that are not picked up by temperature taking alone. So the teams are working doubly hard to sweep through the dorms and test the workers, and this is also the reason why we are seeing such high reported cases every day.  We have to expect the numbers to remain high for some time as we continue this effort to swab, test and isolate the workers. 
To take care of the infected workers, we are rapidly expanding our community care facilities at the Singapore Expo and other sites. After the workers fully recover (and test negative), they will need a place to stay. So we are also preparing additional facilities to accommodate them.

It’s a massive undertaking involving many people on the frontline - SAF and SPF officers, officials from MOM, as well as our healthcare doctors and nurses. 
They are going into the dorms to actively test the workers and isolate the infected ones from the healthy, and to ensure their overall well-being. The vast majority of the workers are young, and they tend to have very mild cough/cold symptoms that are not picked up by temperature taking alone. So the teams are working doubly hard to sweep through the dorms and test the workers, and this is also the reason why we are seeing such high reported cases every day.  We have to expect the numbers to remain high for some time as we continue this effort to swab, test and isolate the workers. 
To take care of the infected workers, we are rapidly expanding our community care facilities at the Singapore Expo and other sites. After the workers fully recover (and test negative), they will need a place to stay. So we are also preparing additional facilities to accommodate them.

last month, the ministry of manpower (mom) eased movement restrictions for migrant workers living in dormitories and the 36-year-old has been running within the dormitory compounds for half an hour daily. 

before covid-19 struck, the construction worker regularly ran outside his dormitory along tanah merah coast road.

Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19. We do not need poison to ""protect""or ""heal"" us. I used Whatsapp to help a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication by replicating Jessica Seah's diet and nontoxic treatment. Appropriate cheap food can activate the immune system. It is cheap, simple and very effective. No expensive ventilators or toxic chemicals like disinfectants and hand sanitizers were needed!🇸🇬",2020-04-26 08:04:38+00:00,262

We discussed their work so far, what comes next, and what we can tweak and improve. We have come a long way, and the migrant workers are now starting to go back to work.

Helping our migrant workers has demanded a multi-faceted approach, with teams from many agencies working together. They have deployed both high tech and the personal touch, and put in enormous efforts to tackle the problem.

It will take us a few more months to resolve the dorms issue. We have kept things under control, and will progressively bring things back up and running again. Thank you all, once again, and keep up the good work! – LHL (MCI Photos by Chwee [1] and Lee Jia Wen [2-4])

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. – LHL

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The momentary congratulatory and smugness on so called “gold standard” response has now been replaced by reacting on the fly and poor leadership. Basics like stay at home and mandatory MASKS wearing were employed last minute. What a disaster with dormitory and 3rd world living conditions! How embarrassing! Your father Lee Kuan Yew would never have let this happen esp letting the ministers make rookie style, deer in head light decisions",2020-04-16 03:51:44+00:00,91
