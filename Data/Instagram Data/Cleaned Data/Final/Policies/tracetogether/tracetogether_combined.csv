0,2,"Parliament passed the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill today, after vigorous debate.
 
I support the Bill. Having served as a policeman for the first part of my public service career, I have seen my share of heart-wrenching crimes. In many cases, we are only able to deliver justice, by judiciously collecting and investigating the necessary evidence. This is our solemn duty to the victims and their families. We must enable our police officers to protect our people and keep Singapore safe. 
 
At the same time, we must respect personal privacy. The Bill today provides an important safeguard — that the data collected through contact tracing systems will be used only for that purpose except where there is a need for police investigations relating to seven categories of serious offences, including murder and rape. 
 
Minister @vivianbalakrishnan, who oversees our Smart Nation effort, gave a very clear account on how we balance the needs of fighting COVID-19 with the privacy of our people, while ensuring that justice is also achieved for serious crimes.
 
The trust of our people is critical to containing the virus. I’m glad that over 80% of our people are using TraceTogether. The Bill passed today is an additional step to safeguard this trust. 
 
COVID-19 remains a clear and present threat. We must continue to remain united behind a shared purpose to overcome this crisis, and emerge even stronger as a society.

2,0,"We’re embarking on our journey to Phase Three. But to avoid a flare up of the virus, any further relaxation must come with additional controls and safeguards, specifically scaled-up contact tracing and testing (including the use of rapid antigen test kits), as well as continued adherence to safe management measures.

We therefore need everyone to do their part to participate in the Trace Together programme, and to cooperate with all the prevailing safe distancing requirements. If we do that well and keep community transmission low, then we will be able to enter Phase Three before the end of the year. That means group sizes can increase from the present 5 to 8, and we can have larger events with multiple zones of 50 people. On the other hand, if we let our guard down and new clusters emerge, then the timeline will have to be pushed back.

Remember the fight is not over and we still have a long road ahead of us. It will not be possible to go back to the pre-Covid world any time soon. But if we stay disciplined and vigilant, we can continue to progressively resume activities and reopen our economy safely.",2020-10-20 15:22:15+00:00,cOrOnA aT tHe bAcK fUnNy,2020-10-20 15:32:09+00:00,5

Remember: if we have downloaded the TraceTogether App, we actually donâ€™t need the tokens.

Try let those who donâ€™t use the TraceTogether App to collect the tokens first - such as the elderly and those without handphones. 

The collection will go on for at least two weeks, so there's plenty of time.

We have made arrangements such that you can go to your nearest CC to collect the tokens, even if the CC is in another Division served by a different MP. 

So if you live in block 301 and is part of Sembawang Central Division under me, you can collect the tokens at Canberra CC near your home, even though the CC is in Canberra Division under Dr @limweekiak.

by december, it will be compulsory to use the tracetogether mobile application or token to check in at venues such as workplaces, schools, malls as well as food and beverage outlets under the government's plan to further reopen the economy.

at these venues, people will not be able to check in by scanning their identification cards or safeentry qr codes with their phones, the smart nation and digital government office said in a statement yesterday.

instead, they will have to either use the tracetogether app to scan a qr code at the premises or have the staff there scan the qr code found on their token.

currently, only the use of safeentry is compulsory.
