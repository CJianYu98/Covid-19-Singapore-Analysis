11,"I could not hold my annual Chap Goh Mei dinner with community leaders and other guests this year because of COVID-19. Instead, I spoke to a small audience at NTUC Auditorium, while groups joined us from 126 other locations virtually.

I took stock of our COVID-19 situation. We want to maintain our current stable position and get Singaporeans vaccinated quickly. The vaccines will take us one big step forward, but not back to business as usual, as many countries will not complete their vaccinations within this year. We have to live with the virus for many more years to come, maybe even permanently.

I also shared my thoughts on our external situation, and the outlook for the future. The next few years will not be easy. We can‚Äôt tell exactly how the world will change after the pandemic, but as long as we work together, hold fast to our principles, and keep faith both with our pioneers as well as generations yet unborn, we will emerge stronger and thrive for many years to come. ‚Äì LHL

12,"Pleased to see the safe arrival of the first batch of Moderna‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine this afternoon, earlier than expected. The Health Sciences Authority has given interim authorisation to use this vaccine in Singapore.

Our vaccination programme is proceeding smoothly. The latest delivery will allow us to continue as planned. More vaccination centres will open soon across Singapore. I hope seniors will book their appointments when their turn comes, so that we can all stay protected together. 

Until then, do continue to follow safety regulations, wear masks, and remember safe distancing! ‚Äì LHL

24,"Our pilot COVID-19 vaccination exercise for seniors aged 70 and above is underway. Following my visit to Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic two weeks ago, I dropped by Teck Ghee CC this morning to meet the seniors getting their jabs and observe the vaccination process.

Teck Ghee CC is one of two CCs being used for vaccinations, along with Tanjong Pagar CC. More centres will be set up in the coming weeks, so that everyone can conveniently receive their vaccinations.
 
Glad the take-up rate from our seniors has been very encouraging. Many thanks to all involved ‚Äì the vaccination team, the community partners, and volunteers ‚Äì for your hard work in reaching out to seniors, guiding them along each step, and ensuring a smooth process. ‚Äì LHL

The vaccination programme will be rolled out to other estates from mid-February. If you have seniors at home who have received the letter, please help them make their appointment for their vaccination. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated as soon as you can. The more of us are protected, the sooner we can get back to a more normal life. ‚Äì LHL
