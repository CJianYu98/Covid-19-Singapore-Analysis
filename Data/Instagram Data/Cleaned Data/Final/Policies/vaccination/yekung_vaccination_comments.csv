14,"We officially started the Sea-Air Vaccination Exercise for our frontliners working at our borders on 18 Jan 2021. 

The attached graph shows the progress made in the maritime sector. 

The top horizontal line shows the number of frontline workers eligible - 18k. 

The first line bordering the blue area shows the number that got their first dose over the last 1.5 months. The number now stands at 17.6k, or 98% of eligible frontline maritime personnel. 

The second line bordering the green area shows the number who have received the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 16.7k have, and in the coming days, almost all would have. 

This means that substantially all frontline maritime workers will be vaccinated, and this is a major step in securing our borders and minimising import cases infiltrating our community, and strengthening international confidence in our maritime hub. 

I thank the various stakeholders - @maritime_sg, EDB, EnterpriseSG, SMOU, SOS, SSA, ASMI, @moh_singapore, Fullerton Health, maritime companies, and also workers and their families, for their tremendous support.

Dr Lim Wee Kiak called for the rebate package for taxi and private hire drivers to be brought forward, which Government has followed up on.

Ms Mariam explained why when evaluating Singapore√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s carbon emission, we need to take into account of the fact that Singapore is a city state which provides aviation, maritime and chemical processing services to the rest of the world.

Ms Poh Li San spoke about how Singapore, despite its limitations, has set a good international example on sustainability and conservation.

Mr Vikram Nair had useful suggestions on how to encourage more people to receive Covid-19 vaccinations.

More than 50,000 active taxi and private hire car drivers will receive an SMS this week to book their vaccination slot. 

Amongst the more than 12,000 taxi and PHC drivers who went for voluntary swab test last September, none tested positive. This is partly due to all the safe measures that have been put in place. 

Notwithstanding, vaccination is an important added protection for our drivers, their families and commuters.

COVID-19 test results, and soon, your vaccination status, may become very relevant information at the check-in and immigration counters for cross border travel. But they will need to be easily verifiable.

Airlines are foreseeing this. So @singaporeair is working with International Air Transport Association (#IATA), and #Affinidi, a local technology company founded by @temasekseen, to start a trial on digital verification for COVID-19 tests and soon, vaccinations.

Accredited labs will issue a health certificate - a QR code on mobile or printed on paper - to passengers, to be scanned and verified easily and securely by airlines and immigration officers using an app.

Hopefully, with the support of IATA, various airlines and authorities around the world, this can become the norm, and replace the yellow book.
