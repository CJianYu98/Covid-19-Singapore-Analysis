Photo by Zheng Zhangxin",2021-01-08 10:29:08+00:00,"Hi Mothership and netizens! Sharing something not related to the above news post. We have grown stronger as a nation throughout COVID19. As we enter 2021, I would like to highlight an incident that we have gone through as a nation. In 2019, an ex-employee of Fei Yue Family Service Centre (a government agency), Guichan Ng Ks (a married woman in her late 40s), committed adultery by procuring the services of male prostitutes. The browsing traffic of her internet service was examined. It was subsequently found that she met up with male prostitutes several times, engaging in sexual acts and copulation, and also discussed them over messaging apps. In examining her internet files, hundreds of hours of bestiality selfie video was also discovered, recording her having sexual intercourse with her pet dog. The details shall not be elaborated here. If you have questions regarding the incident itself, you may contact Speaker of Parliament, Tan Chuan Jin, who is very involved in the community.In September 2019, Guichan was fired from her job in Fei Yue FSC, due to her defiance and refusal to comply with the Singapore government. In particular, she defamed and harrassed her friends without provocation. Although the matter was not pursued legally, she was fired from her job in Fei Yue to prevent her from further abusing her role as a social worker. Her current marital and job status is unknown as she does not have any prior company employment before her job in Fei Yue. If you have concerns or questions regarding Guichan in Fei Yue, you may enquire with Tony Ong Kie Wee, one of her superiors. In regards to the prosecution of Guichan Ng Ks' bestial acts and possession of zoophilic videos, you may contact S Iswaran, Minister of Communication and Information or Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs and Law, or any Member of Parliament. Mothership has been a great source of news, useful stories and anecdotes. We hope this platform continues to serve many more generations of Singaporeans.As we welcome 2021, we can be confident of winning the challenges in life as one Singapore.Regards and thanks,A friend of the authorities.",2021-01-08 19:55:12+00:00,350

If yes, we may be in phase 3 by Jan. If no, den we may be in phase 2 until a vaccine is found. Yes, nightlife will definitely be gone, but the Govt will help them find new jobs. If a vaccine frm China is given to us by Nov, maybe phase 3 will happen. To those who are worried abt side effect or whatsoever, relax, it will be checked by HSA bef selling it to us. However, being vaccinated does not mark the end of covid. WHO have said, no country is safe unless all are safe. Life will definitely cannot return to the pre covid 19 life, we still have to take precautions when we head out. The ways of socialising with others will be very different as well. Safe distancing will definitely be the norm forever. As wat LHL have said, we have to be mentally prepared for Disease X. It may be here anytime soon, and mutate quickly to infect more. But we can prepare ourselves for it by stop thinking dat life will go back to pre covid 19 if we are vaccinated, and live in dis new normal.

Photo from NEA / FB",2020-08-31 10:46:31+00:00,"I realised there have been some comments abt imported cases and community cases, and I wld like to clarify so doubts abt it. 1st, the dorm cases are workers dat are still serving their QO in their dorms or those under RRT. MOH have alr said dat numbers may continue to be high bef tapering down continuously, but dat doesn't mean dat the community is covid free, or yall start to get Complacent seeing low community numbers and go out more often as if covid is over. Cmon, the war is still very very far frm over. A vaccine may not conclude the end of covid, it may be here for up to 2 yrs, or maybe forever, just like seasonal flu, influenza and dengue. To those who are saying dat if u are vaccinated, u can start to be Complacent, by all means, do it urself. Don't drag ur friends or family to be Complacent with u, thinking dat u are totally immuned with covid. Wat if vaccine is not effective? And u start socialising with ppl dat may still be infected after being vaccinated? Cmon, its not the way to do things. WHO have said, dat covid may be here forever w/o a vaccine, and a vaccine is not a straight end to covid. Who knows swine flu is the nxt pandemic? If u think u can start going out more often like pre covid days and socialise as much as u want, then, the ICU ward for covid is reserved for u soon with a ventilator. Sep hols is cming, I wld not xpect crowds do be forming everywhere and ppl are starting to get Complacent. Just on 9 Aug, there was a hell lot of crowd queueing outside tamp mall to scan the safe entry and enter tamp mall. My question to them: has covid ended? Why is complacency stepping in so quick? Just because it national day, covid has hit taken a break yet. And yes true enuf, it was reported as a covid 19 place  due to major Complacency frm the public, thinking dat weekends and holidays its time to go crowded places. Ffs, u are still to stay home!  3rd, imported cases. Imported cases were given SHN, and were tested bef the end of their 14 day quarrantine to prevent spreading to the wider community. The war with covid is gnna last for very long, so do pls stay home more often, so dat u won't be in a ICU covid ward with a ventilator",2020-08-31 11:07:44+00:00,414

But a lot of people dont seem to understand that the government functions in a different way compared to individuals. In fact every government needs to look at the bigger picture rather than the small nitty gritty needs of every single person in the country. Any society that functions on the latter will simply see a collapse in the running of daily life. A lot of demands and questions are being raised but a lot of it can and should be dismissed because context is not being taken into account. A lot of ‚ÄòWHY NOW ISNT IT TOO LATE‚Äô can be answered with one word - context. This pandemic is inherently volatile - nothing can be predicted. And thats why in the initial stages it is close to impossible to not do anything about it or completely go into a full panic mode. Why measures were implemented progressively prior to this circuit breaker is to ease people into this transition while keeping the situation relatively under control. If drastic measures are imposed, we will end up like countries such as Italy or India, where the entire country will be thrown into a frenzy and its impacts will simply be expanded and prolonged. Look, even a slight step up in measures imposed can trigger huge waves of panic buying, what gives the government confidence to announce complete shutdowns in the early stages (considering also that there wasnt such a necessity)?

I asked if some things were coming back to normal. The answer: ‚ÄúNot yet. At least for one more month. Now, in Hubei province, no one is allowed to go out. Every family can go to the supermarket in town every three days to buy groceries.‚Äù Experts think the Covid-19 virus will be around into next year, and could disrupt health systems and economies, and seem concerned about the effect on South Asia and Africa, if it starts spreading there. Recent data (below) suggests an unprecedented (!) slowdown. The markets keep moving up while key driver of the global economy has lost its drive. It is nuts! Capital markets don‚Äôt care, because stimulus has remained the key driver for capital markets for a very long time. The Chinese markets almost collapsed as a reaction to the outbreak, but the 10 percent drop was remedied with tight restrictions on sell orders and some massive liquidity injections (the ""Yi Gang put""). The DAX just hit all-time-high today at the same time as China and the Global Economy grinds to a halt. The markets actually look much worse now than in March 2000 or in October 2008. And the pattern with a constant clamour for eternal cheap credit, negative rates, and rising asset prices - is just about to break.  https://www.facebook.com/109691020613665/posts/117432933172807/?d=n",2020-02-17 16:20:09+00:00,219

Why? Cos need to make sure you never kena, other people infected but no mask then end up spreading to others is not your problem, everyone else can die except you. 2) Stockpile everything at home. Toilet paper and maggi mee are essentials. Never eat maggi mee will die. No toilet paper don't know how to wash butt will die. 3) Don't travel overseas. Actually don't travel anywhere. Just stay at home 24/7. Maybe you want to close window also so virus cannot enter. When order online must wear hazmat suit to collect delivery then do full decon outside house first. 4) Cut off all ties from all China people. Might as well cut off all ties from your Chinese heritage as well. 5) When new rumour comes out, must share on every chat group you have. Make sure the people you send to also forward the rumour. Make chain messages great again! Sounds pretty ridiculous right? But that's exactly what is happening now. Seriously ppl wake up your bloody idea lah, can use brain and think whether what you doing is logical anot? Instead of flexing your cash and going on irrational stockpiling, how about flexing that brain to think on a wider level?",2020-02-09 02:24:39+00:00,214
