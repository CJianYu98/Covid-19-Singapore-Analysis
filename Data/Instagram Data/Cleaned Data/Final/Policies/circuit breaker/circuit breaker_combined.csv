Met some P5 and 6 students who shared their #CircuitBreaker experience with me. They didn‚Äôt like it and much preferred going to school. But they also learnt to make the most of the situation. Some picked up new skills, while others helped out with household chores. They spent more time with family members and learnt to appreciate the important things in life. They showed adaptability and resilience and these are the traits that will put them in good stead for the future.

17,41,"Working from home has taken new meaning for most of us. We‚Äôre doing more remote meetings with our colleagues and realising that we can be just as productive at home as we have been in the office. The circuit breaker has showed us that we can work effectively in different ways.
We must now embrace working from home as the new norm. So even as more Singaporeans return to work during Phase 1 of the reopening plans, we expect the majority of the workforce to continue to work from home. 
This is why we have imposed the following requirement on employers after 1 June: your staff should return to work only if they need specialised equipment and machinery that cannot be accessed from home, or if they need to fulfil legal requirements (eg to complete contracts or transactions). On that basis, we expect most employees working in an office setting to continue working from home as they are presently doing. 
Many employers and managers will need to adjust their mindsets to this new normal. It‚Äôs no longer about having all your staff physically present at work. Even if they have to be on site, consider if they really need to do so every day. You could have hybrid arrangements where your employees work from home several days a week. 
For those who absolutely need to be in the office, employers must ensure that the work environment is safe (eg maintain good ventilation and high hygiene standards, and have officers seated apart etc) and offer them staggered work hours. 
All these workplace measures are critical in our fight against Covid-19 - they will reduce the need for daily movement of people, and minimise the risks of the virus flaring up again.",2020-05-23 13:30:38+00:00,üëçüòäüí™ Have a good Long weekend.,2020-05-23 14:25:53+00:00,5

Singaporeans and businesses alike have been on the receiving end of the strict measures put in place, through entirely no fault of theirs.

We are appreciative and grateful for all the great decisions so far. However, i am indeed shocked that in the last few days your team has said to protect the most vulnerable group in nursing homes as they will not be able to survive well if the virus hits them. Why then is MOH allowing covid patients to be housed in Renci community where there is so many levels of vulnerable residents and also patients who need to come for weekly kidney dialysis? These group has bodies that cannot take a second round of strike against them. Could you be kind and just and not remove this post and instead look into this matter, and give it serious considerations if its a right decision, and if this contradicts the stand to protect the most vulnerable ones among us? They have family who loves them till their last breath. This last breath is already a vulnerable last one and one wrong move will not be a just a number, it will be shattered family hearts. We sincerely hope you will look into this. We understand bed crunches issues, but please underdtand us, we the family of the vulnerable residents, need to seek ur help to protect the most vulnerable ones.

First, we call on everyone to minimise movement. Stay home as much as possible. If you need to go out to buy food or groceries, do so by yourself.  If you need to go out to exercise, do so by yourself and in your neighbourhood. This is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones.
Second, we will tighten access to popular areas where people are still gathering, like wet markets and supermarkets, so that safe distancing measures can be better implemented. For a start we will introduce a new control measure in selected popular wet markets to limit entry to alternate days.
Third we will close more work premises and tighten the list of essential services. The aim is to reduce the number of essential workers still out and about, so that we can minimise movement and interactions. Additional requirements will also be put in place to ensure that these workers and their employers uphold safe distancing measures at their workplaces.

You saved $millions in costs but touchwood, if Singapore exploded like Italy because of ""these costs savings"", Singpore stand to lose $billons in the ""prolonged collapse of Singapore economy"". And Singaporeans and local residents lives and health are worth $trillions if you want to calculate that way. I hope The Elections is not our Govt 1st priorities right now.

The Taskforce has decided to put in place a nation-wide circuit breaker starting for at least a month, starting 7 April, to slow the spread of the virus. 
Under these stringent measures, all workplace premises other than those providing essential services or operating as part of global supply chains will have to close. For these closed premises, the work activities can continue only if all their employees work from home. Schools and IHLs will also be closed and will shift to full home-based learning.

Supermarkets and F&B outlets will remain open. For all F&B outlets, including hawker centres and coffeeshops, dining in will not be allowed - so you can only order food for delivery or takeout.

Essentially, we must all abide by these basic rules:
- Stay at Home. Avoid interactions with anyone outside of your family members who are already living with you
- Go out only if you have to do essential things (like going to work, buying groceries, or doing your daily exercise)
- If you have to go out, and cannot avoid close contact with others, wear a mask.

I‚Äôd like to add if I may - that is to make mask wearing mandatory when we are out. This is crucial especially in enclosed setting like buses, trains. It should not be a choice, left to the people to decide since the govt stand is - wear one if you can‚Äôt avoid crowds. There will always be  a group of people who don‚Äôt or refuses to wear one for their own reasons. Wearing one is protecting OTHERS  from one‚Äôs droplets from coughing, sneezing, talking. We should all and rightfully so, be concerned at the rise of local unlinked cases and the asymptomatic carriers lurking amongst us. We can‚Äôt afford to have a tiny chance that some of these people could be asymptomatic and unknowingly be spreading the virus. Now that every resident will get a reusable mask, there is no reason not to mask up when out. I hope people will change the selfish mindset - cloth mask ‚â† ineffective (against virus) therefore I won‚Äôt wear.  When Malaysia ends her lockdown we will see an influx of people coming in. Temperature scanning can not longer be trusted as a gauge to weed out the infected ones. We need everyone to wear a mask, on top of social distancing measures to further boost containment. Anyone not wearing one should be refused entry to Singapore. This rule should also be applied to trains and buses and crowded places. The seniors, and the sick are the most vulnerable group of people - we must all do what we can as citizens to protect them and to safeguard our healthcare system.

Fact is : it is most Singaporeans ""main asset"". Imho, your policy only benefits the upper class who holds private properties assets) Straight to the point. My suggestion : our Govt next move to tackle the Covid-19 crisis is to have better, stricter guidelines and checks on our food industries and imported food products (from Epi Centers such as Italy, China, Korea) and especially Malaysia. NEA should level up on this. NEA should deploy checks on big large scale central kitchens in Singapore to peridically check on the production staff. E.g. a central bakery employing hundreds of production workers doing cakes production if they are not highly regulated , guided, checked to be safe, any infected food production worker may become ""a super spreader"" through food distribution, sales, consumption. Imagine an infected worker coughed on a cake, cake is then eaten by a few. Would  that spread virus? It is NEA job to enhance food safety assurance.

Singapore.  What does that mean ? Singapore is in high risk and danger of becoming the next Italy. Now we know China aggressive, decisive, extreme measures : the lockdown in Jan were necessary and the correct move. We can compare situations now. Europe vs China. China is doing a better job in the containment efforts. As for Singapore, schools are going to reopen on 23 Mar. Singapore are still ""open doors"" for business.

The 21-year-old university student was then led to a decontamination room with five other people, who were all coughing.By evening, his test results came back and he was told that he was a COVID-19 suspect patient.‚ÄúI was placed in another room with five other people.

Many patients have expressed frustration that they did not qualify for COVID-19 testing.Their worries were compounded by a perceived lack of transparency surrounding coronavirus cases in Indonesia.Ms Karoline Sinaga, 30, went to a hospital on Mar 3 when she developed a mild fever following her return from South Korea, one of the countries badly hit by the pandemic, in late February.She was offered a ‚ÄúCOVID-19 package‚Äù consisting of a chest X-ray and a blood test, but not the COVID-19 swab.‚ÄúI asked why I didn‚Äôt get the swab test and they replied saying that the COVID-19 package only has these tests,‚Äù she told CNA. A health expert from think tank ThinkWell Global said that it is reasonable for the government and hospitals to only conduct swab tests on potentially positive COVID-19 patients.Mr Hasbullah Thabrany told CNA that it is inefficient to test everyone.‚ÄúThe cost is expensive, and it may cause people who have a high chance of having the disease to not being able to get tested,‚Äù he said, adding that this is about managing limited resources.Mr Yurianto, the government‚Äôs spokesman for COVID-19, has urged people to self-isolate at home if they only display mild symptoms.

Feedback : Why are Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as Macau faring better than other cities in tackling against the Covid-19 Crisis ? My guess : M A S K S . That's right. Almost everyone is encouraged to wear masks. So what happens when they do that ? Those who are infected or unaware they are affected covered themselves with masks thus reducing the risks of transmission. And those not infected also wear masks makes it a "" double protection "". We cannot adopt a ""self-deceiving"" concept that asking everyone to wear masks will not help as much simply because we do not have enough masks or could not produce our own masks. Wearing masks does help. If not, why 1 minister said if we run out of masks, medical staff may not work? It simply means masks help the medical staff to protect themselves against the Covid-19.

191,331,"The Wuhan coronavirus situation is evolving rapidly. Over the last 24 hours, we have seen an accelerating trend of infection among the population of Chinese nationals from Hubei. That‚Äôs why we have decided to take additional measures today to limit the risks from Hubei travellers. 
We will quarantine recent travellers from Hubei who are still in Singapore, as well as returning residents/long-term pass holders with recent travel history to Hubei. We will also take actions to curb new visitors with recent travel history to Hubei or with PRC passports issued in Hubei. 
We have a comprehensive plan with contingencies for different scenarios. These measures are part of our plans. Given the accelerating trends and risk levels, we‚Äôve decided to activate them now. 
We have to be mindful that the situation is fluid, with new information coming out from China every day, and with our risk assessments being updated constantly. So we will monitor closely and adjust our posture day by day. We are now taking stricter measure against Hubei travelers.

What would happen to them? So the thing is nobody wanted this virus to start, not you,not me. Yes I understand that none of us like that this virus is on going,that many lifes have been impacted indirectly or directly in a way. I understand that this (may) have caused negative changes but everyone makes mistakes. Think back to the time you did something you regretted,what did you want? You didn't want it to even happen in the first place,you wanted people to understand and forgive you.This is basically the same situation China is in so I hope everyone is able to understand may not be immediately but gradually!

1127,33,"I was very happy to e-meet many familiar faces from the social service sector on Saturday, together with @desmond.lee, @gracefu.hy and @indraneerajah, ahead of my Ministerial Statement next Tuesday.

We heard from 30 social service sector partners, on the challenges they and their clients are facing. We discussed how our social service agencies can strengthen collaboration and capability building. Their passion to serve came through during the dialogue, as they are doing all they can to strengthen support for vulnerable members of our community during the circuit breaker. The circuit breaker has accelerated the shift to digital, as more services are provided online. This highlighted both the potential and also the current constraints of going digital. Many also shared their concerns about the difficulties with fundraising during this period.

Many good ideas were raised. I will look at how we can better support the social service sector as part of the upcoming Budget. We will also work with the sector to embrace digitalisation, accelerate transformation and scale up new capabilities.

What is even more heartening is how the sector is working together. Some participants were already working closely together, and new areas of collaboration were identified during our discussions. The sector faces many common challenges, but we can overcome them if we work in partnership, and put our collective effort into tackling them. This is the spirit of our #SingaporeTogether movement.

We are making good progress towards building a more caring and inclusive society. We will build an even better tomorrow, with the strong support of social service agencies.

Our Muslim community has also shown kindness and understanding, despite having to scale down on many of our activities during this period.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Let us continue to stay home and stay safe during this period, so that we can look forward to celebrating many more special occasions with our families and friends!‚†Ä

Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri to all Muslims in Singapore.‚†Ä

Earlier this evening, I joined @masagosz, @maliki_osman, leaders from our Malay/Muslim organisations, and community partners for an e-Buka Puasa instead, given our circuit breaker measures.‚Å£
‚Å£
WGS and MUIS organised this ‚Äòlive‚Äô e-Buka Puasa on WGS‚Äôs Facebook Page, with chit-chat sessions and music performances.‚Å£
‚Å£
I thank all our Muslims for your understanding in making these difficult adjustments, while keeping the community spirit strong and supporting the fight against COVID-19. This care and togetherness is the very spirit of #SingaporeTogether.‚Å£
‚Å£
I hope our Muslim friends will have a good time with your families preparing to usher in Hari Raya over the next few days.‚Å£

Saya teringat pada tahun lalu saya berpeluang berbuka puasa di Wisma Geylang Serai (WGS) dan berkunjung ke bazar Hari Raya. Malam ini, ekoran langkah pemutus rantaian jangkitan, saya bersama Masagos Zulkifli, Dr Maliki Osman, dan para pemimpin serta rakan-rakan dari beberapa pertubuhan Melayu/Islam di Singapura mengikuti sesi e-Buka Puasa.‚Å£
‚Å£
WGS dengan kerjasama MUIS telah menganjurkan sesi e-Buka Puasa ini secara ‚Äòlive‚Äô melalui laman Facebook WGS. Sesi ‚Äòlive‚Äô ini juga padat dengan pelbagai persembahan dan sesi bersembang.‚Å£
‚Å£
Saya ingin mengucapkan terima kasih kepada rakan-rakan Muslim kita kerana membuat penyesuaian demi mengharungi cabaran COVID-19 bersama. Ini adalah semangat #SGTeguhBersatu.‚Å£

Semoga rakan-rakan Muslim kita ceria menyambut kedatangan Hari Raya disamping keluarga tersayang.‚Å£

At this young age, they cannot take care of themselves by wearing face masks properly or keeping hygienic. 3. The teachers do not have the time to look into taking care of each kid. 4. Many grand parents, parents or helpers will congregate to fetch them to and fro. 5.Those children without pte pick up need the school buses to fetch them. Usually buses need an optimum passenger load. Also frequent disinfecting of buses and school areas cannot be guaranteed. 6.

OTH is a lot quieter these days ‚Äî and for good reason, as many residents and Singaporeans understand the need and importance of staying home during this period.

The OTH team has worked hard to move the buzz online ‚Äî with OTH‚Äôs Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube channels offering contests, workouts, craft tutorials, and concerts to keep everyone staying safe at home entertained and occupied. So you can check out OTH virtually!

I know many residents are looking forward to visiting OTH again. As we slowly and gradually emerge from the circuit breaker, it will not be the same as before. We will have to observe precautionary measures including SafeEntry, to protect the community and prevent a surge of new cases.

For Teachers, this means putting in extra time and effort to prepare. HBL is a different mode of teaching, and you have to be creative and learn new skills to make online learning as engaging as possible.

For Parents, you have to support your children in the best possible way, even as you juggle working from home and housework.

For Students, I know many of you miss your classmates, your favourite hangouts and CCAs in schools. E-learning is not new, but having to do so remotely for a month is a completely different way to learn.

Challenging as it is for everyone, this experience also creates many memorable stories. I urge you all to share these, so that we can all learn about what worked, what did not; why not, and how we can do better.

Let us all be prepared to try new things, adapt and grow with this new experience, and we may just become more innovative after this! The first step in any innovation is to overcome the fear of the unknown. But if the new approach is better, we can learn better. If the traditional approach is better, we will appreciate it more, and look forward to going back to school!

Education Minister @ongyekung has brought forward our mid-year school holidays, so that everyone can have a respite.

‚†Ä
Like many of us, I am concerned about how our seniors are coping, that they may feel lonely or isolated. Our elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19. With the circuit breaker in place, they should stay home as much as possible. We can visit to assist them with their daily needs while keeping the visits short. This is the best way to protect their well-being. It is not easy to explain that we may sometimes have to stay away because we care, but we must do so.

We can still show care and concern for the elderly, even when we are not physically present. There are many ways to keep in touch ‚Äî through WhatsApp, video-conferencing apps such as Skype, or just a simple phone call.

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page. This is a @gov.sg collaboration with producer @jackneock for our seniors to enjoy the familiar tunes from yesterdays in the comfort of our homes.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Let us all help our elderly family members adapt so that they can remain happy and engaged at home. Safe distancing does not mean social isolation.‚†Ä ‚†Ä
I encourage those with good ideas on how to keep our seniors engaged at home to come forward and take part in the #StayhomeforSG challenge.‚†Ä

Does this mean that in order to protect the grandparents, the younger family members should move out? 2. What if the grand parents are not old and fragilecas assumed but lead an active and healthy life and are relatively young and have been looking after the grand children while the parents are working? 3.  If the healthy grandparents actually stay next door or across the block like 3 mins walk,the grand kids are also not allowed to be with the grand parents? 4. If childcare centres are so safe, why do the pre-schools, all schools need to close? Mr Heng, it is good to apply CB but in this case, I think some form of flexibility should be allowed. Reason is now most parents have to work from home and very young kids are a big distraction. They affect the parents work negatively. Also assuming that all grandparents are old, frail and unhealthy is not altogether correct. Hope that certain form of flexibility be allowed. Who can be approached in MOH or govt officers when the appeal has to be carried out?",2020-04-10 03:39:02+00:00,189

‚†Ä
Like many of us, I am concerned about how our seniors are coping, that they may feel lonely or isolated. Our elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19. With the circuit breaker in place, they should stay home as much as possible. We can visit to assist them with their daily needs while keeping the visits short. This is the best way to protect their well-being. It is not easy to explain that we may sometimes have to stay away because we care, but we must do so.

We can still show care and concern for the elderly, even when we are not physically present. There are many ways to keep in touch ‚Äî through WhatsApp, video-conferencing apps such as Skype, or just a simple phone call.

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page.

Like many of us, I am concerned about how our seniors are coping, that they may feel lonely or isolated. Our elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19. With the circuit breaker in place, they should stay home as much as possible. We can visit to assist them with their daily needs while keeping the visits short. This is the best way to protect their well-being. It is not easy to explain that we may sometimes have to stay away because we care, but we must do so.

We can still show care and concern for the elderly, even when we are not physically present. There are many ways to keep in touch ‚Äî through WhatsApp, video-conferencing apps such as Skype, or just a simple phone call.

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page. This is a @gov.sg collaboration with producer @jackneock for our seniors to enjoy the familiar tunes from yesterdays in the comfort of our homes.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Let us all help our elderly family members adapt so that they can remain happy and engaged at home. Safe distancing does not mean social isolation.‚†Ä ‚†Ä

1218,229,"PM @leehsienloong announced yesterday a set of significantly stricter measures, as a circuit breaker to curb the escalating number of new COVID-19 cases. Most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, will close for one month from next Tuesday.

We are implementing these painful but necessary measures to protect lives. The stronger the measures we adopt, the bigger the disruption and costs on businesses. We remain equally committed to protecting jobs and livelihoods during this time. Many businesses are looking at your cash flow and working out alternative arrangements over the weekend. I understand your worries.

That is why I am working with my team at the @mof_sg, together with other government agencies, to further increase support for businesses during the period of the circuit breaker. This includes boosting the Job Support Scheme and waiving the foreign worker levy for the month of April, so that companies can retain and pay their workers. We will also be passing legislation on Tuesday (7 April) in Parliament to ensure that property tax rebates are passed through to tenants.

This is undoubtedly a difficult month for many businesses. Additional help is on the way. I hope that businesses can tide through this month, hold on to your workers, and resume activities once the circuit breaker is lifted. Together, we can pull through this crisis.

I will announce the details in my ministerial statement in Parliament on Monday.

This move came after two Singaporeans who attended a religious gathering in Malaysia had returned here with COVID-19.

Today, @masagosz announced that the mosque closure will be extended till 26 March 2020 to further limit the spread of the virus.

I understand that the closure of mosques and suspension of Friday prayers will cause inconvenience to our friends from the Muslim community. But this is a necessary move in order to reduce the risk of secondary transmission and to protect all Singaporeans. In a mosque setting, it is challenging to conduct contact tracing due to the lack of registration for regular congregants.

There are 1-2 cases a day and if MOH decides to over react and destroy many businesses with these 3 phases, there will be even more unhappy people. There is a delicate balance between too much restrictions on businesses opening and fear of a resurgence. Resurgence may or may not be a way of life going forward but when you force extreme restrictions in businesses down people‚Äôs throats, you will create anger in people with too much time because there is no work in their hands.

(I watched Vietnam news their mask factories the workers do wear gloves). If our local mask factories workers are infected with Covid-19 and they do not wear gloves to touch/sort/pack the masks, the consequences can be disastrous.

The ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù is essential to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. As we expected, daily numbers of new cases are still going up, and faster than before. We must bring the numbers down, and the only way is for all of us to observe the circuit breaker measures strictly.

Stay at home, except when you have to go out to do essential work or buy food. If you need to go to the market, stagger your timing too. Avoid being part of the crowd. This is not a month long holiday, when we can go out for jalan jalan or to meet up with friends.

The health of us all depends on the actions of each of us. Please do your part. ‚Äì LHL

This is something we always do, to allow teachers some time to rest and recharge, although we know many of them use the time to plan lessons and stay in touch with students. 
As for the following two weeks, √¢‚Ç¨¬™starting 19 May√¢‚Ç¨¬¨, schools will bring back students from graduating cohorts, i.e. Pri 6, Sec 4 and 5, JC2 and Pre-U 3.  We know that these students have been anxious about the preparation for their national exams, and that home-based learning cannot fully substitute face to face coaching and lessons. 
Their return to school will be done in a careful and calibrated manner, with ample safe distancing. They will come back in small groups, on selected days in a week, throughout the day, and will be spaced out within the school compound. They will meet teachers one-to-one, or in small groups.  Masks are compulsory. 
We will give priority to students requiring school facilities for coursework and practical sessions, as well as those who need additional support and remediation. 
Throughout the holidays, schools will also continue to engage students with greater needs and provide care for those whose parents work in essential services and are unable to secure alternative care arrangements.
