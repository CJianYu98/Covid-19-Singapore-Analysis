If schools were to close, it affects your studies so much, people are already complaining about tuition centres closing and they need the help from tuition teachers, what more if schools were to close? You can't even study or consult your teachers. Furthermore, with all the extra time on your hands how many of you will really stay home 24/7? u're gonna go running about void decks and shopping malls mixing and increasing your risk.What if schools were to remain open? Yes there is a risk u'll get infected but we're 2 months into this shit, how many of our students are infected? not even a quarter of our confirmed cases are students, if you were to practice social distancing and personal hygiene, head home immediately after school and stay home at all times, the risk lowers by a lot, you are able to prevent getting infected even if schools were to remain open, i'm pretty sure u're allowed to wear masks in school as well, so cmon little boys and girls, stop complaining for once",2020-03-24 12:39:55+00:00,203
