Every country is doing its best to contain the spread of the virus and the economic fallout. But no place can truly be safe, until every place is safe.
 
This is why strong international cooperation is critical to accelerate the development of vaccines, maximise production capacity, and ensure the affordable, fair and equitable access to vaccines for all.
 
New and innovative forms of multilateral cooperation have been created in response to the pandemic, including the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and the COVID-19 Global Vaccines Access (COVAX) Facility. Singapore is an early support of these initiatives, and also co-chairs the Friends of the COVAX Facility with Switzerland.
 
Our collective effort will enable us to overcome this crisis. By working together and strengthening the foundations of international cooperation, we can better deal with future crises and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, so as to build a better future for our people. 
 
You can watch my recorded statement at the High-Level Event on the COVID-19 response at the UN General Assembly on my Facebook Page.

One key area of cooperation that we discussed was public health, including the development of COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines and treatments. I thanked Vice Premier Han for China‚Äôs pledge to make Chinese vaccines available globally. We also agreed that it was important to further strengthen connectivity between our two countries and with the rest of the world, in areas such as supply chain, financial, infrastructure and flight connectivity. This will enable the flow of goods, people and investments that are necessary for economic recovery.‚Å£

475,11,"I could not hold my annual Chap Goh Mei dinner with community leaders and other guests this year because of COVID-19. Instead, I spoke to a small audience at NTUC Auditorium, while groups joined us from 126 other locations virtually.

I took stock of our COVID-19 situation. We want to maintain our current stable position and get Singaporeans vaccinated quickly. The vaccines will take us one big step forward, but not back to business as usual, as many countries will not complete their vaccinations within this year. We have to live with the virus for many more years to come, maybe even permanently.

I also shared my thoughts on our external situation, and the outlook for the future. The next few years will not be easy. We can‚Äôt tell exactly how the world will change after the pandemic, but as long as we work together, hold fast to our principles, and keep faith both with our pioneers as well as generations yet unborn, we will emerge stronger and thrive for many years to come. ‚Äì LHL

The attached graph shows the progress made in the maritime sector. 

The top horizontal line shows the number of frontline workers eligible - 18k. 

The first line bordering the blue area shows the number that got their first dose over the last 1.5 months. The number now stands at 17.6k, or 98% of eligible frontline maritime personnel. 

The second line bordering the green area shows the number who have received the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 16.7k have, and in the coming days, almost all would have. 

This means that substantially all frontline maritime workers will be vaccinated, and this is a major step in securing our borders and minimising import cases infiltrating our community, and strengthening international confidence in our maritime hub.
