657,"What has 4 wheels and never tires of reminding people to practise safe distancing at parks?
If you guessed the O-R3 autonomous robot, you're a psychic!
PUB's latest ""safe distancing ambassador"" conducts daily patrols in the mornings and evenings at Bedok Reservoir, when human traffic at the park is the highest.
It is also armed with sensors that can capture, record and process data that can be sent to officers in real time.
Similar robots will be deployed at Pandan and MacRitchie Reservoirs.
Don't be alarmed if you see the O-R3 rumbling around!

If you guessed the O-R3 autonomous robot, you're a psychic!
PUB's latest ""safe distancing ambassador"" conducts daily patrols in the mornings and evenings at Bedok Reservoir, when human traffic at the park is the highest.
It is also armed with sensors that can capture, record and process data that can be sent to officers in real time.
Similar robots will be deployed at Pandan and MacRitchie Reservoirs.
Don't be alarmed if you see the O-R3 rumbling around!

A lockdown means that even the malls will be closed, you are allowed to go out only for essential stuff. Essential stuff means food and medicine. Do you think you can still saunter into McD? No! Even the hawkers will be closed. So my dear Singaporeans, be careful what you wish for. Stop complaining, just stay home before the country really goes into a lockdown.",2020-03-28 08:33:43+00:00,75

Put up thermo scanners monitors at MRT Entry/ Exit points. Run notices of social distancing ads in MRT, run public address announcement of social distancing in MRT. Promote social distancing in social media to increase public awareness becos public transport is the venue where crowds gather in close proximity. 😑",2020-03-22 09:33:20+00:00,82
