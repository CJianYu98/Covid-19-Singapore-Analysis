4,"Some members of the public have asked, during the open segment of the MFA Town Hall, about the potential opening of our borders. I know many are eager to travel again, be it to neighbouring countries or further, for business or to visit relatives. Others have, on the other hand, urged caution about opening up borders too quickly. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
The reality is that we have to be prepared that overseas travel even to nearby destinations will not return to its pre-COVID-19 state in the near to medium term. But we must re-build our external links gradually, carefully, and pragmatically. Singapore has implemented the Singapore-China Fast Lane for Essential Travel, and we are in discussions with other countries to establish reciprocal green lane arrangements.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
In addition, we are working with Malaysia to address the needs of cross-border travellers. These arrangements will have to include mutually agreed public health protocols, to preserve the public health and safety of citizens on both sides. Discussions will take time, and we have to be thorough to ensure a stable recovery from the COVID-19 situation.‚†Ä
