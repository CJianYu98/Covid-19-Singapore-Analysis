2,"If your answer is ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, great! Keeping a safe distance of at least 1 metre from others can lower your exposure to COVID-19.

When you are further apart, the risk of droplet exposure decreases.

Avoiding crowded places also allows you to stay further apart from the next person. Less crowded places allow for better ventilation and air circulation.

You can break the chain of transmission by always maintaining a safe distance of at least 1 metre in public places.",2020-12-02 09:01:24+00:00,Stop perpetuating the covid lie,2020-12-04 08:05:07+00:00,5

4,"Remember the expression, ‚Äútoo close for comfort‚Äù? Respiratory droplets containing the COVID-19 virus can spread more easily when someone‚Äôs talking loudly or singing. Staying at least 1 metre away from one another can help stop the spread of the virus. The fight is not over, so always keep a safe distance.",2020-11-27 06:00:40+00:00,"Take a time to read this pleaseüëáüëáüëáüëáüíÉüíÉ haaaa how happy I am now ,Mrs  @beverlyhanderson5  make my heart feels with so much joy ,after the pandimic I and my family was left without nothing i don't know how to get my skull bill I go around to friend but no help ,I was just on my country group just keeping myself busy and some posted a short note about Mrs @beverlyhanderson5 great help in Bitcoin online earn ,I step in to give a try and I was so much afraid because it was the only money left with me $376,I inbox him and tell him about my situation at the moment he give words of encourage and he set-up and online trading account for me so I can benefit from their company and I invested the money he told me to wait for 48hours of trade and I will get my money and my profit , surprisely I received 3'800$ as a money and my profit ,I'm super excited at this moment ,I'm sharing this because I was instructed to share the my testimony and the link by the company to impress invite more that want to earn online click below to inbox herüëáüëáüëá@beverlyhanderson5",2020-11-27 09:21:35+00:00,195
6,"Even if there aren‚Äôt floor markings or safe distancing ambassadors to remind you, always keep a safe distance of at least 1 metre. It keeps you safe from COVID-19 transmission by reducing your exposure to droplets. Because if you do get infected, you won‚Äôt enjoy being quarantined or isolated, or worse, spreading the virus to others. The fight is not over, so let‚Äôs keep a safe distance from one another and the virus.",2020-11-20 02:55:07+00:00,You have an immune system for a reason.

7,"Some people only wear their masks when a safe distancing ambassador is nearby. It's worrying that some are still not wearing their masks properly, and not putting their masks back on immediately after eating, drinking or exercising.

COVID-19 is spread predominantly through droplets that are expelled when coughing, sneezing, shouting or talking. Talking softly reduces the amount of droplets expelled. Wearing a mask blocks the expulsion of these droplets and protects the people around you. 

A mask can effectively block the droplets only if it covers your nose and mouth, with no gaps between the mask and your face.

When out and about, we touch a lot of things that may be potentially contaminated. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to avoid touching your mask - to prevent contamination. If you need to touch it, wash or sanitise your hands before and after doing so. Used masks should not be left lying around as they could contribute to the spread of diseases. Used disposable masks should be thrown into rubbish bins.",2020-11-17 02:50:59+00:00,Not all Singaporeans are stupid.
