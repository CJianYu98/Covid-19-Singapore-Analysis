1,"What we have dreaded all these months has happened. 

SIA will be reducing its global workforce. Some 2,400 staff based in Singapore and overseas will be affected, the vast majority being foreigners. Factoring in hiring freezes and early retirements, SIA will be reducing total workforce by 4,300.

We know how badly SIA is hit by COVID-19. Over the past few months, Government has rolled out support measures, including the Jobs Support Scheme, to defray business costs and protect jobs. The aviation sector received the strongest support. SIA has also raised significant capital with the support of its majority shareholder. They have delayed this workforce reduction as long as they can, but with air travel decimated by COVID-19, this has unfortunately become inevitable.

The workers affected, are the same people we see at the airport, ensuring we board our planes efficiently and on time; the cabin crew in their suits and kebaya that have become a symbol of pride for Singapore; and those whose assuring voices we hear over the aircraft public announcement system, often telling us to belt up, for there would be turbulence.

Government will do all we can to support the affected workers. We will work with @ntucsingapore and industry partners to place the workers in jobs, help them transit to other industries, or enrol them in suitable industry attachment and traineeship programmes. I am sure their skills are much needed elsewhere too. More importantly, we will continue to press on, to restore air travel in a safe manner, to get SIA planes back up in the sky, and revive our air hub.

In 2019, we made purposeful changes to our assistance schemes, to better help families break out of the cycle of hardship. Last year, 17,000 households benefitted from CDAC√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s programmes and schemes. 
The outlook is grimmer this year because of COVID-19. To support more families in need, CDAC has enhanced subsidies and raised income ceilings of its assistance schemes.

First, 10,000 families currently benefiting from CDAC programmes will receive a one-time $300 grant to help defray their children√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s educational expenses. 
Second, for needy families that need more help, CDAC has re-opened its 2020 bursary application for primary and secondary students till end May, so more can apply. Up to 5,000 needy post-secondary students are expected to receive a $720 education grant; twice the number of recipients last year.
