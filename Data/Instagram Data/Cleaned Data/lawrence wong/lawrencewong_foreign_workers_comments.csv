A big shout out and “Thank You” to our frontliners and to all who have been working so hard to control the infection over the past few months. But please remember: the virus has not been eradicated. It’s still circulating in our community. So we still need to keep our guard up and stay very disciplined in complying with all the necessary safeguards. That’s the mindset that will enable us to continue on this path of progressive re-opening in a safe and sustainable manner.,2020-10-14 13:26:24+00:00,Thank you💗💐Singapore united.

82,"Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. That’s why we have been steadily building up our national testing capacity. 
From an average of 2,900 tests per day in early April, we are now able to conduct more than 8,000 tests per day. We are continuing to expand our testing capacity in the coming weeks and months. 
To date, Singapore has tested about 2100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the testing figures are 1600 in the US, 1100 in South Korea, and 1000 in the UK. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up more cases. 
In our migrant worker dormitories, for example, we have been testing around 3000 workers every day (including the workers that are asymptomatic), and will continue to do more tests.  So far, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about 1 in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6500 per 100,000). One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community. We are also doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes and senior residential homes, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers.
As more testing capacity is brought on-stream, we will gradually expand testing to the wider pool of workers. This expanded testing regime is of critical importance in enabling us to safely resume economic activities beyond the circuit breaker period.",2020-04-28 02:22:36+00:00,"keep going sir,you’ve our backs 💪🏽",2020-04-28 02:51:07+00:00,7

To date, Singapore has tested about 2100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the testing figures are 1600 in the US, 1100 in South Korea, and 1000 in the UK. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up more cases. 
In our migrant worker dormitories, for example, we have been testing around 3000 workers every day (including the workers that are asymptomatic), and will continue to do more tests.  So far, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about 1 in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6500 per 100,000). One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community. We are also doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes and senior residential homes, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers.
As more testing capacity is brought on-stream, we will gradually expand testing to the wider pool of workers. This expanded testing regime is of critical importance in enabling us to safely resume economic activities beyond the circuit breaker period.",2020-04-28 02:22:36+00:00,@lawrencewongst  this is amazing!

Why is mOH allowing TTSH to house covid patients in renci community hospital nursing block which holds chronic wards and other vulnerable wards? The bed crunch may be a real concern but why put a time bomb in the same block as nursing high risk vulnerable patients??? It takes just one leak to cause death to the already vulnerable group!,2020-05-09 01:34:31+00:00,75
96,"We are going all out to suppress the virus outbreak in the foreign worker dormitories. 
It’s a massive undertaking involving many people on the frontline - SAF and SPF officers, officials from MOM, as well as our healthcare doctors and nurses. 
They are going into the dorms to actively test the workers and isolate the infected ones from the healthy, and to ensure their overall well-being. The vast majority of the workers are young, and they tend to have very mild cough/cold symptoms that are not picked up by temperature taking alone. So the teams are working doubly hard to sweep through the dorms and test the workers, and this is also the reason why we are seeing such high reported cases every day.  We have to expect the numbers to remain high for some time as we continue this effort to swab, test and isolate the workers. 
To take care of the infected workers, we are rapidly expanding our community care facilities at the Singapore Expo and other sites. After the workers fully recover (and test negative), they will need a place to stay. So we are also preparing additional facilities to accommodate them. 
Covid-19 will be with us for many months, and likely beyond the end of the year. We have to be prepared for future waves of infection and we have to steel ourselves for a long fight. As we all do our part to stay home, let’s also remember our frontline personnel working round the clock, as well as our foreign workers who are fighting the virus alongside Singaporeans.

We have to expect the numbers to remain high for some time as we continue this effort to swab, test and isolate the workers. 
To take care of the infected workers, we are rapidly expanding our community care facilities at the Singapore Expo and other sites. After the workers fully recover (and test negative), they will need a place to stay. So we are also preparing additional facilities to accommodate them. 
Covid-19 will be with us for many months, and likely beyond the end of the year. We have to be prepared for future waves of infection and we have to steel ourselves for a long fight. As we all do our part to stay home, let’s also remember our frontline personnel working round the clock, as well as our foreign workers who are fighting the virus alongside Singaporeans. We will overcome this together.",2020-04-17 15:14:21+00:00,Thanks for your leadership sir @lawrencewongst,2020-04-17 15:56:43+00:00,5

It’s a massive undertaking involving many people on the frontline - SAF and SPF officers, officials from MOM, as well as our healthcare doctors and nurses. 
They are going into the dorms to actively test the workers and isolate the infected ones from the healthy, and to ensure their overall well-being. The vast majority of the workers are young, and they tend to have very mild cough/cold symptoms that are not picked up by temperature taking alone. So the teams are working doubly hard to sweep through the dorms and test the workers, and this is also the reason why we are seeing such high reported cases every day.
