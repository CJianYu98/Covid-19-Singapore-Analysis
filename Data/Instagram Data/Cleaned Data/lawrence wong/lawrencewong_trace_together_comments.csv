0,"We’re embarking on our journey to Phase Three. But to avoid a flare up of the virus, any further relaxation must come with additional controls and safeguards, specifically scaled-up contact tracing and testing (including the use of rapid antigen test kits), as well as continued adherence to safe management measures.

We therefore need everyone to do their part to participate in the Trace Together programme, and to cooperate with all the prevailing safe distancing requirements. If we do that well and keep community transmission low, then we will be able to enter Phase Three before the end of the year. That means group sizes can increase from the present 5 to 8, and we can have larger events with multiple zones of 50 people. On the other hand, if we let our guard down and new clusters emerge, then the timeline will have to be pushed back.

Remember the fight is not over and we still have a long road ahead of us. It will not be possible to go back to the pre-Covid world any time soon. But if we stay disciplined and vigilant, we can continue to progressively resume activities and reopen our economy safely.",2020-10-20 15:22:15+00:00,cOrOnA aT tHe bAcK fUnNy,2020-10-20 15:32:09+00:00,5
