5,"A very lively atmosphere greeted me at Tampines North Primary yesterday. Thank you for the warm welcome #backtoschool! 

Met some P5 and 6 students who shared their #CircuitBreaker experience with me. They didn‚Äôt like it and much preferred going to school. But they also learnt to make the most of the situation. Some picked up new skills, while others helped out with household chores. They spent more time with family members and learnt to appreciate the important things in life. They showed adaptability and resilience and these are the traits that will put them in good stead for the future. Very proud of our young ones!",2020-10-29 09:22:17+00:00,You are doing a good job üòä,2020-10-29 09:27:23+00:00,6

41,"Working from home has taken new meaning for most of us. We‚Äôre doing more remote meetings with our colleagues and realising that we can be just as productive at home as we have been in the office. The circuit breaker has showed us that we can work effectively in different ways.
We must now embrace working from home as the new norm. So even as more Singaporeans return to work during Phase 1 of the reopening plans, we expect the majority of the workforce to continue to work from home. 
This is why we have imposed the following requirement on employers after 1 June: your staff should return to work only if they need specialised equipment and machinery that cannot be accessed from home, or if they need to fulfil legal requirements (eg to complete contracts or transactions). On that basis, we expect most employees working in an office setting to continue working from home as they are presently doing. 
Many employers and managers will need to adjust their mindsets to this new normal. It‚Äôs no longer about having all your staff physically present at work. Even if they have to be on site, consider if they really need to do so every day. You could have hybrid arrangements where your employees work from home several days a week. 
For those who absolutely need to be in the office, employers must ensure that the work environment is safe (eg maintain good ventilation and high hygiene standards, and have officers seated apart etc) and offer them staggered work hours. 
All these workplace measures are critical in our fight against Covid-19 - they will reduce the need for daily movement of people, and minimise the risks of the virus flaring up again.",2020-05-23 13:30:38+00:00,üëçüòäüí™ Have a good Long weekend.,2020-05-23 14:25:53+00:00,5

However  the key question to ask here is - does it make sense to virtually lockdown the entire country for extended number of weeks, when we have seen clearly that the average number of community cases is only from single digits to the high teens for awhile now? Singaporeans and businesses alike have been on the receiving end of the strict measures put in place, through entirely no fault of theirs. While the foreign worker dormitories oversight is unfortunate, trying to overcompensate for an earlier mistake with excessively draconian measures is not the way to go.

93,"Seniors are significantly more at risk from Covid-19. Globally, 80% of Covid-related deaths occur in older persons above 60. In Singapore it is 95%. Many young people with Covid-19 have mild symptoms. But for seniors the disease is severe and potentially life-threatening. 
That‚Äôs why we are stepping up our precautions at residential care homes serving the elderly. We are putting in place tighter infection controls and prevention practices. We are requiring all resident-facing staff to stay onsite or at designated hotels during the circuit breaker period. We are also testing all 30k residents and staff of these homes - not just once, but on a periodic basis every two weeks. 
At the same time, all of us can do our part to protect the seniors in our families. Remind them to stay home as much as possible and minimise contacts with others. If the seniors are living with us, then help them with their errands, so that they can minimise their movement outside.

We are appreciative and grateful for all the great decisions so far. However, i am indeed shocked that in the last few days your team has said to protect the most vulnerable group in nursing homes as they will not be able to survive well if the virus hits them. Why then is MOH allowing covid patients to be housed in Renci community where there is so many levels of vulnerable residents and also patients who need to come for weekly kidney dialysis? These group has bodies that cannot take a second round of strike against them. Could you be kind and just and not remove this post and instead look into this matter, and give it serious considerations if its a right decision, and if this contradicts the stand to protect the most vulnerable ones among us? They have family who loves them till their last breath. This last breath is already a vulnerable last one and one wrong move will not be a just a number, it will be shattered family hearts. We sincerely hope you will look into this. We understand bed crunches issues, but please underdtand us, we the family of the vulnerable residents, need to seek ur help to protect the most vulnerable ones.

Second, we will tighten access to popular areas where people are still gathering, like wet markets and supermarkets, so that safe distancing measures can be better implemented. For a start we will introduce a new control measure in selected popular wet markets to limit entry to alternate days.
Third we will close more work premises and tighten the list of essential services. The aim is to reduce the number of essential workers still out and about, so that we can minimise movement and interactions. Additional requirements will also be put in place to ensure that these workers and their employers uphold safe distancing measures at their workplaces. 
We will implement the above measures from now till 4 May. Beyond that we will have to extend the circuit breaker for another four weeks till 1 June. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and if we are able to bring down our community infection numbers decisively, then we can consider easing some of the measures gradually.

The Taskforce has decided to put in place a nation-wide circuit breaker starting for at least a month, starting 7 April, to slow the spread of the virus. 
Under these stringent measures, all workplace premises other than those providing essential services or operating as part of global supply chains will have to close. For these closed premises, the work activities can continue only if all their employees work from home. Schools and IHLs will also be closed and will shift to full home-based learning.

Supermarkets and F&B outlets will remain open. For all F&B outlets, including hawker centres and coffeeshops, dining in will not be allowed - so you can only order food for delivery or takeout.

Essentially, we must all abide by these basic rules:
- Stay at Home. Avoid interactions with anyone outside of your family members who are already living with you
- Go out only if you have to do essential things (like going to work, buying groceries, or doing your daily exercise)
- If you have to go out, and cannot avoid close contact with others, wear a mask.

I‚Äôd like to add if I may - that is to make mask wearing mandatory when we are out. This is crucial especially in enclosed setting like buses, trains. It should not be a choice, left to the people to decide since the govt stand is - wear one if you can‚Äôt avoid crowds. There will always be  a group of people who don‚Äôt or refuses to wear one for their own reasons. Wearing one is protecting OTHERS  from one‚Äôs droplets from coughing, sneezing, talking. We should all and rightfully so, be concerned at the rise of local unlinked cases and the asymptomatic carriers lurking amongst us. We can‚Äôt afford to have a tiny chance that some of these people could be asymptomatic and unknowingly be spreading the virus. Now that every resident will get a reusable mask, there is no reason not to mask up when out. I hope people will change the selfish mindset - cloth mask ‚â† ineffective (against virus) therefore I won‚Äôt wear.  When Malaysia ends her lockdown we will see an influx of people coming in. Temperature scanning can not longer be trusted as a gauge to weed out the infected ones. We need everyone to wear a mask, on top of social distancing measures to further boost containment. Anyone not wearing one should be refused entry to Singapore. This rule should also be applied to trains and buses and crowded places.

The Taskforce has decided to put in place a nation-wide circuit breaker starting for at least a month, starting 7 April, to slow the spread of the virus. 
Under these stringent measures, all workplace premises other than those providing essential services or operating as part of global supply chains will have to close. For these closed premises, the work activities can continue only if all their employees work from home. Schools and IHLs will also be closed and will shift to full home-based learning.

Supermarkets and F&B outlets will remain open. For all F&B outlets, including hawker centres and coffeeshops, dining in will not be allowed - so you can only order food for delivery or takeout.

Essentially, we must all abide by these basic rules:
- Stay at Home. Avoid interactions with anyone outside of your family members who are already living with you
- Go out only if you have to do essential things (like going to work, buying groceries, or doing your daily exercise)
- If you have to go out, and cannot avoid close contact with others, wear a mask.

It also shows I trust your capabilities (though I strongly diagree with your HDB policy which does not align with our great Lee Kuan Yew's promise to common Singaporeans that HDB will be our main appeciative asset. Fact is : it is most Singaporeans ""main asset"". Imho, your policy only benefits the upper class who holds private properties assets) Straight to the point. My suggestion : our Govt next move to tackle the Covid-19 crisis is to have better, stricter guidelines and checks on our food industries and imported food products (from Epi Centers such as Italy, China, Korea) and especially Malaysia. NEA should level up on this. NEA should deploy checks on big large scale central kitchens in Singapore to peridically check on the production staff. E.g. a central bakery employing hundreds of production workers doing cakes production if they are not highly regulated , guided, checked to be safe, any infected food production worker may become ""a super spreader"" through food distribution, sales, consumption. Imagine an infected worker coughed on a cake, cake is then eaten by a few. Would  that spread virus? It is NEA job to enhance food safety assurance.

My feedback and suggestion : What Malaysia did was the correct move ~ the lockdown. This will help them to do containment to avoid becoming the next Italy. And Singapore ? Honestly, I am worried. If our Govt is to do things 'a bit here, a bit there"", Singapore may become the next Italy ? Will Singapore only act aggressively when that scenario happens ? Why I am worried ? Simple reason : Indonesia. Quote CNA news : ""Indonesians seek to get tested for COVID-19 as tally rises; govt says unnecessary to test everyone"" click the link for the full (""very scary"") story.  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-oronavirus-covid-19-tests-unnecessary-everyone-govt-12551074 1.

But CNA news shows that Indonesia Govt ""had failed in many areas"" in their fight against Covid-19. Many Indonesians expressed disappointment in their Govt efforts. So when they have no confidence, where do they go to ? Singapore. They cannot go to Malaysia right now (lockdown). So Singapore. Even without Malaysia lockdown, their 1st choice would be ? Singapore.  What does that mean ? Singapore is in high risk and danger of becoming the next Italy. Now we know China aggressive, decisive, extreme measures : the lockdown in Jan were necessary and the correct move. We can compare situations now. Europe vs China. China is doing a better job in the containment efforts. As for Singapore, schools are going to reopen on 23 Mar. Singapore are still ""open doors"" for business. SIA  will manage to get that few $ business. Efficient ? If planes are not flying at full capacities ? Indonesians will try all their best to get into Singapore for their Covid-19 testings and treatments as their Govt seems to ""have disappointed them"". This is very worrisome.

The 21-year-old university student was then led to a decontamination room with five other people, who were all coughing.By evening, his test results came back and he was told that he was a COVID-19 suspect patient.‚ÄúI was placed in another room with five other people. There were only three beds, so I had to sit in a wheelchair for the entire night.‚ÄúI was only given a bed the next morning,‚Äù he told CNA.

However, Mr Yurianto, the government spokesperson, explained on Tuesday that not everyone can get swabbed for COVID-19, and only¬†doctors can recommend if a patient should be tested. Many patients have expressed frustration that they did not qualify for COVID-19 testing.Their worries were compounded by a perceived lack of transparency surrounding coronavirus cases in Indonesia.Ms Karoline Sinaga, 30, went to a hospital on Mar 3 when she developed a mild fever following her return from South Korea, one of the countries badly hit by the pandemic, in late February.She was offered a ‚ÄúCOVID-19 package‚Äù consisting of a chest X-ray and a blood test, but not the COVID-19 swab.‚ÄúI asked why I didn‚Äôt get the swab test and they replied saying that the COVID-19 package only has these tests,‚Äù she told CNA. A health expert from think tank ThinkWell Global said that it is reasonable for the government and hospitals to only conduct swab tests on potentially positive COVID-19 patients.Mr Hasbullah Thabrany told CNA that it is inefficient to test everyone.‚ÄúThe cost is expensive, and it may cause people who have a high chance of having the disease to not being able to get tested,‚Äù he said, adding that this is about managing limited resources.Mr Yurianto, the government‚Äôs spokesman for COVID-19, has urged people to self-isolate at home if they only display mild symptoms. (Unquote)Means ? Many Indonesians (suspecting or knowing they have Covid-19) will try ""all their means and ways"" to try to get into Singapore for tests and/or treaments. And we know anything ""is possible or do-able in Indonesia"" Are their health declarations ""100% fool-proof"" ? My guess is : most will go to Batam to get into Singapore by ferries.

Feedback : Why are Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as Macau faring better than other cities in tackling against the Covid-19 Crisis ? My guess : M A S K S . That's right. Almost everyone is encouraged to wear masks. So what happens when they do that ? Those who are infected or unaware they are affected covered themselves with masks thus reducing the risks of transmission. And those not infected also wear masks makes it a "" double protection "". We cannot adopt a ""self-deceiving"" concept that asking everyone to wear masks will not help as much simply because we do not have enough masks or could not produce our own masks. Wearing masks does help. If not, why 1 minister said if we run out of masks, medical staff may not work? It simply means masks help the medical staff to protect themselves against the Covid-19. Or wearing masks is better than not wearing any. So after so much talk, main point ? Main Point : we study Macau Hong Kong Taiwan and we can gauge that encouraging everyong to wear masks help in the containment. Our Govt next task ? Quickly assemble a large scale production line that can produce our own masks at about 5 mil units per day rate. Any excess we can sell, export or donate to other countries who want them.
