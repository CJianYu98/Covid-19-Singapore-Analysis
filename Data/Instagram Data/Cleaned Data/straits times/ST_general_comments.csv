2298,"Prayers at mosques in Singapore for Hari Raya Haji were quieter this year due to safe distancing measures to curb the spread of Covid-19.
The usual prayer assembly at Masjid Sultan used to attract at least 5,000 worshippers, but this year it was split into 2 sessions of just 50 people each.
Most mosques held 3 sessions with no more than 50 worshippers - who had to book slots online - each time.
The Straits Times would like to wish all our readers Selamat Hari Raya Haji. Stay safe!

Most disinfectant available can kill some bacteria and germs and not Covid 19. Here it shows Covid19 is highly resistant and contagious. False hope is dangerous and very worrisome. We live to suffer when claims of disinfectant efficacy are not certified nor properly tested. Don’t put peoples life to any risk, it is so irresponsible. Don’t lower our guard check what works and what don’t and protect ourselves and protect our people. All those claims of self disinfect that can last six months is terrible and here is a case where we live to suffer. We need to be alert and protect ourselves.

WHO said another concern is people may contaminate themselves by touching their faces more frequently when they adjust, remove and dispose of their masks. The agency said masks should be reserved for those who are infected with the virus or in close contact with infected patients.SO, when are you, Straits Times, going to report on this and question the government’s current stance on masks.",2020-06-06 06:56:59+00:00,115

Having said this, I can’t help but to wonder if this is achieved due to the constant and responsible personal hygiene practices from the community as a whole or/and the compliance to the restrictions and measures that have been put in place or/and. Regretfully, if only the latter is exercised, my personal view is that Singapore may be at risk of incurring higher community cases once the restrictions are loosen or released completely. My hope is that all residents will continue to exercise good hygiene practices when the restrictions are lifted or even when this global pandemic is over. “(Singapore) has long had an obsession with hygiene and cleanliness” (McDonald/BBC, 2018) which I believe is not without reasonable cause. Hence, let’s continue to do our part! #aremindertoselfandothers",2020-06-01 09:31:35+00:00,160

Things have changed alot in 6 weeks. They know masks helps, but 6 weeks ago, number of healthy people is higher, probability of spread is low, but irrational fear (selfishness, panic hoarding) was high so that was the recommended approach. But today, there's a higher spread in community over time, but higher trust in government to act (e.g. society observed how they quickly planning resources and manpower to create and give out hand sanitizers and now reusable masks), so the approach changed. It's about adapting quickly based on factors e.g. society, resources needed, time available, probability of virus spread.

That is quite concerning when you consider that flushing a toilet can create an aerosolized plume of these viral particles, which can then spread elsewhere within proximity. We know that toothbrushes left in proximity to the toilet gain viral spread quite rapidly, mirroring levels observed in the toilet itself. That same thing can occur for cell phones, which many people take with them into the bathroom.

It also raises questions about the use of toilets in the public domain. Six-feet social distancing means I can see you, you can see me, and we can stay apart. But if I use a toilet, there's no way of knowing whether it was used prior by a symptomatic or asymptomatic viral carrier or shedder.The aerosolization effect that can occur in toilets, leading to microdroplets that can be inhaled or persist on surface areas, raises some real concerns regarding epidemiologic spread. It may also be helpful in understanding why this rapid spread can occur when not linked to known contact with those positive for COVID-19.Turning our attention to the toilets is something we need to do.",2020-04-10 23:47:25+00:00,145

I'll tell you the dilemmas..firstly there are areas in HBL that we definitely need the subject teacher to teach the concept/formula/language etc.Not alot of parents are able to.They can assist with a few questions here and there based on what they learnt back in the days.Secondly pre-sch is Under ECDA,and for now it's pending as to whether it will enforce all pre-school s to be closed bear in mind Private Childcare. Thirdly there are still parents required to work, it's essential so how are we to find alternative childcare...I'm not at all in favour of sch closure...@moesingapore",2020-04-04 02:37:03+00:00,98

#Covid19 #coronavirus #StraitsTimes",2020-03-25 15:13:08+00:00,"Wah tak boleh tahan all these senseless people calling for school closure, I thought aiya Mothership is oriented towards youths so confirm kids will complain about school not closing. Then come here see ST still like that, supposed to be adults already but still cannot think, MOE should hold ""critical thinking in politics"" modules for kids in future. To those who still don't understand why schools haven't been closed: 1) If close schools then what about the kids who are not old enough to take care of themselves? Expect all parents to miraculously be allowed to work from home, get LOA or take leave everyday meh? You all think leave is free ah can anyhow take ah? 2) On one hand praise frontliners who work 24/7 to safeguard us and keep the virus at bay, such as healthcare workers, emergency services, cleaners, administrative staff, transport staff, etc and then next moment tell them their kids have no school. Then you want them to take leave/quit jobs to take care of kids is it? Bad enough to be ungrateful, worse to be hypocritical as well. 3) You think all kids will so guai stay at home all the time meh? Kids not bored ah? Confirm will have some who still go out what, just see those cuckoo go take part in those last-day-club promotion events. 4) If all students can study so effectively with online learning then why we still need schools? Might as well tell everyone study from home, provide Khan Academy links and give out digital certs lah. Teachers unnecessary also, all we need is for them to give lecture, that one AI also can do mah. Tuition centre should also close down, schools also can online liao lagi no need physical tuition centres, just purchase my tuition package online for $99.99 a month, comes with free shipping confirm your child all A. 5) How you want to hold effective online exams? All MCQ? Open book online SAQ and essays? Webcam oral tests and listening comprehension? Pray hard your wifi no lag or else no need graduate liao? Allow students to S/U all mods every year? 6) I haven't even include the scientific research quoted by minister Ong Ye Kung or the statistics presented, I not official source so I don't want to anyhow make claims.",2020-03-25 16:37:49+00:00,376

#coronavirus #covid19 #backtoschool #StraitsTimes",2020-03-19 02:59:34+00:00,"This is a very dangerous decision that Singapore is taking. The MOE and MOH should look into this. Education should never be put before health. Closing schools for 2 weeks is not going to ruin your education! If the cases continuously rise like they have been for the past week and a half, keeping schools and offices open is the most dangerous thing that could be done. All other countries in the world have closed schools, Singapore is the only one left. People are anyways not coming to school because they are scared for their health. What is the goddamn problem Singapore??? Online school is still there!!!!!! UWCSEA, SAS, TTS have moved their spring break forward already! These schools are taking wise decisions as at this rate of growing cases, it is best to keep kids and adults at home. I don't think Singapore understands that this is a global pandemic. Schools, offices and everything SHOULD be closed. Increasing measures is never going to help stop the cases. It seems like all Singapore is ever doing during this global pandemic is ""taking measures"". Singapore is not making a wise decision by putting education over health, in fact it is possibly the dumbest thing they could do. Govt. please take into consideration other peoples lives. All of you are protected in your mansions etc, cancelling a garden party is not going to do anything. So PLEASE for god sakes do something instead of ""taking measures""",2020-03-19 05:32:46+00:00,242

6605,"Using a new test that is able to detect infections even in recovered patients, contact tracers from the Ministry of Health and the police were able to track the infection to 2 travellers from Wuhan, who were cases 8 and 9.
The Wuhan couple were linked to the Life Church and Missions cluster, a Chinese New Year family gathering at Mei Hwan Drive, and finally to the Grace Assembly of God which to date is linked to 23 cases.

#Coronavirus #Singapore #StraitsTimes",2020-02-10 07:08:54+00:00,"Notably, fever occurred in only 43.8% of patients on initial presentation and developed in 87.9% following hospitalization. Absence of fever in 2019-nCoV ARD is more frequent than in SARS-CoV (1%) and MERS-CoV infection (2%) [19] and such patients may be missed if the surveillance case definition focused heavily on fever detection [14]. Consistent with two recent reports [1,12], lymphopenia was common and, in some cases, severe. However, based on a larger sample size and cases recruited throughout China, we found a markedly lower case fatality rate (1.4%) as compared with that reportedly recently [1,12]. The fatality rate was lower (0.88%) when incorporating additional pilot data from Guangdong province (N=603) where effective prevention has been undertaken (unpublished data). Our findings were consistent with the national official statistics, reporting the mortality of 2.01% in China out of 28,018 cases as of February 6th, 2020 [11,23]. Early isolation, early diagnosis and early management might have collectively contributed to the marked reduction in mortality in Guangdong. Furthermore, dilution of health workforce as a result of central management (i.e., Wuhan JinYinTan Hospital) might have led to increased mortality rate. These findings will inform the mass public, clinicians and policy makers the true transmissability of 2019-nCoV which has resulted in a major social panic.",2020-02-10 11:06:48+00:00,192
