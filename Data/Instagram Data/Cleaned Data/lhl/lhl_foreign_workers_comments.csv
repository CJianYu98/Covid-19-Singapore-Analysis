8,"Caught up with the different teams of the Inter-Agency Task Force in an e-meeting today. They have been very busy over the past several months, helping our migrant workers in the dorms during this COVID-19 pandemic.

We discussed their work so far, what comes next, and what we can tweak and improve. We have come a long way, and the migrant workers are now starting to go back to work.

Helping our migrant workers has demanded a multi-faceted approach, with teams from many agencies working together. They have deployed both high tech and the personal touch, and put in enormous efforts to tackle the problem.

It will take us a few more months to resolve the dorms issue. We have kept things under control, and will progressively bring things back up and running again. Thank you all, once again, and keep up the good work! ‚Äì LHL (MCI Photos by Chwee [1] and Lee Jia Wen [2-4])

13,"Paid an ‚Äúe-visit‚Äù to the team at the Singapore Ministry of Manpower Services Center at Bendemeer Road and met the Interagency Task Force.

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers‚Äô Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless. May the Singapore spirit shine brightly as we go through this difficult period together. ‚Äì LHL

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously ‚Äî stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. ‚Äì LHL

We are not getting any of the solidarity payment and even my younger one's kindergarten fee is not getting refunded just because none of us are citizen yet. We are equally paying taxes but we are not included or the government hardly think of PRs when they roll out any of the payout or benefit even during such a difficult time to everyone, which is so unique in the world to differentiate the treatment btw PR and citizens.
