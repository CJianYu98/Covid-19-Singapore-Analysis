13,"The 3rd round of reusable mask distribution by @temasekfoundation started today. The new masks can be rewashed up to 50 times while retaining the antimicrobial performance. Many of you should be familiar with the collection process by now – just bring your NRIC or government-issued ID with a barcode to the vending machines at your RCs, CCs or bus interchanges. There are four sizes of masks available, so do make sure you pick the right one. Do note that the size S masks can only be collected at CCs, Plaza Singapura, and Temasek Shophouse.

24,"You may have seen COVID-19 swab tests being administered at void decks and other areas in your neighbourhood. These swab test operations are part of the government’s efforts to keep our community safe as we continue to reopen our economy and allow more activities to resume. We are offering these tests to selected groups whose work involves more frequent interaction with the public, like stall holders and food delivery riders.

I visited the COVID-19 screening centre at Blk 402 in Ang Mo Kio today, and was glad to see many coming forward to be swabbed. Beyond AMK, the testing operations will also be progressively rolled out to other parts in Singapore. This testing exercise requires the joint efforts of multiple agencies working closely together with community partners. Thank you to all the teams managing this, and keep up the good work! – LHL

41,"Today, we held a virtual Public Service Observance Ceremony. In my message, I thanked public officers for their dedication and efforts during this crisis. Many dealt with situations out of their comfort zone – serving on the frontlines, in hospitals, migrant workers’ dormitories, and at the border. Others worked long hours from offices and homes, to come up with solutions to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, from schools to businesses, travel and our vulnerable groups.⠀
⠀
There were inevitably shortcomings to our COVID-19 response. We will learn from them, improve our processes and do better. But as we adjusted and strengthened our responses to the pandemic, our officers rose to the occasion, and pulled together as one public service.⠀
⠀
I hope you will join me in saluting our public officers. Without them, we wouldn’t have got thus far. The fight is not over, the battle is far from won. But together, we will overcome. – LHL⠀

Never was the opening of a medical facility so timely and fortuitous, as NCID found itself at the forefront of our fight against COVID-19 just a few months later.&nbsp;

We were lucky that NCID was up and running before COVID-19 hit us, but this did not happen by chance. It was the result of years of planning and hard work by government agencies, medical and research institutions, and healthcare partners.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I thanked PM Modi for India’s help when we brought home some Singaporeans from India recently. I assured him that we will care for Indian migrant workers here, just as we care for Singaporeans. The migrant workers made personal sacrifices to come to work here. They have made many contributions to Singapore, so we have a responsibility for them.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Appreciate PM Modi’s affirmation of our efforts in looking after the migrant workers, and his assurance that they will not forget this.

India and Singapore are strategic partners with extensive economic ties. We agreed to work together on the challenges posed by the pandemic, keep supply chains intact, and keep essential supplies flowing. – LHL

1. Public health — helping one another fight the outbreak;
2. Our economies — to save businesses and our citizens’ jobs; 
3. Science and research — to find a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, and prepare for future pandemics.

Had a few more meetings with @worldeconomicforum Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab, Dutch PM Mark Rutte (@minpres), and business leaders before I left Davos for Zurich. Glad to be heading home now after a busy and fruitful trip at #wef20, especially in light of the first reported case of Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. MOH has set up a multi-agency task force and we are well-prepared to deal with this situation. Meanwhile we must remain calm and vigilant, practise good personal hygiene and be socially responsible. Most importantly, please do not spread rumours and misinformation! – LHL
