Officials from both sides have worked hard to put in place measures to allow air travel to resume safely. Travellers will have to get used to new regulations and COVID-19 swab tests ‚Äì all part and parcel of the new normal.

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don‚Äôt want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. ‚Äì LHL

I was pleased to mark the one-year anniversary of the Singapore-New Zealand Enhanced Partnership, and look forward to expanding our cooperation with new initiatives that both sides value.

This is totally unacceptable (and shocking!) in my most honest opinion. I thought we Singapore should have ""higher standards"" than say Vietnam ? (I watched Vietnam news their mask factories the workers do wear gloves). If our local mask factories workers are infected with Covid-19 and they do not wear gloves to touch/sort/pack the masks, the consequences can be disastrous. Trust your wisdom and do advise our local mask factories to instruct their workers to wear gloves. Thank you.

It has been a difficult time for people of faith, including Christians here and elsewhere in the world. They have been unable to hold their usual services because of COVID-19 measures.

It has been a difficult time for people of faith, including Christians here and elsewhere in the world. They have been unable to hold their usual services because of COVID-19 measures.

PM Ardern shared that after New Zealand implemented their measures, numbers only started to come down on Day 11. We are only in Day 3 and still have a long way to go. If we all comply strictly, as the New Zealanders have done, hopefully by our Day 11 we too will see positive results.

PM Ardern and I also discussed how we can support each other during this time, including keeping supply chains intact between the two countries. Both Singapore and New Zealand will continue to do our part in this global fight against COVID-19.

At home, @masagosz has announced that enforcement officers will now immediately take down the particulars of anyone breaching the measures. More details on his Facebook post today. We cannot wait to save lives. Please do your part today. ‚Äì LHL
