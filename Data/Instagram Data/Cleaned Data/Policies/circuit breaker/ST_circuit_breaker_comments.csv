The exact start date of the arrangement will be reviewed late this month.
The move comes as Hong Kong hunkers down under harsher social distancing measures in anticipation of what health authorities have warned could be the worst Covid-19 wave so far.
Hong Kong's daily new infections have crossed 70 for more than a week.
The spike was led initially by a growing dance club cluster of more than 500, most of whom are tai tais and their young dancing instructors.

This takes some leadership foresight and a public who's generally willing to cooperate. Opening up a country to another? Unless both countries have the common same detection, tracing, control methods and direction (just like 1 country) setting measurements to determine when to pull the plug is not enough. Are the countries in a travel bubble willing to adapt and adjust to each other for a common way forward- just like a single country's response, containment and treatment methods?

To everyone who is blaming me them cause they started the virus,do you think it was intentional? Yes it could be controlled but they were just doing what they had always been. No one is gonna be like oh I want something that can kill people and I won't be sued or smt like that right even if there is this virus surely isn't it cause what about their families what about the people they care for? What would happen to them? So the thing is nobody wanted this virus to start, not you,not me. Yes I understand that none of us like that this virus is on going,that many lifes have been impacted indirectly or directly in a way. I understand that this (may) have caused negative changes but everyone makes mistakes. Think back to the time you did something you regretted,what did you want? You didn't want it to even happen in the first place,you wanted people to understand and forgive you.This is basically the same situation China is in so I hope everyone is able to understand may not be immediately but gradually!

I don’t see how we should give in to any form of excuses at this point of time. There are excuses from people who say that they did not foresee such event happening to this extent. There are people blaming the grab-drivers for not cancelling the orders when they witness the situation. There are excuses from people saying that there’ll be left over ingredients. Can we not use up the left over ingredients as gifts for our front-liners? Can we not give them as gifts for people volunteered to help those in needs? Why did authorities and shop owners as well, allow such atrocities to happen? Why do we kept saying we didn’t foresee? Does it not mean that we’ve been only focusing on our own pursuit of happiness?
