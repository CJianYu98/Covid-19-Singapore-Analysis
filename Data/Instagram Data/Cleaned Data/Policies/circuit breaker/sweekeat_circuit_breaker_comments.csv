This year, with the pandemic, the year-end concerts and graduation ceremonies turned into hybrid events, with the children at school and attendees watching online. I joined two virtual kindergarten graduation ceremonies in my constituency this month ‚Äî My First Skool at Bedok South Blk 1 and @pcf.sg Sparkletots at Bedok Blk 30.

Despite the challenging school year, our children have adjusted well, thanks to the dedication of teachers and parents. Our little ones have been resilient and adapted to new norms, not only in their own lives but accepting changes in their parents‚Äô routines as well.

To our graduating K2 students ‚Äî congratulations! I hope you continue to enjoy your learning journey as you embark on a new adventure in primary school. Keep learning and keep growing. üéì

When schools went on full home-based learning during the circuit breaker, our teachers were resilient in the face of the disruptions and uncertainties. They continued on resolutely ‚Äî coming up with new ways to impart knowledge and adjusting and adapting as the weeks went by. My thanks to parents and family members for your support as we all jointly rediscovered the teaching and learning journey in this new context. And well done to our students for being adaptable. Perhaps the most important lesson our teachers will impart to their students this year will be the one demonstrated by their actions ‚Äî of not giving up during tough times and finding new ways to overcome challenges together.

The theme of the celebration was ‚ÄúHats off‚Äù so teachers and staff gamely showed up in their most colourful and creative headgear! Indeed, hats off to all our teachers for your dedication, for doing your best to protect and nurture our children. This Teachers‚Äô Day, let us remember to keep learning, innovating and adapting.

She was a very persuasive salesperson, and I left the store happy with a bagful of purchases. The Autism Resource Centre had trained her well for her job.‚Å£

33,"I was very happy to e-meet many familiar faces from the social service sector on Saturday, together with @desmond.lee, @gracefu.hy and @indraneerajah, ahead of my Ministerial Statement next Tuesday.

We heard from 30 social service sector partners, on the challenges they and their clients are facing. We discussed how our social service agencies can strengthen collaboration and capability building. Their passion to serve came through during the dialogue, as they are doing all they can to strengthen support for vulnerable members of our community during the circuit breaker. The circuit breaker has accelerated the shift to digital, as more services are provided online. This highlighted both the potential and also the current constraints of going digital. Many also shared their concerns about the difficulties with fundraising during this period.

Many good ideas were raised. I will look at how we can better support the social service sector as part of the upcoming Budget. We will also work with the sector to embrace digitalisation, accelerate transformation and scale up new capabilities.

What is even more heartening is how the sector is working together. Some participants were already working closely together, and new areas of collaboration were identified during our discussions. The sector faces many common challenges, but we can overcome them if we work in partnership, and put our collective effort into tackling them. This is the spirit of our #SingaporeTogether movement.

We are making good progress towards building a more caring and inclusive society. We will build an even better tomorrow, with the strong support of social service agencies.

‚†Ä
Usually, Tampines residents would come together to celebrate this special occasion with bazaars, performances, and other festive activities in our community. This year, due to COVID-19, we are celebrating a homely Hari Raya.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
As we celebrate Hari Raya, we celebrate the spirit of caring, giving, and togetherness ‚Äî just like the spirit of #SGUnited and #SingaporeTogether.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
These are unprecedented and trying times for everyone. However, I am glad to see Singaporeans remain strong and resilient. Our Tampines residents have continued to help and care for those in need. Our Muslim community has also shown kindness and understanding, despite having to scale down on many of our activities during this period.‚†Ä

OTH is a lot quieter these days ‚Äî and for good reason, as many residents and Singaporeans understand the need and importance of staying home during this period.

The OTH team has worked hard to move the buzz online ‚Äî with OTH‚Äôs Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube channels offering contests, workouts, craft tutorials, and concerts to keep everyone staying safe at home entertained and occupied. So you can check out OTH virtually!

I know many residents are looking forward to visiting OTH again. As we slowly and gradually emerge from the circuit breaker, it will not be the same as before. We will have to observe precautionary measures including SafeEntry, to protect the community and prevent a surge of new cases. In the meantime, let us #stayhomeforSG, look out for our neighbours, and make Tampines a safe home for all.

You can check out @alistsg ‚Äî from online arts and cultural concerts, virtual museum tours to hands-on arts and crafts, there is something for everyone, for the young and the young at heart.

Librarians from @publiclibrarysg are also holding storytelling sessions for young children in the four different languages on their Facebook Page so that the kids can continue to cultivate the habit of reading even when the libraries are closed. Or expend that excess energy with home workout ideas and healthy habits with the @hpbsg. You can also discover more ideas from the @moesingapore's Parent Kits (https://www.moe.gov.sg/parentkit) on how to care for your child‚Äôs well-being and adjust in this new normal.

102,"Today is the last day of full Home-Based Learning (HBL). The past four weeks have been challenging for everyone involved.

For Teachers, this means putting in extra time and effort to prepare. HBL is a different mode of teaching, and you have to be creative and learn new skills to make online learning as engaging as possible.

For Parents, you have to support your children in the best possible way, even as you juggle working from home and housework.

For Students, I know many of you miss your classmates, your favourite hangouts and CCAs in schools. E-learning is not new, but having to do so remotely for a month is a completely different way to learn.

Challenging as it is for everyone, this experience also creates many memorable stories. I urge you all to share these, so that we can all learn about what worked, what did not; why not, and how we can do better.

Let us all be prepared to try new things, adapt and grow with this new experience, and we may just become more innovative after this! The first step in any innovation is to overcome the fear of the unknown. But if the new approach is better, we can learn better. If the traditional approach is better, we will appreciate it more, and look forward to going back to school!

Education Minister @ongyekung has brought forward our mid-year school holidays, so that everyone can have a respite. I strongly encourage all parents and students to explore new activities to spend quality time together, at home. I hope all our teachers who have been working very hard can also take a well-deserved break, before some of you have to help graduating cohorts prepare for their national exams from 19 May.

This is why PM @leehsienloong has just announced a further tightening of measures for two weeks, and an extension of the circuit breaker by four weeks, until 1 Jun.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
The decision to extend the circuit breaker is important in our fight against COVID-19. But the difficult global situation coupled with our extension, will put greater stress on our businesses and workers.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
To all our companies and our workers, we are with you in these difficult times. We will extend key support measures in the Solidarity Budget into the month of May.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
‚Ä¢ I will extend the 75% wage subsidy under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to all sectors for the month of May. I urge employers to treat their workers fairly, and to do their best to retain them, and make full use of the support measures for training and corporate upgrading.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
‚Ä¢ I will further enhance the JSS to include shareholder-directors who did not qualify for JSS, based on the earlier criteria, and also did not qualify for SIRS.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
‚Ä¢ I will also be waiving the Foreign Worker Levy (FWL) due in May and provide employers with another $750 in FWL rebate for every foreign worker in employment.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Families who need help because their breadwinners have lost their jobs can apply for the COVID-19 Support Grant from 1 May 2020.‚†Ä
‚†Ä

‚†Ä
The extension of the Solidarity Budget will amount to $3.8 billion. But the financial support works only if we each do our part and help one another out.‚†Ä

‚†Ä
Like many of us, I am concerned about how our seniors are coping, that they may feel lonely or isolated. Our elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19. With the circuit breaker in place, they should stay home as much as possible. We can visit to assist them with their daily needs while keeping the visits short. This is the best way to protect their well-being. It is not easy to explain that we may sometimes have to stay away because we care, but we must do so.

We can still show care and concern for the elderly, even when we are not physically present. There are many ways to keep in touch ‚Äî through WhatsApp, video-conferencing apps such as Skype, or just a simple phone call.

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page. This is a @gov.sg collaboration with producer @jackneock for our seniors to enjoy the familiar tunes from yesterdays in the comfort of our homes.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Let us all help our elderly family members adapt so that they can remain happy and engaged at home. Safe distancing does not mean social isolation.‚†Ä ‚†Ä

We can still show care and concern for the elderly, even when we are not physically present. There are many ways to keep in touch ‚Äî through WhatsApp, video-conferencing apps such as Skype, or just a simple phone call.

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page. This is a @gov.sg collaboration with producer @jackneock for our seniors to enjoy the familiar tunes from yesterdays in the comfort of our homes.‚†Ä

Let us all help our elderly family members adapt so that they can remain happy and engaged at home. Safe distancing does not mean social isolation.‚†Ä ‚†Ä

Does this mean that in order to protect the grandparents, the younger family members should move out? 2. What if the grand parents are not old and fragilecas assumed but lead an active and healthy life and are relatively young and have been looking after the grand children while the parents are working? 3.  If the healthy grandparents actually stay next door or across the block like 3 mins walk,the grand kids are also not allowed to be with the grand parents? 4. If childcare centres are so safe, why do the pre-schools, all schools need to close? Mr Heng, it is good to apply CB but in this case, I think some form of flexibility should be allowed. Reason is now most parents have to work from home and very young kids are a big distraction. They affect the parents work negatively. Also assuming that all grandparents are old, frail and unhealthy is not altogether correct. Hope that certain form of flexibility be allowed. Who can be approached in MOH or govt officers when the appeal has to be carried out?",2020-04-10 03:39:02+00:00,189

‚†Ä
Like many of us, I am concerned about how our seniors are coping, that they may feel lonely or isolated. Our elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19. With the circuit breaker in place, they should stay home as much as possible. We can visit to assist them with their daily needs while keeping the visits short. This is the best way to protect their well-being. It is not easy to explain that we may sometimes have to stay away because we care, but we must do so.

We can still show care and concern for the elderly, even when we are not physically present. There are many ways to keep in touch ‚Äî through WhatsApp, video-conferencing apps such as Skype, or just a simple phone call.

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page. This is a @gov.sg collaboration with producer @jackneock for our seniors to enjoy the familiar tunes from yesterdays in the comfort of our homes.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Let us all help our elderly family members adapt so that they can remain happy and engaged at home. Safe distancing does not mean social isolation.‚†Ä ‚†Ä
I encourage those with good ideas on how to keep our seniors engaged at home to come forward and take part in the #StayhomeforSG challenge.‚†Ä

This is the first time in our history that we will be closing all schools and most workplaces across the island for a month ‚Äî a painful but necessary ‚Äòcircuit breaker‚Äô to stem the tide of COVID-19 cases.

Tomorrow afternoon, when Parliament sits, I will announce additional support for workers, businesses and households, to help tide them through this period.

The COVID-19 situation has taken a very sharp turn, both globally and locally. Strong measures have to be taken to protect lives, but the economy has taken a hit as a result. Tomorrow will mark the third round of support measures in less than two months ‚Äî coming after the Unity Budget on 18 Feb and the Resilience Budget on 26 March. This too is another first.

We must remain steadfast in the face of crisis, and stand in solidarity with one another during these difficult times. I am therefore naming this set of measures to tide us through the 'circuit breaker' the Solidarity Budget.

Unity, Resilience, Solidarity ‚Äî these values will come to define who we are as a people. The bonds that bind us together will be forged and renewed in this crisis, much as how the turbulent years of Independence brought our founding generation together. As we battle on, we are most grateful that earlier generations have saved up and built strong foundations for us. These strengths have given us the wherewithal to protect our people and their jobs.

This is a defining chapter of our generation. Together, we will pull through and emerge stronger. When the storm eventually subsides, as all storms do, I am confident that as a stronger society, we can build an even better future for our children and our grandchildren.

229,"PM @leehsienloong announced yesterday a set of significantly stricter measures, as a circuit breaker to curb the escalating number of new COVID-19 cases. Most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, will close for one month from next Tuesday.

We are implementing these painful but necessary measures to protect lives. The stronger the measures we adopt, the bigger the disruption and costs on businesses. We remain equally committed to protecting jobs and livelihoods during this time. Many businesses are looking at your cash flow and working out alternative arrangements over the weekend. I understand your worries.

That is why I am working with my team at the @mof_sg, together with other government agencies, to further increase support for businesses during the period of the circuit breaker. This includes boosting the Job Support Scheme and waiving the foreign worker levy for the month of April, so that companies can retain and pay their workers. We will also be passing legislation on Tuesday (7 April) in Parliament to ensure that property tax rebates are passed through to tenants.

This is undoubtedly a difficult month for many businesses. Additional help is on the way. I hope that businesses can tide through this month, hold on to your workers, and resume activities once the circuit breaker is lifted. Together, we can pull through this crisis.

I will announce the details in my ministerial statement in Parliament on Monday.

This move came after two Singaporeans who attended a religious gathering in Malaysia had returned here with COVID-19.

Today, @masagosz announced that the mosque closure will be extended till 26 March 2020 to further limit the spread of the virus.

I understand that the closure of mosques and suspension of Friday prayers will cause inconvenience to our friends from the Muslim community. But this is a necessary move in order to reduce the risk of secondary transmission and to protect all Singaporeans. In a mosque setting, it is challenging to conduct contact tracing due to the lack of registration for regular congregants.
