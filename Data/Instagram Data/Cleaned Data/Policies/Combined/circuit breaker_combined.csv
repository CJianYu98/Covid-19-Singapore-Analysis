"A very lively atmosphere greeted me at Tampines North Primary yesterday. Thank you for the warm welcome #backtoschool! 

Met some P5 and 6 students who shared their #CircuitBreaker experience with me. They didn‚Äôt like it and much preferred going to school. But they also learnt to make the most of the situation. Some picked up new skills, while others helped out with household chores. They spent more time with family members and learnt to appreciate the important things in life. They showed adaptability and resilience and these are the traits that will put them in good stead for the future.

"Working from home has taken new meaning for most of us. We‚Äôre doing more remote meetings with our colleagues and realising that we can be just as productive at home as we have been in the office. The circuit breaker has showed us that we can work effectively in different ways.
We must now embrace working from home as the new norm. So even as more Singaporeans return to work during Phase 1 of the reopening plans, we expect the majority of the workforce to continue to work from home. 
This is why we have imposed the following requirement on employers after 1 June: your staff should return to work only if they need specialised equipment and machinery that cannot be accessed from home, or if they need to fulfil legal requirements (eg to complete contracts or transactions). On that basis, we expect most employees working in an office setting to continue working from home as they are presently doing. 
Many employers and managers will need to adjust their mindsets to this new normal. It‚Äôs no longer about having all your staff physically present at work. Even if they have to be on site, consider if they really need to do so every day. You could have hybrid arrangements where your employees work from home several days a week. 
For those who absolutely need to be in the office, employers must ensure that the work environment is safe (eg maintain good ventilation and high hygiene standards, and have officers seated apart etc) and offer them staggered work hours. 
All these workplace measures are critical in our fight against Covid-19 - they will reduce the need for daily movement of people, and minimise the risks of the virus flaring up again.",2020-05-23 13:30:38+00:00,üëçüòäüí™ Have a good Long weekend.,2020-05-23,5,Circuit Breaker,5,0,-10.756077795707581,1,0,0,56.2717555139388,4,0,0.0

"Seniors are significantly more at risk from Covid-19. Globally, 80% of Covid-related deaths occur in older persons above 60. In Singapore it is 95%. Many young people with Covid-19 have mild symptoms. But for seniors the disease is severe and potentially life-threatening.

We are appreciative and grateful for all the great decisions so far. However, i am indeed shocked that in the last few days your team has said to protect the most vulnerable group in nursing homes as they will not be able to survive well if the virus hits them. Why then is MOH allowing covid patients to be housed in Renci community where there is so many levels of vulnerable residents and also patients who need to come for weekly kidney dialysis? These group has bodies that cannot take a second round of strike against them. Could you be kind and just and not remove this post and instead look into this matter, and give it serious considerations if its a right decision, and if this contradicts the stand to protect the most vulnerable ones among us? They have family who loves them till their last breath. This last breath is already a vulnerable last one and one wrong move will not be a just a number, it will be shattered family hearts.

"We are seeing some results from the circuit breaker but these are still early days and we cannot let up. We must hunker down and push harder to break the transmission chain decisively.

Second, we will tighten access to popular areas where people are still gathering, like wet markets and supermarkets, so that safe distancing measures can be better implemented. For a start we will introduce a new control measure in selected popular wet markets to limit entry to alternate days.
Third we will close more work premises and tighten the list of essential services. The aim is to reduce the number of essential workers still out and about, so that we can minimise movement and interactions. Additional requirements will also be put in place to ensure that these workers and their employers uphold safe distancing measures at their workplaces. 
We will implement the above measures from now till 4 May. Beyond that we will have to extend the circuit breaker for another four weeks till 1 June.

"<Nation-wide Circuit Breaker>

The Taskforce has decided to put in place a nation-wide circuit breaker starting for at least a month, starting 7 April, to slow the spread of the virus. 
Under these stringent measures, all workplace premises other than those providing essential services or operating as part of global supply chains will have to close. For these closed premises, the work activities can continue only if all their employees work from home. Schools and IHLs will also be closed and will shift to full home-based learning.

Supermarkets and F&B outlets will remain open. For all F&B outlets, including hawker centres and coffeeshops, dining in will not be allowed - so you can only order food for delivery or takeout.

Essentially, we must all abide by these basic rules:
- Stay at Home. Avoid interactions with anyone outside of your family members who are already living with you
- Go out only if you have to do essential things (like going to work, buying groceries, or doing your daily exercise)
- If you have to go out, and cannot avoid close contact with others, wear a mask.

I‚Äôd like to add if I may - that is to make mask wearing mandatory when we are out. This is crucial especially in enclosed setting like buses, trains. It should not be a choice, left to the people to decide since the govt stand is - wear one if you can‚Äôt avoid crowds. There will always be  a group of people who don‚Äôt or refuses to wear one for their own reasons. Wearing one is protecting OTHERS  from one‚Äôs droplets from coughing, sneezing, talking. We should all and rightfully so, be concerned at the rise of local unlinked cases and the asymptomatic carriers lurking amongst us. We can‚Äôt afford to have a tiny chance that some of these people could be asymptomatic and unknowingly be spreading the virus. Now that every resident will get a reusable mask, there is no reason not to mask up when out. I hope people will change the selfish mindset - cloth mask ‚â† ineffective (against virus) therefore I won‚Äôt wear.  When Malaysia ends her lockdown we will see an influx of people coming in. Temperature scanning can not longer be trusted as a gauge to weed out the infected ones. We need everyone to wear a mask, on top of social distancing measures to further boost containment. Anyone not wearing one should be refused entry to Singapore. This rule should also be applied to trains and buses and crowded places.

The Taskforce has decided to put in place a nation-wide circuit breaker starting for at least a month, starting 7 April, to slow the spread of the virus. 
Under these stringent measures, all workplace premises other than those providing essential services or operating as part of global supply chains will have to close. For these closed premises, the work activities can continue only if all their employees work from home. Schools and IHLs will also be closed and will shift to full home-based learning.

The Taskforce has decided to put in place a nation-wide circuit breaker starting for at least a month, starting 7 April, to slow the spread of the virus. 
Under these stringent measures, all workplace premises other than those providing essential services or operating as part of global supply chains will have to close. For these closed premises, the work activities can continue only if all their employees work from home. Schools and IHLs will also be closed and will shift to full home-based learning.

Supermarkets and F&B outlets will remain open. For all F&B outlets, including hawker centres and coffeeshops, dining in will not be allowed - so you can only order food for delivery or takeout.

Essentially, we must all abide by these basic rules:
- Stay at Home. Avoid interactions with anyone outside of your family members who are already living with you
- Go out only if you have to do essential things (like going to work, buying groceries, or doing your daily exercise)
- If you have to go out, and cannot avoid close contact with others, wear a mask.

All of us now have a critical role to play in slowing the spread of the virus. Let us hunker down and beat the virus together.",2020-04-03 13:29:11+00:00,singapore has what it takes to survive... #sgunited,2020-04-03,7,Circuit Breaker,7,0,-12.554816638954804,3,0,0,104.53557732404393,4,0,0.0

It also shows I trust your capabilities (though I strongly diagree with your HDB policy which does not align with our great Lee Kuan Yew's promise to common Singaporeans that HDB will be our main appeciative asset. Fact is : it is most Singaporeans ""main asset"". Imho, your policy only benefits the upper class who holds private properties assets) Straight to the point. My suggestion : our Govt next move to tackle the Covid-19 crisis is to have better, stricter guidelines and checks on our food industries and imported food products (from Epi Centers such as Italy, China, Korea) and especially Malaysia. NEA should level up on this. NEA should deploy checks on big large scale central kitchens in Singapore to peridically check on the production staff. E.g. a central bakery employing hundreds of production workers doing cakes production if they are not highly regulated , guided, checked to be safe, any infected food production worker may become ""a super spreader"" through food distribution, sales, consumption. Imagine an infected worker coughed on a cake, cake is then eaten by a few. Would  that spread virus? It is NEA job to enhance food safety assurance.

But CNA news shows that Indonesia Govt ""had failed in many areas"" in their fight against Covid-19. Many Indonesians expressed disappointment in their Govt efforts. So when they have no confidence, where do they go to ? Singapore. They cannot go to Malaysia right now (lockdown). So Singapore. Even without Malaysia lockdown, their 1st choice would be ? Singapore.  What does that mean ? Singapore is in high risk and danger of becoming the next Italy. Now we know China aggressive, decisive, extreme measures : the lockdown in Jan were necessary and the correct move. We can compare situations now. Europe vs China. China is doing a better job in the containment efforts. As for Singapore, schools are going to reopen on 23 Mar. Singapore are still ""open doors"" for business. SIA  will manage to get that few $ business. Efficient ? If planes are not flying at full capacities ? Indonesians will try all their best to get into Singapore for their Covid-19 testings and treatments as their Govt seems to ""have disappointed them"". This is very worrisome.

Feedback : Why are Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as Macau faring better than other cities in tackling against the Covid-19 Crisis ? My guess : M A S K S . That's right. Almost everyone is encouraged to wear masks. So what happens when they do that ? Those who are infected or unaware they are affected covered themselves with masks thus reducing the risks of transmission. And those not infected also wear masks makes it a "" double protection "". We cannot adopt a ""self-deceiving"" concept that asking everyone to wear masks will not help as much simply because we do not have enough masks or could not produce our own masks. Wearing masks does help. If not, why 1 minister said if we run out of masks, medical staff may not work? It simply means masks help the medical staff to protect themselves against the Covid-19. Or wearing masks is better than not wearing any. So after so much talk, main point ? Main Point : we study Macau Hong Kong Taiwan and we can gauge that encouraging everyong to wear masks help in the containment. Our Govt next task ? Quickly assemble a large scale production line that can produce our own masks at about 5 mil units per day rate. Any excess we can sell, export or donate to other countries who want them.

"Kindergarten graduation ceremonies are a joy to look forward to at this time of the year ‚Äî seeing the enthusiasm of the graduating children and sharing in the excitement of their parents and teachers.

This year, with the pandemic, the year-end concerts and graduation ceremonies turned into hybrid events, with the children at school and attendees watching online. I joined two virtual kindergarten graduation ceremonies in my constituency this month ‚Äî My First Skool at Bedok South Blk 1 and @pcf.sg Sparkletots at Bedok Blk 30.

Despite the challenging school year, our children have adjusted well, thanks to the dedication of teachers and parents. Our little ones have been resilient and adapted to new norms, not only in their own lives but accepting changes in their parents‚Äô routines as well.

To our graduating K2 students ‚Äî congratulations! I hope you continue to enjoy your learning journey as you embark on a new adventure in primary school. Keep learning and keep growing. üéì

"I was very happy to e-meet many familiar faces from the social service sector on Saturday, together with @desmond.lee, @gracefu.hy and @indraneerajah, ahead of my Ministerial Statement next Tuesday.

We heard from 30 social service sector partners, on the challenges they and their clients are facing. We discussed how our social service agencies can strengthen collaboration and capability building. Their passion to serve came through during the dialogue, as they are doing all they can to strengthen support for vulnerable members of our community during the circuit breaker. The circuit breaker has accelerated the shift to digital, as more services are provided online. This highlighted both the potential and also the current constraints of going digital. Many also shared their concerns about the difficulties with fundraising during this period.

Many good ideas were raised. I will look at how we can better support the social service sector as part of the upcoming Budget. We will also work with the sector to embrace digitalisation, accelerate transformation and scale up new capabilities.

What is even more heartening is how the sector is working together. Some participants were already working closely together, and new areas of collaboration were identified during our discussions. The sector faces many common challenges, but we can overcome them if we work in partnership, and put our collective effort into tackling them. This is the spirit of our #SingaporeTogether movement.

We are making good progress towards building a more caring and inclusive society. We will build an even better tomorrow, with the strong support of social service agencies.

These are unprecedented and trying times for everyone. However, I am glad to see Singaporeans remain strong and resilient. Our Tampines residents have continued to help and care for those in need. Our Muslim community has also shown kindness and understanding, despite having to scale down on many of our activities during this period.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Let us continue to stay home and stay safe during this period, so that we can look forward to celebrating many more special occasions with our families and friends!‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri to all Muslims in Singapore.‚†Ä

"I recall fondly how I had a buka puasa with the community at @wgeylangserai at this time last year, followed by a visit to the Geylang Serai Bazaar. Earlier this evening, I joined @masagosz, @maliki_osman, leaders from our Malay/Muslim organisations, and community partners for an e-Buka Puasa instead, given our circuit breaker measures.‚Å£
‚Å£
WGS and MUIS organised this ‚Äòlive‚Äô e-Buka Puasa on WGS‚Äôs Facebook Page, with chit-chat sessions and music performances.‚Å£
‚Å£
I thank all our Muslims for your understanding in making these difficult adjustments, while keeping the community spirit strong and supporting the fight against COVID-19. This care and togetherness is the very spirit of #SingaporeTogether.‚Å£
‚Å£
I hope our Muslim friends will have a good time with your families preparing to usher in Hari Raya over the next few days.‚Å£

Saya teringat pada tahun lalu saya berpeluang berbuka puasa di Wisma Geylang Serai (WGS) dan berkunjung ke bazar Hari Raya. Malam ini, ekoran langkah pemutus rantaian jangkitan, saya bersama Masagos Zulkifli, Dr Maliki Osman, dan para pemimpin serta rakan-rakan dari beberapa pertubuhan Melayu/Islam di Singapura mengikuti sesi e-Buka Puasa.‚Å£
‚Å£
WGS dengan kerjasama MUIS telah menganjurkan sesi e-Buka Puasa ini secara ‚Äòlive‚Äô melalui laman Facebook WGS. Sesi ‚Äòlive‚Äô ini juga padat dengan pelbagai persembahan dan sesi bersembang.‚Å£

"For many Tampines residents and myself, a visit to @ourtampineshub used to be a weekly (or even more frequent) affair. I used to go there for events and would often meet many residents shopping, exercising, finding good makan, attending classes, visiting the library, enjoying movie screenings, and so much more ‚Äî there‚Äôs always something going on at OTH.

OTH is a lot quieter these days ‚Äî and for good reason, as many residents and Singaporeans understand the need and importance of staying home during this period.

The OTH team has worked hard to move the buzz online ‚Äî with OTH‚Äôs Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube channels offering contests, workouts, craft tutorials, and concerts to keep everyone staying safe at home entertained and occupied. So you can check out OTH virtually!

I know many residents are looking forward to visiting OTH again. As we slowly and gradually emerge from the circuit breaker, it will not be the same as before. We will have to observe precautionary measures including SafeEntry, to protect the community and prevent a surge of new cases. In the meantime, let us #stayhomeforSG, look out for our neighbours, and make Tampines a safe home for all.

"Today is the last day of full Home-Based Learning (HBL). The past four weeks have been challenging for everyone involved.

For Teachers, this means putting in extra time and effort to prepare. HBL is a different mode of teaching, and you have to be creative and learn new skills to make online learning as engaging as possible.

For Parents, you have to support your children in the best possible way, even as you juggle working from home and housework.

For Students, I know many of you miss your classmates, your favourite hangouts and CCAs in schools. E-learning is not new, but having to do so remotely for a month is a completely different way to learn.

Challenging as it is for everyone, this experience also creates many memorable stories. I urge you all to share these, so that we can all learn about what worked, what did not; why not, and how we can do better.

Let us all be prepared to try new things, adapt and grow with this new experience, and we may just become more innovative after this! The first step in any innovation is to overcome the fear of the unknown. But if the new approach is better, we can learn better. If the traditional approach is better, we will appreciate it more, and look forward to going back to school!

Education Minister @ongyekung has brought forward our mid-year school holidays, so that everyone can have a respite. I strongly encourage all parents and students to explore new activities to spend quality time together, at home. I hope all our teachers who have been working very hard can also take a well-deserved break, before some of you have to help graduating cohorts prepare for their national exams from 19 May.

‚Ä¢ I will extend the 75% wage subsidy under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to all sectors for the month of May. I urge employers to treat their workers fairly, and to do their best to retain them, and make full use of the support measures for training and corporate upgrading.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
‚Ä¢ I will further enhance the JSS to include shareholder-directors who did not qualify for JSS, based on the earlier criteria, and also did not qualify for SIRS.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
‚Ä¢ I will also be waiving the Foreign Worker Levy (FWL) due in May and provide employers with another $750 in FWL rebate for every foreign worker in employment.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Families who need help because their breadwinners have lost their jobs can apply for the COVID-19 Support Grant from 1 May 2020.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
More details can be found on the MOF website (www.mof.gov.sg).
‚†Ä
The extension of the Solidarity Budget will amount to $3.8 billion. But the financial support works only if we each do our part and help one another out.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
The coming weeks will be even more critical, as we batten down our hatches. We cannot be certain when this crisis will pass. But you can be assured that we will be here with you, for you. As long as we stand in solidarity with one another, we can rough out the waves better and emerge stronger.‚†Ä

"#StayhomeforSG challenge was launched yesterday to encourage Singaporeans to stay active and engaged, even as we stay home. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Like many of us, I am concerned about how our seniors are coping, that they may feel lonely or isolated. Our elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19. With the circuit breaker in place, they should stay home as much as possible. We can visit to assist them with their daily needs while keeping the visits short. This is the best way to protect their well-being. It is not easy to explain that we may sometimes have to stay away because we care, but we must do so.

We can still show care and concern for the elderly, even when we are not physically present. There are many ways to keep in touch ‚Äî through WhatsApp, video-conferencing apps such as Skype, or just a simple phone call.

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page. This is a @gov.sg collaboration with producer @jackneock for our seniors to enjoy the familiar tunes from yesterdays in the comfort of our homes.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Let us all help our elderly family members adapt so that they can remain happy and engaged at home. Safe distancing does not mean social isolation.‚†Ä ‚†Ä
I encourage those with good ideas on how to keep our seniors engaged at home to come forward and take part in the #StayhomeforSG challenge.‚†Ä

Does this mean that in order to protect the grandparents, the younger family members should move out? 2. What if the grand parents are not old and fragilecas assumed but lead an active and healthy life and are relatively young and have been looking after the grand children while the parents are working? 3.  If the healthy grandparents actually stay next door or across the block like 3 mins walk,the grand kids are also not allowed to be with the grand parents? 4. If childcare centres are so safe, why do the pre-schools, all schools need to close? Mr Heng, it is good to apply CB but in this case, I think some form of flexibility should be allowed. Reason is now most parents have to work from home and very young kids are a big distraction. They affect the parents work negatively. Also assuming that all grandparents are old, frail and unhealthy is not altogether correct. Hope that certain form of flexibility be allowed. Who can be approached in MOH or govt officers when the appeal has to be carried out?",2020-04-10,189,Circuit Breaker,195,4,-10.5685976253087,42,13,2,2.1373797389286984,0,1,1.0
"#StayhomeforSG challenge was launched yesterday to encourage Singaporeans to stay active and engaged, even as we stay home. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Like many of us, I am concerned about how our seniors are coping, that they may feel lonely or isolated. Our elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19. With the circuit breaker in place, they should stay home as much as possible. We can visit to assist them with their daily needs while keeping the visits short. This is the best way to protect their well-being. It is not easy to explain that we may sometimes have to stay away because we care, but we must do so.

We can still show care and concern for the elderly, even when we are not physically present. There are many ways to keep in touch ‚Äî through WhatsApp, video-conferencing apps such as Skype, or just a simple phone call.

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page. This is a @gov.sg collaboration with producer @jackneock for our seniors to enjoy the familiar tunes from yesterdays in the comfort of our homes.‚†Ä

"#StayhomeforSG challenge was launched yesterday to encourage Singaporeans to stay active and engaged, even as we stay home. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Like many of us, I am concerned about how our seniors are coping, that they may feel lonely or isolated. Our elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19. With the circuit breaker in place, they should stay home as much as possible. We can visit to assist them with their daily needs while keeping the visits short. This is the best way to protect their well-being. It is not easy to explain that we may sometimes have to stay away because we care, but we must do so.

We can still show care and concern for the elderly, even when we are not physically present. There are many ways to keep in touch ‚Äî through WhatsApp, video-conferencing apps such as Skype, or just a simple phone call.

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page. This is a @gov.sg collaboration with producer @jackneock for our seniors to enjoy the familiar tunes from yesterdays in the comfort of our homes.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Let us all help our elderly family members adapt so that they can remain happy and engaged at home. Safe distancing does not mean social isolation.‚†Ä ‚†Ä
I encourage those with good ideas on how to keep our seniors engaged at home to come forward and take part in the #StayhomeforSG challenge.‚†Ä

This is a defining chapter of our generation. Together, we will pull through and emerge stronger. When the storm eventually subsides, as all storms do, I am confident that as a stronger society, we can build an even better future for our children and our grandchildren.

"PM @leehsienloong announced yesterday a set of significantly stricter measures, as a circuit breaker to curb the escalating number of new COVID-19 cases. Most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, will close for one month from next Tuesday.

We are implementing these painful but necessary measures to protect lives. The stronger the measures we adopt, the bigger the disruption and costs on businesses. We remain equally committed to protecting jobs and livelihoods during this time. Many businesses are looking at your cash flow and working out alternative arrangements over the weekend. I understand your worries.

That is why I am working with my team at the @mof_sg, together with other government agencies, to further increase support for businesses during the period of the circuit breaker. This includes boosting the Job Support Scheme and waiving the foreign worker levy for the month of April, so that companies can retain and pay their workers. We will also be passing legislation on Tuesday (7 April) in Parliament to ensure that property tax rebates are passed through to tenants.

This is undoubtedly a difficult month for many businesses. Additional help is on the way. I hope that businesses can tide through this month, hold on to your workers, and resume activities once the circuit breaker is lifted. Together, we can pull through this crisis.

I will announce the details in my ministerial statement in Parliament on Monday.

"Last Friday, we announced the closure of all mosques in Singapore for five days, to facilitate cleaning and disinfection procedures so as to prevent the emergence of new clusters. This move came after two Singaporeans who attended a religious gathering in Malaysia had returned here with COVID-19. As of today, a total of five Singaporeans who attended the event have now tested positive for the virus. They had visited 10 mosques in Singapore during their infectious period. Today, @masagosz announced that the mosque closure will be extended till 26 March 2020 to further limit the spread of the virus.

I understand that the closure of mosques and suspension of Friday prayers will cause inconvenience to our friends from the Muslim community. But this is a necessary move in order to reduce the risk of secondary transmission and to protect all Singaporeans. In a mosque setting, it is challenging to conduct contact tracing due to the lack of registration for regular congregants. Upon the reopening of mosques, additional precautionary measures will be implemented to reduce the risk of spread of the virus.

"Tomorrow, we will be lifting some circuit breaker measures. A big relief to all, but certainly not without its risks.

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don‚Äôt want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

(About Mr Chan CS , our local masks factory). You will notice the factory workers who touch, sort , pack the production line masks DID NOT WEAR ANY GLOVES at all. This is totally unacceptable (and shocking!) in my most honest opinion. I thought we Singapore should have ""higher standards"" than say Vietnam ? (I watched Vietnam news their mask factories the workers do wear gloves). If our local mask factories workers are infected with Covid-19 and they do not wear gloves to touch/sort/pack the masks, the consequences can be disastrous. Trust your wisdom and do advise our local mask factories to instruct their workers to wear gloves. Thank you.

"Prime Minister @jacindaardern and I spoke on the phone this afternoon. We updated each other on how we are managing COVID-19 in Singapore and New Zealand. We are both implementing strict circuit breaking measures, to break transmission of the virus and squeeze the cases down.

PM Ardern shared that after New Zealand implemented their measures, numbers only started to come down on Day 11. We are only in Day 3 and still have a long way to go. If we all comply strictly, as the New Zealanders have done, hopefully by our Day 11 we too will see positive results.

PM Ardern and I also discussed how we can support each other during this time, including keeping supply chains intact between the two countries. Both Singapore and New Zealand will continue to do our part in this global fight against COVID-19.

At home, @masagosz has announced that enforcement officers will now immediately take down the particulars of anyone breaching the measures. More details on his Facebook post today. We cannot wait to save lives. Please do your part today. ‚Äì LHL

"The Government has just announced some initial steps to allow activities such as barbers, home-based business and laundromats to resume during the circuit breaker period in May. 
For MOE, we will enter the four-week mid-year school holidays in May. The first two weeks will be protected time for teachers. This is something we always do, to allow teachers some time to rest and recharge, although we know many of them use the time to plan lessons and stay in touch with students. 
As for the following two weeks, √¢‚Ç¨¬™starting 19 May√¢‚Ç¨¬¨, schools will bring back students from graduating cohorts, i.e. Pri 6, Sec 4 and 5, JC2 and Pre-U 3.  We know that these students have been anxious about the preparation for their national exams, and that home-based learning cannot fully substitute face to face coaching and lessons. 
Their return to school will be done in a careful and calibrated manner, with ample safe distancing. They will come back in small groups, on selected days in a week, throughout the day, and will be spaced out within the school compound. They will meet teachers one-to-one, or in small groups.  Masks are compulsory. 
We will give priority to students requiring school facilities for coursework and practical sessions, as well as those who need additional support and remediation. 
Throughout the holidays, schools will also continue to engage students with greater needs and provide care for those whose parents work in essential services and are unable to secure alternative care arrangements.

Our teachers, students and parents have been working hard to make HBL work. It hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been easy. The learning curve is steep for everyone. I thank everyone for your hard work, perseverance, patience and positivity.&nbsp;
HBL is a fall back when schools are suspended; it cannot be a prolonged substitute for school. It is better to let everyone have a break from this intense period.&nbsp;
