"Phase 3 begins today. Families will now have the chance to gather in a larger group of 8, and enjoy some meaningful time together.

But please remember: there are still rules in Phase 3. So comply with the measures and do not let your guard down. Around the world, some experts are already warning about a post-seasonal surge in cases, as people are ignoring the restrictions and flocking together for festive celebrations. We must not allow that to happen here.

I thank the majority of residents here who are doing their part. Unfortunately there are a few who continue to disregard the rules. Some book multiple tables in restaurants; others hold large parties in their homes. We will step up enforcement checks, and will take firm actions against these breaches, even for first-time offences - business outlets will be closed, individuals fined, and as highlighted before, those who are work-pass holders risk getting their passes revoked.

"It‚Äôs the second day of our Phase 2 re-opening, and the majority of businesses and individuals are cooperating with the measures to resume activities safely. But unfortunately a few have acted very irresponsibly. They will be taken to task.

"Singapore will be entering Phase 2 of reopening after 18 June 2359. This means that from Friday onwards, almost all businesses will be able to re-open, be it retail, F&B dining-in or personalised consumer services. The key requirement is that individuals must maintain safe distancing of at least 1 m at all times, and if that‚Äôs not feasible (eg when dining at a table), then each group will be limited to a maximum of 5 persons. Sports, gyms, playgrounds, and other public facilities will open, as will similar facilities in condominiums and clubs. Small group gatherings of up to any 5 persons can also resume, and households may receive up to 5 visitors at any time. 
There are a small number of activities that will take more time to resume. These are activities where large numbers of people are likely to come into close contact, often in enclosed spaces and for prolonged periods of time. They include religious services and congregations; large-scale events and venues; and entertainment outlets like bars, clubs and karaoke outlets. We will continue to work with these organisations and business owners on the safe management measures that are needed before they can open.
Phase 2 is a significant step forward in our reopening process. But please do not treat this as a signal to relax and let our guard down. 
Businesses must take the rules seriously. Do not rush to open if you are not ready, because you will be putting your own customers and employees at risk. All of us must continue to exercise individual and social responsibility. There‚Äôs no need to rush to go out this weekend. We should continue to limit our close contacts, even if we can now meet in groups. As customers, we should also be discerning about the establishments we patronise, and insist on high safety standards everywhere we go.

"As we approach the end of the circuit breaker, we are now preparing for the next phase and considering what activities can resume in a safe manner.  We will do so in a very careful and calibrated manner. It won‚Äôt simply be a return to life before the circuit breaker. 
For example, in the construction sector, we will only re-start with a few projects and insist on very tight end-to-end safeguards for these projects. The safeguards include requiring all the workers involved in a project to be housed together (instead of being at multiple dormitories); safe distancing measures at the work sites; and periodic testing of the workers (at 2 week intervals). We expect only about 5% of the construction workforce to work on these projects, and will scale up over time as the industry gains confidence and experience with the measures. 
We will apply this same calibrated approach in how we resume normal activities, be it at work, schools, or in our social settings. In other words, don‚Äôt expect 100% resumption of activities after 1 June. On the contrary, be fully prepared that many of the current restrictions and measures we have today will continue for some time, so as to keep our family members and loved ones safe. 
A controlled and phased exit from the circuit breaker will require patience and discipline from all of us.

"You all heard the news: Phase 2 of re-opening starts this Friday, 19 June.

It is a significant step. Most activities will resume, except certain larger scale ones with close interaction activities, that have potential to be mass spreading events. Social gatherings should have a maximum of five people. 
All the things we miss - sitting in coffeeshops or restaurants, bubble tea, tuition and enrichment classes, meeting up with boyfriends or girlfriends, can all resume. 
It took us a lot of sacrifice to get here, after a fairly long circuit breaker period, and a careful Phase 1 opening. But during this time, all of us co-operated, and we suppressed the virus transmission. 
From here, it is up to us again. We will all take care of our personal hygiene, adopt necessary precautionary measures, look out for one another. That way, we keep the virus under control in Phase 2. While we are all eager to meet up with friends and socialise, we will do so safely. No need to all rush out on Friday - everywhere will be full. Can take our time a bit, and ease into our social activities again. My daughter already told me I must wait for my Father√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Day dinner. 
Schools will continue with our weekly rotation plan, and comprehensive safe management measures. We will bring all students back daily from 29 June. MOE will give more details soon.
