For example, in the construction sector, we will only re-start with a few projects and insist on very tight end-to-end safeguards for these projects. The safeguards include requiring all the workers involved in a project to be housed together (instead of being at multiple dormitories); safe distancing measures at the work sites; and periodic testing of the workers (at 2 week intervals). We expect only about 5% of the construction workforce to work on these projects, and will scale up over time as the industry gains confidence and experience with the measures. 
We will apply this same calibrated approach in how we resume normal activities, be it at work, schools, or in our social settings. In other words, don‚Äôt expect 100% resumption of activities after 1 June. On the contrary, be fully prepared that many of the current restrictions and measures we have today will continue for some time, so as to keep our family members and loved ones safe.

153,336,"You all heard the news: Phase 2 of re-opening starts this Friday, 19 June.

It is a significant step. Most activities will resume, except certain larger scale ones with close interaction activities, that have potential to be mass spreading events. Social gatherings should have a maximum of five people. 
All the things we miss - sitting in coffeeshops or restaurants, bubble tea, tuition and enrichment classes, meeting up with boyfriends or girlfriends, can all resume. 
It took us a lot of sacrifice to get here, after a fairly long circuit breaker period, and a careful Phase 1 opening. But during this time, all of us co-operated, and we suppressed the virus transmission. 
From here, it is up to us again. We will all take care of our personal hygiene, adopt necessary precautionary measures, look out for one another. That way, we keep the virus under control in Phase 2. While we are all eager to meet up with friends and socialise, we will do so safely. No need to all rush out on Friday - everywhere will be full. Can take our time a bit, and ease into our social activities again. My daughter already told me I must wait for my Father√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Day dinner. 
Schools will continue with our weekly rotation plan, and comprehensive safe management measures. We will bring all students back daily from 29 June. MOE will give more details soon.
