They include religious services and congregations; large-scale events and venues; and entertainment outlets like bars, clubs and karaoke outlets.

"As we approach the end of the circuit breaker, we are now preparing for the next phase and considering what activities can resume in a safe manner.  We will do so in a very careful and calibrated manner. It won’t simply be a return to life before the circuit breaker. 
For example, in the construction sector, we will only re-start with a few projects and insist on very tight end-to-end safeguards for these projects. The safeguards include requiring all the workers involved in a project to be housed together (instead of being at multiple dormitories); safe distancing measures at the work sites; and periodic testing of the workers (at 2 week intervals). We expect only about 5% of the construction workforce to work on these projects, and will scale up over time as the industry gains confidence and experience with the measures. 
We will apply this same calibrated approach in how we resume normal activities, be it at work, schools, or in our social settings. In other words, don’t expect 100% resumption of activities after 1 June. On the contrary, be fully prepared that many of the current restrictions and measures we have today will continue for some time, so as to keep our family members and loved ones safe. 
A controlled and phased exit from the circuit breaker will require patience and discipline from all of us. We must all do our part to control the spread of the virus and ensure that it does not flare up again.",2020-05-17 09:51:42+00:00,"@lawrencewongst Sir, I think issuing guidelines for visiting family members of different household to wear mask, not sharing food or utensils etc while visiting could minimise transmission to our elders.

UK, Italy, Spain, France, USA the same stories. It all started with a few, then a few hundred. And then ? Exploded. Out of Control. Like Italy. Like Spain and etc. Singapore started with a few. Now ? More than a thousand. There were ""many overlook"" Singapore Govt made. One of them : letting in tens of thousands of Malaysians before Malaysia borders lockdown. My feel is?

Though it’s late, it’s the right move forward. Everyone should be treated as a suspect case and be tested upon arrival, and not just those who present symptoms at the border (which I believe is the protocol now). Mass testing has proven to be the tipping point for South Korea. We need to nip it in the bud - test, isolate, treat. Time is crucial, we can’t afford to wait for symptoms to show up then have patients present themselves at the hospital. If we can gift the Philippines with 3000 test kits surely we can do it for our fellow returnees? Also, at this point we should make it mandatory to wear mask. Wearing one is essential in the fight -  just look at China, Taiwan, SK, HK. “Wear one only when you’re sick” is not medically correct at this point in time. Experts in China have said people shed virus even before symptoms are present. Only by wearing a mask can we protect ourselves and people around us. I know there’s a shortage of masks in Singapore which makes it unfortunate but we can use cloth recyclable masks or any home made ones. When everyone wears one, it doesn’t matter if one’s quality is better than another. It really has helped those countries in containment. That’s certain. But to tell people that healthy people don’t need to wear one is just plain wrong, pardon me for saying. I’m writing as a concerned Singaporean - we must look at the above countries and learn from them. My next worry is when Malaysia ends her lockdown and thousands of people start to cross the causeway into Singapore... since it’s been proven with our recent imported cases that most don’t show symptoms at the border (meaning temperature can no longer be used as a gauge), how then?

The Year of the Rat has had a bumpy start. But we will continue to work hard to do all the things we need to, in order to secure a bright future for our children and for Singapore. – LHL

However, Singapor is doing in an opposite way- a lot of gathering / parties are still ongoing and people share the respiratory droplets everywhere...

"Had a good time catching up with residents old and new at our Chinese New Year dinner celebration at Teck Ghee last night.

The 2019 novel coronavirus was foremost on the minds of many residents, but fortunately that did not dampen the festive spirit.

The island-wide mask distribution exercise kicked off today. The SAF and @pafrenz worked round the clock to make this happen. For last-mile distribution, many grassroots leaders and volunteers were activated to organise collection points.

It is perhaps fitting that in the Year of the Rat, Singaporeans have embodied this particular creature’s qualities of resilience and creativity, and stayed united and strong. Wishing all a healthy and prosperous year ahead!

"It has been a stressful week not just for the general public, but in particular for healthcare and medical professionals.

We have watched the new coronavirus outbreak in China closely, from the moment the first news came out. Actually we have been preparing for such a situation ever since SARS in 2003. We knew that one day something like that would happen again. So, in a way, this outbreak was a shock, but not a surprise.

9 of the 13 confirmed cases in Singapore are currently being treated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), next to @tantocksenghospital. I visited NCID this morning to see for myself the screening and containment process for affected patients, and to meet and thank some of the people working day and night to treat them. I was very happy with what I saw.

I urge everyone to show understanding and support to our healthcare and medical teams, public officers, the SAF and @pafrenz, who will be distributing masks to Singaporeans over the weekend. We owe them our gratitude for their hard work and dedication.

I have every confidence that if we stay vigilant and united, we can overcome this challenge. – LHL (MCI Photos by Betty Chua)",2020-01-31 10:09:01+00:00,"Dear PM Sir - Singapore government did a great job for the past crisis and  diseases outbreak incidents such as shortage of sand, fanancial crisis, oil price inflation, SARS, Milk powder and now is Wuhan virus.

"[BREAKING] The Ministry of Health has confirmed six new cases of the Wuhan virus in Singapore on Feb. 4, 2020.

Out of the six cases, four are local human-to-human transmissions.

This is the first instance of “limited local transmission”, meaning that the patients had been infected locally.

The source of the virus is a Chinese medicine store at Yong Thai Hang, 24 Cavan Road in Lavender.

The shop is a tourist stop for Chinese travellers.

Some safe management measures that will be put in place following the CCA resumption include:
🔹 Maximum of 20 students per activity
🔹 Modified game rules will apply, such as students having to remain at least 1m apart
🔹 Schools will continue to screen all visitors, including coaches and instructors, for flu-like symptoms
CCAs and school activities that will remain suspended include those that involve high levels of body contact, such as taekwondo sparring or rugby scrums; or high exposure to aerosol and splatters, such as the playing of wind instruments or singing in a choir.

WHO said another concern is people may contaminate themselves by touching their faces more frequently when they adjust, remove and dispose of their masks. The agency said masks should be reserved for those who are infected with the virus or in close contact with infected patients.SO, when are you, Straits Times, going to report on this and question the government’s current stance on masks.",6/6/20,115,Mask,117,4,-11.30041278,24,6,1,0.650034965,0,1,1
"The task force combating the Covid-19 outbreak said that face shields are not as effective as masks in reducing the risk of transmission.
Only specific groups, such as teachers or those with certain medical conditions, will be allowed to wear face shields in place of masks.
This policy review was made as Singapore prepares to come out of its circuit breaker on June 2.

"This year’s National Day is not only an occasion to mark Singapore’s 55th year of independence, but also an occasion to show our solidarity and fortitude as we recommit ourselves as one united people.
 
It is a reminder that the indomitable Singapore spirit will prevail through COVID-19, much as we did in previous crises. 
 
NDP2020 will be conducted in a very different way, compared to previous years and from what was originally planned. The NDP Exco shared with me their challenges on how they had to adapt to the circumstances and quickly reconceptualise NDP when COVID struck, similar to how our people and our businesses had to adapt to the circuit breaker and a new normal.
 
Sitting at the Padang and watching the parade rehearsal this morning, it reminded me of our inaugural National Day Parade back in 1966. Both were simple parades held at the Padang.
 
My thanks to Chief of Defence Force Melvyn Ong, BG Frederick Choo, Chairman of NDP Exco and the team this year for changing the NDP so swiftly to ensure that we can mark our National Day in a safe but meaningful way. 
 
And special kudos to all NDP participants for your passion and hard work. Your commitment makes a difference — Singaporeans can continue to enjoy a meaningful and special NDP. 🇸🇬

Elections have to be held by April 2021, which is less than a year away. Our fight against COVID-19 will be long. The road ahead is full of uncertainty. The next few years will be critical, and the actions we take now will chart the course of our nation for decades to come.

The decision to hold an election in the middle of a pandemic is not an easy one to make. But given the profound uncertainty ahead, and the challenges that we must tackle as a nation, it is important that we do so now, when the situation is relatively stable. The election will give the new Government a fresh, five-year mandate to bring Singaporeans together to overcome this crisis.

We will fight COVID-19 as #SingaporeTogether. More than ever, we will need a government, with a strong mandate and a long runway, to lead us out of this crisis. We will face the challenges ahead together, working in partnership with you. We can and we will overcome this crisis of our generation, and emerge stronger as an economy, as a society and as one people.

There is a lot at stake. I trust that fellow Singaporeans will consider very carefully who you choose to form the next government and take Singapore forward. ⠀

"Glad to hear that the third round of masks collection in Tampines has been smooth and well-received by residents. I was also heartened to hear that we had residents stepping forward to volunteer and help with the distribution — this shows our gotong royong spirit is alive and well in Tampines.

I hope you will find this latest version of the mask more comfortable as new materials were used to optimise comfort and improve resistance to droplets. There is also a smaller size for kids below 12.  You can check out the care instructions for the masks here: vimeo.com/415442232.

You can collect your mask at all Community Centres islandwide till 14 June. Aside from the usual manual collection counters that open from 10am to 6pm daily, you can also use the mask vending machines that operate 24/7. Do bring along your IC and the ICs of your household members to collect on their behalf.

Our Tampines residents can collect their masks at the vending machines at Central Plaza and @tampinescentralcc in @ourtampineshub, or any RC as well as CC nearest to your home.

This islandwide exercise would not have been possible without the support of @pafrenz, @mindefsg, @temasekfoundation, @govtechsg, @astarsg, @ntu_sg and many other community partners and volunteers working behind the scenes — thank you everyone for the hard work.

These included His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah of Brunei, Indonesian Vice President @kyai_marufamin, Malaysian Senior Minister and Minister of International Trade and Industry @azmin_ali, Indonesian Finance Minister @smindrawati, Bruneian Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office and Minister of Finance and Economy II Amin Liew and Bruneian Minister of Primary Resources and Tourism Ali Apong.⁣
⁣
Like Singapore, our closest neighbours will be celebrating Hari Raya Aidilfitri under exceptional circumstances this year. We discussed how COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our societies and economies, and the measures we have put in place to protect our people. In my conversations with leaders in the region, they shared with me that the Muslim community understands the need for these precautionary measures. They have also taken these changes in their stride. What is most important is to celebrate the spirit of caring for and supporting one another.⁣
⁣
Indeed, the COVID-19 is a pandemic of global scale, and hence, global cooperation is critical. Nations and people around the world must continue to stay united within our countries, and strengthen cooperation beyond our borders.⁣
⁣
To all our Muslims in Singapore and around the world, Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri!⁣

"My fellow Tampines MP @cheng_lihui started a Sew Love SG initiative, mobilising residents to volunteer to make masks. Over 300 volunteers have responded. Li Hui sent them the fabrics, then the volunteers cut, sewed and distributed these masks to residents who needed them or sent back to the Tampines Town Council for these to be distributed.⠀
⠀
Over the last few weeks, more than 28,000 masks of all sizes, colours, and patterns have been hand-sewn by our volunteers.⠀
⠀
These have been given to families, migrant workers, and will soon be given to students in Tampines and frontline staff to show our support. Students and residents also made lovely bookmarks to show appreciation for frontline staff.⠀

I am touched by this care and concern that our residents in Tampines, and our people around Singapore, have shown for one another as we battle COVID-19. A big THANK YOU to all, for showing our heart, spirit and resilience during this time.⠀

While we have been seeing more new cases, I am relieved to hear that four more cases have fully recovered and were discharged on Sunday. We have seen a total of six patients who have recovered fully.

With the switch from DORSCON Yellow to Orange, MOH has issued an infographic on precautions you should take to help contain the spread of 2019-nCoV. Just remember the 5Ms, practice them diligently and stay healthy!

"It has been a busy and challenging time dealing with the 2019 novel coronavirus situation. After a confirmed case was identified in Tampines East, Advisor @cheng_lihui went to the affected block to support the cleaning and sanitisation done by Tampines Town Council and @nea_sg officers. She also brought essential items to the family, as they are now quarantined. Together with my Tampines GRC advisors, we will continue to monitor and provide necessary assistance.

Over the weekend, we have been checking on the situation across Tampines — was glad that our Tampines residents were calmly going about their daily lives after the panic buying incidents witnessed on Friday evening. Supermarket staff have worked long hours over the weekend to replenish stocks that were swept off the shelves as well as clean up the scenes of chaos left behind in some stores. I would like to assure Singaporeans that there is enough for everyone if we all only buy what we need. There is no need to build your own stockpile. Let us do our part, keep calm, and not let fear rule over our hearts and minds.

Amid reports of inconsiderate and racist behaviour, I am heartened by the Tampines Kindness Movement initiative for our healthcare workers who have been at the frontline providing professional medical care to the affected. There is currently a booth at @ourtampineshub that lets residents and visitors pen down messages of appreciation to our medical personnel.

"The 2019-novel coronavirus is a global public health challenge. I spoke to PRC Vice-Premier Han Zheng earlier today. I conveyed my condolences and sympathies to the families who have lost their loved ones to the outbreak, and to the communities in China which have been severely affected by the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

I reiterated to Vice-Premier Han that Singapore will continue to work closely with China and the international community to fight the virus —  this includes preventing its further spread and developing better medical testing.

In times like this, with the longstanding special relationship between Singapore and China, it is also important for us to work together.

Singapore researchers have worked to develop diagnostic nCoV test kits for use in laboratories. We can contribute to China’s containment efforts by providing test kits to conduct 10,000 tests at the first instance, together with 3 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines. We will be providing another 10,000 tests in the next couple of weeks. Our scientific experts are also exchanging views with their counterparts in China.

Earlier this week, the @sgredcross, together with various trade associations and chambers, companies and local community organisations, launched a public appeal to raise funds to provide humanitarian assistance to the affected communities in China. The Singapore Government will also contribute $1 million in seed funding to this collective effort by Singaporeans.

Infectious diseases are transboundary in nature. Countries can only overcome this challenge by stepping up measures within each country, and by collaborating with one another.

Singapore will continue to do our part — enhancing our safeguards as the situation evolves, and working with China and the international community to combat this outbreak.

I am confident we can overcome this challenge together.

To our relief, TTSH and MOH have clarified that it was a case of erroneous reporting by the testing laboratory. The student, plus the rest of the contacts, were tested to be negative.

"Students from all levels returned to school today. Visited Ngee Ann Secondary School this morning to see how they were coping with the full student population back in school. Students and teachers are familiar with the safe management measures by now. 
Upper and lower secondary students take designated routes to their classrooms when they enter the school, so no overcrowding. 
Teachers continue to conscientiously check with students if they or their household members are unwell. Question screening remains a very important step in helping us quickly identify potential cases and prevent any clusters in schools. 
With all students back now, it's even more important that all of us practise social responsibility to continue keeping our schools a safe place.",2020-06-29 11:27:28+00:00,It must be very hard to breath with the black mask on while playing a game of badminton in the hall with the sweat students trying to breath with the mask on . hopefully some of the students don't have system of hyperventilating while the mask is on during the game of badminton,29/6/20,51,Mask,52,3,-9.951241081,9,2,0,3.539564056,0,0,1
"You all heard the news: Phase 2 of re-opening starts this Friday, 19 June.

It is a significant step. Most activities will resume, except certain larger scale ones with close interaction activities, that have potential to be mass spreading events. Social gatherings should have a maximum of five people. 
All the things we miss - sitting in coffeeshops or restaurants, bubble tea, tuition and enrichment classes, meeting up with boyfriends or girlfriends, can all resume. 
It took us a lot of sacrifice to get here, after a fairly long circuit breaker period, and a careful Phase 1 opening. But during this time, all of us co-operated, and we suppressed the virus transmission. 
From here, it is up to us again. We will all take care of our personal hygiene, adopt necessary precautionary measures, look out for one another. That way, we keep the virus under control in Phase 2. While we are all eager to meet up with friends and socialise, we will do so safely. No need to all rush out on Friday - everywhere will be full. Can take our time a bit, and ease into our social activities again. My daughter already told me I must wait for my Fatherâ€™s Day dinner. 
Schools will continue with our weekly rotation plan, and comprehensive safe management measures. We will bring all students back daily from 29 June. MOE will give more details soon.

"As we exit from the Circuit Breaker from 2 Jun, we will embark on a roadmap to the eventual full opening of schools. 
But the first step, on 2 Jun, should be a cautious one, to re-open schools safely. We will progressively bring back students to schools and Institutes of Higher Learning. 
How?

First, we will prioritise the return of those who need a higher level of care, like students in Special Education schools, as well as graduating cohorts who needs to prepare for national exams. 
Second, for students not in graduating cohorts, we will have a weekly rotation system so that different levels of students take turns to come to school and to do HBL. So for primary school, it will be P4 and P5 coming back to school and P1, P2, P3 doing HBL in week 1, and the reverse in Week 2. P6s will come back every day.

We aim to gradually have all students fully back in school after two cycles of weekly rotation, or four weeks.

We will also continue to support high needs students and children of parents who need to work and cannot find alternate childcare arrangement, and allow them to come to school on their HBL week. 
Many students will be excited to return to school. Parents may be looking forward to school opening too, especially if they have to return to work. But I am sure parents are also worried about their childrenâ€™s safety. Rest assured that we will take whatever precautions we can to ensure the well-being of all students and staff. 
Third, we will implement a stringent safe management system, including screening of anyone that comes into schools, good hygiene habits, group separation to prevent inter-mingling of students from different classes, and safe distancing which include the wearing masks/face shields by teachers and students. 
COVID-19 will be with us for some time.
