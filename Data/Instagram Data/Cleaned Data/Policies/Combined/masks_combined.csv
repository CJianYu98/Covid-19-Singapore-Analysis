382,925,"As we approach the end of the circuit breaker, we are now preparing for the next phase and considering what activities can resume in a safe manner.  We will do so in a very careful and calibrated manner. It won‚Äôt simply be a return to life before the circuit breaker. 
For example, in the construction sector, we will only re-start with a few projects and insist on very tight end-to-end safeguards for these projects. The safeguards include requiring all the workers involved in a project to be housed together (instead of being at multiple dormitories); safe distancing measures at the work sites; and periodic testing of the workers (at 2 week intervals).

UK, Italy, Spain, France, USA the same stories. It all started with a few, then a few hundred. And then ? Exploded. Out of Control. Like Italy. Like Spain and etc. Singapore started with a few. Now ? More than a thousand. There were ""many overlook"" Singapore Govt made. One of them : letting in tens of thousands of Malaysians before Malaysia borders lockdown. My feel is?

Though it‚Äôs late, it‚Äôs the right move forward. Everyone should be treated as a suspect case and be tested upon arrival, and not just those who present symptoms at the border (which I believe is the protocol now). Mass testing has proven to be the tipping point for South Korea. We need to nip it in the bud - test, isolate, treat. Time is crucial, we can‚Äôt afford to wait for symptoms to show up then have patients present themselves at the hospital. If we can gift the Philippines with 3000 test kits surely we can do it for our fellow returnees? Also, at this point we should make it mandatory to wear mask. Wearing one is essential in the fight -  just look at China, Taiwan, SK, HK. ‚ÄúWear one only when you‚Äôre sick‚Äù is not medically correct at this point in time. Experts in China have said people shed virus even before symptoms are present. Only by wearing a mask can we protect ourselves and people around us. I know there‚Äôs a shortage of masks in Singapore which makes it unfortunate but we can use cloth recyclable masks or any home made ones. When everyone wears one, it doesn‚Äôt matter if one‚Äôs quality is better than another. It really has helped those countries in containment. That‚Äôs certain. But to tell people that healthy people don‚Äôt need to wear one is just plain wrong, pardon me for saying. I‚Äôm writing as a concerned Singaporean - we must look at the above countries and learn from them. My next worry is when Malaysia ends her lockdown and thousands of people start to cross the causeway into Singapore... since it‚Äôs been proven with our recent imported cases that most don‚Äôt show symptoms at the border (meaning temperature can no longer be used as a gauge), how then?

The island-wide mask distribution exercise kicked off today. The SAF and @pafrenz worked round the clock to make this happen. For last-mile distribution, many grassroots leaders and volunteers were activated to organise collection points.

It is perhaps fitting that in the Year of the Rat, Singaporeans have embodied this particular creature‚Äôs qualities of resilience and creativity, and stayed united and strong. Wishing all a healthy and prosperous year ahead!

We have watched the new coronavirus outbreak in China closely, from the moment the first news came out. Actually we have been preparing for such a situation ever since SARS in 2003. We knew that one day something like that would happen again. So, in a way, this outbreak was a shock, but not a surprise.

9 of the 13 confirmed cases in Singapore are currently being treated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), next to @tantocksenghospital. I visited NCID this morning to see for myself the screening and containment process for affected patients, and to meet and thank some of the people working day and night to treat them. I was very happy with what I saw.

I urge everyone to show understanding and support to our healthcare and medical teams, public officers, the SAF and @pafrenz, who will be distributing masks to Singaporeans over the weekend. We owe them our gratitude for their hard work and dedication.

I have every confidence that if we stay vigilant and united, we can overcome this challenge. ‚Äì LHL (MCI Photos by Betty Chua)",2020-01-31 10:09:01+00:00,"Dear PM Sir - Singapore government did a great job for the past crisis and  diseases outbreak incidents such as shortage of sand, fanancial crisis, oil price inflation, SARS, Milk powder and now is Wuhan virus.

NDP2020 will be conducted in a very different way, compared to previous years and from what was originally planned. The NDP Exco shared with me their challenges on how they had to adapt to the circumstances and quickly reconceptualise NDP when COVID struck, similar to how our people and our businesses had to adapt to the circuit breaker and a new normal.
 
Sitting at the Padang and watching the parade rehearsal this morning, it reminded me of our inaugural National Day Parade back in 1966. Both were simple parades held at the Padang.
 
My thanks to Chief of Defence Force Melvyn Ong, BG Frederick Choo, Chairman of NDP Exco and the team this year for changing the NDP so swiftly to ensure that we can mark our National Day in a safe but meaningful way.

Elections have to be held by April 2021, which is less than a year away. Our fight against COVID-19 will be long. The road ahead is full of uncertainty. The next few years will be critical, and the actions we take now will chart the course of our nation for decades to come.

The decision to hold an election in the middle of a pandemic is not an easy one to make. But given the profound uncertainty ahead, and the challenges that we must tackle as a nation, it is important that we do so now, when the situation is relatively stable. The election will give the new Government a fresh, five-year mandate to bring Singaporeans together to overcome this crisis.

We will fight COVID-19 as #SingaporeTogether. More than ever, we will need a government, with a strong mandate and a long runway, to lead us out of this crisis. We will face the challenges ahead together, working in partnership with you. We can and we will overcome this crisis of our generation, and emerge stronger as an economy, as a society and as one people.

With the switch from DORSCON Yellow to Orange, MOH has issued an infographic on precautions you should take to help contain the spread of 2019-nCoV. Just remember the 5Ms, practice them diligently and stay healthy!

Do share it with your friends and loved ones so that they are informed as well.

After a confirmed case was identified in Tampines East, Advisor @cheng_lihui went to the affected block to support the cleaning and sanitisation done by Tampines Town Council and @nea_sg officers. She also brought essential items to the family, as they are now quarantined. Together with my Tampines GRC advisors, we will continue to monitor and provide necessary assistance.

Over the weekend, we have been checking on the situation across Tampines ‚Äî was glad that our Tampines residents were calmly going about their daily lives after the panic buying incidents witnessed on Friday evening. Supermarket staff have worked long hours over the weekend to replenish stocks that were swept off the shelves as well as clean up the scenes of chaos left behind in some stores. I would like to assure Singaporeans that there is enough for everyone if we all only buy what we need. There is no need to build your own stockpile. Let us do our part, keep calm, and not let fear rule over our hearts and minds.

Amid reports of inconsiderate and racist behaviour, I am heartened by the Tampines Kindness Movement initiative for our healthcare workers who have been at the frontline providing professional medical care to the affected. There is currently a booth at @ourtampineshub that lets residents and visitors pen down messages of appreciation to our medical personnel.

If you are in the area, do show your support! Or you can share your encouragement and stories of good deeds by our people in the comments below, for all to read. Stay Calm, Stay Healthy, Stay Caring!

367,1381,"The 2019-novel coronavirus is a global public health challenge. I spoke to PRC Vice-Premier Han Zheng earlier today. I conveyed my condolences and sympathies to the families who have lost their loved ones to the outbreak, and to the communities in China which have been severely affected by the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

I reiterated to Vice-Premier Han that Singapore will continue to work closely with China and the international community to fight the virus ‚Äî  this includes preventing its further spread and developing better medical testing.

In times like this, with the longstanding special relationship between Singapore and China, it is also important for us to work together.

Singapore researchers have worked to develop diagnostic nCoV test kits for use in laboratories. We can contribute to China‚Äôs containment efforts by providing test kits to conduct 10,000 tests at the first instance, together with 3 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines. We will be providing another 10,000 tests in the next couple of weeks. Our scientific experts are also exchanging views with their counterparts in China.

Earlier this week, the @sgredcross, together with various trade associations and chambers, companies and local community organisations, launched a public appeal to raise funds to provide humanitarian assistance to the affected communities in China. The Singapore Government will also contribute $1 million in seed funding to this collective effort by Singaporeans.

Infectious diseases are transboundary in nature. Countries can only overcome this challenge by stepping up measures within each country, and by collaborating with one another.

Singapore will continue to do our part ‚Äî enhancing our safeguards as the situation evolves, and working with China and the international community to combat this outbreak.

I am confident we can overcome this challenge together.

In SG, we had not duly restricted air travel nor insisted on precautionary mask usage. By end February, masks were required and some expected a sort of lock-down - but meanwhile it was much business like usual. By the time the circuit-breaker was announced to be put into effect a fortnight later, there was already six weeks or more for MOM Enforcement unit to ensure the FW dorms and communal living supervisors will have implemented the same strict (if not stricter) norms than what was recommended for Singapore generally. This did not happen. The few cases seemingly from Mustafa then were reported and when testing - and only then - were implemented at the affected dormitories that the situation (of clusters erupting) became known as the data showed it had escalated prior to testing. The eventual handling was excellent but the cost of caring for the 50,000 odd infected, not to mention 'exposed' persons has yet to be revealed. The Opposition should call for an independent Public Inquiry into that matter, not for fault finding, but because it represents what has to be accepted as a real, known risk, as long as we have hundreds of thousands in this type of communal living, not to mention aged homes, student dormitories and the such.

It is a significant step. Most activities will resume, except certain larger scale ones with close interaction activities, that have potential to be mass spreading events. Social gatherings should have a maximum of five people. 
All the things we miss - sitting in coffeeshops or restaurants, bubble tea, tuition and enrichment classes, meeting up with boyfriends or girlfriends, can all resume. 
It took us a lot of sacrifice to get here, after a fairly long circuit breaker period, and a careful Phase 1 opening. But during this time, all of us co-operated, and we suppressed the virus transmission. 
From here, it is up to us again. We will all take care of our personal hygiene, adopt necessary precautionary measures, look out for one another. That way, we keep the virus under control in Phase 2. While we are all eager to meet up with friends and socialise, we will do so safely. No need to all rush out on Friday - everywhere will be full.

But the first step, on 2 Jun, should be a cautious one, to re-open schools safely. We will progressively bring back students to schools and Institutes of Higher Learning. 
How?

First, we will prioritise the return of those who need a higher level of care, like students in Special Education schools, as well as graduating cohorts who needs to prepare for national exams. 
Second, for students not in graduating cohorts, we will have a weekly rotation system so that different levels of students take turns to come to school and to do HBL. So for primary school, it will be P4 and P5 coming back to school and P1, P2, P3 doing HBL in week 1, and the reverse in Week 2. P6s will come back every day.

We aim to gradually have all students fully back in school after two cycles of weekly rotation, or four weeks.

We will also continue to support high needs students and children of parents who need to work and cannot find alternate childcare arrangement, and allow them to come to school on their HBL week. 
Many students will be excited to return to school. Parents may be looking forward to school opening too, especially if they have to return to work. But I am sure parents are also worried about their children√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s safety. Rest assured that we will take whatever precautions we can to ensure the well-being of all students and staff.
