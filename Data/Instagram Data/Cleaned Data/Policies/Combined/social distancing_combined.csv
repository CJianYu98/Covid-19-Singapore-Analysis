0,0,"It’s the final weekend before CNY, and also the final stretch before #SGBudget2021. Taking some time away from my Budget preparations, I joined my fellow East Coast Advisers yesterday to see how our residents and stallholders in East Coast are taking to the tighter safe management measures for the festive period. We also took the opportunity to distribute oranges and exchange greetings with people we met.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Glad to see residents in good spirits and getting ready for CNY, with groceries, flowers and bright decorations! Many appreciated the need for tighter safe management measures, such as a cap on the number of daily visitors each family can receive, given the global situation and the emergence of new, more contagious strains. Let us continue to do our part, to keep our loved ones and our friends and neighbours safe.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Thanks to all who came over to say hello to us, and to our many volunteers who helped with the visit.

I was most concerned about our elderly residents, and kept checking that they were keeping a safe distance and not having to queue for long. When I urged them to take care of their health during this time, many of them rattled off the safe management measures to me. They reminded me to eat and rest more, told me which colours I should wear more often! The less mobile seniors we visited in their homes were also quite cheerful. It is really good to see our seniors well and in good spirits. Hope they will continue to stay well, and we can all spend more time together when the situation allows.⁣

With the pandemic, this occasion has taken added meaning this year. We have had to adapt many of our social and religious norms as we fight COVID-19. As we gradually re-open, we must continue to observe safe management measures to prevent a second wave of infections.⁣

⁣
When schools reopened on 2 June, students had to adapt to new routines — wearing masks during class, staggered recess and dismissal times, and minimising intermingling among themselves. In these challenging times, COVID-19 has taught us and our children important life lessons — the importance of adaptability, resilience and an indomitable spirit.⁣
⁣
I hope that our children and families are making use of this short break to discover our little island, including exploring local attractions or going on staycations. There are also many wonderful spots in East Coast that you can explore — Changi Beach Park, Changi Village, Pulau Ubin, and East Coast Park just to name a few. But do check the visitorship levels using NParks’ safe distancing portal to avoid crowds: https://safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg.⁣
⁣
If you decide to head out, do continue to stay vigilant and exercise social responsibility — observe safe distancing, adopt safe entry and wear a mask. Have fun during your break!⁣

When schools reopened on 2 June, students had to adapt to new routines — wearing masks during class, staggered recess and dismissal times, and minimising intermingling among themselves. In these challenging times, COVID-19 has taught us and our children important life lessons — the importance of adaptability, resilience and an indomitable spirit.⁣

I hope that our children and families are making use of this short break to discover our little island, including exploring local attractions or going on staycations. There are also many wonderful spots in East Coast that you can explore — Changi Beach Park, Changi Village, Pulau Ubin, and East Coast Park just to name a few.

In these COVID-19 times, his family held a private funeral.

If there had been a wake, it would have included many younger entrepreneurs, partners and friends who have come to admire Mr Eng’s achievements, though not so many comrades of his age. You see, Mr Eng passed away at 102. When I last caught up with him, even as a centenarian, he was still going to work every day! His career — from working in a provision shop to being founder-chairman of Sin Heng Chan Group — is even older than our nation.

When the Japanese Occupation threw his first business into disarray, he took to selling garlic and onions by the roadside. He, and those of his generation, have braved many crises. Each time I spoke to him, I learnt something from his experiences and his attitude to life and business. He could take any hardship, he was always ready to find and make the most of opportunities even in crisis.

I trust that this never-say-die spirit lives on and stays strong in all of us. The community is also grateful for all he has done for the community. My deepest condolences to Mr Eng’s family.

I hope people understand that we must all do our part. As Kim Yong and @lawrencewongst pointed out in their Ministerial Statements today, all the measures we have in place will only be effective if we all do our part and are socially responsible. Our frontline healthcare workers, together with our public officers, are giving their all, working around the clock looking after patients, protecting Singapore and our people.

38,000 people are now serving their Stay Home Notices (SHN). Many of them have returned from countries that are hard hit by COVID-19. More will return in the coming days. We expect the number of new cases to go up.

@kshanmugam_ told the House of several cases of irresponsible behaviour — a few individuals who were on SHN were unwell, but still went to work and even participated in social gatherings. The police will be investigating these cases and those caught flouting their SHN will be charged in court.

Do your part — practise safe distancing, seek medical attention promptly if you do not feel well, stay at home if you are supposed to. Only when each of us does our part, can we protect our loved ones and the people around us.

1508,13,"In the recent two weeks, new cases and clusters have emerged. They are likely the result of increased activities over the year-end period (typically new cases present themselves with a 1-2 week lag). Our vulnerabilities have gone up, and we cannot afford to take any chances. The situation can escalate rapidly especially with Chinese New Year coming up soon. Remember cases spiked after CNY last year, and we had many clusters then linked to CNY activities and gatherings.

So we are making a pre-emptive move now to tighten our measures. Under the current rule, home visits are allowed for up to 8 visitors at any time. From 26 Jan onwards, we will limit such visits to 8 distinct visitors per household per day.  For those who are planning to go out visiting, we strongly advise that you minimise your physical gatherings. In particular over the CNY period, visit your family members only, and do not exceed more than two visits per day. 

When dining out, keep your masks on if you are not eating/drinking, and refrain from singing or talking loudly. So during the lohei, masks must remain on, and there should be no shouting of auspicious phrases. For reunion dinners, keep to one table of not more than 8 pax and ensure there are no multiple table bookings, or intermingling across tables. 

I know many will be disappointed at these new restrictions especially over the festive season. But I hope everyone understands why they are necessary. The virus is raging everywhere in the world. Many places in Asia that have successfully controlled the infection are now seeing a rise in cases. Places like China, Taiwan and Hong Kong have all imposed curbs on their CNY celebrations. 

Likewise, we must be mentally prepared that CNY this year will not be the same as before. It will be quieter and more subdued. We will need to stay disciplined and vigilant.

They are likely the result of increased activities over the year-end period (typically new cases present themselves with a 1-2 week lag). Our vulnerabilities have gone up, and we cannot afford to take any chances. The situation can escalate rapidly especially with Chinese New Year coming up soon. Remember cases spiked after CNY last year, and we had many clusters then linked to CNY activities and gatherings.

So we are making a pre-emptive move now to tighten our measures. Under the current rule, home visits are allowed for up to 8 visitors at any time. From 26 Jan onwards, we will limit such visits to 8 distinct visitors per household per day.  For those who are planning to go out visiting, we strongly advise that you minimise your physical gatherings. In particular over the CNY period, visit your family members only, and do not exceed more than two visits per day. 

When dining out, keep your masks on if you are not eating/drinking, and refrain from singing or talking loudly. So during the lohei, masks must remain on, and there should be no shouting of auspicious phrases. For reunion dinners, keep to one table of not more than 8 pax and ensure there are no multiple table bookings, or intermingling across tables.

But it has not been clear that the message now is that because of evidence of community spread, we are not to gather even in groups of less than ten for casual or recreational purposes. For instance, some think it is acceptable to go with a few friends to window shop to break the monotony of life, or to meet at a restaurant as long as there are not more than ten people, because the message that we should only go to malls on essential errands etc etc and its rationale are not loudly and clearly communicated to the public. People very much desire to cooperate at such a difficult time as this but because new implementations and advisories are ever so fast changing, I feel it is important to state loud and clear in plain terms and esp the rationale behind each stricter level of advisory.

Finally someone with ""great common sense"" is doing it. My question is : what are our human resources-rich Govt doing all this while ? What are our top civil servants doing ? What are our agencies EDB TDB A*STAR MTI doing all this while since Feb 18 when Minister Lawrence Wong was mooting with the idea of producing our own masks?. Dear Minister, you are a good & hardworking Minister. But a couple of million masks a month may not be enough. Can our Govt support Razer in (1) help him to expedite in setting up the factory with our ""Govt agencies"" rich resources and industrial contacts (2) our Govt to chip in and ramp up the production scale to at least 15  mil to 30 mil masks a month. This will help create some jobs too. This will help ""boost confidence"" if people are going out in public and our Govt to enforce ""All to Wear Masks"" when in public places, in view of the heightened risks as compared to Jan situation. Especially in MRTs, Buses, Supermarkets etc *News Recap 1 : ST 19 Feb : SINGAPORE - Singapore is looking for new sources of supply for masks and developing capabilities to manufacture them locally as other Asian countries clamp down on mask exports, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong has said.""In recent weeks, some places like Taiwan, Thailand and India have banned or tightened regulations on the export of masks,"" he said in a written parliamentary reply on Tuesday (Feb 18). *News Recap 2 : CNA 1 Apr : SINGAPORE: Singapore gaming company Razer announced plans on Wednesday (Apr 1) to set up an automated face mask manufacturing line within 30 days to produce ""a couple of million certified masks"" each month.

Set quota purchase by ID basis . Ask NTUC IT to do this. E.g. if S68xxxxxxx buy 2 sets of toilet rolls on 3 Apr, he can only buy another 2 sets say at least 1 week later. Once he makes a purchase, his ID and purchase data will be input by the cashiers / NTUC systems. * 2. Impose this measure : allocate say 60% of ALL your stock SOLELY for ONLINE PURCHASES. Why so ? Simple reason : enhanced distancing measures. If you dont believe, you can go to all NTUC outlets now. Now is 5 30 pm (3 Apr). (after PM Lee just gave his speech). All will scramble to panic buy. This is human behaviour everywhere in the world. This will result in ? Large crowd gatherings at NTUC outlets. This defeats the ""enhanced distancing measures"" purpose.  If there are large crowds formations due to panic buying, the community spread risks will increase (meaning more may be infected. Just like those large crowd religious gathering examples). This is extremely risky and dangerous. But why 60%stock allocation for online 40% for in-store? Cos there are people who dont know how to use computers/ go online etc .

I can see that you are working very hard as the Taskaforce Co-Chair,  so thank you for that. As a commoner, I cant formulate policies, I cant contribute much. As an indvidual, I can only help by being ""socially responsible"", which I have been doing since Jan. However, I feel that I can also contribute by giving feedback & suggestions, sharing world info with the Govt & etc. E.g. I shared this info : Japanese Flu drug Avigan was said by China doctors to be effective in the treatment. I am not a doctor, but no harm sharing this info for our medical experts to ""further look into it"". Bear in mind China rarely ""praises"" or ""give words of endorsements"" to Japanese-linked whatever. So today my feedback is : repeated many times. agreed by some in the public : daily MASKS wearing when going out is IMPORTANT for more effective containment. Singpost. It says they do ""daily precautionary checks with temp checking"". Was it very effective ?  After so many weeks, still think it worked like SARS ? All over the world, including ground zero China said carriers may not have fever for days even if they are infected. So, yes temp checking can keep out / contain some with obvious symptoms BUT fail to contain those infected for days without much symptoms such as fever. Is this so hard for our Govt to understand ? By enforcing everyone to wear masks when outside in the public help to minimize the transmission risks, especially from those without fever symptoms. China enforced this and was quite successful. So Singapore, why why why ? Is it because we have not enough masks ? Is making our masks Rocket Science ? Cant our Govt who just budgeted tens of $billions crisis $ allocate $30 mil to assemble a large masks assembly lines to produce a million masks a day ? Cant our Govt employ hundreds of unemployed / laid-offs to work in this mask factory ? An un-infected meeting an infected with both wearing masks = double protection. An un-infected meeting a silent infected with both not wearing masks = Disaster . Think about it. I always wonder what would Lee Kuan Yew do if he were tasked to handle this crisis ?  @leehsienloong @gankimyong @ongyekung @khawboonwan",2020-03-28 06:10:53+00:00,359,Social Distancing,365,4,-11.708318522874766,69,11,11,0.027048137420669617,0,0,1.0

If Singapore can quickly assemble a large assembly line(s) for making a million masks a day for Singapore use, by doing so will 1. More effective in our overall containment efforts 2. Create jobs for hundreds / thousands. With enough masks, if we enforce everyone to wear masks in public, this will surely, surely reduce the community transmission. Without such enforcements, silent virus carriers without much symptoms will continue with not wearing masks and move around in public, thus causing more infections. Then what will our Govt do ? More contacts tracing. After sometime, it will become almost impossible to do ""effective contact tracing"" and Singapore will then be at high risks of becoming the next Italy or Spain (sudden spikes in cases, exploded, healthcare system breakdown etc) This is highly possible if our Govt become complacent (means while doing good in some areas but also flawed / overlook in other areas) @leehsienloong @gankimyong @ongyekung @khawboonwan @teocheehean @lawrencewongst",2020-03-28 18:27:24+00:00,174,Social Distancing,178,4,-12.148450397706316,24,10,4,0.3736292368558014,0,0,1.0

"" Link :  https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3077345/coronavirus-why-so-few-infections-singapores-health (UNQUOTE) This article in some ways praised Singapore Govt and this will make many Singaporeans proud. However, there is one important info in this article : (QUOTE) "" Experts suggest this has been more than just luck, pointing to a case in which 41 health workers were exposed to the coronavirus in a Singapore hospital yet evaded infection.The workers had all come within two metres of a middle-aged man with Covid-19 who was being intubated, a procedure which involves a tube being inserted into the patient’s trachea. The procedure is seen as being particularly hazardous for health workers as it is “aerosol generating” – patients are likely to cough. The workers had not known at the time that the man had the virus and all were quarantined after he tested positive. However, on their release two weeks later, none of them had the virus. The case has come to widespread attention partly because the workers were wearing a mix of standard surgical masks and the N95 mask, which doctors see as the gold standard as it filters out 95 per cent of airborne particles. “That none of the health care workers in this situation acquired infection suggests that surgical masks, hand hygiene, and other standard procedures protected them from being infected.” (UNQUOTE) See the MAIN POINT  here? Strong Evidence: WEARING MASKS ARE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION. Govt must act fast to produce our own masks, enforce everyone in public to wear masks, this will surely help in the overall containment.

How China with more than 1 billion population managed to have some effective containment was mainly due to domestic provincianal borders control. E.g. they locked down Hubei province, think they also locked down Zhejiang province. Main point : Malaysia Covid-19 crisis situation seems to be getting worse. It would be wise if both countries Singapore and Malaysia work out together to extend the borders lockdown. Figures show that a few hundred thousands of people crossed the borders daily (to and fro). This is extremely dangerous if the infected in Malaysia are much more than what was reported in the news. A few hundred thousands daily crossingsof Malaysia Singapore borders. This is no joke. And our Govt must seriously look into this to avoid becoming the next Italy. Once exploded, no amount of contact tracing can help to do effective containment. Not even lockdown after ""exploded"". Chinese saying : ""No Health No Wealth"" Health comes 1st. When Singapore is still within control, economy though bad is still manageable. BUT if Singapore exploded like Italy, any lockdowns, any closure of public transport, our economy will be much much worse than current (already bad) situation. So our Govt most important task now : to prevent Singapore from becoming the next Italy. At all costs. And the next thing to look out for : borders control with Malaysia. @lawrencewongst @leehsienloong @khawboonwan @hengsweekeat @teocheehean @gankimyong @ongyekung @vivianbalakrishnan",2020-03-23 03:06:35+00:00,238,Social Distancing,240,4,-11.851427956994776,41,11,3,0.5037140043705373,0,0,1.0

ASEAN very likely will explode to become the new Epi Center if ASEAN Govts dont do containment as well as Korea or China.
