For example, in the construction sector, we will only re-start with a few projects and insist on very tight end-to-end safeguards for these projects. The safeguards include requiring all the workers involved in a project to be housed together (instead of being at multiple dormitories); safe distancing measures at the work sites; and periodic testing of the workers (at 2 week intervals). We expect only about 5% of the construction workforce to work on these projects, and will scale up over time as the industry gains confidence and experience with the measures. 
We will apply this same calibrated approach in how we resume normal activities, be it at work, schools, or in our social settings. In other words, don‚Äôt expect 100% resumption of activities after 1 June. On the contrary, be fully prepared that many of the current restrictions and measures we have today will continue for some time, so as to keep our family members and loved ones safe.

For those travel returnees on LOA, if they are infected and they go out to the public community, e.g. packed supermakets , packed hawker centres, packed mcdonald's, packed malls, there is a likelihood of an ""Uncontrollable BreakOut"" caused by these travel returnees on LOA who may be infected. If a hawker doing say popiah is being infected by the infected, and if she continues to roll her popiahs with some mild symptoms, and unaware consumers eat them, the chance of infection is there. If that happens, all these contact tracing apps will not be that relevant anymore. If Singapore becomes the next Italy, it will be ""too late"". Singapore will then be in a very disastrous situation. Economy will be 10X maybe 100X worse than the current bad situation. Bear in mind this : Singapore society is closely compact and one of the world's highest density population. Can you afford to close down all mrts and bus servicces like what China did. We must take a pre-emptive approach in anticipation of ""the worst possible scenario"" and instead of ""let's see how then react"" . The latter was what Italy , many European countries did. They waited to see how to react. When the crisis exploded suddenly and situation out of control, then they react. But, it was ""too late"" That is¬† fire fighting approach, not fire prevention. I worry a lot. For families, friends, fellow Singaporeans. Reason : Indonesia. I guess Indonesia will be the next Italy due to their ""reported behaviour e.g. attend large groupings even when their Govt bans them"" as well as ""their Govt citing high costs this high costs that even for Covid-19 testing for many of their potential patients"". Once Indonesia explodes like Italy, I dont think they can do containment as well as ""exploded Korea"".

Though it‚Äôs late, it‚Äôs the right move forward. Everyone should be treated as a suspect case and be tested upon arrival, and not just those who present symptoms at the border (which I believe is the protocol now). Mass testing has proven to be the tipping point for South Korea. We need to nip it in the bud - test, isolate, treat. Time is crucial, we can‚Äôt afford to wait for symptoms to show up then have patients present themselves at the hospital. If we can gift the Philippines with 3000 test kits surely we can do it for our fellow returnees? Also, at this point we should make it mandatory to wear mask. Wearing one is essential in the fight -  just look at China, Taiwan, SK, HK. ‚ÄúWear one only when you‚Äôre sick‚Äù is not medically correct at this point in time. Experts in China have said people shed virus even before symptoms are present. Only by wearing a mask can we protect ourselves and people around us. I know there‚Äôs a shortage of masks in Singapore which makes it unfortunate but we can use cloth recyclable masks or any home made ones. When everyone wears one, it doesn‚Äôt matter if one‚Äôs quality is better than another. It really has helped those countries in containment. That‚Äôs certain. But to tell people that healthy people don‚Äôt need to wear one is just plain wrong, pardon me for saying. I‚Äôm writing as a concerned Singaporean - we must look at the above countries and learn from them. My next worry is when Malaysia ends her lockdown and thousands of people start to cross the causeway into Singapore... since it‚Äôs been proven with our recent imported cases that most don‚Äôt show symptoms at the border (meaning temperature can no longer be used as a gauge), how then?

MOH have alr said dat numbers may continue to be high bef tapering down continuously, but dat doesn't mean dat the community is covid free, or yall start to get Complacent seeing low community numbers and go out more often as if covid is over. Cmon, the war is still very very far frm over. A vaccine may not conclude the end of covid, it may be here for up to 2 yrs, or maybe forever, just like seasonal flu, influenza and dengue. To those who are saying dat if u are vaccinated, u can start to be Complacent, by all means, do it urself. Don't drag ur friends or family to be Complacent with u, thinking dat u are totally immuned with covid. Wat if vaccine is not effective? And u start socialising with ppl dat may still be infected after being vaccinated? Cmon, its not the way to do things. WHO have said, dat covid may be here forever w/o a vaccine, and a vaccine is not a straight end to covid. Who knows swine flu is the nxt pandemic? If u think u can start going out more often like pre covid days and socialise as much as u want, then, the ICU ward for covid is reserved for u soon with a ventilator.

I do not follow and do not wear the mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide another cancer causing agent. When the commuters coughed very badly I did not fall sick! I keep seeing the public areas are disinfect! You are making the population inhale poison! Before you can solve COVID 19, you are creating more health problems! Such stupidity will cause astronomical increase in chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases! This is the fallacy of science that always embrace man-made chemicals! Science created the superbugs, the mutated viruses without realising it and fail to subdue. The next foolish move will be to develop another vaccine. History always repeats itself! Humans are killed by ignorance foolishness and self-inflicted harm! This generation should stop repeating the same errors as our predecessors! To err is human; to err repeatedly is inhuman and if I may add, pure stupidity!üá∏üá¨",2020-03-20 22:33:43+00:00,217,Stay Home Notice,222,4,-11.92546739267035,56,11,6,0.8014811859036169,0,1,1.0

They have been maintaining close to zero infection rates and strong control measures, so the risk of importation is low. They will be able to enter #Singapore from 18 Dec without SHN.

We have earlier opened to Australia, Brunei, Mainland China, New Zealand and Vietnam. Some 4,000 general travellers have entered Singapore since we started unilateral opening in September, and all had tested negative for COVID-19.

Taiwan has recently classified Singapore as a low risk country and reduced the quarantine for essential and business travellers from Singapore to five days.

With the festive period, I hope the reopening arrangements will be useful for families and loved ones to reunite.",2020-12-11 07:25:48+00:00,"Dear Minister Ong, this is definitely a good news.

These are countries which have low COVID-19 incidence rates and strong surveillance programmes, with risk profiles similar to Singapore.

The number of visitors coming from these places are not large - 602 so far, and all have tested negative.

And we are discussing an Air Travel Bubble with Hong Kong. This is a first of its kind arrangement in the world, between two aviation hubs, for all travellers and replacing quarantine with testing. We expect it to start in Nov 2020.
