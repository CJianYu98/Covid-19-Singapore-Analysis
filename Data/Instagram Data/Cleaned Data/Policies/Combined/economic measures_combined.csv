"What we have dreaded all these months has happened. 

SIA will be reducing its global workforce. Some 2,400 staff based in Singapore and overseas will be affected, the vast majority being foreigners. Factoring in hiring freezes and early retirements, SIA will be reducing total workforce by 4,300.

We know how badly SIA is hit by COVID-19. Over the past few months, Government has rolled out support measures, including the Jobs Support Scheme, to defray business costs and protect jobs. The aviation sector received the strongest support. SIA has also raised significant capital with the support of its majority shareholder. They have delayed this workforce reduction as long as they can, but with air travel decimated by COVID-19, this has unfortunately become inevitable.

The workers affected, are the same people we see at the airport, ensuring we board our planes efficiently and on time; the cabin crew in their suits and kebaya that have become a symbol of pride for Singapore; and those whose assuring voices we hear over the aircraft public announcement system, often telling us to belt up, for there would be turbulence.

Government will do all we can to support the affected workers. We will work with @ntucsingapore and industry partners to place the workers in jobs, help them transit to other industries, or enrol them in suitable industry attachment and traineeship programmes. I am sure their skills are much needed elsewhere too. More importantly, we will continue to press on, to restore air travel in a safe manner, to get SIA planes back up in the sky, and revive our air hub.

"What we have dreaded all these months has happened. 

SIA will be reducing its global workforce. Some 2,400 staff based in Singapore and overseas will be affected, the vast majority being foreigners. Factoring in hiring freezes and early retirements, SIA will be reducing total workforce by 4,300.

We know how badly SIA is hit by COVID-19. Over the past few months, Government has rolled out support measures, including the Jobs Support Scheme, to defray business costs and protect jobs. The aviation sector received the strongest support. SIA has also raised significant capital with the support of its majority shareholder. They have delayed this workforce reduction as long as they can, but with air travel decimated by COVID-19, this has unfortunately become inevitable.

The workers affected, are the same people we see at the airport, ensuring we board our planes efficiently and on time; the cabin crew in their suits and kebaya that have become a symbol of pride for Singapore; and those whose assuring voices we hear over the aircraft public announcement system, often telling us to belt up, for there would be turbulence.

Government will do all we can to support the affected workers. We will work with @ntucsingapore and industry partners to place the workers in jobs, help them transit to other industries, or enrol them in suitable industry attachment and traineeship programmes. I am sure their skills are much needed elsewhere too.

"@cdac_sg had our first ever virtual Annual General Meeting earlier. It was good to see everyone again, even if through a screen. 
In 2019, we made purposeful changes to our assistance schemes, to better help families break out of the cycle of hardship. Last year, 17,000 households benefitted from CDAC√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s programmes and schemes. 
The outlook is grimmer this year because of COVID-19. To support more families in need, CDAC has enhanced subsidies and raised income ceilings of its assistance schemes.

"The Government has provided an additional grant to Self-help Groups to help vulnerable households. CDAC will receive $5 million of this additional grant this year, and it will be channelling the full amount to support needy families with young children. 
This will comprise a three-tier grant. 
First, 10,000 families currently benefiting from CDAC programmes will receive a one-time $300 grant to help defray their children√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s educational expenses. 
Second, for needy families that need more help, CDAC has re-opened its 2020 bursary application for primary and secondary students till end May, so more can apply. Up to 5,000 needy post-secondary students are expected to receive a $720 education grant; twice the number of recipients last year.  These families and students will also be invited to the CDAC Ready for School project at the end of the year to receive additional support, such as vouchers for transport and school supplies. 
Third, for workers who are retrenched, CDAC will provide a one-time financial support for their family.

But this Budget‚Äôs central focus is on how we ‚Äì all of us ‚Äì can emerge stronger from this crisis ‚Äì as an economy, as a society, and as one people. The Budget builds on the support that we provided in earlier Budgets, and the shared values that we stand for as Singaporeans. The investments that we are making this year and in the years ahead will put us on a stronger path to create a shared future for all.‚Å£
‚Å£
Having debated our Ministries‚Äô plans to emerge stronger from COVID-19, the focus will now be on galvanising collective action to turn policies and resources into action. As one of our founding fathers Mr S. Rajaratnam said, Singapore must be a ‚Äúdemocracy of deeds‚Äù. We will ensure that the funds are used well, to achieve maximal outcomes. More importantly, we will rally Singaporeans to work together, as we navigate the winds of change and waves of opportunities, to thrive in a post-COVID world.‚Å£

"Emerging stronger as an economy is a key focus of Budget 2021. Our economic agencies are giving their best to ensure that our workers and companies can adapt and thrive in a post-COVID world. MTI and MOM presented these plans at the Committee of Supply debate in Parliament yesterday and today.¬†¬†

While we can debate the specifics of each scheme, we must never forget the big picture: how do we develop a vibrant economy that can provide all Singaporean workers with a better life? Uplifting our workers, and in particular our lower wage workers, remains the highest priority for this Government.

This is why in October last year, I encouraged Minister @joteo.ylm to work with NTUC Secretary General @ng.chee.meng and the President of the Singapore National Employers Federation Dr Robert Yap to set up a Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers.¬†¬†

I am happy that the workgroup has developed a roadmap for a major expansion of the Progressive Wage Model, by extending to sectors such as food services and retail. In the short term, this will more than double the PWM‚Äôs coverage from the existing 85,000 workers to 218,000 workers. Our ambition is to have some form of PWM in the longer-term for all sectors in Singapore.¬†

As we continue to transform our economy to emerge stronger from this crisis, let us do so together, and leave no worker behind.¬†¬†

"What do you hope to achieve with the Emerging Stronger Together Budget? This question was posed to me by a youth at the East Coast Conversation yesterday, which was centered on #SGBudget2021.‚Å£
‚Å£
I explained to him that the Budget Statement was our strategic plan for the future. We are seeking not just to tackle immediate challenges, but to also enable our people and companies to emerge stronger from this crisis. And key to this is how we are able to work together and bring the best out of each other.‚Å£
‚Å£
The discussion covered a wide range of issues, from jobs and the economy, to household support, to GST and Electric Vehicles. I am glad that many understood the difficult choices that had to be made. Together, we can resolve to tackle the challenges from COVID-19 and secure a brighter future for Singapore in the post-pandemic world.‚Å£

"Drawing on Past Reserves for the 2nd year in a row was a difficult decision. The discipline of balancing budgets is the cornerstone of our financial resilience.‚Å£
‚Å£
Early in the crisis, I sought the President‚Äôs approval to draw on the Reserves to deal decisively with the crisis, to save lives and livelihoods. As we enter the 2nd year of this crisis, we continue to tackle immediate challenges and provide targeted support to hard-hit sectors. Taken together, we expect to draw up to $53.7b in FY2020-2021.‚Å£
‚Å£
In my Budget Statement, I explained that if economic recovery progresses on track, we expect to fund the expenditures for the remainder of this term of Government without having to further draw on Reserves. But the global outlook is highly uncertain, and we must be prepared for a scenario where recovery is bumpier and takes much longer.‚Å£
‚Å£
If the economic and fiscal situations turn out to be worse than expected, we should still stay the course to invest for the longer term to emerge stronger. In such a scenario, how then do we continue to ensure good fiscal discipline?‚Å£
‚Å£
This issue is not unique to Singapore. Some countries have legislatively binding debt ceilings.¬†In Germany, known for its fiscal rectitude, the issue of further suspension of the ‚Äòdebt brake‚Äô was hotly debated.‚Å£
‚Å£
If the situation worsens, we may need to approach the President for a further draw on Past Reserves to continue funding investments that will enable Singapore to emerge stronger in the midst of this unprecedented crisis. We should then think hard about how we can ensure that if we need to draw on Past Reserves for this purpose, we can, over time, build this back.‚Å£
‚Å£
We have benefited during this crisis from the prudence and long-term orientation of previous generations.¬†We owe it to future generations to exercise this prudence and ensure they can deal with future crises. I will say more at my Round-Up Speech.‚Å£

‚Å£
There was also keen interest on our green plans, including green financing and whether we could further accelerate our shift to electric vehicles.‚Å£
‚Å£
If we continue to have a can-do spirit, maintain our openness to the world, and tackle our long-term challenges head-on, we can build a bright future for everyone.‚Å£

DPM Heng: I have committed a total of $107 billion in FY2021 under the Emerging Stronger Together Budget, to address the near-term challenges and to enable us to emerge stronger from this crisis. 
 
In the immediate term, we expect to run a fiscal deficit to support targeted relief, considering the unprecedented impact of COVID-19. The President has given her in-principle support for the proposed draw of up to $11 billion on Past Reserves in FY2021. The total expected draw on Past Reserves over FY2020 and FY2021 will be up to $53.7 billion. 
 
Our fiscal situation is expected to be tighter in the coming years. But beyond this crisis, we must return to running balanced budgets. 
 
Our people rallied together, to support one another during this crisis. The past year showed that our values as a people matter ‚Äî the values of unity, resilience, solidarity, and fortitude.
 
Let us strive to emerge stronger together, as a united and shining red dot, trusted by all.

A cheerful senior in his 70s recently came up to me in Bedok. He smiled and asked if I would be giving out any ‚Äúhongbaos‚Äù for Budget.

"Visited @rasasentosa today with @ntucsingapore Sec-Gen @ng.chee.meng. We came here a year ago when COVID-19 first hit our shores, and wanted to see how the team at Rasa Sentosa was coping. Glad to hear that they have adapted, and faced the crisis with fortitude and resilience. They told me how the support measures rolled out last year have helped them.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
What we see here at Rasa Sentosa is also taking place at other hotels and in other sectors. The @mof_sg has just released an interim analysis on the impact of the Government's COVID-19 support measures. You can read the full report here: https://go.gov.sg/mofinterimreport

&nbsp;
CDCs play a very important role in supporting the vulnerable by coming up with local programmes to complement national schemes. Each CDC has its own programmes, but they also work closely together. Since COVID-19, our CDCs have collaborated together and with the community to launch more than 100 initiatives. The CDC Vouchers Scheme is one such example.
&nbsp;
CDC vouchers have benefited almost 350,000 households and more than 8,100 participating merchants to date. During this challenging period, household expenses will continue to weigh on the minds of many families. So we have decided to commit an additional $20 million for a second tranche of vouchers.

A big thank you to our CDCs and to all our community partners. This is the spirit of #SingaporeTogether. I continue to encourage our CDCs to find new ways to build stronger partnerships with our community, hawkers and merchants.

"The Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) was first introduced in 2013 to co-fund wage increases given by employers to Singaporean workers. This encourages businesses which have undergone transformation to share the gains with their workers. We enhanced the scheme at Budget 2020, increasing the Government co-funding levels for 2019 and 2020 qualifying wage increases to 20% and 15% respectively. This year, the WCS paid out over $1 billion to more than 95,000 employers.
 
I know this has been a difficult time for many firms. But for those that are doing well and are reaping the fruits of your business transformation, I hope you are also upskilling your workers, creating better opportunities for them, and raising their wages commensurately. 
 
The next WCS payment will be made in March 2021, based on wage increases in 2020. Employers ‚Äî do remember to make contributions to your employees‚Äô CPF accounts by 14 Jan 2021 to be eligible. You can refer to the @mof_sg and IRAS press release for more details: go.gov.sg/wcsmar2021.

Science, technology and innovation will be critical to overcoming COVID-19, and in enabling us to emerge stronger. So we must stay the course and sustain our investments in research, innovation and enterprise, despite economic cycles.‚Å£
‚Å£
Singapore is committed to invest about 1% of our GDP in RIE each year, for the next five years. This is similar to our commitment to earlier research plans. In dollar terms, we are allocating $25billion for RIE2025.‚Å£
‚Å£
We remain committed to investing in basic research, and will set aside one-third of the overall budget to do so. We have also expanded the scope of RIE into human potential and sustainability. Our investment in human potential will improve prenatal and early childhood development, strengthen lifelong learning, and enable our seniors to remain healthy and active for as long as possible.‚Å£
‚Å£
At the same time, we will pursue sustainability in a broader way ‚Äì to help us achieve our climate change commitments, and strengthen food resilience and biodiversity in our dense urban environment.‚Å£
‚Å£
Given the rapid pace of change and our evolving needs, we structured RIE2025 to give us greater ability and nimbleness by not allocating all the monies upfront. This will enable us to swiftly deploy unallocated funds to respond to emerging priorities and changes in the coming years.‚Å£

This year‚Äôs JCBC is of special significance as we mark 30 years of diplomatic relations and also convened the meeting despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19.

Our substantive agenda this year reflects the strength of our cooperation. We added a new agenda item ‚Äî public healthcare cooperation. This is timely given the pandemic, and as we tackle the common challenge of our ageing populations. 

To recover from this crisis, Vice Premier Han and I also discussed how to strengthen connectivity between Singapore and China. We expressed willingness to discuss ideas to open up borders, and restore normal people-to-people exchanges, at an appropriate time. 

We also reviewed the good progress made by our three Government-to-Government projects in Suzhou, Tianjin and Chongqing, as well as the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City and Singapore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative.

As a regional trade, finance and logistics hub, Singapore can contribute to China‚Äôs ‚Äúdual circulation‚Äù strategy ‚Äî to develop its domestic economy while deepening its linkages with other economies.
 
Economic cooperation will also create opportunities for our workers and businesses, as we grow our industries as part of our Industry Transformation Maps. We must press on with economic transformation and building deeper economic cooperation. 
 
I look forward to building stronger ties with China, and to co-chairing the 17th JCBC with Vice Premier Han next year.

This is the world‚Äôs first week-long round-the-clock hybrid digital and physical event, involving some 60,000 participants and partners from over 40 cities. COVID-19 might have thrown the world a curveball. But this event is one example of how we innovated to cope with the virus.
 
The pandemic has created a unity of purpose across the world, from Silicon Valley to Shenzhen. Technology and innovation played a crucial role in our response to the crisis. They will also be critical in curtailing the pandemic and boosting economic recovery. Our commitment to innovation and to work together will be key to driving economic recovery and growth. In Singapore, we continue to deepen our tech capabilities. Today, I launched the Asian Institute of Digital Finance and the Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme.
 
In my speech at the opening of SFF X SWITCH, I also highlighted the need to use technology and innovation in a way that will build a future that is more inclusive and sustainable. I also emphasised the importance of creating a more resilient global commons as the foundation for a post-COVID future. One aspect is stronger governance on how data is shared. In Singapore, we launched the Singapore Financial Data Exchange today. This new approach to trusted data sharing pioneered by the Exchange can potentially be applied to other areas and jurisdictions.

"With the COVID-19 situation in Singapore stabilising, we can now gradually re-open our borders and resume activities safely.

Resuming general air travel to cities with low incidences of COVID-19 is key to restoring our global connectivity, and to reviving our aviation, aerospace and tourism sectors. Many jobs and businesses are at stake. 

Yesterday, @ongyekung announced the launch of the Singapore-Hong Kong Air Travel Bubble. This scheme will start with one flight of up to 200 travellers into each city daily and will be expanded over time if the arrangement works well. Travellers to Singapore will be tested before they fly and are expected to use the TraceTogether app or token.

This is an important step, as we move towards a new normal for air travel. We look forward to welcoming more visitors at @changiairport and more @singaporeair planes in the skies.

As we open up our borders and head towards Phase 3, we must continue to expand our testing capacity, strengthen contact tracing and remain vigilant. This way, we can gradually resume a sense of normalcy while keeping out new waves of infections.

"Over the past two days, many MPs took to the floor to debate my Ministerial Statement. I thank Members for sharing their views, ideas and support.

There was extensive debate on our economy. I set out the broad strokes of our economic strategy in my Ministerial Statement. And as we emerge from the worst of the crisis, we must redouble our efforts to help our companies transform and our workers upskill.

Unlike other countries, Singapore is both a city and a nation. Managing this unique dual identity will be critical to our success. Stay open to the world while forging our own identity. Stay globally connected while remaining independent. Embracing diversity while being socially cohesive. This dual identity has also enabled us to stay nimble in our fight against COVID-19.

Members also made many points on our fiscal situation. There continues to be great uncertainty on how the pandemic will evolve and the course of economic recovery. We all want to ensure Singapore is here for the long haul. So we must continue to spend in a principled and prudent way, and hand over to our children more than what we inherited from previous generations.

Our fight against COVID-19 is far from over. But I am confident that as long as we stay open and united as well as retain our core values, we will emerge stronger as a cohesive and resilient nation.

"I have been meeting our business leaders and workers regularly. Yesterday, ahead of my upcoming Ministerial Statement, my colleagues and I met up with some of our SMEs in the morning. Together with @ntucsingapore Secretary-General @ng.chee.meng we also met union leaders as well as career coaches with @workforcesingapore in the afternoon.
 
Since we announced that I will be making a Ministerial Statement next Monday, some people have asked if more support was on the way. I took the opportunity to explain to some of our participants that there will not be a new round of support measures. The main purpose of my upcoming Ministerial Statement is to provide context for the Supplementary Supply Bill that will allocate resources for the measures announced in August.
 
At this stage of the crisis, my team and I are fully committed to support our workers and businesses by refining our policies, expanding outreach and improving implementation, to make the most of the $100 billion committed to the fight against COVID-19. We hope that businesses and workers can make the best use of the measures that have been committed

"Opened the FutureChina Global Forum 2020 this afternoon. The theme for this year is on how Singapore can contribute to China‚Äôs and ASEAN‚Äôs growth and build a more resilient future. 

I shared that countries must remain open and connected to the world and undertake adjustments so that globalisation works for them. Singapore can do its part by strengthening connectivity with the region. And in an era of tremendous change, businesses must forge new partnerships to emerge stronger from this crisis. You can read my speech here: https://go.gov.sg/fcgf.

This year marks thirty years of Singapore-China diplomatic relations. Next year, we will commemorate three decades of China-ASEAN dialogue. However, our ties go way back. More than a thousand years ago, there was already a vibrant trading network between China and Southeast Asia, and between our region and the world. 

This trading network and the bonds of our peoples have been resilient, ebbing and flowing over the last ten centuries. With such strong foundations, I am confident that we can emerge from this pandemic to a brighter and more resilient future for our peoples and for the world.

"Amidst the weaker hiring climate, there are some bright spots. The latest Jobs Situation Report by MOM on Monday showed that 2 in 5 workers retrenched in Q1 found jobs in June. The Jobs Growth Incentive is also expected to create more opportunities, especially for mature jobseekers.
 
When I met jobseekers and employers at the Trade and Connectivity Career Discovery Job Fair last Friday, together with Secretary-General @ng.chee.meng and his team at @ntucsingapore ‚Äî many were understandably concerned about the future. The jobseekers I met were resilient, looking to adapt and take on new roles. Two of them were ICT professionals ‚Äî who lost their jobs when their projects could not proceed due to the economic uncertainty. They were exploring job opportunities in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that were on offer at the Fair.
 
Despite the economic situation, I am glad that some companies are doing well and still hiring. @ilovee2i and @skillsfuturesg career coaches were on site to help our jobseekers. One lady, who lost her job in marketing at a MNC, decided to try a new area that more directly helped others. She discussed her options with an e2i career coach and told me that the coach gave her good advice.
 
So far this year, e2i, @workforcesingapore, and their partners have helped place at least 25,000 jobseekers, while providing career advisory and job search assistance to more than 35,000. I am glad that the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package is helping our workers and businesses, and our strong tripartite partnership is working well to help us weather this crisis and emerge stronger.

"How can we best ensure the survival and success of Singapore, and improve the lives of Singaporeans in these unprecedented times? Adapt to change, but stay true to our values. 
 
I spoke in Parliament today about how we must adapt as an economy and as a society, while affirming our values as a people. By embracing change with courage and confidence, we build our capacity to adapt. By staying true to our values, we strengthen our sense of common purpose. By working in close partnership, we advance as Singapore Together. You can read my speech here: go.gov.sg/debatespeech.
 
Change is also taking place in Parliament, as we welcome 31 newly elected MPs. I look forward to hearing from them in this debate. I also expressed my appreciation to the MPs who have retired, and the NCMPs who have stepped down. The longest serving is Goh Chok Tong (@mparader_), who has served for nearly 45 years, including almost 14 years as Prime Minister. Among those who have retired are my ex-bosses at MTI, @khawboonwan and Lim Hng Kiang. I also thanked Low Thia Khiang, who has served as an opposition MP since 1991. Another change we are seeing is the new role of Leader of the Opposition. I congratulate @pritamsingh76 on his appointment and trust that he will continue to put our national interest first.
 
To all my Parliamentary colleagues, Singaporeans have elected us as their representatives. We must put our minds and efforts together, resolve to each do our best to serve Singaporeans and Singapore, so that we can emerge stronger from this test of a generation.

"I spoke about how the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many businesses in my Ministerial Statement on Monday. Companies that have remained agile and invested in innovation have been able to pivot to new opportunities during this crisis.
 
I visited one such company ‚Äî Forefront Medical Technology (FMT) ‚Äî today. Forefront Medical, a precision engineering company, has been actively venturing into new business lines even before the pandemic. Originally focused on making medical products for drug delivery and respiratory care, they started building up automation capabilities, adding cleanroom capacity and growing their local talent pool.
 
When COVID-19 struck, Forefront Medical expanded into manufacturing products for COVID-19 diagnostics, including the production of swabs. Forefront Medical also hired 80 more staff to meet the increase in production demand.
 
Even in the midst of the crisis, there are still pockets of growth. There are many other companies like Forefront Medical, which are growing and hiring. The Jobs Growth Incentive, which I announced on Monday, will support these companies in increasing their local workforce, with more support for our mature workers. And we hope to better match jobseekers to these new opportunities.
 
In this fast-changing environment, all of us ‚Äî businesses, workers and governments ‚Äî will have to remain nimble and quickly adapt. We are in this together, and by working with one another, we can emerge from this crisis stronger.",2020-08-19 15:11:09+00:00,productive event n connections forged to a better nation,2020-08-20,9,Economic Measures,9,0,-11.839124253817936,1,0,0,156.96129294150037,4,0,0.0
"This afternoon, I outlined how the Government will continue and evolve our support for our workers and businesses.

The COVID-19 pandemic rages on in many parts of the world, and the global economy remains very weak. The Government will continue to help our workers and businesses through this crisis.

‚Ä¢ First, we will continue to protect jobs by extending the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for up to seven months. We will adjust the level of support based on the pace of recovery of the different sectors. Most businesses will receive wage support for 17 months in total, up to March 2021.

‚Ä¢ Second, we will encourage businesses that are growing to hire and increase their local workforce, through the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI).

‚Ä¢ Third, we will continue to help those who have fallen on hard times, by extending the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) till Dec 2020. We are also studying how to continue supporting vulnerable employees and self-employed persons beyond 2020.

In addition, we are also providing additional targeted support for sectors that are hardest-hit, such as aerospace, aviation and tourism. We will also strengthen our transformation efforts to capture new opportunities, create better jobs, and reimagine our economy.

The measures announced today will cost $8 billion. We intend to fully fund them by reallocating funds from expenditures that have been delayed due to COVID-19. There are no plans to draw on Past Reserves for these measures, beyond what was approved earlier.

The situation continues to change very rapidly. We must continue to remain nimble and adapt as the pandemic progresses, and will further evolve our support if required. We have also started preparation for #Budget2021.

We are faced with an extraordinary crisis, but we are one people with extraordinary courage, commitment, and can-do spirit. We can beat this crisis as one people, and emerge stronger as a nation.

"I will be making a Ministerial Statement next Monday on how we will continue our support for workers and businesses during this crisis.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues unabated in many parts of the world. Since May, the total number of cases has tripled to 20 million. The global economy has taken a very severe hit, and the situation could get worse.
 
In Singapore, we experienced our worst quarterly GDP performance on record in the second quarter. We have provided significant support for workers and businesses with almost $100 billion over four Budgets, with more than half coming from our Past Reserves. However, given the global economic and health crisis, we are likely to see more job losses and retrenchments in the coming months, and it will be many more months before our economy recovers fully. Even then, it will not be back to business as usual.
 
As we gradually re-open our economy, the recovery across industries is likely to be uneven and uncertain. Many sectors are gradually regaining their footing as economic activities resume. A few sectors are growing and even hiring. But several sectors have been very hard-hit and are unlikely to recover for some years to come.
 
Over the past few weeks, many people have shared with me their anxieties and concerns about their livelihoods. Weighing on their minds was also the uncertainty ahead, given that some of the support schemes are expiring. I will be providing more details on how we will evolve and extend our support for our companies and our workers in my Ministerial Statement on Monday.
 
We will continue to support our workers and firms through this crisis. But we are not able to sustain the same level of support indefinitely. As more sectors re-open gradually, we will have to evolve and taper the support provided. We will continue to provide targeted support to sectors that are hardest hit, including helping them pivot to new opportunities in growth areas. 
 
We are committed to walk this difficult journey with you. Together, we can overcome this crisis and emerge stronger as one people.

"Met up with business and union leaders over the last two days, together with @joteo.ylm, @lowyenling.sg, and @ng.chee.meng.‚Å£
‚Å£
Our discussion took place against the backdrop of our worst quarterly GDP performance on record. The economic situation is severe. The road to economic recovery will be long, and the impact on our labour market could further deepen. We discussed the effectiveness of the support measures rolled out in the last few months, which has helped companies keep workers employed.‚Å£
‚Å£
Some support schemes, such as the Jobs Support Scheme, are ending soon. Participants acknowledged that these schemes cannot continue indefinitely, but asked how support for our businesses and workers will change in the coming months. I assured them of our continued commitment to support our workers and companies. I have also been having intensive discussions with our agencies to review and evolve our schemes as the situation develops.‚Å£
‚Å£
Despite the challenges, it was uplifting to hear how some of them have coped with the crisis. Some are pivoting away from their current businesses to new areas that played to their core strengths. Many have accelerated their digitalisation plans and are offering more services online. Some are sourcing for opportunities abroad through online business engagements. In the process, they are also reskilling their workers and redesigning jobs to take on these new opportunities. There were also many ideas on how we can work better in tripartite partnership during this crisis, including helping our people build new skills and adapt to the post-COVID world.‚Å£
‚Å£
Overall, the gravity of our economic situation weighed heavily on the minds of our business and union leaders. But in the midst of this crisis, I am heartened that they saw opportunities and possibilities. The road ahead will be tough, but with determination and a spirit of enterprise and collaboration, we can come out of this crisis stronger.‚Å£

"This morning, I visited the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centre at Kampong Chai Chee CC @ Heartbeat Bedok with Minister @joteo.ylm and MOS @kiathowsg. We spoke to jobseekers and career ambassadors from @workforcesingapore to better understand their needs and challenges. This is one of eight such Centres across the island, with new locations coming up soon.

The latest employment numbers show that the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market has deepened, but we have avoided a spike in unemployment because of the support measures provided over the four Budgets.

The National Jobs Council has been working closely with industry partners and @ntucsingapore to create jobs, traineeships and skills training opportunities for our people under the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. We have made good progress. So far, 18,000 job placements have been completed through the SGUnited Jobs Initiative. Another 65,000 jobs, traineeship and training places have also been committed.

In particular, we have received overwhelming support from our companies for SGUnited Traineeships. 6,400 companies have expressed interest to host over 35,000 traineeships. This is more than what we have expected, and we will be opening up the traineeships to mid-career individuals. This will provide more options for our jobseekers and companies, and improve their chances of finding good job matches when the eventual upswing happens.

I urge companies who are doing well to make full use of the tools under the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), to grow and to hire more workers. And I encourage jobseekers to keep an open mind and embrace the spirit of learning.

By working together, we can emerge stronger as an economy and as one people.

"During this period of economic uncertainty, many of our workers are going through a tough time. Our lower-income workers in particular, have less to fall back on.

As part of the Resilience Budget, I announced the Workfare Special Payment totalling $1.2 billion to help our lower-income workers. Around 400,000 lower-income Singaporean workers on Workfare will each receive $3,000 in cash to further help them with their expenses. They will receive half the payout in July, and the second half in October.

Workfare provides a wage supplement to our lower-income workers ‚Äî a top-up of up to 30% of their salaries. Through a combination of cash and CPF top-ups, we help these workers with their immediate needs and also with their retirement adequacy.

An integral part of Workfare is the additional support for training. Taken together with @skillsfuturesg and the Progressive Wage Model, we have a strong ecosystem of support to uplift our lower-wage workers in a sustainable way.

At a time when many workers around the world are experiencing wage stagnation, our lower-wage workers have experienced strong real wage growth ‚Äî averaging more than 4% per year in the last five years, faster than the growth in median wages. We can and we will continue to invest in and support our lower-wage workers, so that they can continue to learn and grow. 

Our commitment to Singaporeans is that even as we create new opportunities, we will ensure no one will be left behind by progress. We will enable every worker to make a better living, as long as they are willing to work hard. 

You can refer to the @mof_sg press release for details on the Workfare Special Payment: go.gov.sg/workfarespecialpayment.

As part of the Resilience Budget, I announced the Workfare Special Payment totalling $1.2 billion to help our lower-income workers. Around 400,000 lower-income Singaporean workers on Workfare will each receive $3,000 in cash to further help them with their expenses. They will receive half the payout in July, and the second half in October.

Workfare provides a wage supplement to our lower-income workers ‚Äî a top-up of up to 30% of their salaries. Through a combination of cash and CPF top-ups, we help these workers with their immediate needs and also with their retirement adequacy.

An integral part of Workfare is the additional support for training. Taken together with @skillsfuturesg and the Progressive Wage Model, we have a strong ecosystem of support to uplift our lower-wage workers in a sustainable way.

At a time when many workers around the world are experiencing wage stagnation, our lower-wage workers have experienced strong real wage growth ‚Äî averaging more than 4% per year in the last five years, faster than the growth in median wages. We can and we will continue to invest in and support our lower-wage workers, so that they can continue to learn and grow.

"By bringing the best of everyone together, we can be much greater than the sum of our parts. This is especially true in times of crisis, and if we are to emerge stronger as an economy in a post-COVID world. Success will require stronger partnerships across all stakeholders and across our entire economy.

To spur greater collaboration in critical areas for our businesses, we will be launching a series of seven National Innovation Challenges today on our Open Innovation Network. These challenges range from how we can strengthen productivity of our air and shipping sectors, to how we can safely re-open our construction, tourism and MICE activities. You can find out more here: www.openinnovationnetwork.sg/national-innovation-challenges.

Through these efforts, we also hope to build a stronger culture of innovation here in Singapore ‚Äî among individuals, companies, trade associations, research and academic institutions, and the Government. In an increasingly complex and uncertain world, our ability to work together and innovate will give us an edge in seeking opportunities at home and abroad. Our strengths at home will enable us to contribute to the global community.

By working as #SingaporeTogether, we can emerge stronger from this crisis. Not just as an economy, but also as a society and one people.

We hope our seniors can embrace and adopt technology effectively. To bridge the digital gap, the Government will provide more support, and work with businesses and the community to help our seniors learn digital skills to stay socially connected. One such example is the Mobile Access for Seniors scheme. Eligible lower-income seniors can purchase a basic smartphone from $20 and subsidised mobile plan. This will help to address concerns about cost among seniors and encourage them to go digital.
 
Let us continue to work together to secure our future.

To bridge the digital gap, the Government will provide more support, and work with businesses and the community to help our seniors learn digital skills to stay socially connected. One such example is the Mobile Access for Seniors scheme. Eligible lower-income seniors can purchase a basic smartphone from $20 and subsidised mobile plan.

"The Government continues to govern during this period, even though Parliament has dissolved. The Cabinet met on Wednesday. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce convened on Thursday. Today, we had the second meeting of the National Jobs Council, chaired by SM Tharman.

Jobs are our most urgent task. The National Jobs Council has the heavy responsibility of creating as many new jobs and training opportunities as possible. We have made good progress since the first meeting three weeks ago. This afternoon, we went into specific areas on where we could create more job opportunities, such as the tech sector. I thank members of the Council, many from the private sector, and from @ntucsingapore, for their valuable inputs. Together, we can come up with specific measures and mechanisms, to better match job seekers to the jobs available, and to create new jobs and training opportunities.

We will continue to serve you throughout the election period. We will continue to ensure that the fight against COVID-19 goes on, and that our businesses, workers and households are supported.

"When I was planning for #SGBudget2020, I had consultation sessions with various groups, including businesses, unions and social service agencies, to better understand the needs of the people they are serving.

Our Community Development Councils (CDCs) serve our people in different regions of Singapore. So I asked our five Mayors of the CDCs ‚Äî @lowyenling.sg, @denisephua, @desmond.choo, @maliki_osman, @teo_ho_pin, if we could do more, given the uncertainty with COVID-19. They told me that over and above our national-level support schemes, the CDCs have been providing targeted support in the neighbourhoods. I agreed to support them in their outreach.

Today, I joined the five Mayors and the President of the Federation of Merchants‚Äô Association, Yeo Hiang Meng, for the virtual launch of the CDC Vouchers Scheme. The CDCs have now set aside $20 million to provide vouchers for up to 400,000 eligible Singaporean households. They also want to support the many small businesses in our neighbourhoods, which have been hard hit by COVID-19. I am glad that during the circuit breaker period, the CDCs have reached out to our hawkers and neighbourhood shops through various digital means, to sign up 2,500 participating merchants. I hope more will come on board.

This strong collaboration approach to supporting families in need ‚Äî with the Government, the grassroots and community each doing their part ‚Äî is one way to help us see through the storm. I thank Hiang Meng, our Mayors, and volunteers for their hard work. I also thank our merchants and hawkers for signing on.

This scheme is a ‚Äòtwo-in-one‚Äô ‚Äî we hope to help families cope with the cost of living, and help our hawkers and merchants during this difficult period. Let us continue to be creative to find good ways to support one another. This is the #SingaporeTogether spirit to build a more caring society and to emerge stronger.

"For our youths, this is a challenging time to come of age and be in the job market. The road ahead will be difficult and fraught with uncertainty, but I am glad that our youths have remained resilient in the face of adversity. The pandemic might have set back their plans temporarily, but the virus will not stop them from fulfilling their potential.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
What will set our youths for success is the willingness to take the initiative and make the most of what they have. By turning anxiety into action, they can build a better tomorrow. This was my main message to our youths when I addressed them at the @young.ntuc‚Äôs LIT DISCOvery symposium this evening.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Here in Singapore, we are determined that there will be no ‚Äúlost generation‚Äù arising from COVID-19. The Labour Movement, our companies and the Government will walk this journey with our youths. I am confident our youths can rise to the occasion, and emerge stronger as a generation.‚†Ä

"Caring for and supporting our people is crucial during this challenging time.

I announced the Care and Support Package earlier in the Unity and Resilience Budgets. In April and May, we disbursed the Solidarity Payment and the first tranches of the GST Voucher - U-Save Special Payment and the Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) Rebate.

We will be paying out the remaining Care and Support - Cash from 18 June. Eligible Singaporeans can receive up to an additional $1,000. You can refer to the @mof_sg press release for more details at go.gov.sg/careandsupport-cash. Including the $1.6 billion to be paid out in June, we would have disbursed a total of $3.5 billion to households.

"The Invictus Fund was set up by @ncss.sg to enable our Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to continue serving vulnerable segments of our society during this pandemic.

Many have donated generously, including Ms Anita Fam and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who each contributed $1 million to the Fund. Sian Chay Medical Institution, a charity that provides TCM treatment for the needy, also donated $1 million. These generous contributions will go a long way in serving our vulnerable. The Government will be providing an $18 million top-up to the Invictus Fund.

During the pandemic, many Social Service Agencies are facing a fall in donations. As part of the Fortitude Budget, the Government is also partnering the @toteboardsg to enhance the matching for donations through their Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme.

In addition, NCSS has established the Beyond COVID-19 Taskforce to help the sector take this opportunity to transform. I am glad that many Social Service Agencies are accelerating the adoption of technology to serve their clients better.

I encourage those who are coping well to come forward and support our Social Service Agencies and do your part to help the vulnerable among us. There are many ways you can give back to the society ‚Äî by donating to the Fund (www.comchest.sg/TheInvictusFund) or other worthy causes at @giving.sg. You can also be a volunteer at SG Cares (www.sg/singaporecares). Your contribution can make a big difference to those in need.

The main difference between now and eight weeks ago, is that we have largely brought the spread of the virus under control. But the economic situation, in Singapore and around the world, has worsened, with a deeper recession forecasted.‚Å£
‚Å£
Many of us have adapted to the circuit breaker. Working from home and video conferencing have become the norm. Walking around our neighbourhoods has replaced walks in our parks.‚Å£
‚Å£
But I am glad to see how Singaporeans have been very responsible, making the efforts to adapt. Let‚Äôs turn this into a strength. Our ability to adapt, and to do so quickly, will be crucial not only in the next phase of this fight against COVID-19, but also on other fronts, including the economic front.‚Å£
‚Å£
Including the Fortitude Budget, we are committing almost $100 billion to support our businesses, households and frontline in this fight. We are also topping up the Contingencies Funds to $16 billion, which will provide us with additional ammunition to respond quickly.‚Å£
‚Å£
We are looking forward to life after circuit breaker. But this battle is far from over. We must remain vigilant, and look out for those around us. We must continue to adapt to the crisis and stay ahead of the curve, so that we can come out of this stronger.‚Å£

The main difference between now and eight weeks ago, is that we have largely brought the spread of the virus under control. But the economic situation, in Singapore and around the world, has worsened, with a deeper recession forecasted.‚Å£
‚Å£
Many of us have adapted to the circuit breaker. Working from home and video conferencing have become the norm. Walking around our neighbourhoods has replaced walks in our parks.‚Å£
‚Å£
But I am glad to see how Singaporeans have been very responsible, making the efforts to adapt. Let‚Äôs turn this into a strength. Our ability to adapt, and to do so quickly, will be crucial not only in the next phase of this fight against COVID-19, but also on other fronts, including the economic front.‚Å£
‚Å£
Including the Fortitude Budget, we are committing almost $100 billion to support our businesses, households and frontline in this fight. We are also topping up the Contingencies Funds to $16 billion, which will provide us with additional ammunition to respond quickly.‚Å£
‚Å£
We are looking forward to life after circuit breaker. But this battle is far from over. We must remain vigilant, and look out for those around us. We must continue to adapt to the crisis and stay ahead of the curve, so that we can come out of this stronger.‚Å£

‚Å£
DPM Heng: Today, I introduce this $33 billion Supplementary Budget for the next phase of our fight against COVID-19.‚Å£
‚Å£
Jobs is the central focus of this Budget.‚Å£
‚Å£
We will continue to support workers and businesses who remain affected by border closures and safe distancing measures. We will help our businesses and workers adapt, transform and seize new opportunities, to emerge stronger.‚Å£
‚Å£
We will also provide additional support to our households and the community to cope with the disruptions, and resource our frontline agencies to continue this fight.‚Å£

‚Å£
In his first National Day Rally in 1966, our founding PM Mr Lee Kuan Yew said that our capacity to face up to situations, however unpleasant, was one of the great qualities for survival. He believed that we will progress as long as we reward initiative and resourcefulness. As long as whenever we face peril, our courage and resolve is never found wanting.‚Å£
‚Å£
Each generation has its own trials and tribulations. The COVID-19 pandemic is our biggest crisis since independence. The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting lives and livelihoods across the world and in Singapore. As we are re-opening our economy in phases, we will continue to support our viable businesses, especially those which are not able to open immediately.‚Å£
‚Å£
Jobs will be a key part of tomorrow‚Äôs Budget. The Jobs Support Scheme has helped many employers retain their workers. But a number have lost their jobs, and some are worried that they might be retrenched. We will support those in their jobs to learn and upskill. We will create new jobs for those seeking employment and create traineeships and other opportunities.‚Å£
‚Å£
We will also provide additional support for our social sector agencies, so that they can continue to help the vulnerable among us.‚Å£
‚Å£
These additional measures will require a further draw on our Past Reserves. I have briefed President @halimahyacob on our plans and she has given her in-principle support. I thank Madam President for her support. ‚Å£
‚Å£
The decision to use our Past Reserves has not been an easy one ‚Äî we deliberated long and hard on this. Our past reserves were hard earned, and we have the responsibility of making every dollar count. I will outline the measures in Parliament tomorrow.‚Å£
‚Å£
The battle against COVID-19 will be a long one. Our generation must have courage in adversity, to adapt and to emerge stronger, just like our founding generation. This is why I have named the upcoming budget Fortitude.‚Å£

"I had a very engaging virtual meeting with more than 60 members of the Future Economy Council (FEC) and Singapore Business Federation (SBF) Council today.‚Å£
‚Å£
Ahead of my Budget statement in Parliament next Tuesday, I heard their views on how businesses across the various industries are coping with the pandemic, how effective our support provided over the last three Budgets had been, and what more we can do together.‚Å£
‚Å£
It was a candid session amongst members, including our tripartite partners. This is a difficult period for many businesses to tide over. The road ahead will be challenging and uncertain. How fast the global economy recovers depends on how well countries can contain the pandemic. There is still much uncertainty ahead, so we must be psychologically prepared.‚Å£
‚Å£
I am heartened that beyond suggestions on what more the Government can do, participants also discussed what companies have to do to adapt, and how we can strengthen tripartite collaboration across businesses, our labour movement and the Government.‚Å£
‚Å£
Many good ideas were raised. Some of these ideas will be built into our support measures. Others can be studied for the longer-term. I will be working on the ideas over this weekend as I finalise the upcoming Budget.‚Å£
‚Å£
Following the pre-Budget consultation, we had our first Future Economy Council (FEC) meeting of the year. The Emerging Stronger Taskforce gave an initial update to the FEC. I set up the Taskforce to study how the global economy will change after this massive disruption, and how Singapore businesses and workers can emerge stronger. Members gave suggestions on where else it could focus its efforts on, to enable our economy to stay resilient and to build new sources of dynamism.‚Å£
‚Å£
This has been a very fruitful morning. I learnt a lot. I thank members of the SBF Council and the FEC for your contributions. Beyond the ideas that emerged, I am greatly encouraged by their spirit of enterprise, determination and solidarity.

When the crisis started, we launched the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to provide wage support for our companies and help them retain local employees. Some companies have coped better than others. I am heartened that a number of them have come forward to return the first payment of JSS they received and to decline future payments. They include MNCs, financial institutions as well as other local enterprises across different sectors. I am very encouraged by their sense of responsibility and shared community. I hope their exemplary action will inspire other companies that are doing well to consider doing the same.

Besides returning the disbursement from the JSS, you may also consider contributing to charitable causes, such as the Invictus Fund (www.comchest.sg/TheInvictusFund) and other worthy causes at @giving.sg (www.giving.sg). Some companies and many individuals are doing so. I hope that you will also show recognition and appreciation for your workers who have stepped up during the circuit breaker period.

"#MayDay started in Singapore as a public holiday sixty years ago to commemorate the strength and solidarity of our workers.

The 1960s was a turbulent period in our history, and for our workers. One pressing challenge then was to ensure that our workers could get a job, and to improve their lives. In those formative years, we forged our brand of tripartism ‚Äî where workers and unions work with, rather than against, the Government and employers as co-drivers of our future. Over the years, tripartism thrived and with that, the lives of our workers improved year by year.

I have come to know our tripartite brothers and sisters well over the years ‚Äî the passion and dedication of our union leaders, especially Sister Mary Liew and Brother @ng.chee.meng; and the commitment of our corporate leaders and employers. More recently, the Future Economy Council, which I chair, and the implementation of the Industry Transformation Maps, are important facets of tripartism at work.

Sixty years on, we are facing an unprecedented global pandemic and a looming global economic downturn, which is likely to be severe. The Government has committed a record $60 billion over three Budgets, to support our workers, businesses, and households.

These are challenging times for all of us. But the strength of our tripartite partnership will enable us to get through this rough storm, just as we had done before. The post COVID-19 world may be different, but as long as we stay strong and united, we can emerge stronger!

Each May Day, we commemorate the determination and solidarity of our workers. This year is especially important. I applaud all our workers ‚Äî the dedication of our frontline teams, the tenacity of our migrant workers, and the resilience of those whose livelihoods have been affected.

"Our fresh graduates are entering a tough job market.

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the economy, both globally and in Singapore. Our companies are doing their utmost to keep their workers during this period, with the help of the Jobs Support Scheme. So it is no surprise that fewer of them are hiring. This was a similar situation in 2008-2009, during the Global Financial Crisis.

Singaporeans have had to adapt their livelihoods to the circumstances. I have come across many stories of this grit and resilience. Our graduates from ITE, polytechnics and universities this year will similarly have to adjust to the job market.

I announced the #SGUnited Traineeships Programme during the Resilience Budget to provide additional opportunities for our fresh graduates. This $100 million programme will provide traineeships of up to one year, with Government funding 80% of the training allowance.

More than 4,000 places are now on offer, from almost 300 companies. I am glad that our companies have stepped up where they can. I urge companies who are able to, to do more.

To those graduating this year, we will create as many opportunities for you as we can in this difficult time. We know this is not easy for you. Those who graduated during the Global Financial Crisis went on to pursue their passion and build their careers when the economy eventually recovered. Like them, you too can soar when the crisis recedes. In the meantime, I hope you can make best use of this time to work, learn, and contribute.

"Our fresh graduates are entering a tough job market.

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the economy, both globally and in Singapore. Our companies are doing their utmost to keep their workers during this period, with the help of the Jobs Support Scheme. So it is no surprise that fewer of them are hiring. This was a similar situation in 2008-2009, during the Global Financial Crisis.

Singaporeans have had to adapt their livelihoods to the circumstances. I have come across many stories of this grit and resilience. Our graduates from ITE, polytechnics and universities this year will similarly have to adjust to the job market.

I announced the #SGUnited Traineeships Programme during the Resilience Budget to provide additional opportunities for our fresh graduates. This $100 million programme will provide traineeships of up to one year, with Government funding 80% of the training allowance.

More than 4,000 places are now on offer, from almost 300 companies. I am glad that our companies have stepped up where they can. I urge companies who are able to, to do more.

To those graduating this year, we will create as many opportunities for you as we can in this difficult time. We know this is not easy for you. Those who graduated during the Global Financial Crisis went on to pursue their passion and build their careers when the economy eventually recovered. Like them, you too can soar when the crisis recedes. In the meantime, I hope you can make best use of this time to work, learn, and contribute.

"COVID-19 has put a tremendous strain on global supply chains and on the production of food, essentials and other goods.

As we import most of our food and essentials, we must be prepared to face some of these pressures, and at the same time, work with like-minded countries to keep supply chains and trade flows open, and accelerate our plans to produce some of our needs in Singapore, even if these take time.

On supply chains, Singapore has been working with several countries. Last Friday, Singapore joined 12 other countries to issue a Declaration on Maintaining Essential Global Links. We also concluded discussions with New Zealand on a similar declaration earlier last week. We hope more like-minded countries will join us in this commitment.

We are also accelerating our ‚Äò30x30‚Äô plan ‚Äî to produce 30% of our food needs by 2030. @masagosz is leading a Taskforce to oversee this effort. As part of the Resilience Budget, @sgfoodagency has also set-up a ‚Äú30x30 Express‚Äù grant to support our agri-food industry in this endeavour.

We have the potential to produce more of our food needs locally. Earlier this month, I visited Apollo Aquaculture Group and Max Koi farm. I saw how our farms use innovation and technology for high-density and high-quality fish farming.

We will redouble our efforts to support our companies to ramp up local production and strengthen food resilience. You can be part of this effort too ‚Äî by buying more local produce, even though they might cost slightly more.

At a time when global food security is of increasing concern, we have to pursue a multi-pronged strategy to secure our food needs, for the immediate, and for the longer term.  And each of us can do our part, by not wasting food. (PMO Video by Arina Ong)",2020-04-20 03:39:56+00:00,üëçüëèüí™‚ù§Ô∏èLove local produce - safer & fresher.

"From today, more than 140,000 employers will receive their first payouts, to help cover the wages of over 1.9 million local employees. This is worth more than $7 billion, as I announced in the Solidarity Budget

As part of the Government‚Äôs efforts to help companies and workers with both cash and cashflow during this trying period, the implementing agencies have been working very hard to bring forward the first payouts under the Jobs Support Scheme to April.

For this month, April, I also enhanced the Jobs Support Scheme wage subsidy to 75% for ALL sectors, as the ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù measures are affecting all sectors. This will also be paid together with the first tranche from today.

I trust that business leaders will do their best, to retain their workers, and our workers will use this time well, to learn new skills.

Subsequent tranches will be paid in July and October later this year.

"Had a ‚Äòlive‚Äô Skype interview on CNA938 with John Yip today, in what has become the norm these days.

We had three Budgets in 48 days. Our challenge now is to implement these measures well. Cash flow is a concern for many businesses and households. So we are doing our best to reach as many as we can, as fast as possible.

I shared that we will be disbursing about $9 billion to businesses and households this month. The first payment will be made this Tuesday ‚Äî Singaporeans will be receiving their $600 Solidarity Payment. You can read more details here: go.gov.sg/sp2020.

Also updated listeners on the current COVID-19 situation, particularly the clusters in our foreign worker dormitories. Our immediate priority is the well-being of our foreign workers and to contain the spread. Beyond the outbreak, we should also look at what more we can do to take care of them.

The ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù is one week in. I am glad many of you have remained at home, and have found creative ways to remain active and engaged, connect with your loved ones, and help those around you.

Stay home, stay strong, and we will all emerge stronger.

"Today marks the first day of the one-month ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù. I was reminded of this when I drove to Parliament today. Traffic was light and I only saw a handful of pedestrians on the streets.

Over the last two days, MPs rose unanimously to speak in support of the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Taken together with what we have set aside in the Unity Budget, we are committing almost $60 billion in our response to COVID-19.

The Resilience Budget provides sustained support for our businesses, workers and households for the rest of this year. The Solidarity Budget gives a boost to help them tide over the period of circuit breaker. Our priority now is to ensure that the payments flow to our businesses and households quickly.

We are navigating in uncharted waters, but we are confronting the crisis from a position of strength.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob‚Äôs support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come ‚Äî when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

Thanks for you and your team for helping through this hard time.,2020-04-08,45,Economic Measures,45,2,-10.876462474993188,5,1,3,24.875949711043486,3,0,0.0
"Today marks the first day of the one-month ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù. I was reminded of this when I drove to Parliament today. Traffic was light and I only saw a handful of pedestrians on the streets.

Over the last two days, MPs rose unanimously to speak in support of the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Taken together with what we have set aside in the Unity Budget, we are committing almost $60 billion in our response to COVID-19.

The Resilience Budget provides sustained support for our businesses, workers and households for the rest of this year. The Solidarity Budget gives a boost to help them tide over the period of circuit breaker. Our priority now is to ensure that the payments flow to our businesses and households quickly.

We are navigating in uncharted waters, but we are confronting the crisis from a position of strength.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob‚Äôs support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come ‚Äî when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

My team and I are here to work with you, for you, for Singapore. We stand in solidarity with you during this critical period.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob‚Äôs support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come ‚Äî when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

"Today marks the first day of the one-month ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù. I was reminded of this when I drove to Parliament today. Traffic was light and I only saw a handful of pedestrians on the streets.

Over the last two days, MPs rose unanimously to speak in support of the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Taken together with what we have set aside in the Unity Budget, we are committing almost $60 billion in our response to COVID-19.

The Resilience Budget provides sustained support for our businesses, workers and households for the rest of this year. The Solidarity Budget gives a boost to help them tide over the period of circuit breaker. Our priority now is to ensure that the payments flow to our businesses and households quickly.

We are navigating in uncharted waters, but we are confronting the crisis from a position of strength.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob‚Äôs support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come ‚Äî when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

As we begin the one-month ‚Äòcircuit breaker‚Äô tomorrow, this $5.1 billion Budget will help our businesses, workers, and households tide through the next four weeks.

The Solidarity Budget was put together on very short notice. It was introduced in Parliament even before MPs had the chance to debate the Resilience Budget. Unlike previous Budgets, we did not have the opportunity to consult extensively. But we relied on the various feedback we had received since the Resilience Budget ‚Äî to design additional measures and refine previously announced ones. We also continued to take a tripartite approach to policy design and implementation.

Many of you have also told my colleagues and me that you are anxious about your cash flow. This is understandably a major concern now. We are therefore ensuring that the additional support reaches as many as we can, as fast as possible. Payments to businesses and households will start this month.

To fund these set of measures, I have sought and obtained President @halimahyacob‚Äôs in-principle support to draw on an additional $4 billion from our Past Reserves. The remaining $1.1 billion will be funded from this term of Government.

I have sought and obtained President @halimahyacob‚Äôs in-principle support to draw on an additional $4 billion from Past Reserves. The remaining $1.1 billion will be funded from the fiscal space of this term of Government.

Taken together, the Government‚Äôs response to COVID-19 will total almost $60 billion, or about 12% of GDP.

This is an unprecedented budget, for an extraordinary time. The situation remains highly fluid and uncertain. The Government stands ready to provide further support, should it become necessary.

#SGBudget2020",2020-03-27 05:35:56+00:00,"Dear DPM, Finance Minister, good day to you. An extended Unity Budget is better than nothing. So, a big thank you. I try to re-absorb the new budget details, it is not bad a package, if possible, your Ministry can just fine-tune the package ""a bit here, a bit there"" to make it ""more fantastic"". You served Mr Lee Kuan Yew closely for many years. That speaks volumes of your (good) capabilities. After this budget, our next challenge is to fight / contain / eradicate this Covid-19 (Crisis). The Ministerial Task Force are doing well so far so good, though there are still more room for improvements. Another challenge is of course ensuring the food supplies and necessities supply chain will not be adversely abrupted. Suggestion : more red meats from New Zealand. Not sure if Taiwan is a good option for fruits / vegetables supply source. If so, highly recommend them as alternative. (I must confess I aint no expert in these foodstuffs supply chain NEA regulations etc). All said, not least, thank you once again for the hardwork and efforts. @leehsienloong @lawrencewongst @gankimyong @ongyekung @khawboonwan @teocheehean @indraneerajah ***** note : if possible, try to look into the possibility of setting up a large assembly line to produce our own masks in Singapore. This can help create some temp jobs too. Wearing masks help boost confidence & assurance. Maybe after everyone is wearing masks we can open up our business a bit (e.g. restaurants, pubs...etc) to boost our economy ? But for now with not enough masks better be safe in having ""social distancing"" which is a correct move. And, are our ventilators enough if touchwood, Singpore exploded like Italy ?

"I presented our Resilience Budget today, just five weeks after our Unity Budget. This is the first time in our history that we are tabling a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget.

I introduced measures worth over $48 billion ‚Äî this is more than 7 times the $6.4 billion for support measures in the Unity Budget. With in-principle support from President @halimahyacob, the Government is seeking to draw up to $17 billion from our Past Reserves to fund these measures. This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts ‚Äî medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

When future generations look back on this chapter in our history, it is not the Budget numbers they will remember. It is our resilient spirit, our determination, and our actions in a period of unprecedented disruption that will stand out ‚Äî as one people standing together, supporting one another with strength, grit, and compassion.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available. Around you ‚Äî there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures.

"I presented our Resilience Budget today, just five weeks after our Unity Budget. This is the first time in our history that we are tabling a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget.

I introduced measures worth over $48 billion ‚Äî this is more than 7 times the $6.4 billion for support measures in the Unity Budget. With in-principle support from President @halimahyacob, the Government is seeking to draw up to $17 billion from our Past Reserves to fund these measures. This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts ‚Äî medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

When future generations look back on this chapter in our history, it is not the Budget numbers they will remember. It is our resilient spirit, our determination, and our actions in a period of unprecedented disruption that will stand out ‚Äî as one people standing together, supporting one another with strength, grit, and compassion.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available. Around you ‚Äî there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures.

This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts ‚Äî medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

When future generations look back on this chapter in our history, it is not the Budget numbers they will remember. It is our resilient spirit, our determination, and our actions in a period of unprecedented disruption that will stand out ‚Äî as one people standing together, supporting one another with strength, grit, and compassion.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available.

DPM Heng: On top of the broad-based support to help businesses address the three ‚ÄòC‚Äôs ‚Äî cash, cost, credit, I will provide additional help to specific sectors that are most directly affected by COVID-19.

Sectors relying on tourism and international travel have been hit the hardest. The aviation sector sits at the core of this ecosystem.&nbsp;We will provide an enhanced Jobs Support Scheme to help retain local workers for businesses whose activities are based principally in the aviation sector. We will also introduce a $350 million enhanced aviation support package to fund support measures.

Apart from the aviation sector, other tourism-related industries have had a difficult time. We will also set aside $90 million to help the tourism industry rebound strongly, when the time is right.

"[ SUPPORTING BUSINESSES ]

DPM Heng: The Resilience Budget will address the three Cs on the mind of every business owner now ‚Äî cash flow, cost, and credit.

Cash is king, and we are doing our best to flow the payouts under the wage support schemes quickly, and to grant an automatic deferment of income tax payments of companies and self-employed.

To keep costs under control, I will enhance the Property Tax Rebate announced in the Unity Budget. Commercial properties which have been most badly affected ‚Äî such as hotels, shops and restaurants ‚Äî will pay no property tax this year. Other non-residential properties will benefit from a 30% rebate. I strongly urge landlords to fully pass on the rebate to tenants, by reducing rentals. The Government will lead by example by enhancing rental waivers.

Credit is another key business concern. I will further enhance our financing schemes so that even the hardest-hit businesses can continue to have access to credit. In addition, I will set aside $20 billion of loan capital in this budget. This will help to support good companies with strong capabilities, and catalyse private sector loan capital.

DPM Heng: Our immediate priority is to save jobs, support our workers, and protect livelihoods. Over one third of the Resilience Budget is dedicated to this.

For employees, our top priority is to help them stay employed. I will significantly enhance and extend the Jobs Support Scheme, to provide more impactful and sustained wage support. With these enhancements, a total of $15.1 billion will be allocated to support more than 1.9 million local employees under the Jobs Support Scheme.

For self-employed persons, we plan to provide direct cash assistance through the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme to help them tide over this difficult period. Eligible self-employed persons will receive $1,000 a month for nine months. We will also extend the Self-Employed Person Training Support Scheme to end-2020.

The SGUnited Jobs initiative will create about 10,000 jobs over the next one year. We will also have the SGUnited Traineeships programme to provide young people with opportunities to gain valuable work experience, so that we can emerge stronger from this crisis.

As the impact of COVID-19 on our economy deepens, some workers will lose their jobs or see their incomes significantly reduced. We will provide additional support, including the introduction of a COVID-19 Support Grant.

"[ SAVING JOBS ]

DPM Heng: Our immediate priority is to save jobs, support our workers, and protect livelihoods. Over one third of the Resilience Budget is dedicated to this.

For employees, our top priority is to help them stay employed. I will significantly enhance and extend the Jobs Support Scheme, to provide more impactful and sustained wage support. With these enhancements, a total of $15.1 billion will be allocated to support more than 1.9 million local employees under the Jobs Support Scheme.

For self-employed persons, we plan to provide direct cash assistance through the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme to help them tide over this difficult period. Eligible self-employed persons will receive $1,000 a month for nine months. We will also extend the Self-Employed Person Training Support Scheme to end-2020.

The SGUnited Jobs initiative will create about 10,000 jobs over the next one year. We will also have the SGUnited Traineeships programme to provide young people with opportunities to gain valuable work experience, so that we can emerge stronger from this crisis.

DPM Heng: The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts ‚Äî medical, economic, and social. On the medical front, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe. Yet measures on the medical front to contain the pandemic, both in Singapore and around the world, have made the second front of the battle ‚Äî the economic front, even more difficult. Our latest GDP growth is forecasted to be between -4.0% and -1.0%. On the social front, we need Singaporeans to be strong, and ride through these challenges together.

Last month, I committed $6.4 billion in the Unity Budget towards the Stabilisation and Support Package, the Care and Support Package, and to support our frontline Agencies. Today, I am introducing measures worth over $48 billion in this Resilience Budget, to deal decisively with the COVID-19 situation.

Altogether, we are putting $55 billion to support our people, amounting to 11% of our GDP. This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation.

The Resilience Budget will focus on three key areas:

1. Save jobs, support workers, and protect livelihoods

2. Help enterprises overcome immediate challenges

3. Strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge intact and stronger

"I was so absorbed with our preparations for the second support package that today‚Äôs date, 23 March, nearly slipped my mind ‚Äî it has been 5 years since Mr Lee Kuan Yew passed away.

The world has undergone tremendous change since. These are extraordinary times ‚Äî as the world faces a global pandemic, an economic shock, and a test of the financial systems all rolled into one.

On this fifth anniversary, I asked myself ‚Äî how would a nation that came of age under Mr Lee‚Äôs leadership deal with COVID-19?

While Singapore has never faced a situation like this in our history, we have been through many crises before. In our early years of nationhood, Mr Lee told us, ‚ÄúNever fear!‚Äù. We did not, and we came together as a united nation. This spirit of staying strong and united, showing resilience and caring for one another, will see us through these difficult times.

Our frontline heroes, public officers, community groups, and people are doing their part ‚Äî demonstrating our strength in unity. But the outbreak has inevitably taken a big toll on our economy, with many jobs and livelihoods at stake.

We will meet this challenge head-on. I will present a supplementary Budget on 26 March, just 5 weeks after #SGBudget2020. This is a Budget to support Singaporeans to stay united and resilient. This is the first time that we are introducing a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget, reflecting how fast the situation has deteriorated over the past weeks.

COVID-19 is spreading across the globe. No one can foretell the future, but as long as we stay alert and dynamic, we can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation.

We will keep you safe, preserve jobs and livelihoods, as well as help viable enterprises stay strong.

Singaporeans have stood united through past crises. We remember and honour the fighting spirit of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and our pioneer generation, even as we forge our way forward through new challenges.

We will never fear. Together, we will get through this crisis, and emerge stronger, as one united people.

"The COVID-19 pandemic is causing an unprecedented impact on both Singapore‚Äôs and the world economy. I announced a $4 billion Stabilisation & Support Package in #SGBudget2020 to support our workers and businesses affected by the outbreak. But the fast-evolving and worsening situation calls for more to be done.

My @mof_sg team has been working hard with other agencies and organisations on the second stimulus package. Today, Minister Chan Chun Sing and I met Council members from the Singapore Business Federation, Trade Associations and Chambers to have a better understanding of the challenges faced by different sectors of the economy, and how a second support package can help viable companies and retain workers.

We had a robust and substantive dialogue as they candidly shared their immediate and long-term concerns and challenges. These covered many ‚ÄòCs‚Äô ‚Äî cash flow, costs, capabilities and confidence. We will take the feedback into consideration for the second package.

As COVID-19 will be here to stay till the end of the year, or longer, we have to ensure that our measures are sustainable, to weather the impact of a prolonged outbreak. We are focusing on containing the outbreak on the medical front, to protect lives, and to protect workers and livelihoods.

Self quarantine of 14 days at home will cause widespread spikes in the nation. Why so? All those who return could already be infected but show no symptom yet. When they stay home, they still mingle with their family members. Majority do not have the luxury of big homes and therefore impossible to be within the safe distant from each other. Realistically, many may not be disciplined enough to do the recommended procedures.  Assuming each family has average 5 people including the helper. Assuming that just 2 family members get infected by the one who returns from overseas, these 2 will go to school, to work, to eat, to socialise without knowing that they are also infected. Their neighbours will also get infected too. Can't imagine the spread with so many thousands returning members!!! Suggest that our govt place these group of returning citizens in designated venues for 14 days instead of returning to their home. This will be safer for the nation.

"Was interviewed by @moneyfm893‚Äôs @elliottdanker yesterday.

We discussed how the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation has affected global economies and the global supply chain, as well as its impact on Singapore and our economy. I shared that we are expecting the outbreak to last at least till the end of the year ‚Äî that is why we must not let fear rule over our hearts and minds, and how we can pull through this together, as long as we support one another.

Joined Lianhe Zaobao editor Goh Sin Teck together with fellow panellists as well as business leaders and members from our Trade Association Chambers (TACs) at Lianhe Zaobao‚Äôs #SGBudget2020 Business Forum today. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
We had a robust discussion on the short-term and long-term economic issues affecting Singapore, especially the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. We also exchanged views on the effectiveness of the support measures that I announced during the Budget to counter the impact of COVID-19 on our economy. I shared that the Government is monitoring the situation closely and assessing the need for a second support package if need be.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
While we tackle the current challenges, it is important we continue to keep our eye on our long-term goals and needs. I will be setting up a task force under the ambit of the Future Economy Council ‚Äî this will help encourage enterprises to turn challenges into opportunities and make use of this downtime to emerge stronger from the outbreak. More details will be released soon.‚†Ä

"This year‚Äôs Budget is called our Unity Budget ‚Äî what does unity mean?

It means we never walk alone. It expresses our confidence that Singaporeans will rally to tackle challenges, and go through thick and thin as one Singapore.

We are united in our determination to preserve and enhance jobs, as well as support businesses impacted by COVID-19. We are united in our confidence that Singaporeans come out of this outbreak stronger. As long as we stay united in resilience, trust and solidarity, and to build better lives for all in Singapore, we will get through this, together.

In this fight, our frontline workers, especially our healthcare workers, have shown outstanding courage and dedication. To show our thanks and support, we will award frontline workers up to 1 additional month of special bonus. We will also make a one-off COVID-19 grant to the Public Health Preparedness Clinics, to support them in their active role caring for patients with respiratory symptoms.

My colleagues and I will do our part to show solidarity with fellow Singaporeans who have been affected by the outbreak. All political office holders will take a 1-month salary cut. All MPs will take a 1-month allowance cut. President @halimahyacob informed me that she will join in. Senior public service officers will take a half-month cut.

Beyond COVID-19, our unity will set the foundation for Singaporeans to press on and write the next chapter of our Singapore story. All of this is within our reach, if we work as One Singapore. Above all, let us never stop thinking and working for tomorrow. #SingaporeTogether, Majulah Forever!

I thank Members and the many Singaporans for contributing to #SGBudget2020 Debate. I have listened intently to all your views, and am heartened that we all have the best interests for Singapore.

#SGBudget2020 has come amidst great uncertainty, as we confront the challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak. I understand Singaporeans‚Äô concerns about the impact on our businesses and jobs. We will help workers and businesses through:

1. A $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package to help stabilise the economy as well as support our workers and enterprises. It will also provide for jobs and cash flow support to help businesses retain and retrain workers. Additional help will be given to sectors more directly impacted by COVID-19; and

2. A $1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help Singaporeans with their household expenses and cost of living, with adult Singaporeans getting a one-off cash payout of between $100-$300.

I also announced that given the current economic situation and our financial position, I would not raise our GST rate in 2021. We will consider the situation carefully before any changes. When we raise GST, we would have a $6 billion Assurance Package to help Singaporean households.

Our ability to have a strong Budget in these uncertain times is only possible thanks to our fiscal prudence over generations.

Beyond immediate challenges, this year‚Äôs Budget also presents our long-term strategic financial plan to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans to meet future challenges and seize new opportunities. We will continue to grow our economy, transform our enterprises, care for and nurture Singaporeans, build and secure our nation, while working together with Singaporeans so that we can advance as One Singapore, to build a home we will always call our own.

I also announced that given the current economic situation and our financial position, I would not raise our GST rate in 2021. We will consider the situation carefully before any changes. When we raise GST, we would have a $6 billion Assurance Package to help Singaporean households.

Our ability to have a strong Budget in these uncertain times is only possible thanks to our fiscal prudence over generations.

Beyond immediate challenges, this year‚Äôs Budget also presents our long-term strategic financial plan to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans to meet future challenges and seize new opportunities. We will continue to grow our economy, transform our enterprises, care for and nurture Singaporeans, build and secure our nation, while working together with Singaporeans so that we can advance as One Singapore, to build a home we will always call our own.

I thank the many people who participated in our Budget consultation sessions. I also thank my very dedicated team of officers in @mof_sg.

My colleagues in the respective Ministries will elaborate on these plans during the Committee of Supply debates in the coming weeks.

You can find more details at www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. Over the coming few days, I will continue to post updates on our key Budget measures.

Usually, we try to settle the details as early as possible. This year, we could not, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The @mof_sg team has been putting in extra hours to track the fast-evolving situation, listening to Singaporeans‚Äô suggestions, and coming up with targeted support measures. We have many young officers at MOF, and I had really hoped that they could have a nice Valentine‚Äôs Day with their loved ones last Friday. Instead, they asked for understanding from their partners, and worked with me through the night and over the weekend.

#SGBudget2020 will include measures that were not on the table a month ago. We would not have been able to act quickly and decisively, if not for our deep reserves. I do not mean only our financial reserves, but also the reserves of strength, resilience, empathy, and resourcefulness among our public servants and fellow Singaporeans.

Without these, we would have been much worse off ‚Äî financially and psychologically. My team and I would not be able to spend the last few weeks working on the stabilisation and support measures. We would instead be lying awake trying to project how much of a hit we are going to suffer, rather than what we can do to help our economy and people.

As Finance Minister, I am grateful for the efforts and sacrifices of not just one generation, but of many ‚Äî going back to my illustrious predecessor Dr Goh Keng Swee, our first Finance Minister, and our Pioneer and Merdeka generations.

I am proud of our public officers, working selflessly on the frontline and in the backrooms. I am moved by our people whose acts of compassion inspire us.

Usually, we try to settle the details as early as possible. This year, we could not, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The @mof_sg team has been putting in extra hours to track the fast-evolving situation, listening to Singaporeans‚Äô suggestions, and coming up with targeted support measures. We have many young officers at MOF, and I had really hoped that they could have a nice Valentine‚Äôs Day with their loved ones last Friday. Instead, they asked for understanding from their partners, and worked with me through the night and over the weekend.

I have also been working closely with Cabinet colleagues involved in managing various facets of the COVID-19 outbreak. My thanks to all of them, and to @lawrencewongst and @indraneerajah, who are with me in MOF, and have been contributing to this Budget over the months.

#SGBudget2020 will include measures that were not on the table a month ago. We would not have been able to act quickly and decisively, if not for our deep reserves. I do not mean only our financial reserves, but also the reserves of strength, resilience, empathy, and resourcefulness among our public servants and fellow Singaporeans.

Without these, we would have been much worse off ‚Äî financially and psychologically. My team and I would not be able to spend the last few weeks working on the stabilisation and support measures. We would instead be lying awake trying to project how much of a hit we are going to suffer, rather than what we can do to help our economy and people.

As Finance Minister, I am grateful for the efforts and sacrifices of not just one generation, but of many ‚Äî going back to my illustrious predecessor Dr Goh Keng Swee, our first Finance Minister, and our Pioneer and Merdeka generations.

I am proud of our public officers, working selflessly on the frontline and in the backrooms. I am moved by our people whose acts of compassion inspire us.

"With the COVID-19 situation, taxi and private hire ridership has been affected. A $77 million point-to-point support package has been launched to provide targeted assistance for taxi and private hire drivers, help defray business costs and support affected drivers. This is done through a Special Relief Fund and a Government-@ntucsingapore Driver Care Fund.

Besides financial assistance, enhanced measures have also been put in place by the @ltasg, together with the MOH, Point-to-Point operators, the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA) ‚Äî all to protect the health of our taxi and private hire car drivers, as well as their passengers.

Taxi operators conduct temperature screening at their premises daily. 300,000 surgical masks will be given to drivers to give to passengers who are unwell and need a ride to see a doctor or go to the hospital. Drivers have also been reminded to continue good personal hygiene habits, take their temperature, and clean and disinfect their vehicles more frequently.

We will continue to work with our tripartite partners to support workers in the sectors affected by the COVID-19. I will also be announcing more measures to help both workers and affected businesses in my #SGBudget speech on 18 February.

"COVID-19 is a challenge for our generation. How we respond will define us as a people. DPM @hengsweekeat introduced a $33 bn Fortitude Budget in Parliament today for the next phase of our fight against the pandemic. This comes in addition to the $60 bn set aside in the earlier Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets. In total, we are committing nearly $100 bn, or around 20% of our GDP this year. We are deploying significant resources to deal with an unprecedented crisis. 
The central focus of the Fortitude Budget is jobs - to support our workers and protect their livelihoods.

#SGUnited",2020-05-27 08:55:35+00:00,"Feedback : The 4 budgets amt to est. $100 bil are complex and not straight forward to the masses. If $100 bil are allocated to ALL adult Singaporeans, including the very poor, the middle income, the very rich, each can get about $50,000 Cash basis approx. 2 million adults. Right now, we dont see the very ""tangible benefits or assistance"". Most of the $100 bils seem try to help big corps and sme businesses in the hope that they can retain as many employees as possible. Is this workable ? I doubt so. If an extended family of adult pa, ma, bro, sis if you use the simplest method each getting $50,000 collectively they have $200,000. This $200,000 can help them for at least 5 years even if all of them are retrenched / laid-off. (Of course you can fine-tune it by giving those in landed houses lesser, and of the $100 bils, 20% as full cash support : each adult getting around $10,000 & etc) By having a super complex 4 combined budgets, ask around, look around, how many actually directly benefited from the est. $100 bils? Look at Hong Kong. Simple approach that all the people can feel the benefits. HK$10000 for every Hong Konger. This should be the way. Ours ?Skills training budget in times of social distancing ? Go Digital incentives when most F & B owners worry most are revenues 1st and not the mode of payment ? Note : I am Pro PAP but does not mean I am Pro PAP Policies. Would Mr Lee Kuan Yew have done differently ? @leehsienloong @hengsweekeat @teocheehean @khawboonwan Note : the theory of ""teaching someone to fish"" instead of ""giving him fishes"" has to be applied according to circumstances.

A big thank you to all our workers for your contributions to Singapore, especially during COVID-19.
2020 has been a year like no other. Many workers have had their wages and livelihoods affected by the pandemic, particularly those in hard-hit sectors. Frontline and essential workers have made many sacrifices, to keep their families and all of us safe.

We do not know when this pandemic will end, but there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. We‚Äôre closer to getting a vaccine, and starting to reopen our borders. In the meantime, stay safe and stay strong. 
During this pandemic, labour MPs have been working overtime helping union workers, while the Air Transport Executive Staff Union has been working with SIA and other airlines to assist ground staff and protect their interests. Therefore, I nominate NTUC Assistant Secretary-General @patricktaytg and President of the AESU Daniel Loh to show your appreciation next! ‚Äì LHL

A big thank you to all our workers for your contributions to Singapore, especially during COVID-19.
2020 has been a year like no other. Many workers have had their wages and livelihoods affected by the pandemic, particularly those in hard-hit sectors. Frontline and essential workers have made many sacrifices, to keep their families and all of us safe.

We do not know when this pandemic will end, but there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. We‚Äôre closer to getting a vaccine, and starting to reopen our borders. In the meantime, stay safe and stay strong.

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

We are heading into the storm with a major $55 billion package to help save jobs and businesses, support households, and keep our economy going. If the situation worsens, we are ready to do more.

The impact on our economy has been huge. This is only the second time ever we are drawing on our reserves. The last time was for the Global Financial Crisis in 2009. We will be drawing up to $17 billion to fund the support measures, more than triple what was drawn in 2009.

I have no illusions that this will be all we need. Nobody can tell what lies ahead. COVID-19 has shown starkly how vulnerable we are, and how our existential threats essentially remain the same, despite Singapore going from third world to first. The COVID-19 pandemic will be the formative experience for this generation of Singaporeans. If we remain vigilant, resolute, and united, I am confident we will get through this together.

I would like to quote a Yahoo commentator who wrote this feedback (Quote) : ""Veteran@VOTE2 hours ago singapore reserves are money mainly from past bearers and should be given to ALL singaporean household across the board, whom also facing the virus crisis. not just those whom got lay off due to the crisis, whom are mostly aliens. -- it will be exploited by unscrupulous employers to report 'lay offs' then 're-hired' the same after 3 months. (Unquote) There are other loopholes. E.g. Landlords who gained on zero property tax if they do not pass down the benefits to their tenants what can tenants do ? Lose Lose ? If landlords strategy is to use the gained benefits to wait out for the crisis to be over, they can easily get new tenants. Even if the landlords pass the savings, is there a clear guideline ? What can tenants do if landlords ""give them bread crumbs "" ? I listened to the Unity Budget. It seems complex, not easy to understand for many laymen or commoners. For those unemployed  due to other valid reasons say since last year, what assistance for these groups really ? Maybe I am not as smart as our leaders, but this Unity Budget for sure is confusingly complex. If Govt is afraid of giving too much direct cash handouts (as some may misuse it such as gambling), why not have assistance as such : Govt to pay 50% of PUB bills for the next 12 months ? Note that people are encouraged to do more hand washing. Surely water bills will shoot up. Or, plus S&CC charges to be waived for the next 12 months ? Whatever costs burden reduced is a good help during this crisis. For those affected that are low on CPF ordinary account balance but still have HDB mortgages to service, a top-up of 6 months equivalent will help with ""straight, direct beneficial effect'. People can see it. People can feel the benefts straightaway. And correct me if I am wrong, up the skilllscredit $ ? Now? You want people to go for ""mass training or learning of skills conducted in groups"" now ? At this social distancing times ?

"This morning, I held a dialogue with grassroots leaders on COVID-19 and what lies ahead for Singapore. This was a follow up to my TV broadcast on Thursday.

Fighting COVID-19 is difficult enough. But we also need to deal with COVID-19‚Äôs enormous impact on our economy.

Yesterday, the Government released the report of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's (EBRC), which the Committee had just completed.

The General Elections must take place before 21 April 2021. They can only be called after the electoral registers are updated. This will take about a month.

When to hold elections? That depends on the situation, and the outlook.

Singapore faces grave and extended challenges.

We can‚Äôt tell when the pandemic will end, but it will likely last at least this year, and quite possibly longer.

The economic hit will likely be more serious than the Global Financial Crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic.

I fully expect things to get more serious before they start getting better.

We have two choices. Either hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances ‚Äì but we have no certainty of that.

Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.

If we have to hold elections before COVID-19 is over, we will take all the precautions necessary, so that parties can campaign effectively, and people can vote safely.

At stake are jobs, businesses and lives.

Which way to go, and the elections date, will depend on what will best see Singapore through this major crisis.

COVID-19 may well turn out to be the crisis that defines this generation of Singaporeans. We must gird ourselves to overcome this together, and show the world what Singapore can do. ‚Äì LHL

"This morning, I held a dialogue with grassroots leaders on COVID-19 and what lies ahead for Singapore. This was a follow up to my TV broadcast on Thursday.

Fighting COVID-19 is difficult enough. But we also need to deal with COVID-19‚Äôs enormous impact on our economy.

Yesterday, the Government released the report of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's (EBRC), which the Committee had just completed.

The General Elections must take place before 21 April 2021. They can only be called after the electoral registers are updated. This will take about a month.

When to hold elections? That depends on the situation, and the outlook.

Singapore faces grave and extended challenges.

We can‚Äôt tell when the pandemic will end, but it will likely last at least this year, and quite possibly longer.

The economic hit will likely be more serious than the Global Financial Crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic.

I fully expect things to get more serious before they start getting better.

We have two choices. Either hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances ‚Äì but we have no certainty of that.

Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.

If we have to hold elections before COVID-19 is over, we will take all the precautions necessary, so that parties can campaign effectively, and people can vote safely.
