"During the Covid-19 circuit breaker last year, migrant workers were not allowed to leave their dormitories, not even to get food.

After learning about their predicament, Mrs Cherie Tseng and her husband Tseng Wun Hsiung rang up friends and relatives for donations, looked for catering firms, as well as Grab drivers to deliver food.

In 2 weeks, they raised more than $100,000 to provide over 10,000 meals to about 670 workers. The funds also went towards topping up SIM cards for 1,500 workers.

"We are almost at the half-way mark of our circuit breaker.

We are currently going all out to contain the outbreak in our foreign worker dormitories. We are actively testing our workers, and this is one reason we are seeing a big wave of new cases.

Thankfully, most who tested positive are only showing mild symptoms. The measures taken in our dorms will require some time to work, and we are scaling up our community care facilities in anticipation of a higher load in the coming days and weeks.

In the wider community, there are some indications that the circuit breaker is starting to take effect. But these are still early days and we are concerned about the number of undetected cases in the community, as that will lead to further transmission.

This is why we must all stay at home, unless absolutely necessary.

Our healthcare and essential workers are at the centre of our COVID-19 fight. But what has made a big difference is that every part of society has chipped in. You have made sure that those on the frontline are appreciated, our frail and vulnerable are cared for, and our foreign workers are provided for. You have looked out for those around you, in ways big and small.

The spirit of #SingaporeTogether shines through during these challenging times. The coming weeks will be even more critical. We need all hands on deck. We need to act in unison. Together, we can overcome. We will have time later for reflection — to learn the lessons, and to collectively shape our shared future.

In this most difficult chapter of our generation, we must persevere, stay united and emerge from this stronger.

In the wider community, there are some indications that the circuit breaker is starting to take effect. But these are still early days and we are concerned about the number of undetected cases in the community, as that will lead to further transmission.

This is why we must all stay at home, unless absolutely necessary.

Our healthcare and essential workers are at the centre of our COVID-19 fight. But what has made a big difference is that every part of society has chipped in. You have made sure that those on the frontline are appreciated, our frail and vulnerable are cared for, and our foreign workers are provided for. You have looked out for those around you, in ways big and small.

The spirit of #SingaporeTogether shines through during these challenging times. The coming weeks will be even more critical. We need all hands on deck. We need to act in unison. Together, we can overcome. We will have time later for reflection — to learn the lessons, and to collectively shape our shared future.

Thankfully, most who tested positive are only showing mild symptoms. The measures taken in our dorms will require some time to work, and we are scaling up our community care facilities in anticipation of a higher load in the coming days and weeks.

In the wider community, there are some indications that the circuit breaker is starting to take effect. But these are still early days and we are concerned about the number of undetected cases in the community, as that will lead to further transmission.

This is why we must all stay at home, unless absolutely necessary.

Our healthcare and essential workers are at the centre of our COVID-19 fight. But what has made a big difference is that every part of society has chipped in. You have made sure that those on the frontline are appreciated, our frail and vulnerable are cared for, and our foreign workers are provided for. You have looked out for those around you, in ways big and small.

The spirit of #SingaporeTogether shines through during these challenging times. The coming weeks will be even more critical. We need all hands on deck. We need to act in unison. Together, we can overcome. We will have time later for reflection — to learn the lessons, and to collectively shape our shared future.

In this most difficult chapter of our generation, we must persevere, stay united and emerge from this stronger.

"Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. That’s why we have been steadily building up our national testing capacity. 
From an average of 2,900 tests per day in early April, we are now able to conduct more than 8,000 tests per day. We are continuing to expand our testing capacity in the coming weeks and months. 
To date, Singapore has tested about 2100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the testing figures are 1600 in the US, 1100 in South Korea, and 1000 in the UK. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up more cases. 
In our migrant worker dormitories, for example, we have been testing around 3000 workers every day (including the workers that are asymptomatic), and will continue to do more tests.  So far, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about 1 in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6500 per 100,000). One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community. We are also doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes and senior residential homes, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers.
As more testing capacity is brought on-stream, we will gradually expand testing to the wider pool of workers. This expanded testing regime is of critical importance in enabling us to safely resume economic activities beyond the circuit breaker period.",2020-04-28 02:22:36+00:00,"keep going sir,you’ve our backs 💪🏽",2020-04-28,7,Foreign Worker,6,0,-11.926890800279065,3,0,1,36.03068706439268,4,0,0.0

"We are going all out to suppress the virus outbreak in the foreign worker dormitories. 
It’s a massive undertaking involving many people on the frontline - SAF and SPF officers, officials from MOM, as well as our healthcare doctors and nurses. 
They are going into the dorms to actively test the workers and isolate the infected ones from the healthy, and to ensure their overall well-being. The vast majority of the workers are young, and they tend to have very mild cough/cold symptoms that are not picked up by temperature taking alone. So the teams are working doubly hard to sweep through the dorms and test the workers, and this is also the reason why we are seeing such high reported cases every day.  We have to expect the numbers to remain high for some time as we continue this effort to swab, test and isolate the workers. 
To take care of the infected workers, we are rapidly expanding our community care facilities at the Singapore Expo and other sites. After the workers fully recover (and test negative), they will need a place to stay. So we are also preparing additional facilities to accommodate them. 
Covid-19 will be with us for many months, and likely beyond the end of the year. We have to be prepared for future waves of infection and we have to steel ourselves for a long fight.

Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, diseases, pathogens, free radicals and cancer cells.

Toxic man-made chemicals will not be part of having a healthy society. If people keep adding poison to our environment, the voiceless unborn foetuses will have birth defects and it will affect the quality of the future generations.

"Caught up with the different teams of the Inter-Agency Task Force in an e-meeting today. They have been very busy over the past several months, helping our migrant workers in the dorms during this COVID-19 pandemic.

We discussed their work so far, what comes next, and what we can tweak and improve. We have come a long way, and the migrant workers are now starting to go back to work.

Helping our migrant workers has demanded a multi-faceted approach, with teams from many agencies working together. They have deployed both high tech and the personal touch, and put in enormous efforts to tackle the problem.

It will take us a few more months to resolve the dorms issue. We have kept things under control, and will progressively bring things back up and running again. Thank you all, once again, and keep up the good work! – LHL (MCI Photos by Chwee [1] and Lee Jia Wen [2-4])

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless. May the Singapore spirit shine brightly as we go through this difficult period together. – LHL

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. – LHL
