2020-03-20 05:47:22+00:00,"Dear minister Wong thanks for your hard work. But I must say it isn’t a good idea to have the Singaporean/resident returnees serve their SHN at home. I just saw a CNA clip - reporter was doing interview with a pair of sisters who HAD just returned from the UK at their home :(( This is a prime eg why a quarantine at home won’t work. Some people are just not going to abide by the rules to stay inside their rooms at all times (except to use shower/toilet) the moment they reach home from the airport. Members of the family are inevitably exposed who then go on to infect others in the public. We should follow HK , send returnees to govt facilities. We did that with our Wuhan returnees so why not for this group since Europe now is the new epicenter?",2020-03-20,145,Stay Home Notice,144,4,-10.851783466773117,27,1,3,1.0167066039363175,0,1,1.0
2020-03-20 05:47:22+00:00,"LOA is not = Stay Home Notice. For those travel returnees on LOA, if they are infected and they go out to the public community, e.g. packed supermakets , packed hawker centres, packed mcdonald's, packed malls, there is a likelihood of an ""Uncontrollable BreakOut"" caused by these travel returnees on LOA who may be infected. If a hawker doing say popiah is being infected by the infected, and if she continues to roll her popiahs with some mild symptoms, and unaware consumers eat them, the chance of infection is there. If that happens, all these contact tracing apps will not be that relevant anymore. If Singapore becomes the next Italy, it will be ""too late"". Singapore will then be in a very disastrous situation. Economy will be 10X maybe 100X worse than the current bad situation. Bear in mind this : Singapore society is closely compact and one of the world's highest density population. Can you afford to close down all mrts and bus servicces like what China did. We must take a pre-emptive approach in anticipation of ""the worst possible scenario"" and instead of ""let's see how then react"" . The latter was what Italy , many European countries did. They waited to see how to react. When the crisis exploded suddenly and situation out of control, then they react. But, it was ""too late"" That is  fire fighting approach, not fire prevention. I worry a lot. For families, friends, fellow Singaporeans. Reason : Indonesia. I guess Indonesia will be the next Italy due to their ""reported behaviour e.g. attend large groupings even when their Govt bans them"" as well as ""their Govt citing high costs this high costs that even for Covid-19 testing for many of their potential patients"". Once Indonesia explodes like Italy, I dont think they can do containment as well as ""exploded Korea"". Singapore being its closest neighbor will be in a very very serious, dangerous and risky situation. Will our Govt take our feedback seriously ? We feedback not to curry favors (unlike many instagrammers), get likes attention and so forth.

2020-03-20 05:47:22+00:00,"Dear Minister Wong, I’m very glad to know that returnees from the UK and USA will have to serve SHN at designated hotels starting on Thursday (although it’d have been better to apply to everyone). Though it’s late, it’s the right move forward. Everyone should be treated as a suspect case and be tested upon arrival, and not just those who present symptoms at the border (which I believe is the protocol now). Mass testing has proven to be the tipping point for South Korea. We need to nip it in the bud - test, isolate, treat. Time is crucial, we can’t afford to wait for symptoms to show up then have patients present themselves at the hospital. If we can gift the Philippines with 3000 test kits surely we can do it for our fellow returnees? Also, at this point we should make it mandatory to wear mask. Wearing one is essential in the fight -  just look at China, Taiwan, SK, HK. “Wear one only when you’re sick” is not medically correct at this point in time. Experts in China have said people shed virus even before symptoms are present. Only by wearing a mask can we protect ourselves and people around us. I know there’s a shortage of masks in Singapore which makes it unfortunate but we can use cloth recyclable masks or any home made ones. When everyone wears one, it doesn’t matter if one’s quality is better than another. It really has helped those countries in containment. That’s certain. But to tell people that healthy people don’t need to wear one is just plain wrong, pardon me for saying. I’m writing as a concerned Singaporean - we must look at the above countries and learn from them. My next worry is when Malaysia ends her lockdown and thousands of people start to cross the causeway into Singapore... since it’s been proven with our recent imported cases that most don’t show symptoms at the border (meaning temperature can no longer be used as a gauge), how then? Thank you and the team once again for the hard work.

MOH have alr said dat numbers may continue to be high bef tapering down continuously, but dat doesn't mean dat the community is covid free, or yall start to get Complacent seeing low community numbers and go out more often as if covid is over. Cmon, the war is still very very far frm over. A vaccine may not conclude the end of covid, it may be here for up to 2 yrs, or maybe forever, just like seasonal flu, influenza and dengue. To those who are saying dat if u are vaccinated, u can start to be Complacent, by all means, do it urself. Don't drag ur friends or family to be Complacent with u, thinking dat u are totally immuned with covid. Wat if vaccine is not effective? And u start socialising with ppl dat may still be infected after being vaccinated? Cmon, its not the way to do things. WHO have said, dat covid may be here forever w/o a vaccine, and a vaccine is not a straight end to covid. Who knows swine flu is the nxt pandemic? If u think u can start going out more often like pre covid days and socialise as much as u want, then, the ICU ward for covid is reserved for u soon with a ventilator. Sep hols is cming, I wld not xpect crowds do be forming everywhere and ppl are starting to get Complacent. Just on 9 Aug, there was a hell lot of crowd queueing outside tamp mall to scan the safe entry and enter tamp mall. My question to them: has covid ended? Why is complacency stepping in so quick? Just because it national day, covid has hit taken a break yet.
