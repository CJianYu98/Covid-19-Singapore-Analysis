0,"Our Bedok Community Centre COVID-19 vaccination centre will be starting operations from Monday, 8 March.¬†

Seniors aged 70 and above will be progressively receiving personalised letters inviting them to make an appointment for their vaccinations. Those who have received their invitations letters can register for vaccination at www.vaccine.gov.sg. For those who have yet to receive your invitations, I seek your patience to wait for your turn.

Community volunteers and care ambassadors and resident volunteers have been going door-to-door to help our seniors make their vaccinations appointments and answer their queries. A big thank you to all our volunteers and @pafrenz for organising this outreach effort. I also thank the healthcare professionals, who will be carrying out the vaccinations.¬†

Do help our seniors get vaccinated, and I encourage you to do so when you are offered. By getting vaccinated, you are protecting not only yourself, but also your loved ones.

During my walkabouts, many residents asked about our national vaccination programme. Some also wanted to hear about my personal experience. I assured them that vaccination is safe and effective. We will be progressively setting up more community vaccination centres in the heartlands, including in Bedok, prioritising seniors and those at greater risk of infection.

115,"The @unitednations is marking its 75th anniversary in an extraordinary year.
 
Every country is doing its best to contain the spread of the virus and the economic fallout. But no place can truly be safe, until every place is safe.
 
This is why strong international cooperation is critical to accelerate the development of vaccines, maximise production capacity, and ensure the affordable, fair and equitable access to vaccines for all.
 
New and innovative forms of multilateral cooperation have been created in response to the pandemic, including the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and the COVID-19 Global Vaccines Access (COVAX) Facility. Singapore is an early support of these initiatives, and also co-chairs the Friends of the COVAX Facility with Switzerland.
 
Our collective effort will enable us to overcome this crisis. By working together and strengthening the foundations of international cooperation, we can better deal with future crises and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, so as to build a better future for our people. 
 
You can watch my recorded statement at the High-Level Event on the COVID-19 response at the UN General Assembly on my Facebook Page.

Earlier this evening, Gan Kim Yong and I participated in the Joint Finance and Health Ministers Meeting hosted by @g20org. We thank our Saudi colleagues for their leadership. COVID-19 is a global crisis, so international cooperation is critical. The #G20, which covers nearly 80% of the world‚Äôs economy, and the @who have key roles to play.
 
Countries, International Organisations and the private sector are joining forces to accelerate vaccine development, maximise manufacturing capacity, and ensure equitable distribution. Singapore is an early supporter of the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility. Switzerland and Singapore are also co-chairing the ‚ÄúFriends of the COVAX Facility‚Äù to promote vaccine multilateralism. 
 
At the same time, as we restart our economies in a safe manner, countries need to coordinate our resumption of activities. As we restart air travel, testing will be key to give assurance to travellers and public health authorities. We must work together to develop international standards, and share test results quickly including through electronic means.
 
We must also continue to identify gaps and strengthen our health and financial resilience against future outbreaks.

147,"I spoke to PRC Vice Premier Han Zheng earlier today. Much has changed since we last spoke in February, as we now face the common challenge of resuming social and economic activities, while safeguarding against further waves of COVID-19 infections.‚Å£
‚Å£
Vice Premier Han and I discussed how China and Singapore can deepen existing cooperation and work together in new areas. One key area of cooperation that we discussed was public health, including the development of COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines and treatments. I thanked Vice Premier Han for China‚Äôs pledge to make Chinese vaccines available globally. We also agreed that it was important to further strengthen connectivity between our two countries and with the rest of the world, in areas such as supply chain, financial, infrastructure and flight connectivity. This will enable the flow of goods, people and investments that are necessary for economic recovery.‚Å£
‚Å£
I am glad that our joint efforts to create new opportunities and enhance connectivity have continued despite COVID-19, including through key bilateral projects and cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative. The strides that we have taken reflects our common resolve to overcome the pandemic together and emerge stronger.‚Å£
‚Å£
This is an important year for our countries as we mark the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations. I look forward to welcoming Vice Premier Han to Singapore for the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) meeting when the COVID situation permits.‚Å£
