As this circuit breaker we are all going through, taught us a great lesson like confining ourselves staying at home for so many days and little children not allowed to play at the playground really drives us all nuts.Singapore our homeland is one of the freest country in the world. And now we find ourselves with so much restriction even simple thing like having  fresh air in the sun and taking a stroll.We may even get a fine from doing so.A feeling like we are all put in ""imprisonment"" for something that is not even a crime and it is about freedom we ask for.This Covid-19  had really taken a toll on us.And no matter how bad it is, i know together we were win this war.🙏🙏🙏",2020-04-20 10:30:18+00:00,138
