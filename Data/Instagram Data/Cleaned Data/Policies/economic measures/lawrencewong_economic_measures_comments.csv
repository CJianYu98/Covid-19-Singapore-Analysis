7,"#SGBudget2021 will continue to provide immediate relief for Singaporeans, while setting out a clear strategy to tackle our broader challenges over the horizon.

The overall budget deficit for FY2020 is the largest since Singapore‚Äôs independence, at $64.9 billion, or 13.9% of GDP. In FY2021, we will still run a deficit, albeit a smaller one, at 2.2% of GDP. 

We must therefore continue to strike a careful balance between addressing our immediate needs and meeting our longer-term needs in a fiscally responsible manner.
 
Over the past year, we have rallied together and supported one another. Let‚Äôs continue to stay the course in our fight against Covid-19 and strive to emerge stronger together!

It is wrong for taxpayers to be subsidising the SHN cost for some employers of domestic helpers. If they can afford to hire a domestic helper they should be able to afford the cost of the SHN. At most an installment scheme can be offered with interest. It's ludicrous that taxpayers are subsidising a portion of them.,2021-02-17 00:12:58+00:00,63

38,"COVID-19 is a challenge for our generation. How we respond will define us as a people. DPM @hengsweekeat introduced a $33 bn Fortitude Budget in Parliament today for the next phase of our fight against the pandemic. This comes in addition to the $60 bn set aside in the earlier Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets. In total, we are committing nearly $100 bn, or around 20% of our GDP this year. We are deploying significant resources to deal with an unprecedented crisis. 
The central focus of the Fortitude Budget is jobs - to support our workers and protect their livelihoods. More than 100,000 training and job opportunities will be created to cater to Singaporeans with different skills and aspirations. We are also providing more support to our businesses, especially those that are unable to re-open immediately after the circuit breaker. SME commercial tenants will enjoy up to 4 months of rental relief, shared equally between the government and landlords. There will be more help for households, and for our social service agencies who are taking care of vulnerable groups during this period. 
The battle against COVID-19 will be long and uncertain. There will be ups and downs in the journey. But with the fortitude to adapt and persevere, we will ultimately prevail!

#SGUnited",2020-05-27 08:55:35+00:00,"Feedback : The 4 budgets amt to est. $100 bil are complex and not straight forward to the masses. If $100 bil are allocated to ALL adult Singaporeans, including the very poor, the middle income, the very rich, each can get about $50,000 Cash basis approx. 2 million adults. Right now, we dont see the very ""tangible benefits or assistance"". Most of the $100 bils seem try to help big corps and sme businesses in the hope that they can retain as many employees as possible. Is this workable ? I doubt so. If an extended family of adult pa, ma, bro, sis if you use the simplest method each getting $50,000 collectively they have $200,000. This $200,000 can help them for at least 5 years even if all of them are retrenched / laid-off. (Of course you can fine-tune it by giving those in landed houses lesser, and of the $100 bils, 20% as full cash support : each adult getting around $10,000 & etc) By having a super complex 4 combined budgets, ask around, look around, how many actually directly benefited from the est. $100 bils? Look at Hong Kong. Simple approach that all the people can feel the benefits. HK$10000 for every Hong Konger. This should be the way. Ours ?Skills training budget in times of social distancing ? Go Digital incentives when most F & B owners worry most are revenues 1st and not the mode of payment ? Note : I am Pro PAP but does not mean I am Pro PAP Policies. Would Mr Lee Kuan Yew have done differently ? @leehsienloong @hengsweekeat @teocheehean @khawboonwan Note : the theory of ""teaching someone to fish"" instead of ""giving him fishes"" has to be applied according to circumstances. When deep crisis calls for it, you have to be really wise to choose which to do so. So to me it was ""an opportunity for all Singaporeans to feel directly assisted wasted"".",2020-05-29 05:43:49+00:00,292

#SGUnited",2020-05-27 08:55:35+00:00,"Feedback 2 : if your 4 budgets amt to say $5 bil, and each Singaporean adult gets $600 cash, then I think it is ""tangibly proportionate"". But if you have $100 bil budgeted, $10,000 cash assistance would be ""a better assistance, and more keenly felt"" by the masses. Why did I say earlier that tens of billions poured to help big corps and SMEs would not ""be workable"" ? 1. It is a good time actually for ""industry consolidation"" aka reset. The industry could have been overly saturated pre Covid-19 crisis. So, to save SIA is a wise choice as it is of such importance to Singapore economy as track records have shown.
