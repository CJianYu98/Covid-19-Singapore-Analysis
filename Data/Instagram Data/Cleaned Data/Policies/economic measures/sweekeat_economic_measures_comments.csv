This came after more than 70 hours of robust debate in Parliament, with 65 members speaking during the debate of the Budget Statement. The Bill will now be sent to President to seek her assent, before the Bill becomes law.⁣
⁣
As we enter into the second year of the pandemic, we are shifting gears. We will continue to tackle the immediate challenges. But this Budget’s central focus is on how we – all of us – can emerge stronger from this crisis – as an economy, as a society, and as one people. The Budget builds on the support that we provided in earlier Budgets, and the shared values that we stand for as Singaporeans. The investments that we are making this year and in the years ahead will put us on a stronger path to create a shared future for all.⁣
⁣
Having debated our Ministries’ plans to emerge stronger from COVID-19, the focus will now be on galvanising collective action to turn policies and resources into action. As one of our founding fathers Mr S. Rajaratnam said, Singapore must be a “democracy of deeds”. We will ensure that the funds are used well, to achieve maximal outcomes. More importantly, we will rally Singaporeans to work together, as we navigate the winds of change and waves of opportunities, to thrive in a post-COVID world.⁣

18,"Emerging stronger as an economy is a key focus of Budget 2021. Our economic agencies are giving their best to ensure that our workers and companies can adapt and thrive in a post-COVID world. MTI and MOM presented these plans at the Committee of Supply debate in Parliament yesterday and today.  

While we can debate the specifics of each scheme, we must never forget the big picture: how do we develop a vibrant economy that can provide all Singaporean workers with a better life? Uplifting our workers, and in particular our lower wage workers, remains the highest priority for this Government.

This is why in October last year, I encouraged Minister @joteo.ylm to work with NTUC Secretary General @ng.chee.meng and the President of the Singapore National Employers Federation Dr Robert Yap to set up a Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers.  

I am happy that the workgroup has developed a roadmap for a major expansion of the Progressive Wage Model, by extending to sectors such as food services and retail. In the short term, this will more than double the PWM’s coverage from the existing 85,000 workers to 218,000 workers. Our ambition is to have some form of PWM in the longer-term for all sectors in Singapore. 

As we continue to transform our economy to emerge stronger from this crisis, let us do so together, and leave no worker behind.

⁣
I explained to him that the Budget Statement was our strategic plan for the future. We are seeking not just to tackle immediate challenges, but to also enable our people and companies to emerge stronger from this crisis. And key to this is how we are able to work together and bring the best out of each other.⁣
⁣
The discussion covered a wide range of issues, from jobs and the economy, to household support, to GST and Electric Vehicles. I am glad that many understood the difficult choices that had to be made. Together, we can resolve to tackle the challenges from COVID-19 and secure a brighter future for Singapore in the post-pandemic world.⁣

25,"Drawing on Past Reserves for the 2nd year in a row was a difficult decision. The discipline of balancing budgets is the cornerstone of our financial resilience.⁣
⁣
Early in the crisis, I sought the President’s approval to draw on the Reserves to deal decisively with the crisis, to save lives and livelihoods. As we enter the 2nd year of this crisis, we continue to tackle immediate challenges and provide targeted support to hard-hit sectors. Taken together, we expect to draw up to $53.7b in FY2020-2021.⁣
⁣
In my Budget Statement, I explained that if economic recovery progresses on track, we expect to fund the expenditures for the remainder of this term of Government without having to further draw on Reserves. But the global outlook is highly uncertain, and we must be prepared for a scenario where recovery is bumpier and takes much longer.⁣
⁣
If the economic and fiscal situations turn out to be worse than expected, we should still stay the course to invest for the longer term to emerge stronger. In such a scenario, how then do we continue to ensure good fiscal discipline?⁣
⁣
This issue is not unique to Singapore. Some countries have legislatively binding debt ceilings. In Germany, known for its fiscal rectitude, the issue of further suspension of the ‘debt brake’ was hotly debated.⁣
⁣
If the situation worsens, we may need to approach the President for a further draw on Past Reserves to continue funding investments that will enable Singapore to emerge stronger in the midst of this unprecedented crisis. We should then think hard about how we can ensure that if we need to draw on Past Reserves for this purpose, we can, over time, build this back.⁣
⁣
We have benefited during this crisis from the prudence and long-term orientation of previous generations. We owe it to future generations to exercise this prudence and ensure they can deal with future crises. I will say more at my Round-Up Speech.⁣
⁣
If we rally together and make the best choices to position us well for the longer term, I am confident that we can emerge stronger and build a better future for our children.⁣

I am glad that the international community takes an interest in our Budget as they see Singapore as an important base to do business.

DPM Heng: I have committed a total of $107 billion in FY2021 under the Emerging Stronger Together Budget, to address the near-term challenges and to enable us to emerge stronger from this crisis. 
 
In the immediate term, we expect to run a fiscal deficit to support targeted relief, considering the unprecedented impact of COVID-19. The President has given her in-principle support for the proposed draw of up to $11 billion on Past Reserves in FY2021. The total expected draw on Past Reserves over FY2020 and FY2021 will be up to $53.7 billion. 
 
Our fiscal situation is expected to be tighter in the coming years. But beyond this crisis, we must return to running balanced budgets. 
 
Our people rallied together, to support one another during this crisis. The past year showed that our values as a people matter — the values of unity, resilience, solidarity, and fortitude.
 
Let us strive to emerge stronger together, as a united and shining red dot, trusted by all.

&nbsp;
A cheerful senior in his 70s recently came up to me in Bedok. He smiled and asked if I would be giving out any “hongbaos” for Budget. Then he quickly turned serious and said that Budget should not be about goodies. Instead, he said it was much more important to invest in building up our people’s abilities and enabling them to do better. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Shared values such as this — building on what we inherit and passing on something better to the next generation — are what bind us together as a people. Indeed, we can take heart that through this crisis, we have built deeper social reserves — united in purpose, standing in solidarity, and facing difficulties with resilience and fortitude.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
As I make the final edits to the speech, I mulled over the name for this Budget. In June last year, I set out in my national broadcast, our plans to emerge stronger together. Since then, we have moved into Phase 3 of re-opening, and vaccination is well underway. As COVID-19 has accelerated changes and created new ones, we must also navigate these shifts to thrive in a post-COVID world. Our ability to plan ahead, even in a crisis, has been the hallmark of the Singapore Story.
&nbsp;
I decided therefore that Emerging Stronger Together should also be the name of the upcoming Budget — we must continue to focus on coming out of this crisis stronger, and forge partnerships to meet the challenges ahead, as one people.
&nbsp;
To emerge stronger, we must find new ways to innovate and transform our economy. We must strengthen our social compact and support one another, especially those with greater needs. On this little red dot, we must strengthen efforts to tackle climate change. Importantly, we must continue to be prudent in our spending.

CDCs play a very important role in supporting the vulnerable by coming up with local programmes to complement national schemes. Each CDC has its own programmes, but they also work closely together. Since COVID-19, our CDCs have collaborated together and with the community to launch more than 100 initiatives. The CDC Vouchers Scheme is one such example.

CDC vouchers have benefited almost 350,000 households and more than 8,100 participating merchants to date.

During this challenging period, household expenses will continue to weigh on the minds of many families. So we have decided to commit an additional $20 million for a second tranche of vouchers.
&nbsp;
A big thank you to our CDCs and to all our community partners. This is the spirit of #SingaporeTogether. I continue to encourage our CDCs to find new ways to build stronger partnerships with our community, hawkers and merchants.
&nbsp;
Let us continue to face the challenges ahead head-on, stand in solidarity with one another, and emerge stronger as a united Singapore.

174,"The Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) was first introduced in 2013 to co-fund wage increases given by employers to Singaporean workers. This encourages businesses which have undergone transformation to share the gains with their workers. We enhanced the scheme at Budget 2020, increasing the Government co-funding levels for 2019 and 2020 qualifying wage increases to 20% and 15% respectively. This year, the WCS paid out over $1 billion to more than 95,000 employers.
 
I know this has been a difficult time for many firms. But for those that are doing well and are reaping the fruits of your business transformation, I hope you are also upskilling your workers, creating better opportunities for them, and raising their wages commensurately. 
 
The next WCS payment will be made in March 2021, based on wage increases in 2020. Employers — do remember to make contributions to your employees’ CPF accounts by 14 Jan 2021 to be eligible. You can refer to the @mof_sg and IRAS press release for more details: go.gov.sg/wcsmar2021.

⁣
COVID-19 has accelerated technological trends and structural changes that will reshape the global economy, and throw up new challenges for societies.⁣
⁣
Science, technology and innovation will be critical to overcoming COVID-19, and in enabling us to emerge stronger. So we must stay the course and sustain our investments in research, innovation and enterprise, despite economic cycles.⁣
⁣
Singapore is committed to invest about 1% of our GDP in RIE each year, for the next five years. This is similar to our commitment to earlier research plans. In dollar terms, we are allocating $25billion for RIE2025.⁣
⁣
We remain committed to investing in basic research, and will set aside one-third of the overall budget to do so. We have also expanded the scope of RIE into human potential and sustainability. Our investment in human potential will improve prenatal and early childhood development, strengthen lifelong learning, and enable our seniors to remain healthy and active for as long as possible.⁣
⁣
At the same time, we will pursue sustainability in a broader way – to help us achieve our climate change commitments, and strengthen food resilience and biodiversity in our dense urban environment.⁣
⁣
Given the rapid pace of change and our evolving needs, we structured RIE2025 to give us greater ability and nimbleness by not allocating all the monies upfront. This will enable us to swiftly deploy unallocated funds to respond to emerging priorities and changes in the coming years.⁣
⁣
By working together to realise RIE2025, we can emerge stronger from this crisis and create more and better opportunities for our businesses and workers.&nbsp;⁣

205,"Concluded our 12th Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) Council meeting this evening. This year’s meeting was held virtually, and we were joined by members who dialled in from around the world. 
 
Just as we had to adapt our meeting to COVID-19, we also had to adjust our RIE plans to take into account the shifts accelerated by the pandemic and our new operating environment. Research and innovation have been crucial in helping us contain and to eventually end the pandemic. They are equally important for driving economic growth and building a more resilient society post-COVID.
 
While much has changed in the last one year, often irrevocably, one thing has remained constant — and that is our commitment to research and innovation. The Council endorsed our RIE2025 plans — our plans for the next five years. I thank our RIEC members — who include global leaders in business and academia — for their support and contributions. RIE2025 will play an important role in creating new opportunities for our workers as well as tackling national needs, such as an ageing population and climate change. 
 
I will be announcing the details of RIE2025 tomorrow.

214,"Concluded substantive discussions at the 16th Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) meeting which I co-chaired with PRC Vice Premier Han Zheng today. This year’s JCBC is of special significance as we mark 30 years of diplomatic relations and also convened the meeting despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19.

Our substantive agenda this year reflects the strength of our cooperation. We added a new agenda item — public healthcare cooperation. This is timely given the pandemic, and as we tackle the common challenge of our ageing populations. 

To recover from this crisis, Vice Premier Han and I also discussed how to strengthen connectivity between Singapore and China. We expressed willingness to discuss ideas to open up borders, and restore normal people-to-people exchanges, at an appropriate time. 

We also reviewed the good progress made by our three Government-to-Government projects in Suzhou, Tianjin and Chongqing, as well as the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City and Singapore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative.

As a regional trade, finance and logistics hub, Singapore can contribute to China’s “dual circulation” strategy — to develop its domestic economy while deepening its linkages with other economies.
 
Economic cooperation will also create opportunities for our workers and businesses, as we grow our industries as part of our Industry Transformation Maps. We must press on with economic transformation and building deeper economic cooperation. 
 
I look forward to building stronger ties with China, and to co-chairing the 17th JCBC with Vice Premier Han next year.

Resuming general air travel to cities with low incidences of COVID-19 is key to restoring our global connectivity, and to reviving our aviation, aerospace and tourism sectors. Many jobs and businesses are at stake. 

Yesterday, @ongyekung announced the launch of the Singapore-Hong Kong Air Travel Bubble. This scheme will start with one flight of up to 200 travellers into each city daily and will be expanded over time if the arrangement works well. Travellers to Singapore will be tested before they fly and are expected to use the TraceTogether app or token.

This is an important step, as we move towards a new normal for air travel. We look forward to welcoming more visitors at @changiairport and more @singaporeair planes in the skies.

As we open up our borders and head towards Phase 3, we must continue to expand our testing capacity, strengthen contact tracing and remain vigilant. This way, we can gradually resume a sense of normalcy while keeping out new waves of infections.

⁣
This popular market and food centre re-opened in June after a four-month renovation. It is known as one of the best breakfast and late-night supper places in the east. Glad to hear from Fengshan residents that the upgrading has led to a more pleasant dining experience.&nbsp; I’m happy that the efforts of Cheryl and her volunteers are making a difference.⁣
⁣
I met many stallholders, some have been operating out of the market for decades. Some were second-generation stallholders. Business dropped sharply during the circuit breaker period. With the improving situation, I’m glad to hear that it has improved quite a bit. But most residents remain cautious about the economic outlook and are careful about their spending. So we are not back to normal yet.⁣
⁣
I was also glad to hear from many residents who thanked me and my team for our Budget measures. These have supported them in many ways. Our hawkers and stallholders have been very resilient and working very hard — so let us continue to give our support, and at the same time keep our habits of wearing masks and keeping our safe distancing.⁣
⁣
Looking forward to meeting more families and residents of East Coast at our next GRC walkabout as a team!⁣

This popular market and food centre re-opened in June after a four-month renovation. It is known as one of the best breakfast and late-night supper places in the east. Glad to hear from Fengshan residents that the upgrading has led to a more pleasant dining experience.&nbsp; I’m happy that the efforts of Cheryl and her volunteers are making a difference.⁣
⁣
I met many stallholders, some have been operating out of the market for decades. Some were second-generation stallholders. Business dropped sharply during the circuit breaker period. With the improving situation, I’m glad to hear that it has improved quite a bit. But most residents remain cautious about the economic outlook and are careful about their spending. So we are not back to normal yet.⁣
⁣
I was also glad to hear from many residents who thanked me and my team for our Budget measures. These have supported them in many ways. Our hawkers and stallholders have been very resilient and working very hard — so let us continue to give our support, and at the same time keep our habits of wearing masks and keeping our safe distancing.⁣
⁣
Looking forward to meeting more families and residents of East Coast at our next GRC walkabout as a team!⁣

There was extensive debate on our economy. I set out the broad strokes of our economic strategy in my Ministerial Statement. And as we emerge from the worst of the crisis, we must redouble our efforts to help our companies transform and our workers upskill.

Unlike other countries, Singapore is both a city and a nation. Managing this unique dual identity will be critical to our success. Stay open to the world while forging our own identity. Stay globally connected while remaining independent. Embracing diversity while being socially cohesive. This dual identity has also enabled us to stay nimble in our fight against COVID-19.

Members also made many points on our fiscal situation. There continues to be great uncertainty on how the pandemic will evolve and the course of economic recovery. We all want to ensure Singapore is here for the long haul. So we must continue to spend in a principled and prudent way, and hand over to our children more than what we inherited from previous generations.

Our fight against COVID-19 is far from over. But I am confident that as long as we stay open and united as well as retain our core values, we will emerge stronger as a cohesive and resilient nation.

At this stage of the crisis, my team and I are fully committed to support our workers and businesses by refining our policies, expanding outreach and improving implementation, to make the most of the $100 billion committed to the fight against COVID-19. We hope that businesses and workers can make the best use of the measures that have been committed
 
The discussions yesterday have given us a better sense of the pain points of jobseekers and businesses, opportunities for collaboration in the coming months, and new ideas that we can develop for Budget next year. Many businesses and jobseekers are going through a tough time. But with the support measures in place and by working closely together, we can help businesses stay viable and keep workers employed. Just as important, we must look to the future and aim to emerge stronger.",2020-10-03 00:28:52+00:00,A great visionary and finance leader! *DW,2020-10-03 09:35:16+00:00,7

430,"Opened the FutureChina Global Forum 2020 this afternoon. The theme for this year is on how Singapore can contribute to China’s and ASEAN’s growth and build a more resilient future. 

I shared that countries must remain open and connected to the world and undertake adjustments so that globalisation works for them. Singapore can do its part by strengthening connectivity with the region. And in an era of tremendous change, businesses must forge new partnerships to emerge stronger from this crisis. You can read my speech here: https://go.gov.sg/fcgf.

This year marks thirty years of Singapore-China diplomatic relations. Next year, we will commemorate three decades of China-ASEAN dialogue. However, our ties go way back. More than a thousand years ago, there was already a vibrant trading network between China and Southeast Asia, and between our region and the world. 

This trading network and the bonds of our peoples have been resilient, ebbing and flowing over the last ten centuries. With such strong foundations, I am confident that we can emerge from this pandemic to a brighter and more resilient future for our peoples and for the world.

世界各国必须确保它们的经济和全球贸易体系保持互联互通。新加坡也正在努力，跟区域国家和世界各国在贸易，数码互联互通及人员流动方面加强合作。在这个瞬息万变的时代，企业更必须注重合作，共同应对未来的挑战，同时把握新机遇。
 
今年是新中建交的30周年。新加坡会继续加深和中国的双边关系。当然，新中两国的合作，以及两国人民的往来，可以追溯到更久以前。只要我们共同努力，就能为后疫情时代做好准备，为人民创造一个更美好的未来。

When I met jobseekers and employers at the Trade and Connectivity Career Discovery Job Fair last Friday, together with Secretary-General @ng.chee.meng and his team at @ntucsingapore — many were understandably concerned about the future. The jobseekers I met were resilient, looking to adapt and take on new roles. Two of them were ICT professionals — who lost their jobs when their projects could not proceed due to the economic uncertainty. They were exploring job opportunities in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that were on offer at the Fair.
 
Despite the economic situation, I am glad that some companies are doing well and still hiring. @ilovee2i and @skillsfuturesg career coaches were on site to help our jobseekers. One lady, who lost her job in marketing at a MNC, decided to try a new area that more directly helped others. She discussed her options with an e2i career coach and told me that the coach gave her good advice.
 
So far this year, e2i, @workforcesingapore, and their partners have helped place at least 25,000 jobseekers, while providing career advisory and job search assistance to more than 35,000. I am glad that the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package is helping our workers and businesses, and our strong tripartite partnership is working well to help us weather this crisis and emerge stronger.

478,"I spoke about how the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many businesses in my Ministerial Statement on Monday. Companies that have remained agile and invested in innovation have been able to pivot to new opportunities during this crisis.
 
I visited one such company — Forefront Medical Technology (FMT) — today. Forefront Medical, a precision engineering company, has been actively venturing into new business lines even before the pandemic. Originally focused on making medical products for drug delivery and respiratory care, they started building up automation capabilities, adding cleanroom capacity and growing their local talent pool.
 
When COVID-19 struck, Forefront Medical expanded into manufacturing products for COVID-19 diagnostics, including the production of swabs. Forefront Medical also hired 80 more staff to meet the increase in production demand.
 
Even in the midst of the crisis, there are still pockets of growth. There are many other companies like Forefront Medical, which are growing and hiring. The Jobs Growth Incentive, which I announced on Monday, will support these companies in increasing their local workforce, with more support for our mature workers. And we hope to better match jobseekers to these new opportunities.
 
In this fast-changing environment, all of us — businesses, workers and governments — will have to remain nimble and quickly adapt.

484,"This afternoon, I outlined how the Government will continue and evolve our support for our workers and businesses.

The COVID-19 pandemic rages on in many parts of the world, and the global economy remains very weak. The Government will continue to help our workers and businesses through this crisis.

• First, we will continue to protect jobs by extending the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for up to seven months. We will adjust the level of support based on the pace of recovery of the different sectors. Most businesses will receive wage support for 17 months in total, up to March 2021.

• Second, we will encourage businesses that are growing to hire and increase their local workforce, through the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI).

• Third, we will continue to help those who have fallen on hard times, by extending the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) till Dec 2020. We are also studying how to continue supporting vulnerable employees and self-employed persons beyond 2020.

In addition, we are also providing additional targeted support for sectors that are hardest-hit, such as aerospace, aviation and tourism. We will also strengthen our transformation efforts to capture new opportunities, create better jobs, and reimagine our economy.

The measures announced today will cost $8 billion. We intend to fully fund them by reallocating funds from expenditures that have been delayed due to COVID-19. There are no plans to draw on Past Reserves for these measures, beyond what was approved earlier.

The situation continues to change very rapidly. We must continue to remain nimble and adapt as the pandemic progresses, and will further evolve our support if required. We have also started preparation for #Budget2021.

486,"This afternoon, I outlined how the Government will continue and evolve our support for our workers and businesses.

The COVID-19 pandemic rages on in many parts of the world, and the global economy remains very weak. The Government will continue to help our workers and businesses through this crisis.

• First, we will continue to protect jobs by extending the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for up to seven months. We will adjust the level of support based on the pace of recovery of the different sectors. Most businesses will receive wage support for 17 months in total, up to March 2021.

• Second, we will encourage businesses that are growing to hire and increase their local workforce, through the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI).

• Third, we will continue to help those who have fallen on hard times, by extending the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) till Dec 2020. We are also studying how to continue supporting vulnerable employees and self-employed persons beyond 2020.

In addition, we are also providing additional targeted support for sectors that are hardest-hit, such as aerospace, aviation and tourism. We will also strengthen our transformation efforts to capture new opportunities, create better jobs, and reimagine our economy.

The measures announced today will cost $8 billion. We intend to fully fund them by reallocating funds from expenditures that have been delayed due to COVID-19. There are no plans to draw on Past Reserves for these measures, beyond what was approved earlier.

The situation continues to change very rapidly. We must continue to remain nimble and adapt as the pandemic progresses, and will further evolve our support if required. We have also started preparation for #Budget2021.

We are faced with an extraordinary crisis, but we are one people with extraordinary courage, commitment, and can-do spirit. We can beat this crisis as one people, and emerge stronger as a nation.

537,"I will be making a Ministerial Statement next Monday on how we will continue our support for workers and businesses during this crisis.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues unabated in many parts of the world. Since May, the total number of cases has tripled to 20 million. The global economy has taken a very severe hit, and the situation could get worse.
 
In Singapore, we experienced our worst quarterly GDP performance on record in the second quarter. We have provided significant support for workers and businesses with almost $100 billion over four Budgets, with more than half coming from our Past Reserves. However, given the global economic and health crisis, we are likely to see more job losses and retrenchments in the coming months, and it will be many more months before our economy recovers fully. Even then, it will not be back to business as usual.
 
As we gradually re-open our economy, the recovery across industries is likely to be uneven and uncertain. Many sectors are gradually regaining their footing as economic activities resume. A few sectors are growing and even hiring. But several sectors have been very hard-hit and are unlikely to recover for some years to come.
 
Over the past few weeks, many people have shared with me their anxieties and concerns about their livelihoods. Weighing on their minds was also the uncertainty ahead, given that some of the support schemes are expiring. I will be providing more details on how we will evolve and extend our support for our companies and our workers in my Ministerial Statement on Monday.
 
We will continue to support our workers and firms through this crisis. But we are not able to sustain the same level of support indefinitely. As more sectors re-open gradually, we will have to evolve and taper the support provided. We will continue to provide targeted support to sectors that are hardest hit, including helping them pivot to new opportunities in growth areas. 
 
We are committed to walk this difficult journey with you. Together, we can overcome this crisis and emerge stronger as one people.

⁣
Our discussion took place against the backdrop of our worst quarterly GDP performance on record. The economic situation is severe. The road to economic recovery will be long, and the impact on our labour market could further deepen. We discussed the effectiveness of the support measures rolled out in the last few months, which has helped companies keep workers employed.⁣
⁣
Some support schemes, such as the Jobs Support Scheme, are ending soon. Participants acknowledged that these schemes cannot continue indefinitely, but asked how support for our businesses and workers will change in the coming months. I assured them of our continued commitment to support our workers and companies. I have also been having intensive discussions with our agencies to review and evolve our schemes as the situation develops.⁣
⁣
Despite the challenges, it was uplifting to hear how some of them have coped with the crisis. Some are pivoting away from their current businesses to new areas that played to their core strengths. Many have accelerated their digitalisation plans and are offering more services online. Some are sourcing for opportunities abroad through online business engagements. In the process, they are also reskilling their workers and redesigning jobs to take on these new opportunities. There were also many ideas on how we can work better in tripartite partnership during this crisis, including helping our people build new skills and adapt to the post-COVID world.⁣
⁣
Overall, the gravity of our economic situation weighed heavily on the minds of our business and union leaders. But in the midst of this crisis, I am heartened that they saw opportunities and possibilities.

555,"This morning, I visited the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centre at Kampong Chai Chee CC @ Heartbeat Bedok with Minister @joteo.ylm and MOS @kiathowsg. We spoke to jobseekers and career ambassadors from @workforcesingapore to better understand their needs and challenges. This is one of eight such Centres across the island, with new locations coming up soon.

The latest employment numbers show that the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market has deepened, but we have avoided a spike in unemployment because of the support measures provided over the four Budgets.

The National Jobs Council has been working closely with industry partners and @ntucsingapore to create jobs, traineeships and skills training opportunities for our people under the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. We have made good progress. So far, 18,000 job placements have been completed through the SGUnited Jobs Initiative. Another 65,000 jobs, traineeship and training places have also been committed.

In particular, we have received overwhelming support from our companies for SGUnited Traineeships. 6,400 companies have expressed interest to host over 35,000 traineeships. This is more than what we have expected, and we will be opening up the traineeships to mid-career individuals. This will provide more options for our jobseekers and companies, and improve their chances of finding good job matches when the eventual upswing happens.

I urge companies who are doing well to make full use of the tools under the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), to grow and to hire more workers. And I encourage jobseekers to keep an open mind and embrace the spirit of learning.

By working together, we can emerge stronger as an economy and as one people.

We have made good progress. So far, 18,000 job placements have been completed through the SGUnited Jobs Initiative. Another 65,000 jobs, traineeship and training places have also been committed.

In particular, we have received overwhelming support from our companies for SGUnited Traineeships. 6,400 companies have expressed interest to host over 35,000 traineeships. This is more than what we have expected, and we will be opening up the traineeships to mid-career individuals. This will provide more options for our jobseekers and companies, and improve their chances of finding good job matches when the eventual upswing happens.

I urge companies who are doing well to make full use of the tools under the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), to grow and to hire more workers. And I encourage jobseekers to keep an open mind and embrace the spirit of learning.

By working together, we can emerge stronger as an economy and as one people.

614,"During this period of economic uncertainty, many of our workers are going through a tough time. Our lower-income workers in particular, have less to fall back on.

As part of the Resilience Budget, I announced the Workfare Special Payment totalling $1.2 billion to help our lower-income workers. Around 400,000 lower-income Singaporean workers on Workfare will each receive $3,000 in cash to further help them with their expenses. They will receive half the payout in July, and the second half in October.

Workfare provides a wage supplement to our lower-income workers — a top-up of up to 30% of their salaries. Through a combination of cash and CPF top-ups, we help these workers with their immediate needs and also with their retirement adequacy.

An integral part of Workfare is the additional support for training. Taken together with @skillsfuturesg and the Progressive Wage Model, we have a strong ecosystem of support to uplift our lower-wage workers in a sustainable way.

At a time when many workers around the world are experiencing wage stagnation, our lower-wage workers have experienced strong real wage growth — averaging more than 4% per year in the last five years, faster than the growth in median wages.

646,"During this period of economic uncertainty, many of our workers are going through a tough time. Our lower-income workers in particular, have less to fall back on.

As part of the Resilience Budget, I announced the Workfare Special Payment totalling $1.2 billion to help our lower-income workers. Around 400,000 lower-income Singaporean workers on Workfare will each receive $3,000 in cash to further help them with their expenses. They will receive half the payout in July, and the second half in October.

Workfare provides a wage supplement to our lower-income workers — a top-up of up to 30% of their salaries. Through a combination of cash and CPF top-ups, we help these workers with their immediate needs and also with their retirement adequacy.

An integral part of Workfare is the additional support for training. Taken together with @skillsfuturesg and the Progressive Wage Model, we have a strong ecosystem of support to uplift our lower-wage workers in a sustainable way.

At a time when many workers around the world are experiencing wage stagnation, our lower-wage workers have experienced strong real wage growth — averaging more than 4% per year in the last five years, faster than the growth in median wages. We can and we will continue to invest in and support our lower-wage workers, so that they can continue to learn and grow. 

Our commitment to Singaporeans is that even as we create new opportunities, we will ensure no one will be left behind by progress. We will enable every worker to make a better living, as long as they are willing to work hard. 

You can refer to the @mof_sg press release for details on the Workfare Special Payment: go.gov.sg/workfarespecialpayment.

653,"By bringing the best of everyone together, we can be much greater than the sum of our parts. This is especially true in times of crisis, and if we are to emerge stronger as an economy in a post-COVID world. Success will require stronger partnerships across all stakeholders and across our entire economy.

To spur greater collaboration in critical areas for our businesses, we will be launching a series of seven National Innovation Challenges today on our Open Innovation Network. These challenges range from how we can strengthen productivity of our air and shipping sectors, to how we can safely re-open our construction, tourism and MICE activities. You can find out more here: www.openinnovationnetwork.sg/national-innovation-challenges.

Through these efforts, we also hope to build a stronger culture of innovation here in Singapore — among individuals, companies, trade associations, research and academic institutions, and the Government. In an increasingly complex and uncertain world, our ability to work together and innovate will give us an edge in seeking opportunities at home and abroad. Our strengths at home will enable us to contribute to the global community.

By working as #SingaporeTogether, we can emerge stronger from this crisis. Not just as an economy, but also as a society and one people.

669,"More than $4 billion will be disbursed in the July payout of the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), which was introduced to save jobs.
 
Including this upcoming July disbursement, we would have flowed more than $15 billion to over 140,000 employers to support wage costs for 1.9 million local employees. 
 
The July payout will be based on wages paid out in the months of February to April. For the month of April, we had set the wage support at 75% support for all firms, to help them tide through the circuit breaker.
 
I urge all employers to do your utmost to retain your staff, and to take the opportunity to transform your operations and upskill your employees during this period. Together, we can emerge stronger from this crisis.

The effects of COVID-19 are severe, and the road ahead remains highly uncertain. I thank the leadership of Saudi Arabia in bringing the @g20org to advance collective efforts to counter the economic and social consequences of the global pandemic.
 
Tonight’s meeting was convened to discuss the progress of countries’ responses and how we can work together to gradually reopen. The path to recovery will be long and uncertain, especially with the fragile state of the global economy. But as long as countries remain committed to work together, we can overcome this crisis. I also called on G20 members to keep our economies open, connected and sustainable, so that we can all emerge stronger. 
 
In this crisis, we must tackle the risks to lives, to our economies and to financial stability. But the crisis also offers opportunity for all countries to strengthen our partnership within the G20 and with the various international financial institutions. Let us work together to rebuild a better future for our peoples.

Glad to hear from stallholders that the CDC vouchers have been very useful and effective for their businesses, especially during these difficult times. Many stalls have also been embracing and adapting to digital technologies to aid them in their business transactions.

I have also been very touched by the care and concern residents have shown towards me, often reminding me to take good care of my health and to get ample rest. I have been taking my health very seriously after recovering from a stroke, and I make an effort to exercise daily and opt for healthier food choices. Yesterday, to my surprise, I received an appreciation card from a stallholder with a thoughtful message — thank you for the sweet gesture, and for the care and enthusiasm. It spurs me on to want to do better and even more for East Coast residents, and for Singaporeans.

We hope our seniors can embrace and adopt technology effectively. To bridge the digital gap, the Government will provide more support, and work with businesses and the community to help our seniors learn digital skills to stay socially connected. One such example is the Mobile Access for Seniors scheme. Eligible lower-income seniors can purchase a basic smartphone from $20 and subsidised mobile plan. This will help to address concerns about cost among seniors and encourage them to go digital.
 
Let us continue to work together to secure our future.

很高兴受邀参加昨晚的凤山活跃乐龄歌台直播秀。这是我第一次参加网络歌台节目。
 
这个节目主要是让凤山的年长者观赏娱乐表演。因为受到疫情影响，凤山活跃乐龄组的义工们把节目搬上网，让年长者不用出门，也可以在家里享受娱乐。这就是社交媒体和新科技能带给我们的好处。
 
冠状病毒疫情对我们的生活造成了巨大的影响。为了适应新常态，我们需要调整生活。数码 科技让我们可以不出门，依然过着活跃的生活。多年来，政府也通过一系列措施，与社区和 企业携手合作，不遗余力推动数码化进程。最近，政府和电信业者合作，推出津贴计划，为低收入年长者提供负担得起的智能手机和配套。只要符合条件，年长者就可以用 20 块钱购买一台基本款的智能手机，方便他们随时用手机上网。
 
所以，我希望大家，尤其是年长者，继续积极学习和使用数码科技，享受网络所带来的便利，从中受惠。",2020-07-03 13:08:41+00:00,Together We Care @ East Coast ❤️,2020-07-03 14:38:05+00:00,5

⁣
Everywhere I went, I could feel the spirit of resilience. Businesses are getting active again. Residents told me which Budget measures have been most helpful. But I also got feedback from those who are struggling, and we will see how we can help them. I was assured to hear residents tell me how their MPs have reached out to them, and how local schemes have benefitted them. I can see that our PAP candidates are working for their residents. I am confident that they will keep their residents’ well-being central to all they do.⁣

Jobs are our most urgent task. The National Jobs Council has the heavy responsibility of creating as many new jobs and training opportunities as possible. We have made good progress since the first meeting three weeks ago. This afternoon, we went into specific areas on where we could create more job opportunities, such as the tech sector. I thank members of the Council, many from the private sector, and from @ntucsingapore, for their valuable inputs. Together, we can come up with specific measures and mechanisms, to better match job seekers to the jobs available, and to create new jobs and training opportunities.

⁣
In the 6th and final national broadcast, I spoke about how we shall not only overcome this crisis, we will emerge from it stronger — as an economy, as a society and as a people.⁣
⁣
We have committed almost $100 billion to protect jobs, keep viable businesses afloat, and support households. We are making a big push to create 100,000 job and training opportunities for those seeking employment. Had we not done so, we would have lost years of progress and an entire generation.⁣
⁣
While all countries are providing a cushion to their people, we are going further by investing to give everyone a springboard to bounce back from this even stronger.⁣
⁣
We have outlined our plans to do so — to grow our economy, create better jobs, strengthen our social compact, and safeguard everything we hold dear.⁣
⁣
To emerge stronger, we must draw on the wits and will of our people. When we launched the #SingaporeTogether movement a year ago, I promised that we would partner with Singaporeans to shape our future together. Now, in this crisis, partnership is more critical than ever.⁣
⁣
We will face the challenges ahead together with you, all the way. We will fight COVID-19 as Singapore Together.⁣
⁣
We will overcome this crisis of our generation. We will be a generation that emerges stronger.⁣

⁣
I had briefed Madam President and the CPA twice over the past few months on the COVID-19 crisis and the Government’s response. We had comprehensive discussions on the nature of the virus, the extent of the crisis, and the thinking behind the Government’s plans. COVID-19 is a global pandemic and the deepest economic crisis since Singapore’s Independence. But thankfully, because of the discipline and foresight of past generations, who saved for a rainy day, we have our national reserves to depend on today.⁣
⁣
So as we emerge from the storm, which we surely will, let us too fulfil our duty of stewarding the past reserves for future generations.⁣

890,"When I was planning for #SGBudget2020, I had consultation sessions with various groups, including businesses, unions and social service agencies, to better understand the needs of the people they are serving.

Our Community Development Councils (CDCs) serve our people in different regions of Singapore. So I asked our five Mayors of the CDCs — @lowyenling.sg, @denisephua, @desmond.choo, @maliki_osman, @teo_ho_pin, if we could do more, given the uncertainty with COVID-19. They told me that over and above our national-level support schemes, the CDCs have been providing targeted support in the neighbourhoods. I agreed to support them in their outreach.

Today, I joined the five Mayors and the President of the Federation of Merchants’ Association, Yeo Hiang Meng, for the virtual launch of the CDC Vouchers Scheme. The CDCs have now set aside $20 million to provide vouchers for up to 400,000 eligible Singaporean households. They also want to support the many small businesses in our neighbourhoods, which have been hard hit by COVID-19. I am glad that during the circuit breaker period, the CDCs have reached out to our hawkers and neighbourhood shops through various digital means, to sign up 2,500 participating merchants. I hope more will come on board.

This strong collaboration approach to supporting families in need — with the Government, the grassroots and community each doing their part — is one way to help us see through the storm. I thank Hiang Meng, our Mayors, and volunteers for their hard work. I also thank our merchants and hawkers for signing on.

This scheme is a ‘two-in-one’ — we hope to help families cope with the cost of living, and help our hawkers and merchants during this difficult period. Let us continue to be creative to find good ways to support one another. This is the #SingaporeTogether spirit to build a more caring society and to emerge stronger.

What will set our youths for success is the willingness to take the initiative and make the most of what they have. By turning anxiety into action, they can build a better tomorrow. This was my main message to our youths when I addressed them at the @young.ntuc’s LIT DISCOvery symposium this evening.⠀

You can refer to the @mof_sg press release for more details at go.gov.sg/careandsupport-cash. Including the $1.6 billion to be paid out in June, we would have disbursed a total of $3.5 billion to households.

I hope this will alleviate the expenditure concerns of our families. Some of you have donated your Solidarity Payment. You can consider doing likewise for this cash payout to a good cause at www.giving.sg.

965,"The National Jobs Council, chaired by Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, held its first meeting today.⁣
⁣
This Council is a tripartite partnership, formed to oversee the creation of job opportunities and skills training for our people during this crisis, as many livelihoods are at stake. I announced at the Fortitude Budget that I have appointed SM Tharman to chair the Council. He agreed readily, and invited me to be an advisor. I joined the Council for the first meeting.⁣
⁣
We had a good discussion on how to implement the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package — which aims to create close to 100,000 jobs, traineeships and skills training opportunities. I am glad to see the sense of urgency and the resolve among members to do our best in the face of significant challenges, to manage the employment situation. Our tripartite partnership — where businesses and trade associations, workers and @ntucsingapore, together with the Government, work together — is a great source of strength that serves our people well, especially in these difficult times.⁣
⁣
Beyond dealing with immediate challenges, the Council also had a very good discussion on how we must take this opportunity to prepare our workers to emerge stronger in the future. This supports the work of the Emerging Stronger Taskforce that I appointed Minister @desmond.lee and Mr Tan Chong Meng to co-chair.⁣

I am confident that our spirit of working together, tapping on the energies and commitment of all, will once again enable us to come out of this crisis stronger.

971,"The Invictus Fund was set up by @ncss.sg to enable our Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to continue serving vulnerable segments of our society during this pandemic.

Many have donated generously, including Ms Anita Fam and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who each contributed $1 million to the Fund. Sian Chay Medical Institution, a charity that provides TCM treatment for the needy, also donated $1 million. These generous contributions will go a long way in serving our vulnerable. The Government will be providing an $18 million top-up to the Invictus Fund.

During the pandemic, many Social Service Agencies are facing a fall in donations. As part of the Fortitude Budget, the Government is also partnering the @toteboardsg to enhance the matching for donations through their Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme.

In addition, NCSS has established the Beyond COVID-19 Taskforce to help the sector take this opportunity to transform. I am glad that many Social Service Agencies are accelerating the adoption of technology to serve their clients better.

I encourage those who are coping well to come forward and support our Social Service Agencies and do your part to help the vulnerable among us. There are many ways you can give back to the society — by donating to the Fund (www.comchest.sg/TheInvictusFund) or other worthy causes at @giving.sg. You can also be a volunteer at SG Cares (www.sg/singaporecares). Your contribution can make a big difference to those in need.

Including the Fortitude Budget, we are committing almost $100 billion to support our businesses, households and frontline in this fight. We are also topping up the Contingencies Funds to $16 billion, which will provide us with additional ammunition to respond quickly.⁣

This is why I announced the $285 million Special Situation Fund as part of the Fortitude Budget. This will ensure that start-ups with a good growth record can remain viable during this period, and be better positioned.⁣

Start-ups are synonymous with disruption. While many of our start-ups are used to creating disruption, I am glad that they are also resilient to the disruption caused by our invisible enemy. The start-up spirit is strong among this group of entrepreneurs.⁣

⁣
In his first National Day Rally in 1966, our founding PM Mr Lee Kuan Yew said that our capacity to face up to situations, however unpleasant, was one of the great qualities for survival. He believed that we will progress as long as we reward initiative and resourcefulness. As long as whenever we face peril, our courage and resolve is never found wanting.⁣
⁣
Each generation has its own trials and tribulations. The COVID-19 pandemic is our biggest crisis since independence. The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting lives and livelihoods across the world and in Singapore. As we are re-opening our economy in phases, we will continue to support our viable businesses, especially those which are not able to open immediately.⁣
⁣
Jobs will be a key part of tomorrow’s Budget. The Jobs Support Scheme has helped many employers retain their workers. But a number have lost their jobs, and some are worried that they might be retrenched. We will support those in their jobs to learn and upskill. We will create new jobs for those seeking employment and create traineeships and other opportunities.⁣
⁣
We will also provide additional support for our social sector agencies, so that they can continue to help the vulnerable among us.⁣
⁣
These additional measures will require a further draw on our Past Reserves. I have briefed President @halimahyacob on our plans and she has given her in-principle support. I thank Madam President for her support. ⁣
⁣
The decision to use our Past Reserves has not been an easy one — we deliberated long and hard on this. Our past reserves were hard earned, and we have the responsibility of making every dollar count. I will outline the measures in Parliament tomorrow.⁣
⁣
The battle against COVID-19 will be a long one. Our generation must have courage in adversity, to adapt and to emerge stronger, just like our founding generation. This is why I have named the upcoming budget Fortitude.⁣
⁣
Moving forward with Fortitude — as we stay United as one people, remain Resilient in the face of adversity and stand in Solidarity with one another.

⁣
Ahead of my Budget statement in Parliament next Tuesday, I heard their views on how businesses across the various industries are coping with the pandemic, how effective our support provided over the last three Budgets had been, and what more we can do together.⁣
⁣
It was a candid session amongst members, including our tripartite partners. This is a difficult period for many businesses to tide over. The road ahead will be challenging and uncertain. How fast the global economy recovers depends on how well countries can contain the pandemic. There is still much uncertainty ahead, so we must be psychologically prepared.⁣
⁣
I am heartened that beyond suggestions on what more the Government can do, participants also discussed what companies have to do to adapt, and how we can strengthen tripartite collaboration across businesses, our labour movement and the Government.⁣
⁣
Many good ideas were raised. Some of these ideas will be built into our support measures. Others can be studied for the longer-term. I will be working on the ideas over this weekend as I finalise the upcoming Budget.⁣
⁣
Following the pre-Budget consultation, we had our first Future Economy Council (FEC) meeting of the year. The Emerging Stronger Taskforce gave an initial update to the FEC. I set up the Taskforce to study how the global economy will change after this massive disruption, and how Singapore businesses and workers can emerge stronger. Members gave suggestions on where else it could focus its efforts on, to enable our economy to stay resilient and to build new sources of dynamism.⁣
⁣
This has been a very fruitful morning. I learnt a lot. I thank members of the SBF Council and the FEC for your contributions. Beyond the ideas that emerged, I am greatly encouraged by their spirit of enterprise, determination and solidarity. The grit and resilience of our business leaders and workers will be critical in the months ahead, as we navigate turbulent waters ahead.⁣

Our discussion was centred on the COVID-19 situation in our countries, and around the world. We shared learning points on this battle — from measures to contain the spread of the virus, to support for our companies and households. We also discussed how we can steer our economies towards recovery as we gradually re-open, and explored areas to strengthen bilateral cooperation. We also reaffirmed our longstanding and multi-faceted bilateral relationship and the need to work with each other.

When the crisis started, we launched the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to provide wage support for our companies and help them retain local employees. Some companies have coped better than others. I am heartened that a number of them have come forward to return the first payment of JSS they received and to decline future payments. They include MNCs, financial institutions as well as other local enterprises across different sectors. I am very encouraged by their sense of responsibility and shared community. I hope their exemplary action will inspire other companies that are doing well to consider doing the same.

Besides returning the disbursement from the JSS, you may also consider contributing to charitable causes, such as the Invictus Fund (www.comchest.sg/TheInvictusFund) and other worthy causes at @giving.sg (www.giving.sg). Some companies and many individuals are doing so. I hope that you will also show recognition and appreciation for your workers who have stepped up during the circuit breaker period.

To all our companies — a big thank you for your commitment, your contributions and your confidence in Singapore as we fight COVID-19. By standing together and helping one another, we can overcome this crisis and emerge stronger. This is the spirit of our #SingaporeTogether movement. ⠀

But we are determined that there should be no lost generation in Singapore. We are doing our utmost to keep viable companies afloat and to preserve jobs. In a weak job market, we are creating traineeships and other learning opportunities for our students who are graduating.

We do not know what the 21st century will shape up to be post-COVID. But we are sailing into uncharted waters — surveying the new landscape, exploring new growth and opportunities, preparing to seize them when the storm passes.⠀
⠀
This is why I set up the Emerging Stronger Taskforce. We have two able co-chairs — @desmond.lee and Tan Chong Meng — leading this expedition. The Taskforce held its first meeting today. I thank Desmond and Chong Meng for leading this effort, and members of the Taskforce for their commitment to this cause. They will be inviting our people to share their views and co-creating ideas together. You can read more about their first meeting on go.gov.sg/est.

The Taskforce will present its recommendations to the Future Economy Council, which I chair, in phases. It is still early days. With conviction, determination and good planning, we seek to emerge stronger from this crisis, and create a better future for our people. In the process, we also hope to work with people globally to build a better world. ⠀

1130,"#MayDay started in Singapore as a public holiday sixty years ago to commemorate the strength and solidarity of our workers.

The 1960s was a turbulent period in our history, and for our workers. One pressing challenge then was to ensure that our workers could get a job, and to improve their lives. In those formative years, we forged our brand of tripartism — where workers and unions work with, rather than against, the Government and employers as co-drivers of our future. Over the years, tripartism thrived and with that, the lives of our workers improved year by year.

I have come to know our tripartite brothers and sisters well over the years — the passion and dedication of our union leaders, especially Sister Mary Liew and Brother @ng.chee.meng; and the commitment of our corporate leaders and employers. More recently, the Future Economy Council, which I chair, and the implementation of the Industry Transformation Maps, are important facets of tripartism at work.

Sixty years on, we are facing an unprecedented global pandemic and a looming global economic downturn, which is likely to be severe. The Government has committed a record $60 billion over three Budgets, to support our workers, businesses, and households.

These are challenging times for all of us. But the strength of our tripartite partnership will enable us to get through this rough storm, just as we had done before. The post COVID-19 world may be different, but as long as we stay strong and united, we can emerge stronger!

Each May Day, we commemorate the determination and solidarity of our workers. This year is especially important. I applaud all our workers — the dedication of our frontline teams, the tenacity of our migrant workers, and the resilience of those whose livelihoods have been affected. While we may not be able to save every job, we will take care of every worker. #everyworkermatters. This is our commitment to you. We are here with you, for you.

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the economy, both globally and in Singapore. Our companies are doing their utmost to keep their workers during this period, with the help of the Jobs Support Scheme. So it is no surprise that fewer of them are hiring. This was a similar situation in 2008-2009, during the Global Financial Crisis.

Singaporeans have had to adapt their livelihoods to the circumstances. I have come across many stories of this grit and resilience. Our graduates from ITE, polytechnics and universities this year will similarly have to adjust to the job market.

1153,"COVID-19 has put a tremendous strain on global supply chains and on the production of food, essentials and other goods.

As we import most of our food and essentials, we must be prepared to face some of these pressures, and at the same time, work with like-minded countries to keep supply chains and trade flows open, and accelerate our plans to produce some of our needs in Singapore, even if these take time.

On supply chains, Singapore has been working with several countries. Last Friday, Singapore joined 12 other countries to issue a Declaration on Maintaining Essential Global Links. We also concluded discussions with New Zealand on a similar declaration earlier last week. We hope more like-minded countries will join us in this commitment.

We are also accelerating our ‘30x30’ plan — to produce 30% of our food needs by 2030. @masagosz is leading a Taskforce to oversee this effort. As part of the Resilience Budget, @sgfoodagency has also set-up a “30x30 Express” grant to support our agri-food industry in this endeavour.

We have the potential to produce more of our food needs locally. Earlier this month, I visited Apollo Aquaculture Group and Max Koi farm. I saw how our farms use innovation and technology for high-density and high-quality fish farming.

We will redouble our efforts to support our companies to ramp up local production and strengthen food resilience. You can be part of this effort too — by buying more local produce, even though they might cost slightly more.

At a time when global food security is of increasing concern, we have to pursue a multi-pronged strategy to secure our food needs, for the immediate, and for the longer term.  And each of us can do our part, by not wasting food. (PMO Video by Arina Ong)",2020-04-20 03:39:56+00:00,👍👏💪❤️Love local produce - safer & fresher.

As part of the Government’s efforts to help companies and workers with both cash and cashflow during this trying period, the implementing agencies have been working very hard to bring forward the first payouts under the Jobs Support Scheme to April.

For this month, April, I also enhanced the Jobs Support Scheme wage subsidy to 75% for ALL sectors, as the “circuit breaker” measures are affecting all sectors. This will also be paid together with the first tranche from today.

I trust that business leaders will do their best, to retain their workers, and our workers will use this time well, to learn new skills.

Subsequent tranches will be paid in July and October later this year.

1167,"From today, more than 140,000 employers will receive their first payouts, to help cover the wages of over 1.9 million local employees. This is worth more than $7 billion, as I announced in the Solidarity Budget

As part of the Government’s efforts to help companies and workers with both cash and cashflow during this trying period, the implementing agencies have been working very hard to bring forward the first payouts under the Jobs Support Scheme to April.

For this month, April, I also enhanced the Jobs Support Scheme wage subsidy to 75% for ALL sectors, as the “circuit breaker” measures are affecting all sectors. This will also be paid together with the first tranche from today.

I trust that business leaders will do their best, to retain their workers, and our workers will use this time well, to learn new skills.

Subsequent tranches will be paid in July and October later this year.

We had three Budgets in 48 days. Our challenge now is to implement these measures well. Cash flow is a concern for many businesses and households. So we are doing our best to reach as many as we can, as fast as possible.

I shared that we will be disbursing about $9 billion to businesses and households this month. The first payment will be made this Tuesday — Singaporeans will be receiving their $600 Solidarity Payment. You can read more details here: go.gov.sg/sp2020.

Also updated listeners on the current COVID-19 situation, particularly the clusters in our foreign worker dormitories. Our immediate priority is the well-being of our foreign workers and to contain the spread. Beyond the outbreak, we should also look at what more we can do to take care of them.

The “circuit breaker” is one week in. I am glad many of you have remained at home, and have found creative ways to remain active and engaged, connect with your loved ones, and help those around you.

We had three Budgets in 48 days. Our challenge now is to implement these measures well. Cash flow is a concern for many businesses and households. So we are doing our best to reach as many as we can, as fast as possible.

I shared that we will be disbursing about $9 billion to businesses and households this month. The first payment will be made this Tuesday — Singaporeans will be receiving their $600 Solidarity Payment. You can read more details here: go.gov.sg/sp2020.

Also updated listeners on the current COVID-19 situation, particularly the clusters in our foreign worker dormitories. Our immediate priority is the well-being of our foreign workers and to contain the spread. Beyond the outbreak, we should also look at what more we can do to take care of them.

The “circuit breaker” is one week in. I am glad many of you have remained at home, and have found creative ways to remain active and engaged, connect with your loved ones, and help those around you.

Stay home, stay strong, and we will all emerge stronger.

1282,"Today marks the first day of the one-month “circuit breaker”. I was reminded of this when I drove to Parliament today. Traffic was light and I only saw a handful of pedestrians on the streets.

Over the last two days, MPs rose unanimously to speak in support of the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Taken together with what we have set aside in the Unity Budget, we are committing almost $60 billion in our response to COVID-19.

The Resilience Budget provides sustained support for our businesses, workers and households for the rest of this year. The Solidarity Budget gives a boost to help them tide over the period of circuit breaker. Our priority now is to ensure that the payments flow to our businesses and households quickly.

We are navigating in uncharted waters, but we are confronting the crisis from a position of strength.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob’s support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come — when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

1311,"Today marks the first day of the one-month “circuit breaker”. I was reminded of this when I drove to Parliament today. Traffic was light and I only saw a handful of pedestrians on the streets.

Over the last two days, MPs rose unanimously to speak in support of the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Taken together with what we have set aside in the Unity Budget, we are committing almost $60 billion in our response to COVID-19.

The Resilience Budget provides sustained support for our businesses, workers and households for the rest of this year. The Solidarity Budget gives a boost to help them tide over the period of circuit breaker. Our priority now is to ensure that the payments flow to our businesses and households quickly.

We are navigating in uncharted waters, but we are confronting the crisis from a position of strength.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob’s support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

We obtained President @halimahyacob’s support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come — when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

1355,"I presented the Solidarity Budget in Parliament today.

As we begin the one-month ‘circuit breaker’ tomorrow, this $5.1 billion Budget will help our businesses, workers, and households tide through the next four weeks.

The Solidarity Budget was put together on very short notice. It was introduced in Parliament even before MPs had the chance to debate the Resilience Budget. Unlike previous Budgets, we did not have the opportunity to consult extensively. But we relied on the various feedback we had received since the Resilience Budget — to design additional measures and refine previously announced ones. We also continued to take a tripartite approach to policy design and implementation.

Many of you have also told my colleagues and me that you are anxious about your cash flow. This is understandably a major concern now. We are therefore ensuring that the additional support reaches as many as we can, as fast as possible. Payments to businesses and households will start this month.

To fund these set of measures, I have sought and obtained President @halimahyacob’s in-principle support to draw on an additional $4 billion from our Past Reserves. The remaining $1.1 billion will be funded from this term of Government.

DPM Heng: The additional measures in the Solidarity Budget will cost $5.1 billion.

I have sought and obtained President @halimahyacob’s in-principle support to draw on an additional $4 billion from Past Reserves. The remaining $1.1 billion will be funded from the fiscal space of this term of Government.

Taken together, the Government’s response to COVID-19 will total almost $60 billion, or about 12% of GDP.

DPM Heng: I will take further steps to save jobs and protect the livelihoods of our people during this period of heightened measures.

I will help businesses preserve their capacity and capabilities, so that they are ready to resume activities when the circuit breaker is lifted.

I will also provide direct cash in hand for households, to help tide families through this difficult period.

To reach as many as we can, as quickly as possible — the enhanced measures in the Solidarity Budget are broad-based.

This is part of the Care and Support Package which I announced during #SGBudget2020. Each of these households will receive a GST Voucher – U-Save of up to $300 this month, or up to $800 over four quarters from April 2020 to March 2021, depending on their HDB flat type.

Larger families who are eligible can receive up to $1,000 or 2.5 times their regular GST Voucher – U-Save over the same period. The rebates will be credited to your household’s utilities account directly. I hope that these rebates can help ease concerns and support households for their expenses and bills.

The aviation industry has been one of the sectors hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

⠀
I visited @changiairport T3 on Monday to meet some of the ground staff and frontline workers and see how they have been coping. It was a sombre sight to see the quiet and near-empty departure gates, with many planes grounded on the tarmac. Despite this, morale on the ground remains high.⠀
⠀
I was also reassured to see and hear how the aviation sector’s leaders are working together on how we can help the sector recover and bounce back from this, stronger than before. This temporary shock to the sector will not be a permanent one, though it is likely to last longer than anticipated. In the Resilience Budget, I announced targeted measures for the aviation sector to help businesses retain workers and capabilities. Was encouraged to also hear how the enhanced Jobs Support Scheme will help tide through these difficult times.⠀

During this uncertain period, we will put cash in the hands of all families to help you cope.

I will triple the cash payout for all adult Singaporeans in the Care and Support Package announced in the Unity Budget. For families with young children, I will triple the additional cash payout as well. To further help needy Singaporeans with their household expenses, grocery vouchers will be tripled.

During this time, the Government will exercise greater flexibility on its fees and loans — freezing all government fees and charges for one year, from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021. We will also suspend all loan repayment and interest charges for one year, from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2021, for graduates who have taken a government loan for their university and polytechnic studies. All late payment charges on HDB mortgage arrears will be suspended for three months.

#SGBudget2020",2020-03-27 05:35:56+00:00,"Dear DPM, Finance Minister, good day to you. An extended Unity Budget is better than nothing. So, a big thank you. I try to re-absorb the new budget details, it is not bad a package, if possible, your Ministry can just fine-tune the package ""a bit here, a bit there"" to make it ""more fantastic"". You served Mr Lee Kuan Yew closely for many years. That speaks volumes of your (good) capabilities. After this budget, our next challenge is to fight / contain / eradicate this Covid-19 (Crisis). The Ministerial Task Force are doing well so far so good, though there are still more room for improvements. Another challenge is of course ensuring the food supplies and necessities supply chain will not be adversely abrupted. Suggestion : more red meats from New Zealand. Not sure if Taiwan is a good option for fruits / vegetables supply source. If so, highly recommend them as alternative. (I must confess I aint no expert in these foodstuffs supply chain NEA regulations etc). All said, not least, thank you once again for the hardwork and efforts. @leehsienloong @lawrencewongst @gankimyong @ongyekung @khawboonwan @teocheehean @indraneerajah ***** note : if possible, try to look into the possibility of setting up a large assembly line to produce our own masks in Singapore. This can help create some temp jobs too. Wearing masks help boost confidence & assurance. Maybe after everyone is wearing masks we can open up our business a bit (e.g. restaurants, pubs...etc) to boost our economy ? But for now with not enough masks better be safe in having ""social distancing"" which is a correct move. And, are our ventilators enough if touchwood, Singpore exploded like Italy ? US seems to be in a mess right now after they were caught unprepared by the sudden exploded outbreak. Not enough ventilators, masks etc. I am actually quite shocked by the US news, considering US is one of the ""richest, most high tech"" advanced countries in the world.",2020-03-27 07:14:51+00:00,314

1520,"I presented our Resilience Budget today, just five weeks after our Unity Budget. This is the first time in our history that we are tabling a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget.

I introduced measures worth over $48 billion — this is more than 7 times the $6.4 billion for support measures in the Unity Budget. With in-principle support from President @halimahyacob, the Government is seeking to draw up to $17 billion from our Past Reserves to fund these measures. This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

When future generations look back on this chapter in our history, it is not the Budget numbers they will remember. It is our resilient spirit, our determination, and our actions in a period of unprecedented disruption that will stand out — as one people standing together, supporting one another with strength, grit, and compassion.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available. Around you — there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

When future generations look back on this chapter in our history, it is not the Budget numbers they will remember. It is our resilient spirit, our determination, and our actions in a period of unprecedented disruption that will stand out — as one people standing together, supporting one another with strength, grit, and compassion.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available. Around you — there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures. This Resilience Budget, like everything else we do, is about working with you and for you, for Singapore.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available. Around you — there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures. This Resilience Budget, like everything else we do, is about working with you and for you, for Singapore.

1564,"I presented our Resilience Budget today, just five weeks after our Unity Budget. This is the first time in our history that we are tabling a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget.

I introduced measures worth over $48 billion — this is more than 7 times the $6.4 billion for support measures in the Unity Budget. With in-principle support from President @halimahyacob, the Government is seeking to draw up to $17 billion from our Past Reserves to fund these measures. This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

DPM Heng: The COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious crisis we have faced in a generation. We have been able to respond boldly and decisively to the outbreak in Singapore because we have forged a cohesive and resilient society.

To show solidarity with Singaporeans, all political office holders will take an additional 2-month pay cut, on top of the 1-month pay cut announced last month. President @halimahyacob, Speaker @chuanjin1 and Deputy Speakers Charles Chong and Lim Biow Chuan will take a similar 3-month pay cut in total.

The months ahead will not be easy, as the situation continues to evolve dynamically and unpredictably. We must continue to be on high vigilance, mentally and psychologically prepared for every scenario. The Government will lead the way. We will protect and advance the well-being and livelihoods of Singaporeans. We will take care of our people. We will leave no one behind.

DPM Heng: The Government has obtained President @halimahyacob’s in-principle support to draw up to $17 billion to fund measures to save jobs and our economy. Past Reserves can be drawn down only in exceptional circumstances, under a two-key system, if the President, after consulting the Council of Presidential Advisers, agrees with the Government’s proposal to draw on the Past Reserves in exceptional situations. The Government has scrupulously upheld this.

The COVID-19 pandemic is already a mighty storm, and is still growing. It is the sort of event that we had accumulated reserves for. Because we have prepared ourselves well, Singapore has the resources to meet this crisis with confidence.

1601,"[ FISCAL IMPACT ]

DPM Heng: The Government has obtained President @halimahyacob’s in-principle support to draw up to $17 billion to fund measures to save jobs and our economy. Past Reserves can be drawn down only in exceptional circumstances, under a two-key system, if the President, after consulting the Council of Presidential Advisers, agrees with the Government’s proposal to draw on the Past Reserves in exceptional situations. The Government has scrupulously upheld this.

The COVID-19 pandemic is already a mighty storm, and is still growing. It is the sort of event that we had accumulated reserves for. Because we have prepared ourselves well, Singapore has the resources to meet this crisis with confidence. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely, and do more as and when we need to.

1613,"[SUPPORT FOR SPECIFIC SECTORS ]

DPM Heng: On top of the broad-based support to help businesses address the three ‘C’s — cash, cost, credit, I will provide additional help to specific sectors that are most directly affected by COVID-19.

Sectors relying on tourism and international travel have been hit the hardest. The aviation sector sits at the core of this ecosystem.&nbsp;We will provide an enhanced Jobs Support Scheme to help retain local workers for businesses whose activities are based principally in the aviation sector. We will also introduce a $350 million enhanced aviation support package to fund support measures.

Apart from the aviation sector, other tourism-related industries have had a difficult time. We will also set aside $90 million to help the tourism industry rebound strongly, when the time is right.

In addition, sectors that involve a high level of human interaction will take a hit from the recently announced safe distancing measures. We will also support them accordingly.

1617,"[ SUPPORTING BUSINESSES ]

DPM Heng: The Resilience Budget will address the three Cs on the mind of every business owner now — cash flow, cost, and credit.

Cash is king, and we are doing our best to flow the payouts under the wage support schemes quickly, and to grant an automatic deferment of income tax payments of companies and self-employed.

To keep costs under control, I will enhance the Property Tax Rebate announced in the Unity Budget. Commercial properties which have been most badly affected — such as hotels, shops and restaurants — will pay no property tax this year. Other non-residential properties will benefit from a 30% rebate. I strongly urge landlords to fully pass on the rebate to tenants, by reducing rentals. The Government will lead by example by enhancing rental waivers.

Credit is another key business concern. I will further enhance our financing schemes so that even the hardest-hit businesses can continue to have access to credit. In addition, I will set aside $20 billion of loan capital in this budget. This will help to support good companies with strong capabilities, and catalyse private sector loan capital.

DPM Heng: Many Singaporeans are concerned about how they will pay their bills and household expenses if their livelihoods are affected during this uncertain period. We will put more cash in the hands of all families to help them cope.

The Care and Support Package announced in the Unity Budget will be enhanced - I willl triple the cash payout from the earlier announced quantum. The Workfare Special Payment will also be enhanced — each recipient will get an extra $3,000 in cash. I will triple the Grocery Vouchers given to them this year to $300.

In addition, to strengthen community partnership in support of workers and families, I will increase the amounts given to Self-Help Groups and CDCs.

For employees, our top priority is to help them stay employed. I will significantly enhance and extend the Jobs Support Scheme, to provide more impactful and sustained wage support. With these enhancements, a total of $15.1 billion will be allocated to support more than 1.9 million local employees under the Jobs Support Scheme.

For self-employed persons, we plan to provide direct cash assistance through the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme to help them tide over this difficult period. Eligible self-employed persons will receive $1,000 a month for nine months. We will also extend the Self-Employed Person Training Support Scheme to end-2020.

The SGUnited Jobs initiative will create about 10,000 jobs over the next one year. We will also have the SGUnited Traineeships programme to provide young people with opportunities to gain valuable work experience, so that we can emerge stronger from this crisis.

Yet measures on the medical front to contain the pandemic, both in Singapore and around the world, have made the second front of the battle — the economic front, even more difficult.

Altogether, we are putting $55 billion to support our people, amounting to 11% of our GDP. This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation.

The world has undergone tremendous change since. These are extraordinary times — as the world faces a global pandemic, an economic shock, and a test of the financial systems all rolled into one.

On this fifth anniversary, I asked myself — how would a nation that came of age under Mr Lee’s leadership deal with COVID-19?

While Singapore has never faced a situation like this in our history, we have been through many crises before. In our early years of nationhood, Mr Lee told us, “Never fear!”. We did not, and we came together as a united nation. This spirit of staying strong and united, showing resilience and caring for one another, will see us through these difficult times.

Our frontline heroes, public officers, community groups, and people are doing their part — demonstrating our strength in unity. But the outbreak has inevitably taken a big toll on our economy, with many jobs and livelihoods at stake.

While Singapore has never faced a situation like this in our history, we have been through many crises before. In our early years of nationhood, Mr Lee told us, “Never fear!”. We did not, and we came together as a united nation. This spirit of staying strong and united, showing resilience and caring for one another, will see us through these difficult times.

We had a robust and substantive dialogue as they candidly shared their immediate and long-term concerns and challenges. These covered many ‘Cs’ — cash flow, costs, capabilities and confidence. We will take the feedback into consideration for the second package.

As COVID-19 will be here to stay till the end of the year, or longer, we have to ensure that our measures are sustainable, to weather the impact of a prolonged outbreak.

I am glad that the flow of goods, including food supplies, will continue when the Order is in force. As Chun Sing explained, we have adequate stockpiles, diversified food supply lines, and alternative plans should existing supply lines be disrupted. We do not have all our eggs in one basket.

While the supermarkets in Tampines and other parts of the island were more crowded than usual, most shoppers are buying what they need. There is no need to panic buy.

#SGUnited (Taken today at NTUC FairPrice, Tampines Mall)",2020-03-17 12:37:44+00:00,"Dear Mr Heng, there are now many Spore citizens, PR returning from UK, USA and other countries with widespread covid-19. Self quarantine of 14 days at home will cause widespread spikes in the nation. Why so? All those who return could already be infected but show no symptom yet. When they stay home, they still mingle with their family members. Majority do not have the luxury of big homes and therefore impossible to be within the safe distant from each other. Realistically, many may not be disciplined enough to do the recommended procedures.  Assuming each family has average 5 people including the helper. Assuming that just 2 family members get infected by the one who returns from overseas, these 2 will go to school, to work, to eat, to socialise without knowing that they are also infected. Their neighbours will also get infected too. Can't imagine the spread with so many thousands returning members!!! Suggest that our govt place these group of returning citizens in designated venues for 14 days instead of returning to their home. This will be safer for the nation. A total lock-down will cause the nation much more than giving designated venues to house all those who returned from overseas regardless of which country whether by air, by rail or by road.  Drastic times require drastic actions but surely all SG citizens will stand united to win this battle together with our government.",2020-03-19 05:43:12+00:00,230

We discussed how the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation has affected global economies and the global supply chain, as well as its impact on Singapore and our economy. I shared that we are expecting the outbreak to last at least till the end of the year — that is why we must not let fear rule over our hearts and minds, and how we can pull through this together, as long as we support one another.

Our current priorities are to limit the spread of the virus and its impact on our economy. As a small and open economy, the fluid developments around the world will inevitably affect us in one way or another. We will continue to keep a close watch and adjust our approach accordingly.

⠀
新冠状病毒的继续蔓延为我们带来了许多不确定性。企业们的焦虑和忐忑，我感同身受。我鼓励企业先善用预算案的经济稳定与支援配套，协助企业继续运营，帮助工友保住饭碗。如果情况所需，我不排除推出第二个援助配套。

在经济放缓时，我们也鼓励企业养精蓄锐，继续深化企业能力，进一步加强转型的力度。所以，我将在未来经济理事会的框架下，成立一个工作小组，并会有商界领导以及商团商会代表加入，把危机化为机遇，越战越强。详情稍后公布。

Joined Lianhe Zaobao editor Goh Sin Teck together with fellow panellists as well as business leaders and members from our Trade Association Chambers (TACs) at Lianhe Zaobao’s #SGBudget2020 Business Forum today. ⠀
⠀
We had a robust discussion on the short-term and long-term economic issues affecting Singapore, especially the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. We also exchanged views on the effectiveness of the support measures that I announced during the Budget to counter the impact of COVID-19 on our economy. I shared that the Government is monitoring the situation closely and assessing the need for a second support package if need be.⠀
⠀
While we tackle the current challenges, it is important we continue to keep our eye on our long-term goals and needs. I will be setting up a task force under the ambit of the Future Economy Council — this will help encourage enterprises to turn challenges into opportunities and make use of this downtime to emerge stronger from the outbreak. More details will be released soon.⠀

It means we never walk alone. It expresses our confidence that Singaporeans will rally to tackle challenges, and go through thick and thin as one Singapore.

We are united in our determination to preserve and enhance jobs, as well as support businesses impacted by COVID-19. We are united in our confidence that Singaporeans come out of this outbreak stronger. As long as we stay united in resilience, trust and solidarity, and to build better lives for all in Singapore, we will get through this, together.

In this fight, our frontline workers, especially our healthcare workers, have shown outstanding courage and dedication. To show our thanks and support, we will award frontline workers up to 1 additional month of special bonus. We will also make a one-off COVID-19 grant to the Public Health Preparedness Clinics, to support them in their active role caring for patients with respiratory symptoms.

My colleagues and I will do our part to show solidarity with fellow Singaporeans who have been affected by the outbreak. All political office holders will take a 1-month salary cut. All MPs will take a 1-month allowance cut. President @halimahyacob informed me that she will join in. Senior public service officers will take a half-month cut.

Beyond COVID-19, our unity will set the foundation for Singaporeans to press on and write the next chapter of our Singapore story. All of this is within our reach, if we work as One Singapore. Above all, let us never stop thinking and working for tomorrow. #SingaporeTogether, Majulah Forever!

#SGBudget2020 has come amidst great uncertainty, as we confront the challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak. I understand Singaporeans’ concerns about the impact on our businesses and jobs. We will help workers and businesses through:

1. A $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package to help stabilise the economy as well as support our workers and enterprises. It will also provide for jobs and cash flow support to help businesses retain and retrain workers. Additional help will be given to sectors more directly impacted by COVID-19; and

2. A $1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help Singaporeans with their household expenses and cost of living, with adult Singaporeans getting a one-off cash payout of between $100-$300.

I also announced that given the current economic situation and our financial position, I would not raise our GST rate in 2021. We will consider the situation carefully before any changes. When we raise GST, we would have a $6 billion Assurance Package to help Singaporean households.

Our ability to have a strong Budget in these uncertain times is only possible thanks to our fiscal prudence over generations.

Beyond immediate challenges, this year’s Budget also presents our long-term strategic financial plan to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans to meet future challenges and seize new opportunities. We will continue to grow our economy, transform our enterprises, care for and nurture Singaporeans, build and secure our nation, while working together with Singaporeans so that we can advance as One Singapore, to build a home we will always call our own.

I also announced that given the current economic situation and our financial position, I would not raise our GST rate in 2021. We will consider the situation carefully before any changes. When we raise GST, we would have a $6 billion Assurance Package to help Singaporean households.

Our ability to have a strong Budget in these uncertain times is only possible thanks to our fiscal prudence over generations.

Beyond immediate challenges, this year’s Budget also presents our long-term strategic financial plan to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans to meet future challenges and seize new opportunities. We will continue to grow our economy, transform our enterprises, care for and nurture Singaporeans, build and secure our nation, while working together with Singaporeans so that we can advance as One Singapore, to build a home we will always call our own.

I thank the many people who participated in our Budget consultation sessions. I also thank my very dedicated team of officers in @mof_sg.

My colleagues in the respective Ministries will elaborate on these plans during the Committee of Supply debates in the coming weeks.

You can find more details at www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. Over the coming few days, I will continue to post updates on our key Budget measures. (MOF Photos)",2020-02-18 13:25:01+00:00,Thank you so much  Mr Heng❤️,2020-02-19 04:31:03+00:00,6
1785,"We are hours away from the Budget Statement, which I will deliver in Parliament tomorrow.

Usually, we try to settle the details as early as possible. This year, we could not, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The @mof_sg team has been putting in extra hours to track the fast-evolving situation, listening to Singaporeans’ suggestions, and coming up with targeted support measures. We have many young officers at MOF, and I had really hoped that they could have a nice Valentine’s Day with their loved ones last Friday. Instead, they asked for understanding from their partners, and worked with me through the night and over the weekend.

I have also been working closely with Cabinet colleagues involved in managing various facets of the COVID-19 outbreak. My thanks to all of them, and to @lawrencewongst and @indraneerajah, who are with me in MOF, and have been contributing to this Budget over the months.

#SGBudget2020 will include measures that were not on the table a month ago. We would not have been able to act quickly and decisively, if not for our deep reserves. I do not mean only our financial reserves, but also the reserves of strength, resilience, empathy, and resourcefulness among our public servants and fellow Singaporeans.

Without these, we would have been much worse off — financially and psychologically. My team and I would not be able to spend the last few weeks working on the stabilisation and support measures. We would instead be lying awake trying to project how much of a hit we are going to suffer, rather than what we can do to help our economy and people.

As Finance Minister, I am grateful for the efforts and sacrifices of not just one generation, but of many — going back to my illustrious predecessor Dr Goh Keng Swee, our first Finance Minister, and our Pioneer and Merdeka generations.

I am proud of our public officers, working selflessly on the frontline and in the backrooms. I am moved by our people whose acts of compassion inspire us. I am grateful for the deep reserves we have — of finances, but more importantly of friendship, care, grit. I will do my best to protect and grow these.

I have also been working closely with Cabinet colleagues involved in managing various facets of the COVID-19 outbreak. My thanks to all of them, and to @lawrencewongst and @indraneerajah, who are with me in MOF, and have been contributing to this Budget over the months.

#SGBudget2020 will include measures that were not on the table a month ago. We would not have been able to act quickly and decisively, if not for our deep reserves. I do not mean only our financial reserves, but also the reserves of strength, resilience, empathy, and resourcefulness among our public servants and fellow Singaporeans.

Without these, we would have been much worse off — financially and psychologically. My team and I would not be able to spend the last few weeks working on the stabilisation and support measures. We would instead be lying awake trying to project how much of a hit we are going to suffer, rather than what we can do to help our economy and people.

As Finance Minister, I am grateful for the efforts and sacrifices of not just one generation, but of many — going back to my illustrious predecessor Dr Goh Keng Swee, our first Finance Minister, and our Pioneer and Merdeka generations.

I am proud of our public officers, working selflessly on the frontline and in the backrooms. I am moved by our people whose acts of compassion inspire us. I am grateful for the deep reserves we have — of finances, but more importantly of friendship, care, grit. I will do my best to protect and grow these.

1835,"With the COVID-19 situation, taxi and private hire ridership has been affected. A $77 million point-to-point support package has been launched to provide targeted assistance for taxi and private hire drivers, help defray business costs and support affected drivers. This is done through a Special Relief Fund and a Government-@ntucsingapore Driver Care Fund.

Besides financial assistance, enhanced measures have also been put in place by the @ltasg, together with the MOH, Point-to-Point operators, the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA) — all to protect the health of our taxi and private hire car drivers, as well as their passengers.

Taxi operators conduct temperature screening at their premises daily. 300,000 surgical masks will be given to drivers to give to passengers who are unwell and need a ride to see a doctor or go to the hospital. Drivers have also been reminded to continue good personal hygiene habits, take their temperature, and clean and disinfect their vehicles more frequently.

We will continue to work with our tripartite partners to support workers in the sectors affected by the COVID-19. I will also be announcing more measures to help both workers and affected businesses in my #SGBudget speech on 18 February.

Let’s continue to stay united and navigate through this challenging period together.
