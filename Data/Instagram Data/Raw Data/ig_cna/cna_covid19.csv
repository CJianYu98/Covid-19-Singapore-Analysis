But despite that, some restaurants and cafes have banded together to do their bit by funding meals for people working at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

These include Restaurant Labyrinth and Sanity Coffee (the photo shows, from left, the latter’s Diya Tan and the former’s chef-owner LG Han) as well as their friends at Keng Eng Kee Seafood, Jam At Siri House and Pezzo Group.

Han said: “Even if local F&B businesses don’t have money, we have food. We can make a difference through food.” How does the initiative work? It ranges from actual food and coffee deliveries to financial contributions. Read the story on CNA Lifestyle to find out how you can also chip in.

According to Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, many locally transmitted COVID-19 cases in Singapore ""were the result of the socially irresponsible actions of a few individuals"" who continued to attend events and activities despite being unwell.

To curb the spread of the coronavirus in Singapore, members of the public should avoid social contact and see a doctor early if unwell, he recently said.

How many bad eggs? About 35 out of the 160 confirmed cases in Singapore so far did not minimise social contact although they had already developed fever or respiratory symptoms, or had not consulted a doctor early when unwell. More than a fifth (22 per cent) continued to work or carried on with their daily routine despite being sick.

The urgent need for support from landlords is a sentiment many restaurant owners share. “There is so much rental pressure on restaurants where the operating cash flow is just two months out. If restaurants and retailers don’t get help from landlords, we cannot survive. (The landlords) have made so much money from us tenants over the last few years and now is the time they really have to step up to help us,” said Cynthia Chua of Spa Esprit Group, which includes establishments like Tiong Bahru Bakery.

Substantial rentals are not the only challenge facing Singapore’s restaurants today. “There’s a lot of uncertainty as to when produce is coming in. Right now, we can get fish locally or from Malaysia, but with meat (mostly from Australia), the worry is what will happen when stocks here run out” said Cheek and Cloudstreet chef-owner Rishi Naleendra.

But the greatest challenge is the lack of traffic. Relish’s Willin Low said: “If people stop coming out, then there’s no point in keeping a restaurant open.” Read the story on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #Singapore #food #restaurant #F&B #coronavirus #COVID19 #safedistancing #socialdistancing (Photo: Instagram/Tiong Bahru Bakery)","['This world pandemic changes the world how we do business.

Singapore’s Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong made the announcement on Apr 14. Individuals who are caught refusing to wear a mask will be fined S$300 on their first offence, while those who flout the rule a second time will be fined S$1,000.

Foreign residents caught breaching these rules might have their work passes or permanent resident status revoked.

There are some exemptions: Children below the age of two don’t need to, and adults who are exercising (running and jogging) only need to put once they stop.

But that begs the question – how do you clean your reusable cloth masks? Experts say you should wash it as often as you wash your underwear, meaning after every use. You should also boil it in water once in a while.

Instead, it’s back to the drawing board for the Virus Vanguard, Singapore’s anti-COVID-19 superhero team.

The five-member fictional team made its debut on the Gov.sg website on Apr 21 but was taken down less than a day, with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) saying it’s “undergoing a review” after receiving a lot of feedback about the characters.

Virus Vanguard was a collaboration between Gov.sg and art collective Band of Doodlers. The plan was to create a comic series to convey the different aspects of the ""circuit breaker"" measures aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. But some characters were criticised for too much levity while others felt the emphasis could have been on healthcare workers.

But one character drew much of the flak – MAWA Man, a Manchester United-supporting character who really doesn’t like Liverpool FC. The name, Must Always Walk Alone, was a jibe at the latter’s motto You’ll Never Walk Alone. An online petition by LFC supporters to withdraw the character received more than 500 signatures.

Band Of Doodlers founder Mas Shafreen has apologised, saying the characters “came across insensitive… A group of us, including myself, wanted to create superhero characters to show appreciation for our frontliners, including healthcare workers, and how we can battle this together.” Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #VirusVanguard #superhero #MAWA #YNWA #LFC #coronavirus #COVID19 (Photo: Gov.sg)","['how is anyone actually mad about this', '✍🏻👍🏻✍🏻', 'At least keep that hottie Care-leh Dee, muahaha... 😃😃😍😍 oh wait, must practice social distancing', 'Haha salty lfc fans', 'One bad decision after another!

But if you were thinking of ordering online a nice, refreshing cup of bubble tea to comfort yourself, that might be hard.

The list of essential services that will stay open during this period have been trimmed even further. That means specialised food and beverage outlets will have to shut for now, including outlets that “predominantly” sell drinks like bubble tea, fruit juice, smoothies, coffee, soya bean and alcoholic drinks. Popcorn stores, bak kwa shops, ice cream shops, outlets that mainly sell cakes, cupcakes, cheese and other desserts will have to close too.

And if you’ve got zero shaving skills, you might have to resign yourself to growing your hair out this circuit breaker period), as hairdressers and barbers will have to close their outlets.
