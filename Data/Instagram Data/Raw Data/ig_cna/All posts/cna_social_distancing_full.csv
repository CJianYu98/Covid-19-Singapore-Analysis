And that probably means hours spent in front of the TV. But prolonged sitting (and eventual slouching) will likely lead to stiffness and pain of the neck, upper back and lower back.

How do you minimise the pain? Don't forget to move around every 20 to 30 minutes. Neck, arm and leg movements, hand squeezes, marching on the spot and mini squats all help too, if you want to be more active.

The urgent need for support from landlords is a sentiment many restaurant owners share. “There is so much rental pressure on restaurants where the operating cash flow is just two months out. If restaurants and retailers don’t get help from landlords, we cannot survive. (The landlords) have made so much money from us tenants over the last few years and now is the time they really have to step up to help us,” said Cynthia Chua of Spa Esprit Group, which includes establishments like Tiong Bahru Bakery.

Substantial rentals are not the only challenge facing Singapore’s restaurants today. “There’s a lot of uncertainty as to when produce is coming in. Right now, we can get fish locally or from Malaysia, but with meat (mostly from Australia), the worry is what will happen when stocks here run out” said Cheek and Cloudstreet chef-owner Rishi Naleendra.

But the greatest challenge is the lack of traffic. Relish’s Willin Low said: “If people stop coming out, then there’s no point in keeping a restaurant open.” Read the story on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #Singapore #food #restaurant #F&B #coronavirus #COVID19 #safedistancing #socialdistancing (Photo: Instagram/Tiong Bahru Bakery)","['This world pandemic changes the world how we do business.

Yes, ghosts.

Volunteers dressed up as pocong – traditional ghostly figures in Indonesia that are typically wrapped in white shrouds with powdered faces – walk the streets to basically scare villagers into staying at home.

At first it didn’t work because people actually went out to catch them walking around, but organisers have since changed tactics – they’re now launching surprise patrols. And it seems to be working. According to one resident, “Since the pocong appeared, parents and children have not left their homes. And people will not gather or stay on the streets after evening prayers.” Boo!

It looks like that creepy robodog in that Black Mirror episode. Except that “this one’s a jaunty yellow,” he joked.

But Colbert said he preferred his dog to be “cuter, cuddlier and less dystopian” and suggested an alternative: The Bennybot 9000.
