He was supposed to perform on Feb 18 and 16, respectively, but no new dates have been announced.

But if you’re a 98 Degrees fan, you’re in luck – the group has also announced a new date for their own postponed concert, which will be on May 19. It’s been a series of one postponement/cancellation after another – ex-Spandau Ballet singer Tony Hadley’s own show has been pushed back to Oct 10.

Meanwhile, other big Singapore music fests such as Garden Beats and One Love Asia are still set to continue on Feb 29 and May 1 and 2, respectively. For now at least.

COVID-19 can survive on it for about 3 days'.","Aside from frequent hand washing, cleaning your phone often is another way to minimise your brush with germs, including the coronavirus. Think about it: Your phone is the first and last thing you touch daily, which means you’re putting an inordinate amount of microbes on it – and these thrive there because of the heat from the devices.

Citing a study done on the coronavirus, Dr Jyoti Somani of the Division of Infectious Diseases at National University Hospital pointed out that the virus can survive on common phone materials such as glass, metal and ceramic ""on average about three days in our local climate"", and ""a shorter period of time on aluminum.” If you’re afraid that cleaning with alcohol might damage your precious (and expensive) phones, try using a solution that’s one part rubbing alcohol (with an alcohol percentage of 70) and one part water to dilute it.

And it’s always best to use phone covers and have a screen protector – cleaning these is safer than a naked phone.

The 25th Bond film No Time To Die has been postponed to November because of COVID-19. The movie was originally meant to debut in April, but there are concerns it would severely hamper ticket sales for the movie.

The announcement was made on the official James Bond Twitter account. According to Variety, the outbreak has led to widespread closures of theatres in major regions such as South Korea, China, Japan and Italy. The magazine’s inside sources have also revealed theatre closures have had a big impact on profit margins, with revenues in markets like Hong Kong and Taiwan dropping by 50 per cent and sales in Italy grinding to a halt.

The U2 singer recently posted an original song on Instagram – a piano ballad titled Let Your Love Be Known, which was inspired by the story of Italians singing during lockdown.

The lyrics go: “You can’t touch, but you can sing across rooftops / Sing on the phone / Sing and promise me you won’t stop / Sing your love be known / Oh, let your love be known.” He continued with some encouragement: “Yes, there is isolation / You and me we’re still here / Yes, when we open our eyes we’ll stare down the fear.” Thanks, Bono.

But you might want to hold back on that prank you’ve been planning the entire year. Now’s not the right time – and in some countries, you might even get in big trouble.

From Thailand to India, countries have told people not to make April Fools' Day pranks related to COVID-19, with some threatening jail time as they seek to prevent the spread of rumours which could put lives at risk.

Tech giant Google, which is famous for its annual spoofs, has cancelled the tradition because of the pandemic which has killed about 40,000 people worldwide.

Thailand said April Fools' Day jokes about the virus could be punished under a law carrying a sentence of up to five years in prison, while Taiwan's president posted on Facebook that anyone spreading rumours or false information could face up to three years in jail and/or a fine of up to NT$3 million.

In India, Maharashtra state's cyber security unit said it would take legal action against anyone spreading fake news today, while Germany’s health ministry also urged the public not to make up stories related to the virus, under the heading “Corona is no joke.” #AprilFools #coronaisnojoke #pranks #COVID19 #coronavirus (Photo: AP)","[""Indian govt cant catch me if I'm using a virtual machine in another virtual machine.

After several hours, he edited the post to say he had gone too far, and also posted an apology note. ""I want to express my sincere apologies to the people who have suffered because of COVID-19 and to the people who were disrupted in their administrative work,” he wrote.

The urgent need for support from landlords is a sentiment many restaurant owners share. “There is so much rental pressure on restaurants where the operating cash flow is just two months out. If restaurants and retailers don’t get help from landlords, we cannot survive. (The landlords) have made so much money from us tenants over the last few years and now is the time they really have to step up to help us,” said Cynthia Chua of Spa Esprit Group, which includes establishments like Tiong Bahru Bakery.

Substantial rentals are not the only challenge facing Singapore’s restaurants today. “There’s a lot of uncertainty as to when produce is coming in. Right now, we can get fish locally or from Malaysia, but with meat (mostly from Australia), the worry is what will happen when stocks here run out” said Cheek and Cloudstreet chef-owner Rishi Naleendra.

But the greatest challenge is the lack of traffic. Relish’s Willin Low said: “If people stop coming out, then there’s no point in keeping a restaurant open.” Read the story on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #Singapore #food #restaurant #F&B #coronavirus #COVID19 #safedistancing #socialdistancing (Photo: Instagram/Tiong Bahru Bakery)","['This world pandemic changes the world how we do business.

Yes, ghosts.

Volunteers dressed up as pocong – traditional ghostly figures in Indonesia that are typically wrapped in white shrouds with powdered faces – walk the streets to basically scare villagers into staying at home.

At first it didn’t work because people actually went out to catch them walking around, but organisers have since changed tactics – they’re now launching surprise patrols. And it seems to be working. According to one resident, “Since the pocong appeared, parents and children have not left their homes. And people will not gather or stay on the streets after evening prayers.” Boo!

Singapore’s Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong made the announcement on Apr 14. Individuals who are caught refusing to wear a mask will be fined S$300 on their first offence, while those who flout the rule a second time will be fined S$1,000.

Foreign residents caught breaching these rules might have their work passes or permanent resident status revoked.

There are some exemptions: Children below the age of two don’t need to, and adults who are exercising (running and jogging) only need to put once they stop.

But that begs the question – how do you clean your reusable cloth masks? Experts say you should wash it as often as you wash your underwear, meaning after every use. You should also boil it in water once in a while.

The 99-year-old war veteran has become a celebrity by raising at least £6.4 million for Britain's health service with a walk around his garden during the COVID-19 crisis.

Captain Tom, who has used a walking frame to move around since breaking his hip, has set himself the target of walking the 25m around his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday later this month.

The story has lifted the hearts of a nation stuck in lockdown for the last month and weary of the relentless wave of grim news. Moore had originally aimed to raise £500,000 but that target has been smashed as media attention from around the globe has zoomed in on his garden in Bedfordshire, central England.

His son-in-law Colin Ingram said Moore wanted to give something back after receiving such good care from the state-run National Health Service (NHS) when he broke his hip two years ago and in subsequent hospital visits. ""We said we'd give him a pound a lap, and thank goodness I didn't say I'd match any money he raised,” quipped Ingram.

Raising money for the NHS has given Moore a new lease of life and the veteran has no plans to stop, even though he is due to hit his 100-lap target on Thursday morning.

Instead, it’s back to the drawing board for the Virus Vanguard, Singapore’s anti-COVID-19 superhero team.

The five-member fictional team made its debut on the Gov.sg website on Apr 21 but was taken down less than a day, with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) saying it’s “undergoing a review” after receiving a lot of feedback about the characters.

Virus Vanguard was a collaboration between Gov.sg and art collective Band of Doodlers. The plan was to create a comic series to convey the different aspects of the ""circuit breaker"" measures aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. But some characters were criticised for too much levity while others felt the emphasis could have been on healthcare workers.

But one character drew much of the flak – MAWA Man, a Manchester United-supporting character who really doesn’t like Liverpool FC. The name, Must Always Walk Alone, was a jibe at the latter’s motto You’ll Never Walk Alone. An online petition by LFC supporters to withdraw the character received more than 500 signatures.

Band Of Doodlers founder Mas Shafreen has apologised, saying the characters “came across insensitive… A group of us, including myself, wanted to create superhero characters to show appreciation for our frontliners, including healthcare workers, and how we can battle this together.” Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #VirusVanguard #superhero #MAWA #YNWA #LFC #coronavirus #COVID19 (Photo: Gov.sg)","['how is anyone actually mad about this', '✍🏻👍🏻✍🏻', 'At least keep that hottie Care-leh Dee, muahaha... 😃😃😍😍 oh wait, must practice social distancing', 'Haha salty lfc fans', 'One bad decision after another!

CNA Lifestyle recently had a quick email chat with Ho. “I think when the Black Lives Matter protests first happened, they were peaceful, until various groups with different agendas started hijacking the movement, rioting and looting until curfews were implemented. Won’t lie – that week was pretty stressful. I could hear sirens and police helicopters every night, and the occasional sound of gunshots. Later that week, there was also a report of an active shooter in my neighborhood, so that was slightly stressful,” he said.

The best defenses against bathroom contagions are a mask, social distancing, limiting the surfaces you touch with your hands and hand hygiene.

1. Consider larger bathrooms with multiple stalls because they have more air circulation.

2. If someone exits a bathroom stall or a single bathroom right before you, try waiting at least 60 seconds before entering – especially if the toilet seat lid is up, signifying more plume.

3. Skip the paper toilet seat covers. They are likely placebo – we have no idea if they offer protection from bacteria or viruses – and they could easily be contaminated with toilet plume, so touching them with your hands could be a source of infectious transmission.

4. If you need to dispose of a menstrual product in one of those little containers, touch the lid with a wad of toilet paper and sanitise your hands after. Those lids are among the worst surfaces in the bathroom stall: Touched by many unwashed hands and showered with infectious plume.

5. If the toilet has a lid, close it before you flush so it traps the plume. Think of the lid as a mask for the toilet.

6. If an automated toilet is flushing, step back because those things spray.

7. How you dry your hands after washing probably doesn’t matter; paper towels or dryers are likely equal. But do avoid shared, reusable hand towels.

8. Get out of there quickly. Chatting in bathrooms is the new smoking in bathrooms – it’s a relic of the past. If you have to open a door to exit, use hand sanitiser after you leave.
