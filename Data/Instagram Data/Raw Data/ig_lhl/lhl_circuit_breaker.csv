This year’s theme celebrates the work of nurses and midwives — a fitting one to salute the healthcare professionals working selflessly and tirelessly to care for patients in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. My deepest thanks to all of you for your dedication and commitment to save lives and bring comfort to the ill and infirm.

Our month long circuit breaker starts today. Let us all do our part to support our healthcare professionals by staying at home, and complying with the enhanced measures in place. – LHL

Glad that all Members of Parliament supported the measures. They raised useful ideas to improve the policies to support businesses, workers and households through this crisis.

While we deal with immediate challenges, we must keep an eye on the future too. The MPs raised a relevant question: we do need to use the reserves now, but are we being fiscally prudent enough? Will we still have enough reserves to do more later, if the situation calls for it?

When this is over, the past will not come back. Hence DPM @hengsweekeat set up two initiatives to think ahead — a taskforce on Emerging Stronger to cover the economy, as well as a new emphasis on social resilience under the Singapore Together Movement.

Beyond the Budget measures, it will be our own determination and discipline that will see us through, and keep us safe for the future. – LHL (An empty Orchard MRT station on the first day of a month-long ‘circuit breaker’. / MCI Photo by Fyrol)

Please share with your families and friends, especially older Singaporeans.

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. – LHL

I hope they are able to see what we are seeing, and have the faith in trusting that Singapore will do our best for their loved ones. Thank you for the meticulous efforts in taking care of the people. Beside those frontline measures that are reported, I appreciate the less mentioned efforts in place to keep the elderly active through e-Getai, exercise shows etc. The government didn’t have to, but they did. May I also suggest to use mass media to teach the elderly how to set up applications on their mobile phones to facilitate medical teleconsultations where appropriate. Many of them are on long term follow up for a variety of chronic diseases. They are the vulnerable group, yet are also the ones needing to go to hospital outpatient clinics most for routine follow up that may put them at increased risks. Some of them have the gadgets, but do not know how to maximize the use. Lastly, while a lot had been done, there is the group of old folks and/or less fortunate ones who are living alone and may not have access to technology via smart phones or TV. I have no better solutions how to help them at this moment but I know some may have heightened fears due to disempowerment from a lack of information and/or connection to the world beyond their four walls.

I thank you all for complying with the restrictions. While community cases have fallen, we still need to bring their number down decisively. We also want to make sure that if any cases leak from the migrant worker population into the wider community, we can detect and contain them.

That is why we are tightening the circuit breaker measures, e.g. thinning out crowds at hot spots like wet markets, and closing more workplace premises, till 4 May. We will also extend the circuit breaker itself to 1 June.

I know that this has not been an easy time. The circuit breaker is working, but we need to do a little bit more, and for a bit longer. Let us all do our part to beat the virus, break the chain of transmission, and overcome this together.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Fasting month this year will be markedly different. There will be no communal Terawih prayers, because mosques are all closed. Many would also be unable to break fast with their close family and friends, as they usually do. I hope you understand why the circuit breaker restrictions are being extended, to stamp out new COVID-19 transmissions and protect all of us.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I am glad that MUIS is providing many online resources, such as SalamSG TV to help foster the Ramadan spirit.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To all our Muslim friends, I wish you a blessed and fulfilling fasting month. May this Ramadan be a time of quiet reflection and prayer, together with your immediate families. – LHL

We discussed the COVID-19 situations in our two countries. Singapore is in the midst of the circuit breaker. India implemented a nationwide lockdown since late March, not a simple decision in a huge country of 1.3 billion people.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I thanked PM Modi for India’s help when we brought home some Singaporeans from India recently. I assured him that we will care for Indian migrant workers here, just as we care for Singaporeans. The migrant workers made personal sacrifices to come to work here. They have made many contributions to Singapore, so we have a responsibility for them.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Appreciate PM Modi’s affirmation of our efforts in looking after the migrant workers, and his assurance that they will not forget this.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
India and Singapore are strategic partners with extensive economic ties. We agreed to work together on the challenges posed by the pandemic, keep supply chains intact, and keep essential supplies flowing. – LHL

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

During this circuit breaker, many of us have gotten used to a new normal of telecommuting and ordering goods online. This has increased demand, and created new opportunities for business. Some industries, like retail, may never be quite the same again.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This has been happening all along, though not so suddenly as now. New industries are constantly emerging, and we must be ready for them. 50 years ago who could have imagined a job as a social media manager, or in biotech?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I said in my #MayDay speech yesterday that we are determined to help companies prepare for the new operating environment, and to retrain workers for the new jobs available. We can’t save every job, but we will look after every worker, and their families too.

I wish everyone a safe and meaningful #LabourDay. – LHL

I am juggling a lot working from home and teaching my kid at the same time that it is taking a critical toll on my mental and physical health.\nClosing school leads many people unemployed in an effort to take care of children during working hours, which eventually hit already dire economy situation even harder. Keeping school closed has to be considered very carefully taking all factors into consideration. In addition, every countries vary with respect to efficiency of closure of school. We cannot just follow other countries's case without taking into a unique Singaporean demographical charactor. For instance, Italy and UK that closed school have high rate of elderly population and two-thirds of workable adults live with their parents, which makes often three generations live in one household where normally grandmother take care of children when adults work. \nFor these European countries, closing school was a necessary measure taken  to stop the spread of virus through children to the vulnerable old.\nIf Singapore keep closing school, many households will have to hire Foreign Domestic Helper, which result in more outside mingling that has to be minimized at this stage, let alone those who cannot afford will end up losing their jobs with prioritizing child care at home.\nLastly, even if we close the school for little one, kids are kids and they will run around and mingle with neighborhood' childreb who you don't even  know their travel history. Conversely, at school they control who they interact with by handing out travel declaration forms in advance and putting those unwell in quarantine under the strong supervision of designated teacher.\nIn nutshell, I have heard that there has been no single case children were spreader of virus and closing school will do more harm than good. Opening school will help to stop all this emotional, mental and physical agony that it has put and bring children opportunities to learn better with social and emotional interaction with other children and teachers.

You may not be able to head outside yet, but I hope families will use this time to bond over activities at home. MOE is posting a stay-home activity idea on their Facebook Page every day. Our @nationallibrarysg librarians are holding weekday storytelling sessions for young children in the four languages on their @publiclibrarysg Facebook Page.

Some students taking their national exams this year will be returning to school on 19 May. But for the rest, as and when schools can safely reopen, I am sure everyone is looking forward to seeing their classmates and teachers in person again. – LHL

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I held a virtual dialogue with Malay-Muslim leaders and community leaders this evening. We talked about how families are coping, as they adapt to the circuit breaker restrictions. To all who have sacrificed to keep loved ones safe during this period, take heart. We are facing this together, and our collective efforts are showing results.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We may be celebrating differently this year, but the significance of the holy month remains constant — a time of reflection, prayer, and good deeds. No pandemic can change this. May your Ramadan continue to be blessed and bright, and your family healthy. – LHL

Brother Kumar was a former General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Daily Rated Workers. He passed away last November at age 68.⠀
⠀
Three veteran trade unionists were also conferred the Comrade of Labour (Star) (Bar) accolade, the highest award category for unionists this year — Brother Karthikeyan Krishnamurthy, Executive Secretary, United Workers Of Petroleum Industry; Brother Tan Hock Soon, General Secretary, Food, Drinks & Allied Workers Union; and Brother Toh Hock Poh, Consultant, Metal Industries Workers Union. All three remain involved in union work, drawing upon decades of experience to help brothers and sisters tackle current challenges.⠀
⠀
COVID-19 has created an extremely challenging environment for workers and businesses. We will be progressively re-opening our economy and easing circuit breaker measures after 1 June. Our tripartite partnership — of government, the Labour Movement and @ntucsingapore, and employers — must work harder and more closely than ever to support workers and businesses. Recovery will be long and hard, but I am confident that together, we can overcome our difficulties.⠀
⠀
Congratulations to all award recipients: go.gov.sg/mda2020citations! Thank you for your distinguished services to the unions and workers, and may it spur you on to greater contributions. – LHL⠀

For many students, it was the first time back in school after almost two months — students did Home Based Learning when the circuit breaker began in April, and had their mid-year school holidays in May. I’m sure many of you were excited to see friends and teachers again!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
HBL had become the ‘new normal’ during the circuit breaker. Today as we start Phase 1 of our safe opening, there will be yet another ‘new normal’. Students and teachers returned to a different environment than when they were last in school.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Parents will understandably be anxious for their children. Rest assured that @moesingapore has taken comprehensive measures to keep students, teachers, and staff safe. We will take time to get used to the precautions, but they are necessary to protect everyone. Meanwhile, we are watching the situation closely, and will do everything necessary to gradually resume our normal activities while keeping teachers and students safe. – LHL

Wrapped up the second-last day of campaigning with a visit to Fernvale. It was a wet evening, but thankfully it cleared up in time for me and Gan Thiam Poh to meet young families heading home, or visiting Seletar Mall for dinner.

I was last in this area a few months ago, just before the circuit breaker. It was then in Sengkang West SMC, under @vpmlam, who is now in the Sengkang GRC team. Now it has become part of Ang Mo Kio GRC, and Thiam Poh is taking care of it. He was previously looking after the adjacent part of Fernvale, and many residents already know him. Hope to see you more in the years to come, and welcome to the Ang Mo Kio family! – LHL

I was glad to have a chance to visit him in March before the circuit breaker. In spite of his illness, Cikgu made a great effort to vote in the recent GE. I am grateful for his support and friendship through the years.
