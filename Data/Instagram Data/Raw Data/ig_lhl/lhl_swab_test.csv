⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This huge and complicated operation depends on many individuals all doing their part so that the testing runs smoothly. It is not just getting the swab done, but being on the front line, taking all the precautions and doing the procedures right. It is hard work and I thank all of you who are making this possible.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As we start Phase 2 of our re-opening on 19 June, we are also ramping up testing capacity so that we can safely and progressively resume work and social activities in the COVID world.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To win this battle, we need everyone to continue doing our part by practising safe distancing and good personal hygiene. Let us make a safe and steady transition to Phase 2! – LHL

Japan is one of the countries with whom we are discussing setting up reciprocal ‘green lanes’, to resume essential travel with the necessary safety precautions.

Had a fruitful meeting with Communist Party of China Politburo member and Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Office Director Yang Jiechi. As you would expect, we discussed our respective COVID-19 situations. Despite the pandemic, both sides have kept up contacts through phone and video calls. Singapore and China had earlier agreed on a “fast lane” for essential business and official travel between both countries. At the moment this covers six Chinese provinces and municipalities, and hopefully this list will grow if the situation stays under control.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic relations. Our ties with China are substantial and multi-faceted. I am confident that by working with each other and with the international community, we can make more progress in the post-COVID world. – LHL

⠀
This time, our work is cut out for us – not only to deal with the immediate threat of COVID-19, but also to plan for an uncertain new future in its wake. ⠀
⠀
In this climate of economic uncertainty, it is only natural to feel anxious about our social support, and competition from foreigners. I want to reassure Singaporeans that the Government will always be on your side. This is why we are adjusting our work pass schemes, and tightening the Fair Consideration Framework. However, please remember that we must stay open to the world, to attract businesses to set up here, and in turn create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans. ⠀
⠀
During the clarifications, I explained the mindset we should have in elections. Voters are choosing the party they wish to govern Singapore; your vote matters. Vote because you truly support the party, whether PAP or opposition, and not because you want ‘the best of both worlds’. ⠀
⠀
Singaporean voters have spoken, and I respect their choice. The Government will do its part to work with the opposition to keep Parliament a constructive forum for debate. ⠀
⠀
Singapore has survived many life or death crises before. Each time we survived, and came back stronger. Like all previous crises, COVID-19 will be the occasion for us to do better, emerge stronger, and more united than before.

May be an image of 2 people, people standing, suit and outerwear.","Today marks 30 years of diplomatic relations between Singapore and China. Our relationship started even before formal establishment of diplomatic ties in 1990, and our bilateral collaboration has deepened and expanded over the years.
 
China has been our largest trading partner and we have been China’s largest foreign investor since 2013. People-to-people exchanges have also grown. In 2018 more than four million people travelled between our countries – 40 times as many as the 100,000 travellers in 1990. COVID-19 has suspended the flights for now, but amid the pandemic, we have continued to support each other, and embarked on new areas of cooperation. Beyond bilateral ties, we have also worked well together in regional and international fora.
 
I look forward to growing and strengthening our ties and bringing our partnership to greater heights. – LHL

These swab test operations are part of the government’s efforts to keep our community safe as we continue to reopen our economy and allow more activities to resume. We are offering these tests to selected groups whose work involves more frequent interaction with the public, like stall holders and food delivery riders.

I visited the COVID-19 screening centre at Blk 402 in Ang Mo Kio today, and was glad to see many coming forward to be swabbed. Beyond AMK, the testing operations will also be progressively rolled out to other parts in Singapore. This testing exercise requires the joint efforts of multiple agencies working closely together with community partners. Thank you to all the teams managing this, and keep up the good work! – LHL
