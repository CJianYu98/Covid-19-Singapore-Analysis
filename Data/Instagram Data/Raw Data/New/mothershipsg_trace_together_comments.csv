Is it really too much to ask for? For a decent human to ask for some amount of privacy. That's why its so damn important to have oppositions in Parliament, not to challenge but to question whether is it really normal for us to be watched like this?

7,springonionhateme,"In zoos, animals are there for the entertainment of humans. Even when that entertainment has a degree of education, animals are still captive for our benefit. We can learn about animals and wildlife in many ways, we don‚Äôt have to keep them in zoos for the sake of our own education.Even in zoos where conservation is a priority, there is still the issue that the freedoms and needs of individual animals are compromised in the name of ‚Äòthe greater good‚Äô. It is still speciesist to assume that we have the right to keep animals captive, even if we believe the ultimate outcomes associated with preventing extinction are positive.Animals are not able to thrive in such small places. Even ‚Äògood‚Äô zoos simply can‚Äôt afford to provide spaces large enough to satisfy the normal roaming and exploring instincts of many animals. And as for bad zoos, some of the conditions can be so cramped and awful that animals suffer from ‚Äòzoochosis‚Äô ‚Äì if you see an animal rocking back and forth, it‚Äôs likely that it‚Äôs suffering severe mental depression from being copped up in such confined and inadequate conditions.Even if enclosures are of an adequate size, most zoos provide a chance to see non-native animals from completely different parts of the world. This can mean that animals are often kept in climates very different from the ones they should be living in. Even if the animals receive a good standard of care, it can‚Äôt be good to keep them in an alien environment.If people want to see animals and fund something positive, there are plenty of amazing animal sanctuaries that desperately need money for upkeep, rescue operations, education programs, and investigations. Most zoos are for-profit operations, whereas animal sanctuaries prioritise the safety, comfort, and wellbeing of the animals.",2020-08-11T15:34:30.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CDv5AGPD8c-/,2020-08-11T12:02:30.000Z,"Did you know that elephants are keystone species?

3,kenkopite,"@lawrencewongst It is a shame that lessons have not been learnt from the dormitory outbreak that brought the entire Singapore to a halt unnecessarily. Back then, you had said that the government did not have the benefit of HINDSIGHT. And now when Singaporeans are helping the government to have the FORESIGHT to identify potential cluster outbreak events like the GE, you dismiss it off as not jumping to conclusions and waiting to see if it really happens. The GE timeline was not due until next year, so was it really 'essential' for it to be called at this point in time with the risks of further outbreaks it may clearly cause?

56,wstwstwstwst,"so hard to choose one because each song carries so much meaning and showcases so much character, but if I had to choose one, it would definitely be Break My Heart! she sings about vulnerability & love :‚Äô))) despite knowing that the love may leave her heartbroken, she still chooses to follow her heart as she believes that it is worth fighting for & that is so strong of her!!! really love dancing and singing to this song bc it has such an addictive & upbeat melody, makes me forget that I‚Äôm in quarantine sometimes because it always feels like a party with this song on!!!

59,tyrenleahey13,"my favourite song is definitely don‚Äôt start now because lyrically, it is so relatable right now during the circuit breaker where people who ghosted on me before are starting to come back into my life and they‚Äôre acting like nothing happen, that I wasn‚Äôt hurt by them before, and thinking that I do not have any self respect but no ‚Äúwalk away you know how don‚Äôt start caring about me now‚Äù - I have way more self respect than to let people come and go in my life whenever they feel like it and only use me and talk to me when they‚Äôre bored. It serves as a reminder that I don‚Äôt need these kinds of people in my life. The song is a celebration of how it‚Äôs my time to live my life the way I want to and sonically, it is a whole BOP as well that just ages like wine, getting better every time you listen to it.",2020-05-09T03:56:31.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_xT44rnxgS/,2020-05-04T15:10:39.000Z,"[MOTHERSHIP GIVEAWAY]

66,notnaud,"'Break my heart' is the best because first of all its ultra catchy and second of all look at her music video and catch the lady giving us a full dance routine which she literally never does in the past. Closest she has come to this much dance was in 'Physical', and 'New Rules' which ain't even from this album. Dua got the besttttt vocals out there, so good that I had to save up for her concert in 2018 to experience it live. 'Break my heart' is the kind of song i vibe and (attempt to) dance to at home because it is just so catchy!! ü§©ü§© 'i should have stayed at home, i was doing better alone' i relate to cos i like to sing in my room alone - WHICH would be so much better with a Cambridge Audio Yoyo system!!!¬°¬°!!

Moreover, the lyrics literally resonates so meaningfully with my heart. And yes, Tiktok is such a spark of reminder to this song. On a side note, ""Don't start now"" showcased how talented Dua Lipa is at such young age of 24 years and even turned things around to the naysayers who thought she did not have stage presence.

Dua's vocals are exceptionally strong and prominent throughout the song and so is not overshadowed by the electronic sound. It manages to sound like a modern pop song and yet also bring out the nostalgic 2000s dance-pop song sound at the same time, I can hear 'cool' drawing inspiration from that era like from Gwen Stefani for example, and these influences adds the cherry on top of this already splendid song!",2020-05-04T16:26:03.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_xT44rnxgS/,2020-05-04T15:10:39.000Z,"[MOTHERSHIP GIVEAWAY]

161,oveaslimeas,"Every. Single. Song in this album is so amazing, it was almost tough to find a favourite. All the songs are BOPS. However, one of my favourite songs off the album has to be love again. It's catchy tunes, lyric structure, the meaning behind the lyrics and Dua's strong, prominent and amazing vocals make it one of the best songs of her album. Most importantly, the star-wars like feel to the song just makes me want to get up and dance. Love again has a certain uniqueness to it that just makes the song so special. So so thankful of her to release such a catchy, fun and entertaining album during this tough period. Every time I listen to it, I just take my mind off things, relax, and have a little fun once in a while. Best album of 2020!!! I love @dualipa so much!!!!!!!",2020-05-04T16:33:59.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_xT44rnxgS/,2020-05-04T15:10:39.000Z,"[MOTHERSHIP GIVEAWAY]

10,devils_advocator,"Guys, as bad as it may seem, we are not fucked. Considering our population density, our growing numbers of 300, 400 and 700 is considered decent. For a country as compact as Singapore, we should be seeing thousands at this point but that isnt the case. Look at the top few countries, they have very widespread population but still is transmitting at a faster rate than we are(some while under lockdown). The government have also said that the first 2 weeks will be crucial. The CB will flush out most of the clusters and infected. Dont forget that this virus takes about a week or 2 before developing symptoms in some cases and we are witnessing the evidence as more and more gets tested positive. For all we know, some of these could have been old cases that tested positive near the end of 2 weeks. The best we can do now is listen to the government and cooperate because who understands the situation better than they do? Stay up to date as well through reputable news sources.

35,aliciatan4,"After all the strict measures, instead of the infected numbers reducing, the number of  infected people keep breaking new highs. This means masks , the social distancing , the disininfectants, alcohol, hand sanitizers , frequent hand washing with soap and lockdowns  only give a false sense of security and are totally ineffective! I already explained earlier the cancer causing agents like formaldehyde, Triclosan, sodium laurel sulphate, parabens, etc. will impair the immune system, leaving the population more vulnerable to COVID 19! Stop listening to the clueless highly qualified professionals in WHO and the so-called experts who have no inkling how our immune system works! Please contact Jessica Seah at aceofaceent@yahoo.com, author of Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills. She reversed all her health problems including obesity, arthritis, high uric acid, hormonal imbalance, infections, constipation, extreme joint pain and anaphylactic allergic reaction without any medication or exercise! I used her nontoxic method to help a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication. I posted proofs of impressive cases like my friend's sister, 73 reversed her diabetes high blood pressure and high cholesterol. A copy of her improved blood sugar report was posted. Only the already healed who truly understand what health is all about can teach the world how to heal. Fight COVID 19 with the correct weapon, our unharmed immune system!

STOP. ur bringing more negative effects than positive effects. im pretty sure the working adults wants to go back to work, im pretty sure the students (most of them) wanna go back to school instead of being cooped at home. it can be wholesome but boring. sidenote, kudos to the frontline workers, essential working staffs, workers who help to build my country. i love you and respect you. stay safe & stay at home!!!",2020-04-16T15:42:59.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_C_A6tHUKc/,2020-04-16T15:23:11.000Z,"JUST IN: Of the new cases, 81 per cent are linked to known clusters while the rest are pending contact tracing.

There are schools such as mine where ants can be commonly found dead in food and where measurements are so incredibly lax to the point where we once kept our thermometers together in a box. Not the kind u put in ur ear, the kind where one would have to suck on. Not only that, we aren't allowed to go to washrooms to wash them, nor ask others for tissues. So most people just wipe it off their shirt with some just shoving it back in. The government is mostly just dedicating resources and care to high end schools such as HCI, RGS, RVHS, and completely ignoring some low end schools such as mine for instance. Honestly, there is no way to truly confirm that all schools are taking appropriate measures to protect students from this disease or any other sort of disaster. Plus, Secondary school students tend to leave home regardless, so does that not make it any different from letting them stay at home? Besides, nowadays, parents being wary and worried over their child's well being, they'd probably force their child to stay at home.

21,agathacyf,"Frightening fact on COVID 19 infection:Make no mistake. When loved ones are removed from your home by ambulance because the virus has hit them hard, you are not going to be able to follow them there, sit by their hospital bed and hold their hand. You are not going to be able to pop in at 7.00 pm for visiting hours. They are going to have no one other than exhausted and brave hospital staff to see them through days or weeks of barely breathing through a ventilator until they either die or recover. They are not going to be well enough to text you.You are not going to be able to phone the ward to check in on them regularly (staff will be too busy for that). During that time, they will be completely alone, while you sit at home waiting to hear whether they have made it through.Imagine that person is someone you love dearly. Because it's going to be a reality for many in the coming weeks.And if that person in hospital happens to be you, going through that ordeal completely alone, it would be nothing less than terrifying.Please stay home and only go out if absolutely necessary.
