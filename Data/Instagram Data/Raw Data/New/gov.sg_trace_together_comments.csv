3,dawntan.sg,It will be good to incorporate some good features of Safe entry into Trace Together app. Personally I like the search feature of locations within close proximity .  I use that when I’m nearing the building to save time and straight to queue for entry instead of scanning the QR code.,2020-12-11T01:53:39.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CInPobSHB2c/,2020-12-10T10:03:48.000Z,"Why must the SafeEntry and TraceTogether App/Token be used together? 📲

0,g.lightly,Perhaps review the imported cases. More stringent requirements before they are allowed to fly to Sg esp for non-Singaporeans.

3,wt.keng,"Please at least look into revamping the rules for a 3v3 situation for basketball court. There are those of us who are serious about abiding to safe distancing regulations but failed to influence those around us because of the vicious cycle of flaunting and closing down of basketball courts around Boon Keng area. We do not have the ill intentions to flaunt the rules set out, but with all the courts forced to closed down due to failure to comply, there are those who are traveling to different parts of Singapore for a game of basketball. The lesser the number of courts available to play, the more unnecessary travel to different parts of Singapore. Just two points in conclusion 1) Please consider amending regulation to accommodate 6 or 8 pax per half court. 2) Open up basketball courts at Boon Keng area to avoid unnecessary travel reducing risk of cross infections.Thank you for reading and giving some thoughts about coming up with measurements that makes more sense to avoid unnecessary tension with safe distancing officers. 🙏🏻",2020-08-22T13:39:37.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CELWphGnma8/,2020-08-22T04:00:36.000Z,"If your household is looking to eat out, and you have more than 5 pax, it is possible to book an additional table to accommodate everyone (but do limit interactions between tables).
