Our local attractions have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but with the gradual re-opening of our economy in Phase 2, most have reopened with the necessary precautionary measures in place such as safe distancing, temperature-taking, and safe entry.

No one can tell how long international travel restrictions will last. COVID-19 will remain a problem for a long time yet, and we will all have to learn to live with it. In the meanwhile, take this time to explore our island ‚Äî from our world-famous tourist attractions to the places off the beaten path. You may be surprised by what you will discover. ‚Äì LHL
