The new masks can be rewashed up to 50 times while retaining the antimicrobial performance. Many of you should be familiar with the collection process by now – just bring your NRIC or government-issued ID with a barcode to the vending machines at your RCs, CCs or bus interchanges. There are four sizes of masks available, so do make sure you pick the right one. Do note that the size S masks can only be collected at CCs, Plaza Singapura, and Temasek Shophouse.

A gentle reminder that there is no need to rush! There is enough stock for everyone and you have up till 13 Dec to pick up your masks. 😷 – LHL"

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHI’s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. – LHL

We are redoubling our efforts to combat dengue, and one way is to use mosquitoes against themselves.

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHI’s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. – LHL

Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHI’s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. – LHL

When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHI’s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. – LHL

When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch.

47,jenfran_bmh,An impressive project that truly benefits mankind! Thank you 🙏,2020-09-16T11:50:38.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFMMXyUM4wO/,2020-09-16T08:21:26.000Z,"Even as we fight COVID-19, we cannot take our eyes off other threats. We are redoubling our efforts to combat dengue, and one way is to use mosquitoes against themselves.

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHI’s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. – LHL

Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHI’s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. – LHL

Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

We are redoubling our efforts to combat dengue, and one way is to use mosquitoes against themselves.

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

16,ze.ynep8738,Hello minister 👍👍👍👍,2020-09-17T17:26:23.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFMMXyUM4wO/,2020-09-16T08:21:26.000Z,"Even as we fight COVID-19, we cannot take our eyes off other threats. We are redoubling our efforts to combat dengue, and one way is to use mosquitoes against themselves.

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

We are redoubling our efforts to combat dengue, and one way is to use mosquitoes against themselves.

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

35,jairuskteo,Thank you Sir.,2020-09-16T15:10:56.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFMMXyUM4wO/,2020-09-16T08:21:26.000Z,"Even as we fight COVID-19, we cannot take our eyes off other threats. We are redoubling our efforts to combat dengue, and one way is to use mosquitoes against themselves.

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHI’s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. – LHL

So far they have given out 1,000 packs of masks to residents.⠀
⠀
If you haven’t picked up your masks yet, you can find out your collection day and time by keying in your postal code at https://www.maskgowhere.gov.sg. ⠀
⠀
Do remember to bring your NRIC for verification, and heed the MOH advisory on the proper usage of masks.⠀
⠀
The SAF and @pafrenz have done an outstanding job in getting the mask packs and collection points ready in time. Thank you for the hard work! – LHL⠀
