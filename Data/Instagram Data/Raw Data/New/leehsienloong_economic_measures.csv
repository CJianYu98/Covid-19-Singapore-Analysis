https://www.instagram.com/p/CLWaOzHrd9Z/,"As DPM @hengsweekeat announced in his #SGBudget2021 speech today, the FY2020 budget deficit was 13.9% of GDP, the largest ever. This was what we needed, to keep Singaporeans safe and protect their livelihoods during COVID-19.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This year, we will continue to help Singaporeans and businesses through the $11 billion COVID-19 Resilience Package. Although we are again running a deficit, it is much smaller – only 2.2% of GDP. Things are gradually returning to normal.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
While grappling with the pandemic, we must not neglect the future. Hence the Budget has many items that build our capabilities and competitiveness. When the sun shines again, we must be ready to seize the new opportunities.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This “can do” spirit helped us overcome the last financial crisis. With the resilience that our people have shown this time, I am confident that we can do it again.

Singapore is not a PA member, but we were invited to join their Summit as a Candidate Associate State last night. Once the PASFTA is signed, we will become even closer, as an Associate State of the PA.

This December when more of us are taking leave, do visit our local attractions and help them tide through this difficult period. Hopefully, after the pandemic passes, we can all enjoy them to the fullest again.

Starting today, all Singaporeans aged 18 and above will receive $100 worth of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers, that they can spend at local hotels, attractions and tours. Find out more here: https://go.gov.sg/srvouchers

https://www.instagram.com/p/CHrbtamribh/,"How has COVID-19 changed the way we look at the world? John Micklethwait, Bloomberg’s Editor-in-chief, asked me this during my interview for their New Economy Forum.

My answer was simple: COVID-19 is a powerful reminder that while Man proposes, God disposes. Immediately, governments worldwide were forced to change gears, put aside their plans, and make COVID-19 their top priority. It was a stark lesson that no matter how carefully one plans ahead, being able to deal with the unexpected is equally important. – LHL

We discussed strengthening cooperation between our countries amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and welcomed the resumption of essential travel between Singapore and Japan. 

Singapore and Japan are like-minded partners enjoying a longstanding close relationship. We have many opportunities to work together, e.g. in vaccine multilateralism, third-country infrastructure cooperation, and preparing for the digital economy. We also both support multilateralism and are working to sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership by the end of this year.

- Our Lives: We are still in the thick of the fight against COVID-19 and will have to sustain this effort for perhaps a year, or longer.

- Our Jobs: The key focus of the government in the coming months and years must be jobs. We are investing heavily to reskill Singaporeans, and growing our economy to create more good jobs.

- Our Future: Even as we deal with immediate priorities of COVID-19, we must not lose sight of our longer-term mission to improve Singapore.

We will need the best possible leadership and a solidly united population to see us safely through the pandemic and economic pain, and to lead us beyond, into better days ahead.

Generations of Singaporeans have trusted in the PAP, and worked with us to build this country. Your support has been our biggest strength, and the PAP has never let you down.

This is not a normal election because we are not living in normal times. The central focus of this Manifesto is how we will work together to overcome the crisis of a generation.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe and prevent COVID-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to provide one another care and support, so that together we can keep ourselves safe amidst the uncertainties ahead.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Beyond COVID-19, this Manifesto also sets out the PAP’s longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, beyond the next 5-year term of government — 10, 20 years down the road.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government. What the PAP promises, it delivers.

Brother Kumar was a former General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Daily Rated Workers. He passed away last November at age 68.⠀
⠀
Three veteran trade unionists were also conferred the Comrade of Labour (Star) (Bar) accolade, the highest award category for unionists this year — Brother Karthikeyan Krishnamurthy, Executive Secretary, United Workers Of Petroleum Industry; Brother Tan Hock Soon, General Secretary, Food, Drinks & Allied Workers Union; and Brother Toh Hock Poh, Consultant, Metal Industries Workers Union. All three remain involved in union work, drawing upon decades of experience to help brothers and sisters tackle current challenges.⠀
⠀
COVID-19 has created an extremely challenging environment for workers and businesses. We will be progressively re-opening our economy and easing circuit breaker measures after 1 June. Our tripartite partnership — of government, the Labour Movement and @ntucsingapore, and employers — must work harder and more closely than ever to support workers and businesses. Recovery will be long and hard, but I am confident that together, we can overcome our difficulties.⠀

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B-rW10yHso0/,"Today is the first day of COVID-19 circuit breaking measures. It is timely that we also rounded up the debate on the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets.

Glad that all Members of Parliament supported the measures. They raised useful ideas to improve the policies to support businesses, workers and households through this crisis.

While we deal with immediate challenges, we must keep an eye on the future too. The MPs raised a relevant question: we do need to use the reserves now, but are we being fiscally prudent enough? Will we still have enough reserves to do more later, if the situation calls for it?

When this is over, the past will not come back. Hence DPM @hengsweekeat set up two initiatives to think ahead — a taskforce on Emerging Stronger to cover the economy, as well as a new emphasis on social resilience under the Singapore Together Movement.

Beyond the Budget measures, it will be our own determination and discipline that will see us through, and keep us safe for the future. – LHL (An empty Orchard MRT station on the first day of a month-long ‘circuit breaker’. / MCI Photo by Fyrol)

Besides Singapore’s response to COVID-19, I also spoke about the wider impact of the pandemic — how it has blighted the global economy and further soured US-China relations.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Like the rest of the world, I hope that a treatment or vaccine will happen sooner than later. But we must be psychologically prepared for a long battle ahead, and learn to live with the virus by adjusting our routines and adopting new norms.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B-O86Xen9Ls/,"Sat down with local media today to talk about the Resilience Budget that @hengsweekeat announced in Parliament yesterday, and what lies ahead as the COVID-19 pandemic turns the world upside down.

We are heading into the storm with a major $55 billion package to help save jobs and businesses, support households, and keep our economy going. If the situation worsens, we are ready to do more.

The impact on our economy has been huge. This is only the second time ever we are drawing on our reserves. The last time was for the Global Financial Crisis in 2009. We will be drawing up to $17 billion to fund the support measures, more than triple what was drawn in 2009.

I have no illusions that this will be all we need. Nobody can tell what lies ahead. COVID-19 has shown starkly how vulnerable we are, and how our existential threats essentially remain the same, despite Singapore going from third world to first. The COVID-19 pandemic will be the formative experience for this generation of Singaporeans. If we remain vigilant, resolute, and united, I am confident we will get through this together.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B9tbvnqnd56/,"This morning, I held a dialogue with grassroots leaders on COVID-19 and what lies ahead for Singapore. This was a follow up to my TV broadcast on Thursday.

Fighting COVID-19 is difficult enough. But we also need to deal with COVID-19’s enormous impact on our economy.

Yesterday, the Government released the report of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's (EBRC), which the Committee had just completed.

The General Elections must take place before 21 April 2021. They can only be called after the electoral registers are updated. This will take about a month.

When to hold elections? That depends on the situation, and the outlook.

Singapore faces grave and extended challenges.

We can’t tell when the pandemic will end, but it will likely last at least this year, and quite possibly longer.

The economic hit will likely be more serious than the Global Financial Crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic.

I fully expect things to get more serious before they start getting better.

We have two choices. Either hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances – but we have no certainty of that.

Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.

If we have to hold elections before COVID-19 is over, we will take all the precautions necessary, so that parties can campaign effectively, and people can vote safely.

At stake are jobs, businesses and lives.

Which way to go, and the elections date, will depend on what will best see Singapore through this major crisis.

COVID-19 may well turn out to be the crisis that defines this generation of Singaporeans. We must gird ourselves to overcome this together, and show the world what Singapore can do. – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/B9onAlwHOjK/,"It is five weeks since I spoke about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. So it is timely to update Singaporeans again on the medical, economic and psychological outlooks of the situation.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Today, the @WHO officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. This means that while the situation in Singapore remains under control, the COVID-19 threat will be with us for a long time. We cannot be complacent.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
There are some baseline precautions we must get used to, like maintaining good personal hygiene and not holding large gatherings. We must also plan ahead in case a major outbreak happens in Singapore, like in South Korea or Italy.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If a major outbreak happens, we will need more stringent social distancing measures, such as suspending schools and compulsory telecommuting. These will slow down the rate of transmission and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Already our economy has been seriously impacted, so we are working on a second stimulus package to support businesses and workers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singapore’s response to COVID-19 has been recognised by WHO and the international community. This is through the efforts of many Singaporeans, from the frontline staff to all of us keeping #SGclean. I thank all Singaporeans who are dealing with this calmly and responsibly. We must keep up our efforts, and remain #SGUnited.

The 2019-nCov outbreak is, of course, foremost on everybody’s minds. How we react to it is a major test for our nation. In terms of health outcomes, I am confident we will be alright. The real test is to our social and psychological defence. We must come through this challenge together, helping one another to cope, and maintaining confidence in one another and in Singapore.

Even as we fight the coronavirus, we must continue dealing with issues, external and domestic, that will always matter to Singaporeans.

It will support our long term plans for Singapore, and also include measures to see us through the economic fallout from the nCoV outbreak.
