34,edamam000,"Why are Singaporeans not getting treated the same too @pizzahut_sg? Hasn’t everyone in Singapore contributed and worked hard for our country as well? On the other hand you are charging $3-$4 for delivery fees? Yes, I agree it is a good gesture but shouldn’t Singaporeans (aka healthcare services, frontline or all other Singaporeans who contributed) receive the same treatment.
