Nasa’s science rover Perseverance has landed safely on the floor of a vast Martian crater after piercing the atmosphere at 19,000kmh.

The most advanced astrobiology laboratory ever sent to another world will be searching for traces of ancient microbial life on the Red Planet.

The robotic vehicle sailed through space for nearly 7 months, covering 472 million km.

Moments after touchdown, Perseverance beamed back its first black-and-white images from the Martian surface, one of them showing the rover’s shadow cast on the desolate, rocky landing site.

22,aliciatan4,"Finding a permanent solution to fight COVID 19 is more important!Isn't it cheaper to fight COVID 19 using the unharmed immune system that is free? We just need to eat the correct diet to activate it! Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She reversed all her health problems without any medication or exercise! True healing means eliminating toxins never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, pathogens, disease, free radicals and cancer cells! Her method is nontoxic, cheap, simple and very effective! Fight the unseen enemy with the correct weapon! I used Whatsapp to help a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication by replicating Jessica Seah's diet and nontoxic treatment. It was cheap, simple and very effective. No expensive ventilators were required! It cost less than US$25! Our unharmed immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19 and any invaders!🇸🇬",2020-04-27T05:46:17.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_Z5HHoJHht/,2020-04-25T12:56:41.000Z,"🎤👏🔦 Were you singing, cheering or waving your flashlight at 7.55pm?

I posted concrete proofs including a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication, no expensive ventilator is required. Jessica Seah's treatment method is cheap, simple and very effective. Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, diseases, pathogens, free radicals and cancer cells. I hope the world will not keep repeating the history of having to deal with new strains of superbugs caused by the man-made chemicals like medicines , vaccines, disininfectants, hand sanitizers, etc. The more such toxins are used, the more vulnerable will be the population will be to infections and diseases! Toxic man-made chemicals will not be part of having a healthy society.
