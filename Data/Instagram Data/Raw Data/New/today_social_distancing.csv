Then have to watch the neighbors having so many visitors and hearing all the happy merry laughters and all the buzz.

For TODAY journalist Tessa Oh, the annual CNY festivities have always been a huge source of stress.&nbsp; 

‚Äò‚ÄôHaving divorced parents who both remarried new partners may mean getting twice the hongbao money, but I also have twice the number of relatives to visit.‚Äô‚Äô

‚Äò‚ÄôOn a regular year, the marathon would start on the eve of Chinese New Year,‚Äô‚Äô she says. ‚Äò‚ÄôWith four homes to visit in the day, plus another three at night, and about 80 relatives to greet, there is no time to waste.‚Äô‚Äô

‚Äò‚ÄôI will not lie. When the Government announced that family gatherings should be kept to a minimum this Chinese New Year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I heaved a heavy sigh of relief...‚Äô‚Äô

Earlier this week, Kwok, who has COVID-19 to thank for this lull in his usually back-breaking work schedule, posted a photo with his wife Moka Fang and their two daughters, Chantelle, three, and Charlotte, one, along with an emotional note to his fans. 

‚ÄúEvery year on October 26, I receive blessings from my family, colleagues, friends and fans from all over the world. I always feel thankful and consider myself very blessed because of all the well-wishes,‚Äù he wrote.

He added that in the past, he would always be at work on his birthday. 

This year, however, he continued: ""I just finished filming my movie and could take a short break from work on my birthday. I had a small celebration with my colleagues and my family because of safe distancing rules. It was a simple party.""

Fans were delighted to see a photo of Kwok's family together, as the star rarely posts photos of his two daughters. The photo, which showed the three women in his life giving him a kiss, quickly went viral online.

Earlier this week, Kwok, who has COVID-19 to thank for this lull in his usually back-breaking work schedule, posted a photo with his wife Moka Fang and their two daughters, Chantelle, three, and Charlotte, one, along with an emotional note to his fans. 

‚ÄúEvery year on October 26, I receive blessings from my family, colleagues, friends and fans from all over the world. I always feel thankful and consider myself very blessed because of all the well-wishes,‚Äù he wrote.

He added that in the past, he would always be at work on his birthday. 

This year, however, he continued: ""I just finished filming my movie and could take a short break from work on my birthday. I had a small celebration with my colleagues and my family because of safe distancing rules. It was a simple party.""

Fans were delighted to see a photo of Kwok's family together, as the star rarely posts photos of his two daughters. The photo, which showed the three women in his life giving him a kiss, quickly went viral online.

But in this Covid-19 climate, how she delivers care to patients has had to be done differently.

While she used to be able to comfort anxious families by using a soothing tone of voice and non-verbal cues such as hugs or facial expressions, she has to now convey comfort and empathy from behind a mask. Touch has also been minimised because of safe distancing. 

It is even more challenging for the loved ones of Covid-19 patients. 

Before the coronavirus emerged, family members could talk to patients, sponge their faces, hands and legs, and even lighten the atmosphere in the room with songs.

But now, they cannot touch their loved ones to comfort and reassure them. Families may also be in a dilemma, with fears of their own safety and health conflicting with concerns about their loved ones.

14,wyap,How many of you have the chance to fly a plane? And do you even dare or have the ability to flying a big commercial plane with hundreds/thousands of people on it. I believe most of them look forward to that day of realising their dreams to learn flying and to fly. Not just for the money. Although I dun deny all of us need money to survive. Well at least they realised their dreams and I believe they will be back flying again soon.

So definitely more precaution is needed compared to normal singaporeans who are not doing much in this period. However sometimes there are better solutions and cost efficient methods to keep them socially distant.  Yea they sometimes don't listen to social distancing measures.
