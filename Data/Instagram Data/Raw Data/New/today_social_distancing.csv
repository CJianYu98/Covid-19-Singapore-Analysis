For TODAY journalist Tessa Oh, the annual CNY festivities have always been a huge source of stress.&nbsp; 

‘’Having divorced parents who both remarried new partners may mean getting twice the hongbao money, but I also have twice the number of relatives to visit.’’

‘’On a regular year, the marathon would start on the eve of Chinese New Year,’’ she says. ‘’With four homes to visit in the day, plus another three at night, and about 80 relatives to greet, there is no time to waste.’’

‘’I will not lie. When the Government announced that family gatherings should be kept to a minimum this Chinese New Year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I heaved a heavy sigh of relief...’’

For TODAY journalist Tessa Oh, the annual CNY festivities have always been a huge source of stress.&nbsp; 

‘’Having divorced parents who both remarried new partners may mean getting twice the hongbao money, but I also have twice the number of relatives to visit.’’

‘’On a regular year, the marathon would start on the eve of Chinese New Year,’’ she says. ‘’With four homes to visit in the day, plus another three at night, and about 80 relatives to greet, there is no time to waste.’’

‘’I will not lie. When the Government announced that family gatherings should be kept to a minimum this Chinese New Year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I heaved a heavy sigh of relief...’’

💔The separation from loved ones in Malaysia, including his girlfriend, was worsened by a bout of dengue fever last June. Many of Mr Wong’s personal plans have been put on hold, including his proposal to his girlfriend.

“We are also encouraged to reflect on the first Christmas, where Christ was born without fanfare and only the angels and the shepherds, along with their sheep, bore witness to his birth.”

As Christians get ready to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ today, the familiar hymns and carols that would typically resonate through church halls during Christmas festivities will be largely heard online due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

The various churches interviewed by TODAY said that while they have gradually raised the limits of the number of worshippers allowed within their premises, in accordance with government guidelines, there are some people who are more comfortable worshipping from home because of the global health crisis.

Religious organisations have been allowed to admit up to 100 people since Oct 3 — with safe distancing and management measures in place. This limit is due to be raised to 250 people, in five zones of up to 50 people each, when Singapore enters the final phase of reopening its economy on Dec 28.

Singapore Airlines has just unveiled its own mahjong set, which features the airline’s iconic batik motif and other airline-related elements on the tiles.

The limited edition mahjong set is available for pre-order on the KrisShop website, and is selling for S$338, or 42,450 KrisFlyer miles (a regular mahjong set is usually anything from $50 to over $100). Delivery will be from Jan 4, 2021 onwards.

You’ll notice that the tiles are tinged with batik motifs, and that white board tile? It isn’t just an ordinary rectangle — it’s an aircraft window! Scrutinise the tiles in the Bamboo suit and you’ll realise they’re little airplane seat maps...

Earlier this week, Kwok, who has COVID-19 to thank for this lull in his usually back-breaking work schedule, posted a photo with his wife Moka Fang and their two daughters, Chantelle, three, and Charlotte, one, along with an emotional note to his fans. 

“Every year on October 26, I receive blessings from my family, colleagues, friends and fans from all over the world. I always feel thankful and consider myself very blessed because of all the well-wishes,” he wrote.

He added that in the past, he would always be at work on his birthday. 

This year, however, he continued: ""I just finished filming my movie and could take a short break from work on my birthday. I had a small celebration with my colleagues and my family because of safe distancing rules. It was a simple party.""

Fans were delighted to see a photo of Kwok's family together, as the star rarely posts photos of his two daughters. The photo, which showed the three women in his life giving him a kiss, quickly went viral online.

But in this Covid-19 climate, how she delivers care to patients has had to be done differently.

While she used to be able to comfort anxious families by using a soothing tone of voice and non-verbal cues such as hugs or facial expressions, she has to now convey comfort and empathy from behind a mask. Touch has also been minimised because of safe distancing. 

It is even more challenging for the loved ones of Covid-19 patients. 

Before the coronavirus emerged, family members could talk to patients, sponge their faces, hands and legs, and even lighten the atmosphere in the room with songs.

But now, they cannot touch their loved ones to comfort and reassure them. Families may also be in a dilemma, with fears of their own safety and health conflicting with concerns about their loved ones.

12,thomas.tyrone.beiron.tay,"Wondering if vocational training and certification should return into our curriculum for school, so we all get to choose and be certified for a specific 'handicraft' like sewing/embroidery, carpentry, plumbing, culinary art, etc. before going on to pick an academic stream, so we don't need to downscale retrain in times of crisis? Otherwise, after spending thousands on academic and professional training, we spend even more time and thousands on job reskills training decades later. I would have picked horticulture and landscaping work back then, and only if NEA and Town Councils didn't make that job as unpleasant as it is perceived today! 😄",2020-09-28T21:35:57.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFqupwopgTA/,2020-09-28T04:58:12.000Z,"✈️ It was his life-long dream to be a pilot but for Steven (not his real name), his career was over before it even began.

14,wyap,How many of you have the chance to fly a plane? And do you even dare or have the ability to flying a big commercial plane with hundreds/thousands of people on it. I believe most of them look forward to that day of realising their dreams to learn flying and to fly. Not just for the money. Although I dun deny all of us need money to survive. Well at least they realised their dreams and I believe they will be back flying again soon.

Angered after safe distancing enforcement officers told him to put on a mask, 30-year-old food deliveryman Muhammad Adimin Kemton began hurling verbal abuse at them.

He then stormed off to buy a packet of disposable masks from a nearby store, but proceeded to throw the newly-bought masks and a used ice-cream stick at the officers, while shouting numerous Hokkien vulgarities at them. 

He was sentenced to four weeks’ jail on Monday (July 13).

31,silkqueco,Actually it their health is the utmost importance given that they built Singapore infrastructure.  So definitely more precaution is needed compared to normal singaporeans who are not doing much in this period. However sometimes there are better solutions and cost efficient methods to keep them socially distant.  Yea they sometimes don't listen to social distancing measures.  I mean even singaporeans dun listen to such measures.  What to tell about workers who are not as educated. Bt i believe this is not the best solution,2020-05-15T08:03:53.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAMmqQCgbZO/,2020-05-15T05:34:10.000Z,"The video, which started making its rounds on Wednesday (May 13), showed more than six workers sitting at the back of a lorry separated by hinged wooden partitions, with each worker sitting in what resembled a cell.&nbsp;⁣

I posted concrete proofs. I even helped a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection by replicating Jessica Seah's nontoxic treatment method and diet.
