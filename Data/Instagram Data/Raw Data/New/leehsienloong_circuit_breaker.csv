Celebrations this year have been subdued due to the pandemic. People are meeting in smaller groups and making fewer house visits. Vaccinations for seniors are underway, and progressively for the rest of our population.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If the global pandemic abates, I hope next year we can hold our usual boisterous celebrations, and usher in the Year of the Tiger together with a roar! Wishing everyone a safe and healthy Chap Goh Mei! 祝大家元宵节快乐! – LHL

The world has changed beyond imagining since then. Economies around the world have been ravaged by border closures and lockdowns. Countries have experienced second and third waves of infection, and new variants of the virus are emerging. Meanwhile, other long-term challenges remain, like climate change, which is accelerating dangerously.

Global cooperation to tackle shared challenges has never been more critical. Forums such as the WEF not only promote dialogue, but bring together leaders from small and large countries, industry, and civil society. 

I look forward to meeting these leaders in person at the #wef2021 meeting here in Singapore in May. Let us build upon the discussions at this Davos Agenda Week and forge a new path forward. – LHL

⠀
Mr Biden takes office at a time when many pressing challenges confront the US and the rest of the world, not least dealing with COVID-19. Strong American leadership will decisively contribute to our collective recovery, and the shape of the post-pandemic world. ⠀
⠀
This US election was contentious and bitter. I wish Mr Biden every success in his endeavours to heal the divisions. National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman put it beautifully in her poem she recited at the inauguration: “So we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seek harm to none and harmony for all.”⠀
⠀
Singapore has been a long-standing strategic, defence and economic partner of the US. I look forward to working with Mr Biden and his Administration to strengthen America’s engagement of Asia and ASEAN. I hope to meet him face-to-face as soon as we are able to, either in Singapore or Washington DC. – LHL⠀

https://www.instagram.com/p/CJqIaq1LmKG/,"Deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Encik Mahmud Awang on Monday. He was one of Singapore’s founding leaders.

A widely respected unionist, Encik Mahmud first got involved in union work when he joined the Singapore Traction Company (STC) as a bus conductor. He became close friends with Mr Ahmad Ibrahim, Mr Devan Nair and Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and won the support of many unions.

Encik Mahmud was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 1963 General Election, and subsequently to the Parliament of newly independent Singapore. In the years when Singapore was in Malaysia, Malay PAP leaders, including Encik Mahmud, Othman Wok, Rahim Ishak, and others, came under enormous pressure by UMNO politicians to choose race over nation. But Encik Mahmud and his comrades held firm in their conviction. Their courage and leadership kept alive the vision of a multiracial Singapore, and enabled it to become the reality today.
 
Mr Lee was forever grateful for Encik Mahmud’s stout-hearted support at this critical moment in our history, and they kept in touch. At Mr Lee’s state funeral, Encik Mahmud was one of the pallbearers.
 
Encik Mahmud may have left us, but his legacy will live on. My thoughts are with his family in this time of loss. – LHL

A big thank you to all our workers for your contributions to Singapore, especially during COVID-19.
2020 has been a year like no other. Many workers have had their wages and livelihoods affected by the pandemic, particularly those in hard-hit sectors. Frontline and essential workers have made many sacrifices, to keep their families and all of us safe.

We do not know when this pandemic will end, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel. We’re closer to getting a vaccine, and starting to reopen our borders. In the meantime, stay safe and stay strong. 
During this pandemic, labour MPs have been working overtime helping union workers, while the Air Transport Executive Staff Union has been working with SIA and other airlines to assist ground staff and protect their interests. Therefore, I nominate NTUC Assistant Secretary-General @patricktaytg and President of the AESU Daniel Loh to show your appreciation next! – LHL

For every #toast2U hashtag, NTUC Income will pledge $2 to the NTUC U Care Fund, which helps low-income members and their families through various assistance programmes to defray their cost of living and children’s school expenses, as well as members whose livelihood had been affected by Covid-19.
When nominated:
1. All you need to do is record yourself “receiving” the drink from the person who nominated you and give a toast accompanied by a note of appreciation in the post.
2. “Pass” the drink on by nominating two others.
3. Tag @UHeartsg for us to keep track of the donations, and remember to make your post public!
This @UHeartsg initiative is by @nebosg and @young.ntuc, supported by NTUC Income.",323,2020-12-04T11:25:28.000Z,leehsienloong,2456696812963290830

The Singapore-Hong Kong Air Travel Bubble takes off next Sunday, 22 November, with the start of daily ‘bubble’ flights between our two cities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought on serious challenges for every country, including the United States and Singapore. At this critical time, the duty of a leader is to unite the people, strengthen their trust in the government, and see the nation through the crisis.

With his long history and deep experience as a former US Vice President and US Senator, Mr Biden is well-placed to lead his country through the challenges ahead.

Mr Biden is familiar with the US’ long-standing, multifaceted and robust partnership with Singapore. As Vice President, he visited Singapore in 2013. Three years later, when I visited Washington D.C. in August 2016, he made time to host me to lunch too.

Mr Biden, Singapore looks forward to working with you and your Administration to deepen the partnership between our two countries, enhance the US’ role in Asia-Pacific, and overcome COVID-19. You can count on Singapore to remain a friend and partner. – LHL

The theme was “Reimagining the next normal for Asia and the World”. I shared what we have been doing to see Singapore through this COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;

To wrap up our discussion, moderator Oliver Tonby, Chairman of McKinsey & Company Asia, asked for my views on good leadership.&nbsp;

My answer: a good leader must muster a capable team that you can trust, and tap on others who know more than you. You must also be psychologically prepared for surprises and setbacks, and make the best decision based on the knowledge you have. Above all, focus on your responsibilities and fulfil your duty to your people, regardless of any personal consequences to yourself. – LHL

The RTS Link is a valuable project to both sides. It will improve connectivity and people-to-people ties between Singapore and Johor. Once operational, it will ease congestion on the Causeway. So it was apt that we marked this milestone with a bilateral ceremony at the Causeway, which has connected our two countries for almost a hundred years.

The pandemic has shown how deeply entwined our two countries are. Even in these difficult times, we continue to work together, and look forward to doing still more together. – LHL

I had sent the card 36 years ago to his father, who had saved it all these years, and passed away just a few months ago aged 103.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As PM, my duty is not just to keep Singapore intact through this crisis. I must also hand it over to the next generation, in good shape and into good hands. In this election, the @papsingapore has refreshed and reinforced its team with 27 new candidates. They come from many different backgrounds and experiences. They will represent you and walk with you, as we go through the difficult months and years ahead.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
#GE2020 has been an unusual campaign. With COVID-19, we could not gather and hold rallies as we usually do. Still, the virtual campaign has seen a full and serious discussion of issues, and all candidates have had ample opportunity to put forward their views to Singaporeans.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As you reflect on the campaign on Cooling Off Day tomorrow, and cast your vote on Friday, please think about what is at stake. When you vote, you will be choosing the team that you trust, to lead us through this grave crisis, and on to a brighter future.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My thanks to all candidates for a hard fought campaign. Thank you too to all who will be on duty on Polling Day, making sure that Singaporeans can vote safely.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Lastly, to my supporters and volunteers who have done so much to look after residents in Ang Mo Kio, and to Singaporeans who have supported me all these years in politics: thank you for sharing my journey. I hope you will elect my PAP team to continue serving you, to secure #OurLivesOurJobsOurFuture. – LHL⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀",294,2020-07-08T14:35:51.000Z,leehsienloong,2348801258161220132

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

You may not be able to head outside yet, but I hope families will use this time to bond over activities at home. MOE is posting a stay-home activity idea on their Facebook Page every day. Our @nationallibrarysg librarians are holding weekday storytelling sessions for young children in the four languages on their @publiclibrarysg Facebook Page.

Some students taking their national exams this year will be returning to school on 19 May. But for the rest, as and when schools can safely reopen, I am sure everyone is looking forward to seeing their classmates and teachers in person again. – LHL

During this circuit breaker, many of us have gotten used to a new normal of telecommuting and ordering goods online. This has increased demand, and created new opportunities for business. Some industries, like retail, may never be quite the same again.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This has been happening all along, though not so suddenly as now. New industries are constantly emerging, and we must be ready for them. 50 years ago who could have imagined a job as a social media manager, or in biotech?

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Annabel was an accomplished sportswoman. She was a national field hockey player from 1964 to 1980, and captained the team for more than 10 years. She went on to sports administration, serving in many national and international organisations. She left an indelible mark on our sports scene.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
She was Team Singapore’s Chef de Mission for many SEA, Asian, Commonwealth, and Olympic Games. In her hands, our flag always flew high. A well-respected role model, she guided our sports talents, imparting in them resilience, discipline and teamwork. She made sure they had the right environment to succeed. As a trailblazer for women in sports, she worked tirelessly to increase participation by women and girls.

Aside from sports, she was also an accomplished lawyer and a former vice president of the Law Society.

She will be dearly missed by all who knew her. My deepest condolences to Annabel’s family and loved ones. – LHL

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I thanked PM Modi for India’s help when we brought home some Singaporeans from India recently. I assured him that we will care for Indian migrant workers here, just as we care for Singaporeans. The migrant workers made personal sacrifices to come to work here. They have made many contributions to Singapore, so we have a responsibility for them.

Appreciate PM Modi’s affirmation of our efforts in looking after the migrant workers, and his assurance that they will not forget this.

While community cases have fallen, we still need to bring their number down decisively. We also want to make sure that if any cases leak from the migrant worker population into the wider community, we can detect and contain them.

That is why we are tightening the circuit breaker measures, e.g. thinning out crowds at hot spots like wet markets, and closing more workplace premises, till 4 May. We will also extend the circuit breaker itself to 1 June.

I know that this has not been an easy time. The circuit breaker is working, but we need to do a little bit more, and for a bit longer. Let us all do our part to beat the virus, break the chain of transmission, and overcome this together.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

The “circuit breaker” is essential to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. As we expected, daily numbers of new cases are still going up, and faster than before. We must bring the numbers down, and the only way is for all of us to observe the circuit breaker measures strictly.

Stay at home, except when you have to go out to do essential work or buy food. If you need to go to the market, stagger your timing too. Avoid being part of the crowd. This is not a month long holiday, when we can go out for jalan jalan or to meet up with friends.

Glad that all Members of Parliament supported the measures. They raised useful ideas to improve the policies to support businesses, workers and households through this crisis.

While we deal with immediate challenges, we must keep an eye on the future too. The MPs raised a relevant question: we do need to use the reserves now, but are we being fiscally prudent enough? Will we still have enough reserves to do more later, if the situation calls for it?

When this is over, the past will not come back. Hence DPM @hengsweekeat set up two initiatives to think ahead — a taskforce on Emerging Stronger to cover the economy, as well as a new emphasis on social resilience under the Singapore Together Movement.

Beyond the Budget measures, it will be our own determination and discipline that will see us through, and keep us safe for the future. – LHL (An empty Orchard MRT station on the first day of a month-long ‘circuit breaker’. / MCI Photo by Fyrol)

Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and I discussed the situation on the phone today. I told him that I understood the reasons why he had made this move, and wished Malaysia success in containing the outbreak. I was happy to hear his reassurance that the flow of goods and cargo between Singapore and Malaysia, including food supplies, would continue.⠀
⠀
However, Malaysians living in Johor but working in Singapore will have to comply with the Malaysian lockdown. This will prevent them from commuting daily, at least for the time being. We are therefore working out arrangements with our companies to help these Malaysian workers stay in Singapore temporarily, if they would like to do so.⠀

We also agreed to appoint Senior Ministers on both sides — SM @teocheehean and Dato’ Sri Ismail Sabri – to coordinate our responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly on measures where we can work together, or where the actions of one country will affect the other.

If a major outbreak happens, we will need more stringent social distancing measures, such as suspending schools and compulsory telecommuting. These will slow down the rate of transmission and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.

They are in AI, banking, new media, logistics, real estate, telecommunications, among other fields. One common theme is tapping the power of the digital economy. Was impressed by their drive and desire to change the way business is done, and also to improve lives through their work. – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/B7GNgztHk9X/,"Greatly saddened to hear of the passing of former Chief Justice Yong Pung How today.

He was born in Malaya, but made Singapore his home, and contributed immensely to our society. He served Singapore to the fullest, especially as Chief Justice, but also as Managing Director of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and a member of the Council of Presidential Advisors. An astute banker, he also became Chairman and CEO of OCBC for a period!

As our second Chief Justice, Mr Yong made bold and wide-ranging reforms, aggressively tightening the ship. He removed or adjusted anachronistic practices (like wearing horsehair wigs in court) to better suit the needs of Singaporean society.

Mr Yong is featured in the Judicial Heritage Centre which opened this week at the Supreme Court. I visited there yesterday, and hope many Singaporeans will too, to learn something more about what he accomplished.

To me personally, Mr Yong was a treasured family friend. My father got to know him as students in Cambridge, and I first met him and Mrs Yong as a very young child, when my parents visited them in Kuala Lumpur.

Mr Yong has left an indelible mark on our legal profession and our society. My deepest condolences to Mrs Yong and her family. – LHL (Mr Lee Kuan Yew with former Chief Justice Yong Pung How at the Millennium Law Conference in 2000. / Photo: Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore)",98,2020-01-09T11:22:01.000Z,leehsienloong,2217519295672242007
