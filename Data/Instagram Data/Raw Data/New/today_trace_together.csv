An autopsy uncovered 31 recent scars and 47 external injuries scattered all over Piang's body. 

Over 9 months, Gaiyathiri Murugayan, 40, repeatedly abused Piang. The latter was deprived of food and water and lost 15 kg in the process. She had no privacy, being forced to shower or relieve herself with the toilet door open while Gaiyathiri and her mother Prema S Naraynasamy watched.

She had to wear many layers of face masks as she went about her work in the house, because Gaiyathiri found her unhygienic and did not want to look at her face.

On the day Piang died, Gaiyathiri had rained blows on her, bashed her head with a detergent bottle, and Prema allegedly punched the worker‚Äôs neck and choked her. 

Piang was so weak that she could barely get up from the toilet floor, but the women did not stop their abuse...

The more we trust them, the more loyalty and good service we get back from them. Shame that we have these kind of employers in this country.

7,dylonko,"It really isn‚Äôt that big of a deal lol. If you want to choose nursing IP isn‚Äôt the choice. Also, IP isn‚Äôt just offered to you, you need to go for rounds and rounds of interviews. And then get accepted and choose that you WANT to take up IP in the school. I mean, every year, there are people dropping out of IP for many reasons. And one of them is that you only realise that IP will not aid you in nursing at maybe Year 3 or 4, you‚Äôll need a diploma so an A level cert will not help. Thus dropping out. So it‚Äôs just about which path is best for an individual.",2021-01-04T13:41:57.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CJnlaAYDLy2/,2021-01-04T09:45:16.000Z,"TODAY contributor Sarah Ong Xinmin writes: ""From the time I entered the Integrated Programme (IP) in River Valley High School, I had been on a steady journey towards completing my A-Level examination.""

While most commuters are bemused and elated at his works, some have their reservations. There have been commuters who accuse him of invading their privacy and even threaten to call the police.

‚ÄúI will just tell them, if you don‚Äôt like what I do, then I‚Äôll tear up the paper,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen people tell me such things, it goes into one ear and then out the other, I don‚Äôt let it bother me.‚Äù

It is the happiness of commuters that keeps him doing what he does. The moment he boards an MRT train, he springs to action, whipping out a sketchpad, pencil and eraser, before proceeding to methodically sketch the commuters around him, one by one.

Once the 72-year-old is done with each sketch, he will offer the artwork to the commuter free of charge. He started this hobby in 2014, and that he hardly takes rest days.

TODAY accompanied Mr Kiew as he sketched commuters from Bishan to Jurong East. Click on the link in bio @todayonline to read on.

The cheating students had wearable Bluetooth devices attached onto their bodies, and had on skin-coloured, in-ear earphones before going into the exam centres. These devices were linked to mobile phones concealed under the students‚Äô clothing.

Two accomplices registered themselves as private candidates, and either of them sat for an exam paper with a hidden iPhone affixed to their chests.

During the exam, they used the video-calling application FaceTime to broadcast the exam papers back to other accomplices stationed at the tuition agency.

Once the accomplices had the answers to the exam questions, they called the students individually and read out the answers to them.

The students, who received the instructions through their earphones, would then write down the answers. They were told to cough if they could not hear any of the answers clearly so that the answer could be repeated back to them.
