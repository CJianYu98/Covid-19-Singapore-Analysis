11,nikowxy,"Thank you for educating Singaporeans about HIV. HIV is not a death sentence. In many countries it is now known to be a chronic health condition like any other chronic health condition. The drugs are very effective in suppressing the virus. To people who asked how he contracted HIV, it doesn't matter how people got HIV, that should not be the main focus. I think society should be less judgemental on people with HIV.

Our economy will reap the benefits of this decision that our gov made this year. Believe it or not, having NDP this year will help our economy recover faster.

She reversed all her health problems including infections, obesity, arthritis, hormonal imbalance high uric acid, constipation,extreme joint pain and anaphylactic allergic reaction without any medication or exercise. True healing means eliminating toxins never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, diseases, pathogens, free radicals and cancer cells!

24,arcoxia.dj,Stay at home. Save lives.  Stay safe. Our cases crossed the 6k mark and we overtook both malaysia and indonesia who had thousands of case ahead of us.  This week will be the crucial week to see if CB really helps as we slowly go past the 14 day mark.  To the foreign workers who have been badly affected. You are one of us and we hold you in our thoughts.. and time and time again we salute the frontliners.  Keep fighting and I hope to see Singapore back on its feet.

28,devils_advocator,"Pass on the message to all your relatives and friends to stay at home and only go out if you really have to. There are many alternatives for exercising at home. You do not need to go out of your house just to exercise. Exercising is good yes but remember the purpose of the circuit breaker. For those blaming the government, understand that they have told everyone to go out only if necessary but not many took the advice hence the clusters. Before the surge in cases, we were lacking in mask production. Unlike many other bigger country with mask production, we had to import masks that every country needs. Keep your differences aside and lets cooperate. If not for our government, at least for our frontliners.

As for the 90 unlinked cases. 21 are singaporeans or PR, 5 S pass holders and 64 work permit holders. The numbers are quickly escalating due to the living conditions in dormitories which the govt are rectifying at the moment. Cases of Singaporeans infected are relatively low compared to other countries. Just read and quit complaining can or not?

59,pinkcorona_9,I dont think this is working out unless ccb happens.. coz most of the cases now coming from essential services and F&b .. as they are running still under cb period.. all the delivery guys are roaming..and chances of spread is as equal.. though you stay at home.. ( example: imagine food delivery guy has covid ..how many houses he might have roam within the 14 days symptom period.. in order for himself to realise..it is not just about wearing masks..but his hands should be clean..self hygiene..etc etc..not only food delivery guy..but any other online platform delivery/ or any other essential  service when we go ) but its really difficult to manage and control..in my opinion..unless total lockdown happens..each and everyone stays at home.. cooks own food.. cutoff from outside real world..i know its very difficult..but it can be achieved  just to kill this virus) its just my opinion .. not to hurt anyone..,2020-04-13T16:54:43.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-7UXTnHRy7/,2020-04-13T15:55:49.000Z,"[JUST IN] 280 of the new cases are Work Permit holders in the dormitories.

Construction work still goes on, those on LOA still remain in the same vicinity as others, because they don't have a comfortable HDB to retreat to like most of us and worst of all, rooms are still packed to the brim with 16 pax.

Saving the Singapore economy instead of ruining it further would be his top priority because eventually when all stabilise we can work our way back up. Pls rethink.
