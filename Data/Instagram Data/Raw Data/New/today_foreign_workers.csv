But she didn’t say anything, because her 12-year-old son’s primary school teacher had grown to be like a family member, lending her money on several occasions and even taking on the role as the boy’s guardian.

Then came the day she allowed the boy to go over to the man’s place for a sleepover...

“Back then, I thought the country’s borders would only be closed for 14 days. I remember being in tears crossing the Causeway, feeling confused and directionless,’’ he says. 

💔The separation from loved ones in Malaysia, including his girlfriend, was worsened by a bout of dengue fever last June. Many of Mr Wong’s personal plans have been put on hold, including his proposal to his girlfriend.

“I will just tell them, if you don’t like what I do, then I’ll tear up the paper,” he said. “When people tell me such things, it goes into one ear and then out the other, I don’t let it bother me.”

It is the happiness of commuters that keeps him doing what he does. The moment he boards an MRT train, he springs to action, whipping out a sketchpad, pencil and eraser, before proceeding to methodically sketch the commuters around him, one by one.

Once the 72-year-old is done with each sketch, he will offer the artwork to the commuter free of charge. He started this hobby in 2014, and that he hardly takes rest days.

His wife has a relapse of gastric cancer and he has become increasingly familiar with the feelings of overwhelming helplessness that many caregivers of advanced cancer patients have.

In October, the actress’ fanclub @rbkd shared a very emotional post from Rui En, where she revealed that her cat had passed away ""completely suddenly and unexpectedly"". 

In that post, she wrote: ""I have been alternating between feeling OK and breathtaking devastation. The pain is more like an emptiness, a hole that feels like it can never be filled again. I'm afraid to sleep because I want to avoid that moment of waking up feeling everything is ok, only to have that realization that she is gone. I can't eat...""

In a recent interview with @8dayssg, Rui En was asked if she was feeling better. 

She said: ""I'm just not someone who wants to have kids, nor someone who feels incomplete without having kids, but we all do have a nurturing side, and I translated that onto my animals.  I really do treat them as my kids, so when you have a child pass away suddenly, it's very traumatic...

""There are certain days where you feel okay, [and] some days where you feel like you might not be okay, and that's okay. It really was the first time for me, [experiencing] this kind of grief and trauma. I did go for some grief counselling via Zoom [with a counsellor from USA], I actually haven't written about it, but I intend to, 'ços I want to normalise mental health care...""

Ahmed Salim, a 31-year-old Bangladeshi, was convicted of a murder charge, which carries the mandatory death penalty in Singapore. Clad in a purple prison jumpsuit, he was expressionless as the sentence was passed.

Ahmed had admitted to the killing acts but disputed claims that he intended to cause the death of his girlfriend, Indonesian domestic worker Nurhidayati Wartono Surata, on Dec 30, 2018.

The couple had dated for five years and decided to get engaged, but she began seeing other men.&nbsp;When Nurhidayati, then 34, refused to break up with another foreign worker she was dating, he tightened a towel around her neck, then strangled her with a drawstring from his jacket.

During his trial, Ahmed alleged that Nurhidayati had gravely provoked him when she said, in reference to her other boyfriend: “He is better than you, he is better than you in the hotel, he is better in bed, he is better financially. If you don’t believe (me), next week I will go with him, will make a video and show you.”

16,huh.ziq,"I believe that the lady’s dumb choices of words led to the guy’s rage. If only she had shut her mouth, and politely asked for a separation, i am sure she would still live to be with her other boyfriend. Besides, the convicted spent 5 years with her and just when he wanted to pop the question, the lady admits to seeing a man far better financially and sexually than him. We all understand that rage building up in the convicted, and to add fuel to the fire, the victim criticised the convicted as his standards are lower compared to the other guy.I am not siding with anyone here but both sides are equally wrong, The victim shouldn’t have criticised him and should’ve asked for a separation way earlier or in a polite manner. Or don’t even see another man whilst being in a relationship at all ! Avoid that ! The man should’ve kept calm and not lay hands on the victim, but due to the overwhelming pressure put on him by the victim. He took her life. Don’t ever lay your hands on your partners in a abusive way, Don’t ever let your rage and anger control you, it will lead to you doing actions you wished you never did.",2020-12-16T07:09:53.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIzpXRBBp1U/,2020-12-15T05:39:20.000Z,"Yesterday, the High Court sentenced a foreign worker to death for murdering his girlfriend, rejecting his claim that she humiliated him right before he killed her.

Ahmed Salim, a 31-year-old Bangladeshi, was convicted of a murder charge, which carries the mandatory death penalty in Singapore. Clad in a purple prison jumpsuit, he was expressionless as the sentence was passed.

Ahmed had admitted to the killing acts but disputed claims that he intended to cause the death of his girlfriend, Indonesian domestic worker Nurhidayati Wartono Surata, on Dec 30, 2018.

The couple had dated for five years and decided to get engaged, but she began seeing other men.&nbsp;When Nurhidayati, then 34, refused to break up with another foreign worker she was dating, he tightened a towel around her neck, then strangled her with a drawstring from his jacket.

During his trial, Ahmed alleged that Nurhidayati had gravely provoked him when she said, in reference to her other boyfriend: “He is better than you, he is better than you in the hotel, he is better in bed, he is better financially. If you don’t believe (me), next week I will go with him, will make a video and show you.”

What was terrifying was when he’d call my home number the moment I got back and tell me that he knows what I was wearing and what I was doing. I didn’t know if he was telling the truth but I was so frightened that I drew the curtains shut immediately. I don’t even know who he was,"" she said. 

This unknown individual even threatened Fiona during these conversations. “He said he would call my mum and speak to her if I hung up on him,  she revealed.  As a child, I couldn’t understand what was going on. I didn’t know what to do, so I told my mother about the incident. It was pretty stressful.”

Ms Zhou Xiaoxuan, 27, is suing Zhu Jun, a prominent television host whom she accuses of forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is demanding a public apology from Zhu and 50,000 yuan (S$10,201) in damages.

Ms Zhou's case is being closely watched as it followed the passage of China's first Civil Code in May, which provided an expanded definition of sexual harassment and greater protection for victims.

Ms Zhou, who is better known by her nickname Xianzi, alleged that Zhu harassed her when she worked as an intern for state broadcaster CCTV six years ago.

She first posted her allegations online in 2018. Zhu, who denies the claims, unsuccessfully filed a counter lawsuit accusing her of damaging his reputation...

A 47-year-old Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (ICA) officer was charged today with accepting bribes from two female Chinese nationals between 2018 and last year. The bribes were in exchange for helping the women stay in Singapore by arranging for them to get special passes. 

He appeared in court on Tuesday with the women — Liang Qinglan, 37, and Cheng Wenjuan, 32.

Special passes are issued by either the ICA or Ministry of Manpower. They allow foreigners to stay in Singapore for specific purposes, such as to assist in investigations and attend court proceedings.

The charges Teo faces include: 
- trying to obtain an Apple iPhone X from Liang 
- obtaining a red packet with 188.88 yuan (S$38.50)
- obtaining at least S$2,100 in cash	
- obtaining loans amounting to about 7,000 yuan
- obtaining free sex on several occasions
- obtaining a free massage and masturbation

A 47-year-old Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (ICA) officer was charged today with accepting bribes from two female Chinese nationals between 2018 and last year. The bribes were in exchange for helping the women stay in Singapore by arranging for them to get special passes. 

He appeared in court on Tuesday with the women — Liang Qinglan, 37, and Cheng Wenjuan, 32.

Special passes are issued by either the ICA or Ministry of Manpower. They allow foreigners to stay in Singapore for specific purposes, such as to assist in investigations and attend court proceedings.

The charges Teo faces include: 
- trying to obtain an Apple iPhone X from Liang 
- obtaining a red packet with 188.88 yuan (S$38.50)
- obtaining at least S$2,100 in cash	
- obtaining loans amounting to about 7,000 yuan

As it turned out, the website of Radio France Internationale had mistakenly published about 100 prewritten obituaries of prominent figures.

Several hours after the obituaries first ran Monday, the public radio station, which broadcasts in France and abroad, apologised and started taking the reports offline.

While the wider community here is gradually having some normality as they go about their lives, Mr Shermaraja and many migrant workers remain indoors, save for work and essential errands.

Mr Shermaraja gave TODAY a glimpse into his life since returning to work last month after being cooped up for almost half a year.

It can be as simple as speaking to people in need near their homes, said a social activist at a lunchtime webinar earlier this week. 

Citing the examples of migrant and low-income workers, Mr Cai Yinzhou @yinzjoee told the audience of TODAY’s inaugural Instagram Live webinar series that they can invite these workers for coffee and just chat with them about their lives. He told TODAY later that this type of interaction could help to change perspectives about these workers.

“I think the best kind of interviews, the best insights that you can get, are really from conversations,” said the director of Citizen Adventures, which organises tours to Geylang @geylangadventures and Dakota to raise awareness on social issues specific to the neighbourhoods.

The 30-year-old was responding to a question asked by moderator and CNA presenter Elizabeth Neo about how youths can stay informed about social causes they support, and to whom they ought to be speaking.

Both were part of a panel discussion titled “Activism no longer a dirty word: The rise and impact of youth activism and its future in Singapore”. It was the first in a series of four discussions on issues affecting Singapore society.

They were joined by TODAY senior journalist Navene Elangovan and Ms Dipa Swaminathan @dipagyps, a lawyer and founder of the migrant workers group ItsRainingRaincoats @itsrainingraincoats.

His lawyers argued that in the spur of the moment, he “wanted to take a video of a female using the toilet”. And so, he did. 

He went to the women's toilet, chose the toilet cubicle closest to the entrance and filmed the victim with his mobile phone from above the cubicle door. The woman was in a state of undress and relieving herself.

The last thing Khatera saw were the three men on a motorcycle who attacked her just after she left her job at a police station in Afghanistan's central Ghazni province. 

They shot at her and stabbed her in the eyes with a knife. Waking up in hospital, everything was dark.

""I asked the doctors, why I can't see anything? They told me that my eyes are still bandaged because of the wounds. But at that moment, I knew my eyes had been taken from me,"" she said.

22,nabisah18,Hahahhaha..am laughing at all the ignorant comments here about the human rights and feminism. It has not done anything in the 1st world or the 3rd world country. Women are still exploited around the world be it at work or home. Read real stuff and you will know the real Afghan and how they treat their woman before American created the puppet Taliban. Read real history not propaganda. Do Research. condemning is easy but without facts.  Media has twisted info with an agenda. Read and research the truth you will know.,2020-11-11T09:06:35.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CHcCVC6BCB-/,2020-11-11T05:04:19.000Z,"This was possibly her own father’s doing. 

The last thing Khatera saw were the three men on a motorcycle who attacked her just after she left her job at a police station in Afghanistan's central Ghazni province. 

They shot at her and stabbed her in the eyes with a knife. Waking up in hospital, everything was dark.

""I asked the doctors, why I can't see anything? They told me that my eyes are still bandaged because of the wounds. But at that moment, I knew my eyes had been taken from me,"" she said.

She blames the attack on Taliban militants, and says the assailants acted on a tip-off from her father who vehemently opposed her working outside the home.

The attack on Ms Khatera, 33, is indicative of a growing trend, human rights activists say, of an intense and often violent backlash against women taking jobs, especially in public roles.

The last thing Khatera saw were the three men on a motorcycle who attacked her just after she left her job at a police station in Afghanistan's central Ghazni province. 

They shot at her and stabbed her in the eyes with a knife. Waking up in hospital, everything was dark.

""I asked the doctors, why I can't see anything? They told me that my eyes are still bandaged because of the wounds. But at that moment, I knew my eyes had been taken from me,"" she said.

She blames the attack on Taliban militants, and says the assailants acted on a tip-off from her father who vehemently opposed her working outside the home.

The attack on Ms Khatera, 33, is indicative of a growing trend, human rights activists say, of an intense and often violent backlash against women taking jobs, especially in public roles.

Among the items he took, were: Two bras from a washing machine, four panties from another washing machine, a laundry bag containing a sports bra and underwear, and a black leather wallet. He also took multiple items of clothing hanging along a common corridor, including two pairs of panties, a bra and several pairs of socks, and a pair of black shorts. 

His modus operandi was to check washing machines at the dormitory's launderettes or along corridors for women's undergarments. 

The court heard that he would then take the undergarments to pantry rooms “to look at them up close”, and that he would leave the undergarments behind in these rooms thereafter.

In the span of less than two months, he took some nine laundry bags with assorted clothing, and trespassed into King Edward VII Hall on eight occasions. 

Among the items he took, were: Two bras from a washing machine, four panties from another washing machine, a laundry bag containing a sports bra and underwear, and a black leather wallet.

In the span of less than two months, he took some nine laundry bags with assorted clothing, and trespassed into King Edward VII Hall on eight occasions. 

Among the items he took, were: Two bras from a washing machine, four panties from another washing machine, a laundry bag containing a sports bra and underwear, and a black leather wallet. He also took multiple items of clothing hanging along a common corridor, including two pairs of panties, a bra and several pairs of socks, and a pair of black shorts. 

His modus operandi was to check washing machines at the dormitory's launderettes or along corridors for women's undergarments. 

The court heard that he would then take the undergarments to pantry rooms “to look at them up close”, and that he would leave the undergarments behind in these rooms thereafter.

In the span of less than two months, he took some nine laundry bags with assorted clothing, and trespassed into King Edward VII Hall on eight occasions. 

Among the items he took, were: Two bras from a washing machine, four panties from another washing machine, a laundry bag containing a sports bra and underwear, and a black leather wallet. He also took multiple items of clothing hanging along a common corridor, including two pairs of panties, a bra and several pairs of socks, and a pair of black shorts.

In the span of less than two months, he took some nine laundry bags with assorted clothing, and trespassed into King Edward VII Hall on eight occasions. 

Among the items he took, were: Two bras from a washing machine, four panties from another washing machine, a laundry bag containing a sports bra and underwear, and a black leather wallet. He also took multiple items of clothing hanging along a common corridor, including two pairs of panties, a bra and several pairs of socks, and a pair of black shorts.

Mr Li Hua, 47, has a condition called ankylosing spondylitis, which caused his bones to fuse and his spine to curve forwards.

For more than twenty years, he has relied on his mother to help him get through each day, from preparing meals, to getting dressed and going to the bathroom. It is help that Ms Tang Dongchen, 71, has given with grace.

“I never complained about him and I never told him off,” said Ms Tang. 
“He is my son. It’s not his fault that he’s got this disease.”

To show his gratitude to his mother, Mr Li, who lives in the central Chinese province of Hunan, often plays his favourite Chinese song on the harmonica: In the World, Only Mama is Dear.

Mr Li’s condition began to worsen when he was about 18 and over time he became bent over, his face just a few centimetres from his thighs.

Before Mr Li had a wheelchair, Ms Tang would carry her son on her back, taking him to doctors in search of treatment...

""When I said to her, 'Mom, you revealed my pregnancy.' She goes, 'Emma, you announced it!' And I said, 'No I didn't. That was a tabloid.' She goes, 'Oh I didn’t ... that wasn't clear.’ ”

For four months, she procrastinated getting it checked.

When she finally did, Ms Vivienne Wong, then 32 (pictured above, right), was diagnosed with breast cancer. 

Because her cancer grew so fast, her doctor urged her to get a mastectomy immediately, which involved removing her entire right breast. “That was one of the most devastating moments,” Ms Wong said. 

Even though she got it reconstructed, it was not the same to her. “It’s dead inside. It’s numb, it’s really just a prosthetic in my chest.”

Ms Wendy New, 42 (pictured above, left), discovered she had breast cancer when she was 39, but opted not to undergo a mastectomy. She recalled how a close male friend had urged her to do it because it was a simple process of cutting off “a piece of meat”.

“People don’t know how to react to cancer patients,” Ms New said. “They don’t need your advice, they just need someone to be there to listen to them. They don’t need you to understand exactly what they are going through, because you wouldn’t.”

After dating for five years, Bangladeshi worker Ahmed Salim and his girlfriend Nurhidayati Wartono Surata got engaged and planned to get married.

If we are ALL supposed to wear a mask the moment we step out of our homes even if only it is just to go down to check the letter box for letters then how can we be so easily  infected just cos pple at the block are infected? So does it means tat wearing a mask actually don't really protect us or what? Or is it cos we are packed into a crowded lift? But even so is only a minute or 2 inside the lift..

5,potatocoffeepot,Singaporeans are not stupid or blind..we have seen the efforts u as our PM has made to help not only us but the foreign workers n I m sure a lot of Singaporeans appreciate what you have done for us n the foreign workers..👍😊...Ur brother Lee Hsian Yang's actions over the Oxley house tell us the person he is...spiteful n mean to his own brother n did not hesitate to humiliate his own elder brother including not giving any due consideration for us Singaporeans. He not only make our PM but the people of Singapore the laughing stock in the eyes of the outside world. Such a person who cares nothing about humiliating his very own brother do not deserve any kind of respect let alone my vote..even if u hv grudges towards our PM. Is there a need to humiliate him to such extent?? Have u ever pause for a second n spare a thought for your very respected father LKY n your dear mother when u n tat horrible sister of yours openly n publicly insult him. Your horrible words n action has done irreparable  damage to the image of Singapore.. n you expect us to support you...?? U hv 2 sons too..if they fight..would you as a father stand at the sideline n cheer them on? U and your sister are truly pitiful n pathetic...n i truly thank God tat both your parents are no longer around to see you n your sister's this kind of horrible behaviour towards our PM...sigh,2020-06-29T14:46:22.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CCBYbb-p9Ws/,2020-06-29T14:01:10.000Z,"Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says the General Election is not about him or any family disputes.

Beside the Urgent renovation to others facilities to cater to those not affected yet. Can the minister in charge pls updated which ministries is spending this additional cost including all the manpower, logistics, rental of space, etc,etc. To execute this overlook mistake made?. Or just like the Youth Olympic where additional hundred millions was cough out due to error of under costing. Or further down where buying the wrong share n cost  to lost sin 500 millions. (No One is responsible???). It high time, the respective in charge is (MAN) enough to admit the mistakes make. Just like in school. WE were told by teacher.

5,aliciatan4,"Demonize COVID 19 so they can develop the vaccines to ""save"" the world! If you analyse the facts, the infected patients are killed by the HIV medicine, their existing illnesses and their equally toxic prescriptions not COVID 19! HIV medicine can trigger liver failure, pancreas failure, heart problems, an increase acid in the blood that can be fatal plus other adverse reactions! It is always the wrong treatment that kills the patients. Our unharmed immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, pathogens, diseases, free radicals and cancer cells! However , the so-called experts recommended using cancer causing agents disinfectants, hand sanitizers and alcohol to ""protect"" the population, leaving everyone more vulnerable to COVID 19! Needless to say, the infected cases quadrupled in Singapore and around the world! Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She was a victim of the horrific medicines. Subsequently, she discovered the correct diet will activate the immune system to fight and subdue any unseen enemy without any medication or exercise.True healing means eliminating toxins, never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19. We do not need poison to ""protect""or ""heal"" us. I used Whatsapp to help a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication by replicating Jessica Seah's diet and nontoxic treatment. Appropriate cheap food can activate the immune system. It is cheap, simple and very effective. No expensive ventilators or toxic chemicals like disinfectants and hand sanitizers were needed!🇸🇬",2020-04-26T08:04:38.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_bTGFshUHk/,2020-04-26T02:00:26.000Z,"On April 23, the total number of people infected with Covid-19 crossed the 10,000-mark, 91 days after the first case was reported in Singapore on Jan 23.&nbsp;⁣

2,aliciatan4,"I urge the leaders all over the world to contact Jessica Seah from Singapore so this unpredecented global pandemic can end swiftly without any more deaths, bankruptcies, lockdowns, retrenchments and viral mutations! WHO is clueless how the immune system really works based on their wrong recommendations like using disinfectants, hand sanitizers, alcohol and soap. They contain cancer causing agents like formaldehyde Triclosan， sodium laurel sulphate， parabens etc. that will impair the immune system and damage the organs, leaving the population more vulnerable to COVID 19! True healing means eliminating toxins, never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! I posted proofs including a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication plus other impressive cases. Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, pathogens, diseases, free radicals and cancer cells! It is always the wrong treatment methods that kill the patients! Jessica Seah's nontoxic treatment method is cheap, simple and very effective.

Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, diseases, pathogens, free radicals and cancer cells. I hope the world will not keep repeating the history of having to deal with new strains of superbugs caused by the man-made chemicals like medicines , vaccines, disininfectants, hand sanitizers, etc. The more such toxins are used, the more vulnerable will be the population will be to infections and diseases!

7,issacj.17,"As you can see, there are many sides of the issue. As we look at the legal pov, there are more rights for women to exercise that extends beyond taking care of the family. Women are often seen as the caretaker of the family, hence more time is dedicated to home, which companies see as less time for work. Hence, companies are less willing to pay higher wages to women. On the other hand, the notion that men are seen as more powerful and hence receive more pay is changing and that idea will be dissolved in the distant future. Nonetheless, with changing family values, societies are still struggling with the idea that women are now working. Hence, we have yet to understand and decide how women will play a role both at work and home and what approaches companies should take to resolve this issue especially considering whether it is in their financial interest to do so.",2020-01-17T15:30:46.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B7IUZTtg6l2/,2020-01-10T07:00:38.000Z,"Women in Singapore are not only still earning less than men today, but the gender wage gap has increased slightly between 2002 and 2018, a study by the Ministry of Manpower has found. #l#linkinbio to learn more."
