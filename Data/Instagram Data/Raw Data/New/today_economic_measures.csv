As Christians get ready to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ today, the familiar hymns and carols that would typically resonate through church halls during Christmas festivities will be largely heard online due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

The various churches interviewed by TODAY said that while they have gradually raised the limits of the number of worshippers allowed within their premises, in accordance with government guidelines, there are some people who are more comfortable worshipping from home because of the global health crisis.

Religious organisations have been allowed to admit up to 100 people since Oct 3 — with safe distancing and management measures in place. This limit is due to be raised to 250 people, in five zones of up to 50 people each, when Singapore enters the final phase of reopening its economy on Dec 28.

Unbeknownst to many, Mr Firdaus could do with a helping hand himself. 

The pandemic has cost him his marine engineering job and forced him to take up odd jobs which include cleaning work, on top of having to care for his pregnant wife and three children aged between 14 and 10.

“Yes, of course, it’s difficult for me. But I want to help people who think they can’t be helped. With the resources that I have, it’ll be a waste if I don’t,” he said. 

The pandemic and its devastating impact on the economy have affected many people’s lives and livelihoods, casting a gloom over the entire year. But this has not deterred ordinary Singaporeans like Mr Firdaus from stepping up to bring joy to others. 

These community volunteers distribute food, clean up homes, shelter the homeless and spread cheer — all the while navigating the pandemic restrictions. Some of the volunteers’ brave fronts also mask the struggles that they are going through themselves due to the pandemic...

The pandemic has cost him his marine engineering job and forced him to take up odd jobs which include cleaning work, on top of having to care for his pregnant wife and three children aged between 14 and 10.

“Yes, of course, it’s difficult for me. But I want to help people who think they can’t be helped. With the resources that I have, it’ll be a waste if I don’t,” he said. 

The pandemic and its devastating impact on the economy have affected many people’s lives and livelihoods, casting a gloom over the entire year. But this has not deterred ordinary Singaporeans like Mr Firdaus from stepping up to bring joy to others. 

These community volunteers distribute food, clean up homes, shelter the homeless and spread cheer — all the while navigating the pandemic restrictions. Some of the volunteers’ brave fronts also mask the struggles that they are going through themselves due to the pandemic...

The government has since admitted that the order to cull the country's entire mink population was illegal. 

The order was given after authorities found Covid-19 outbreaks at hundreds of mink farms, including a new strain of the virus, suspected of being able to compromise the efficacy of vaccines.

""We have two generations of really skilled mink farmers, father and son, who in a very, very short time have had their life's work shattered,"" Ms Frederiksen told reporters after a meeting with a mink farmer and his son at their farm near Kolding in Western Denmark.

""It has been emotional for them, and... Sorry. It has for me too,"" Ms Frederiksen said with a wavering voice, pausing for breath in between words.

Denmark's mink population is one of the world's biggest and highly valued for the quality of its fur. The head of the Danish mink breeders' association has said that the industry, which employs around 6,000 people and exports fur pelts worth US$800 million (S$1,071 million) annually, is finished.

The government has since admitted that the order to cull the country's entire mink population was illegal. 

The order was given after authorities found Covid-19 outbreaks at hundreds of mink farms, including a new strain of the virus, suspected of being able to compromise the efficacy of vaccines.

""We have two generations of really skilled mink farmers, father and son, who in a very, very short time have had their life's work shattered,"" Ms Frederiksen told reporters after a meeting with a mink farmer and his son at their farm near Kolding in Western Denmark.

""It has been emotional for them, and... Sorry. It has for me too,"" Ms Frederiksen said with a wavering voice, pausing for breath in between words.

Denmark's mink population is one of the world's biggest and highly valued for the quality of its fur. The head of the Danish mink breeders' association has said that the industry, which employs around 6,000 people and exports fur pelts worth US$800 million (S$1,071 million) annually, is finished.

The government has since admitted that the order to cull the country's entire mink population was illegal. 

The order was given after authorities found Covid-19 outbreaks at hundreds of mink farms, including a new strain of the virus, suspected of being able to compromise the efficacy of vaccines.

""We have two generations of really skilled mink farmers, father and son, who in a very, very short time have had their life's work shattered,"" Ms Frederiksen told reporters after a meeting with a mink farmer and his son at their farm near Kolding in Western Denmark.

""It has been emotional for them, and... Sorry. It has for me too,"" Ms Frederiksen said with a wavering voice, pausing for breath in between words.

Denmark's mink population is one of the world's biggest and highly valued for the quality of its fur. The head of the Danish mink breeders' association has said that the industry, which employs around 6,000 people and exports fur pelts worth US$800 million (S$1,071 million) annually, is finished.

By December, it will be compulsory to use the TraceTogether mobile application or token to check in at venues such as workplaces, schools, malls as well as food and beverage outlets under the Government's plan to further reopen the economy.

At these venues, people will not be able to check in by scanning their identification cards or SafeEntry QR codes with their phones, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office said in a statement yesterday.

Instead, they will have to either use the TraceTogether app to scan a QR code at the premises or have the staff there scan the QR code found on their token.

Currently, only the use of SafeEntry is compulsory.

14,christinelimlc,"Knee-jerk reaction to say it is unfair. Cannot compare HSK’s remark (he’s just saying some people are racist and cannot accept a non-Chinese PM - which is true) to Raeesah’s which were more serious as she mentioned “Rich Chinese” and “Whites” and “Christian pastor” and implied they are given preferential treatment. Both are unwise to publicly make such remarks, of course. Personally, I think we should not play into the hands of people trying to manipulate and divide S’poreans.

More likely to have a freak election result of potential PAP  wipeout at EC & Aljunied GRC and by extension WP & PSP winning all the seats they are contesting for and PAP losing 2/3 majority if we believe her very persuasive speech. That’s a very scary reality, so  we must think and vote very carefully. It’s a very thin line between wanting more “dissenting” voices in Parliament, believing people who just NATO, and having hardworking but less glib MPs and a stable future. It’s a real dilemma indeed. Don’t think it’s “unfair” for PAP to want hold the fort! WP also put all their so-called A-Team “heavy weights” in Aljunied  and nobody says that’s unfair!",2020-07-04T18:05:29.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CCNnwJsl4OR/,2020-07-04T08:05:57.000Z,"GE2020: The surprise move by the ruling party’s heavyweight Heng Swee Keat to contest East Coast GRC has thrown up an “unfair” dilemma for voters there, the rival Workers’ Party (WP) team said.

I have reported to you, MAS and few of your MPs but all are taking back seats.  My personal experience on LTA public liability claims where the loss adjusters skills , integrity, ethnics  and characters are a big issues but none of you are willing to check on. MAS even tell me they do not regulate loss adjusters. There are no regulators in singapore to ""control"" the loss adjusters.

However, if we see a wave of complains, there might more than meets the eye. I don't think the party can effectively screen such things out, as I belief most background checks will involve their education levels, achievements, family etc. Even in social media, people will not normally post such things on someone at a higher position, so there is a limit how much you can screen someone. I belief if someone wants to to go into politics, they need to access themselves  first.

6,kelspyy,"One moment we hear DPM saying he would like to reach out to the individuals who commented on Ivan Lim’s character and examine the concerns thoroughly; the next moment we hear PM Lee saying that the short campaign period simply does not allow time for such investigations. We hear MP Masagos and DPM commenting how candidates should prove/ redeem themselves in election, but no single PAP member seemed to have sufficient proof points to present us with a much needed alternative/ balanced view point of Ivan Lim’s character. The PAP did not appear to have a unified position on how best to handle this saga. Also, why could and did no single PAP member did put up a case for Ivan? Instead most comments were directed to Ivan to speak for himself. Is it time to take a true and deeper review of the PAP’s candidate selection process? Did the candidate already prove themselves to the party sufficiently both in terms of calibre and integrity before the party decided on them being fielded?",2020-06-28T05:53:03.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CB712oTlZGp/,2020-06-27T10:22:50.000Z,"“I have emphasised that integrity and character are very important in our candidates.
