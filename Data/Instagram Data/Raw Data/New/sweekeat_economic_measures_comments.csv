As we enter into the second year of the pandemic, we are shifting gears. We will continue to tackle the immediate challenges. But this Budget’s central focus is on how we – all of us – can emerge stronger from this crisis – as an economy, as a society, and as one people. The Budget builds on the support that we provided in earlier Budgets, and the shared values that we stand for as Singaporeans. The investments that we are making this year and in the years ahead will put us on a stronger path to create a shared future for all.⁣

Having debated our Ministries’ plans to emerge stronger from COVID-19, the focus will now be on galvanising collective action to turn policies and resources into action. As one of our founding fathers Mr S. Rajaratnam said, Singapore must be a “democracy of deeds”. We will ensure that the funds are used well, to achieve maximal outcomes. More importantly, we will rally Singaporeans to work together, as we navigate the winds of change and waves of opportunities, to thrive in a post-COVID world.⁣

Our economic agencies are giving their best to ensure that our workers and companies can adapt and thrive in a post-COVID world. MTI and MOM presented these plans at the Committee of Supply debate in Parliament yesterday and today.  

While we can debate the specifics of each scheme, we must never forget the big picture: how do we develop a vibrant economy that can provide all Singaporean workers with a better life? Uplifting our workers, and in particular our lower wage workers, remains the highest priority for this Government.

This is why in October last year, I encouraged Minister @joteo.ylm to work with NTUC Secretary General @ng.chee.meng and the President of the Singapore National Employers Federation Dr Robert Yap to set up a Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers.  

I am happy that the workgroup has developed a roadmap for a major expansion of the Progressive Wage Model, by extending to sectors such as food services and retail. In the short term, this will more than double the PWM’s coverage from the existing 85,000 workers to 218,000 workers. Our ambition is to have some form of PWM in the longer-term for all sectors in Singapore. 

As we continue to transform our economy to emerge stronger from this crisis, let us do so together, and leave no worker behind.

LKY Noted Mr.Heng Is the BEST Secretary he had... 👏👏👏😍😍😍❤️❤️,2021-03-04T07:26:16.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CL9cejwhrhX/,2021-03-03T14:33:19.000Z,"Emerging stronger as an economy is a key focus of Budget 2021. Our economic agencies are giving their best to ensure that our workers and companies can adapt and thrive in a post-COVID world. MTI and MOM presented these plans at the Committee of Supply debate in Parliament yesterday and today.  

While we can debate the specifics of each scheme, we must never forget the big picture: how do we develop a vibrant economy that can provide all Singaporean workers with a better life? Uplifting our workers, and in particular our lower wage workers, remains the highest priority for this Government.

This is why in October last year, I encouraged Minister @joteo.ylm to work with NTUC Secretary General @ng.chee.meng and the President of the Singapore National Employers Federation Dr Robert Yap to set up a Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers.  

I am happy that the workgroup has developed a roadmap for a major expansion of the Progressive Wage Model, by extending to sectors such as food services and retail. In the short term, this will more than double the PWM’s coverage from the existing 85,000 workers to 218,000 workers. Our ambition is to have some form of PWM in the longer-term for all sectors in Singapore. 

As we continue to transform our economy to emerge stronger from this crisis, let us do so together, and leave no worker behind.

The discipline of balancing budgets is the cornerstone of our financial resilience.⁣
⁣
Early in the crisis, I sought the President’s approval to draw on the Reserves to deal decisively with the crisis, to save lives and livelihoods. As we enter the 2nd year of this crisis, we continue to tackle immediate challenges and provide targeted support to hard-hit sectors. Taken together, we expect to draw up to $53.7b in FY2020-2021.⁣
⁣
In my Budget Statement, I explained that if economic recovery progresses on track, we expect to fund the expenditures for the remainder of this term of Government without having to further draw on Reserves. But the global outlook is highly uncertain, and we must be prepared for a scenario where recovery is bumpier and takes much longer.⁣
⁣
If the economic and fiscal situations turn out to be worse than expected, we should still stay the course to invest for the longer term to emerge stronger. In such a scenario, how then do we continue to ensure good fiscal discipline?⁣
⁣
This issue is not unique to Singapore. Some countries have legislatively binding debt ceilings. In Germany, known for its fiscal rectitude, the issue of further suspension of the ‘debt brake’ was hotly debated.⁣
⁣
If the situation worsens, we may need to approach the President for a further draw on Past Reserves to continue funding investments that will enable Singapore to emerge stronger in the midst of this unprecedented crisis. We should then think hard about how we can ensure that if we need to draw on Past Reserves for this purpose, we can, over time, build this back.⁣
⁣
We have benefited during this crisis from the prudence and long-term orientation of previous generations. We owe it to future generations to exercise this prudence and ensure they can deal with future crises. I will say more at my Round-Up Speech.⁣
⁣
If we rally together and make the best choices to position us well for the longer term, I am confident that we can emerge stronger and build a better future for our children.⁣

9,nsc28112020,Thank you for your leadership and commitment to see SG through. ❤️,2021-02-24T15:51:28.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLqV4UZhp_M/,2021-02-24T04:30:06.000Z,"Drawing on Past Reserves for the 2nd year in a row was a difficult decision. The discipline of balancing budgets is the cornerstone of our financial resilience.⁣
⁣
Early in the crisis, I sought the President’s approval to draw on the Reserves to deal decisively with the crisis, to save lives and livelihoods. As we enter the 2nd year of this crisis, we continue to tackle immediate challenges and provide targeted support to hard-hit sectors. Taken together, we expect to draw up to $53.7b in FY2020-2021.⁣
⁣
In my Budget Statement, I explained that if economic recovery progresses on track, we expect to fund the expenditures for the remainder of this term of Government without having to further draw on Reserves. But the global outlook is highly uncertain, and we must be prepared for a scenario where recovery is bumpier and takes much longer.⁣
⁣
If the economic and fiscal situations turn out to be worse than expected, we should still stay the course to invest for the longer term to emerge stronger. In such a scenario, how then do we continue to ensure good fiscal discipline?⁣
⁣
This issue is not unique to Singapore. Some countries have legislatively binding debt ceilings. In Germany, known for its fiscal rectitude, the issue of further suspension of the ‘debt brake’ was hotly debated.⁣
⁣
If the situation worsens, we may need to approach the President for a further draw on Past Reserves to continue funding investments that will enable Singapore to emerge stronger in the midst of this unprecedented crisis. We should then think hard about how we can ensure that if we need to draw on Past Reserves for this purpose, we can, over time, build this back.⁣
⁣
We have benefited during this crisis from the prudence and long-term orientation of previous generations. We owe it to future generations to exercise this prudence and ensure they can deal with future crises. I will say more at my Round-Up Speech.⁣
⁣
If we rally together and make the best choices to position us well for the longer term, I am confident that we can emerge stronger and build a better future for our children.⁣

I am glad that our impacted industries are seeking to grow green shoots. There is no single path to recovery. So we must create new shoots, work hard to nurture them, and adapt as the situation evolves. 

Connect@Changi is one such green shoot. This is the first facility under the Connect@Singapore scheme. Through this dedicated facility at @singaporeexpo, business travellers from around the world can meet safely in Singapore, while ‘bubbled’ from our community. I hope that this facility will help catalyse business activities in Singapore and the region. 

We tried (successfully!) having an East Coast meeting through the floor-to-ceiling glass panes — this provides a face-to-face but contactless experience for safety. The experience is much more authentic than I initially envisaged it to be. 

This initiative embodies the spirit of how we will emerge stronger — by working in collaboration, by being willing to try new things and come up with creative solutions. The government will walk this journey of adaptation and innovation with our companies.
 
We must continue to persevere and nurture new shoots, so that we can catch the first sign of spring and emerge stronger, together.

This initiative embodies the spirit of how we will emerge stronger — by working in collaboration, by being willing to try new things and come up with creative solutions. The government will walk this journey of adaptation and innovation with our companies.
 
We must continue to persevere and nurture new shoots, so that we can catch the first sign of spring and emerge stronger, together.

⁣
I am glad that the international community takes an interest in our Budget as they see Singapore as an important base to do business. As a small and open economy, we must continue to preserve our linkages to the rest of the world. Amidst the disruptions caused by the pandemic, the Budget sets out our strategic plan to emerge stronger from this crisis and build an even more innovative, vibrant and dynamic economy.⁣
⁣
In particular, we had a good discussion on Singapore’s fiscal strategy. While we have drawn on past reserves for a second consecutive year, we are committed to running balanced budgets once the crisis is over.⁣
⁣
There was also keen interest on our green plans, including green financing and whether we could further accelerate our shift to electric vehicles.⁣

Over the Lunar New Year weekend, most of my time was spent going over my speech, thinking about the future, and reflecting on the past year.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
A cheerful senior in his 70s recently came up to me in Bedok. He smiled and asked if I would be giving out any “hongbaos” for Budget. Then he quickly turned serious and said that Budget should not be about goodies. Instead, he said it was much more important to invest in building up our people’s abilities and enabling them to do better. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Shared values such as this — building on what we inherit and passing on something better to the next generation — are what bind us together as a people. Indeed, we can take heart that through this crisis, we have built deeper social reserves — united in purpose, standing in solidarity, and facing difficulties with resilience and fortitude.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
As I make the final edits to the speech, I mulled over the name for this Budget. In June last year, I set out in my national broadcast, our plans to emerge stronger together. Since then, we have moved into Phase 3 of re-opening, and vaccination is well underway. As COVID-19 has accelerated changes and created new ones, we must also navigate these shifts to thrive in a post-COVID world. Our ability to plan ahead, even in a crisis, has been the hallmark of the Singapore Story.
&nbsp;
I decided therefore that Emerging Stronger Together should also be the name of the upcoming Budget — we must continue to focus on coming out of this crisis stronger, and forge partnerships to meet the challenges ahead, as one people.
&nbsp;
To emerge stronger, we must find new ways to innovate and transform our economy. We must strengthen our social compact and support one another, especially those with greater needs. On this little red dot, we must strengthen efforts to tackle climate change. Importantly, we must continue to be prudent in our spending.
&nbsp;
Together, let’s commit to build a Singapore that is economically vibrant, socially cohesive, environmentally sustainable and fiscally disciplined.

Since then, we have moved into Phase 3 of re-opening, and vaccination is well underway. As COVID-19 has accelerated changes and created new ones, we must also navigate these shifts to thrive in a post-COVID world. Our ability to plan ahead, even in a crisis, has been the hallmark of the Singapore Story.
&nbsp;
I decided therefore that Emerging Stronger Together should also be the name of the upcoming Budget — we must continue to focus on coming out of this crisis stronger, and forge partnerships to meet the challenges ahead, as one people.
&nbsp;
To emerge stronger, we must find new ways to innovate and transform our economy. We must strengthen our social compact and support one another, especially those with greater needs. On this little red dot, we must strengthen efforts to tackle climate change. Importantly, we must continue to be prudent in our spending.
&nbsp;
Together, let’s commit to build a Singapore that is economically vibrant, socially cohesive, environmentally sustainable and fiscally disciplined.

A cheerful senior in his 70s recently came up to me in Bedok. He smiled and asked if I would be giving out any “hongbaos” for Budget. Then he quickly turned serious and said that Budget should not be about goodies. Instead, he said it was much more important to invest in building up our people’s abilities and enabling them to do better. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Shared values such as this — building on what we inherit and passing on something better to the next generation — are what bind us together as a people. Indeed, we can take heart that through this crisis, we have built deeper social reserves — united in purpose, standing in solidarity, and facing difficulties with resilience and fortitude.&nbsp;

&nbsp;
CDCs play a very important role in supporting the vulnerable by coming up with local programmes to complement national schemes. Each CDC has its own programmes, but they also work closely together. Since COVID-19, our CDCs have collaborated together and with the community to launch more than 100 initiatives. The CDC Vouchers Scheme is one such example.
&nbsp;
CDC vouchers have benefited almost 350,000 households and more than 8,100 participating merchants to date. During this challenging period, household expenses will continue to weigh on the minds of many families. So we have decided to commit an additional $20 million for a second tranche of vouchers.
&nbsp;
A big thank you to our CDCs and to all our community partners. This is the spirit of #SingaporeTogether. I continue to encourage our CDCs to find new ways to build stronger partnerships with our community, hawkers and merchants.

&nbsp;
CDCs play a very important role in supporting the vulnerable by coming up with local programmes to complement national schemes. Each CDC has its own programmes, but they also work closely together. Since COVID-19, our CDCs have collaborated together and with the community to launch more than 100 initiatives. The CDC Vouchers Scheme is one such example.
&nbsp;
CDC vouchers have benefited almost 350,000 households and more than 8,100 participating merchants to date. During this challenging period, household expenses will continue to weigh on the minds of many families. So we have decided to commit an additional $20 million for a second tranche of vouchers.

GSTV is a permanent scheme to support lower- and middle-income Singaporeans. GSTV has three components – Cash, MediSave and U-Save. This year’s U-Save rebates are higher to better help our households cope during this difficult period. As part of the Care and Support Package announced during #SGBudget2020, eligible households will receive twice the regular amount of U-Save this financial year.

GSTV is a permanent scheme to support lower- and middle-income Singaporeans. GSTV has three components – Cash, MediSave and U-Save. This year’s U-Save rebates are higher to better help our households cope during this difficult period.

&nbsp;
GSTV is a permanent scheme to support lower- and middle-income Singaporeans. GSTV has three components – Cash, MediSave and U-Save. This year’s U-Save rebates are higher to better help our households cope during this difficult period. As part of the Care and Support Package announced during #SGBudget2020, eligible households will receive twice the regular amount of U-Save this financial year. Larger households will receive 2.5 times the regular amount.

Since several years ago, it is almost a ""tradition” to announce the date of the annual Budget around the turn of the year. This year is no different. 
 
But this year has been far from traditional. Instead of an annual Budget, we had four Budgets and two Ministerial Statements. To support our workers, companies and households through COVID-19, we introduced several rounds of support measures.

⁣
COVID-19 has accelerated technological trends and structural changes that will reshape the global economy, and throw up new challenges for societies.⁣
⁣
Science, technology and innovation will be critical to overcoming COVID-19, and in enabling us to emerge stronger. So we must stay the course and sustain our investments in research, innovation and enterprise, despite economic cycles.⁣
⁣
Singapore is committed to invest about 1% of our GDP in RIE each year, for the next five years. This is similar to our commitment to earlier research plans. In dollar terms, we are allocating $25billion for RIE2025.⁣
⁣
We remain committed to investing in basic research, and will set aside one-third of the overall budget to do so. We have also expanded the scope of RIE into human potential and sustainability. Our investment in human potential will improve prenatal and early childhood development, strengthen lifelong learning, and enable our seniors to remain healthy and active for as long as possible.⁣
⁣
At the same time, we will pursue sustainability in a broader way – to help us achieve our climate change commitments, and strengthen food resilience and biodiversity in our dense urban environment.⁣
⁣
Given the rapid pace of change and our evolving needs, we structured RIE2025 to give us greater ability and nimbleness by not allocating all the monies upfront. This will enable us to swiftly deploy unallocated funds to respond to emerging priorities and changes in the coming years.⁣
⁣
By working together to realise RIE2025, we can emerge stronger from this crisis and create more and better opportunities for our businesses and workers.&nbsp;⁣

This year’s meeting was held virtually, and we were joined by members who dialled in from around the world. 
 
Just as we had to adapt our meeting to COVID-19, we also had to adjust our RIE plans to take into account the shifts accelerated by the pandemic and our new operating environment. Research and innovation have been crucial in helping us contain and to eventually end the pandemic. They are equally important for driving economic growth and building a more resilient society post-COVID.
 
While much has changed in the last one year, often irrevocably, one thing has remained constant — and that is our commitment to research and innovation. The Council endorsed our RIE2025 plans — our plans for the next five years. I thank our RIEC members — who include global leaders in business and academia — for their support and contributions. RIE2025 will play an important role in creating new opportunities for our workers as well as tackling national needs, such as an ageing population and climate change.

This year’s JCBC is of special significance as we mark 30 years of diplomatic relations and also convened the meeting despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19.

Our substantive agenda this year reflects the strength of our cooperation. We added a new agenda item — public healthcare cooperation. This is timely given the pandemic, and as we tackle the common challenge of our ageing populations. 

To recover from this crisis, Vice Premier Han and I also discussed how to strengthen connectivity between Singapore and China. We expressed willingness to discuss ideas to open up borders, and restore normal people-to-people exchanges, at an appropriate time. 

We also reviewed the good progress made by our three Government-to-Government projects in Suzhou, Tianjin and Chongqing, as well as the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City and Singapore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative.

As a regional trade, finance and logistics hub, Singapore can contribute to China’s “dual circulation” strategy — to develop its domestic economy while deepening its linkages with other economies.
 
Economic cooperation will also create opportunities for our workers and businesses, as we grow our industries as part of our Industry Transformation Maps. We must press on with economic transformation and building deeper economic cooperation. 
 
I look forward to building stronger ties with China, and to co-chairing the 17th JCBC with Vice Premier Han next year.

0,dianapuichun,Thank you for sharing. I am participating in the Singapore Fintech Festival 2020. Heard your speech!,2020-12-07T02:40:16.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIetZtnBQ7A/,2020-12-07T02:30:34.000Z,"@sgfintechfest x @switchsingapore 2020 kicked-off today!
 
This is the world’s first week-long round-the-clock hybrid digital and physical event, involving some 60,000 participants and partners from over 40 cities. COVID-19 might have thrown the world a curveball. But this event is one example of how we innovated to cope with the virus.
 
The pandemic has created a unity of purpose across the world, from Silicon Valley to Shenzhen. Technology and innovation played a crucial role in our response to the crisis. They will also be critical in curtailing the pandemic and boosting economic recovery. Our commitment to innovation and to work together will be key to driving economic recovery and growth. In Singapore, we continue to deepen our tech capabilities. Today, I launched the Asian Institute of Digital Finance and the Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme.
 
In my speech at the opening of SFF X SWITCH, I also highlighted the need to use technology and innovation in a way that will build a future that is more inclusive and sustainable. I also emphasised the importance of creating a more resilient global commons as the foundation for a post-COVID future. One aspect is stronger governance on how data is shared. In Singapore, we launched the Singapore Financial Data Exchange today. This new approach to trusted data sharing pioneered by the Exchange can potentially be applied to other areas and jurisdictions.

In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, global cooperation is our only way to overcome crises and tackle global challenges. Just as a global response was needed for the world to emerge from the Global Financial Crisis more than a decade ago, we need to come together as one to overcome COVID-19.
 
The G20 has helped to rally a global response to the pandemic. Despite the extraordinary circumstances, the Saudi Presidency has demonstrated leadership in convening the countries involved to implement a forward-looking G20 Action Plan for a strong and sustainable global recovery.
 
The path towards a full recovery remains long and uncertain. There is still much that we must do together to emerge stronger. At the meeting, I underlined the importance of strengthening our collective resilience to cope with future shocks on all fronts. We must also commit ourselves to harnessing technology and green finance to build back better.
 
Singapore is honoured to have been invited to the G20 this year. I warmly congratulate the Saudi Presidency on its achievements. By working together, we can create a more resilient and sustainable future.

The G20 has helped to rally a global response to the pandemic. Despite the extraordinary circumstances, the Saudi Presidency has demonstrated leadership in convening the countries involved to implement a forward-looking G20 Action Plan for a strong and sustainable global recovery.
 
The path towards a full recovery remains long and uncertain. There is still much that we must do together to emerge stronger. At the meeting, I underlined the importance of strengthening our collective resilience to cope with future shocks on all fronts. We must also commit ourselves to harnessing technology and green finance to build back better.
 
Singapore is honoured to have been invited to the G20 this year. I warmly congratulate the Saudi Presidency on its achievements. By working together, we can create a more resilient and sustainable future.

Resuming general air travel to cities with low incidences of COVID-19 is key to restoring our global connectivity, and to reviving our aviation, aerospace and tourism sectors. Many jobs and businesses are at stake. 

Yesterday, @ongyekung announced the launch of the Singapore-Hong Kong Air Travel Bubble. This scheme will start with one flight of up to 200 travellers into each city daily and will be expanded over time if the arrangement works well. Travellers to Singapore will be tested before they fly and are expected to use the TraceTogether app or token.

This is an important step, as we move towards a new normal for air travel. We look forward to welcoming more visitors at @changiairport and more @singaporeair planes in the skies.

As we open up our borders and head towards Phase 3, we must continue to expand our testing capacity, strengthen contact tracing and remain vigilant. This way, we can gradually resume a sense of normalcy while keeping out new waves of infections.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is reshaping the world. The fusion of the digital, biological and physical space will open up many new opportunities.

We are building our Networked Trade Platform to make the movement of goods more seamless. We are helping our companies go digital and grow internationally. We are also investing more in R&D.

COVID-19 has accelerated many changes. So we have to move even faster. We are seeking to strengthen our digital connectivity, including through digital economy agreements.

19,guatsimsjirley,A big thank you for supporting the lower income group like me it's been a great help in time of need.,2020-10-25T13:14:30.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CGqutC3BPlR/,2020-10-23T01:30:02.000Z,"Workfare and the Progressive Wage Model are key policy innovations to uplift our lower-income workers. Through Workfare, the Government supplements their incomes with cash and CPF top-ups to provide for both their immediate and retirement needs.
 
During the pandemic, we are doing even more to help our lower-income workers. Through the Workfare Special Payment (WSP), each worker on Workfare will receive a total of $3,000 in cash. The first payment of $1,500 was made in July, and Workfare recipients will be receiving the balance $1,500 later this month. We also expanded the scheme in August so that the 70,000 workers who only started receiving Workfare for work done in 2020 will benefit. In total, 470,000 workers will be receiving the WSP.

I met many stallholders, some have been operating out of the market for decades. Some were second-generation stallholders. Business dropped sharply during the circuit breaker period.

So we are not back to normal yet.⁣

⁣
This popular market and food centre re-opened in June after a four-month renovation. It is known as one of the best breakfast and late-night supper places in the east. Glad to hear from Fengshan residents that the upgrading has led to a more pleasant dining experience.&nbsp; I’m happy that the efforts of Cheryl and her volunteers are making a difference.⁣
⁣
I met many stallholders, some have been operating out of the market for decades. Some were second-generation stallholders. Business dropped sharply during the circuit breaker period. With the improving situation, I’m glad to hear that it has improved quite a bit. But most residents remain cautious about the economic outlook and are careful about their spending. So we are not back to normal yet.⁣
⁣
I was also glad to hear from many residents who thanked me and my team for our Budget measures. These have supported them in many ways. Our hawkers and stallholders have been very resilient and working very hard — so let us continue to give our support, and at the same time keep our habits of wearing masks and keeping our safe distancing.⁣

Looking forward to meeting more families and residents of East Coast at our next GRC walkabout as a team!⁣

There was extensive debate on our economy. I set out the broad strokes of our economic strategy in my Ministerial Statement. And as we emerge from the worst of the crisis, we must redouble our efforts to help our companies transform and our workers upskill.

Unlike other countries, Singapore is both a city and a nation. Managing this unique dual identity will be critical to our success. Stay open to the world while forging our own identity. Stay globally connected while remaining independent. Embracing diversity while being socially cohesive. This dual identity has also enabled us to stay nimble in our fight against COVID-19.

Members also made many points on our fiscal situation. There continues to be great uncertainty on how the pandemic will evolve and the course of economic recovery. We all want to ensure Singapore is here for the long haul. So we must continue to spend in a principled and prudent way, and hand over to our children more than what we inherited from previous generations.

Our fight against COVID-19 is far from over. But I am confident that as long as we stay open and united as well as retain our core values, we will emerge stronger as a cohesive and resilient nation.

There was extensive debate on our economy. I set out the broad strokes of our economic strategy in my Ministerial Statement. And as we emerge from the worst of the crisis, we must redouble our efforts to help our companies transform and our workers upskill.

Unlike other countries, Singapore is both a city and a nation. Managing this unique dual identity will be critical to our success. Stay open to the world while forging our own identity. Stay globally connected while remaining independent. Embracing diversity while being socially cohesive. This dual identity has also enabled us to stay nimble in our fight against COVID-19.

Members also made many points on our fiscal situation. There continues to be great uncertainty on how the pandemic will evolve and the course of economic recovery. We all want to ensure Singapore is here for the long haul. So we must continue to spend in a principled and prudent way, and hand over to our children more than what we inherited from previous generations.

Our fight against COVID-19 is far from over. But I am confident that as long as we stay open and united as well as retain our core values, we will emerge stronger as a cohesive and resilient nation.

For those who live in 1-room and 2-room HDB flats, they will be receiving the first tranche of Grocery Vouchers in October. No application is required. These vouchers can be used at participating supermarkets: FairPrice, Giant, Prime Supermarket, and Sheng Siong Supermarket. You can find out more here: go.gov.sg/csp2020.
 
We hope these support measures go some way in helping our households during this difficult and highly uncertain period.

Samwoh’s commitment to innovation and sustainability has benefitted them significantly, especially during this pandemic. Many of the roads we drive on are paved with improved materials from the R&D work that Samwoh has undertaken over the years. And they are exploring further use of technology in their solutions. Samwoh also had an early focus on sustainability. Their use of locally recycled materials has provided resilience against external supply chain disruptions in the last few months. Samwoh continues to hire during the pandemic and is participating in the #SGUnited Skills Programme. I spoke to some of their interns and employees, one just started work three days ago.⁣
⁣
Under the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, there are now 117,000 committed jobs, traineeships and training opportunities. This is 25,500 more than a month ago. With the Jobs Growth Incentive, we can expect more jobs to be created in the coming months. We are also stepping up efforts to match jobseekers to these opportunities. So far, about 33,000 jobseekers have been matched to new opportunities.⁣
⁣
The road to recovery will be uneven and uncertain. I hope our workers and companies will continue to adapt, and make full use of the opportunities available. This is a difficult period, but if we make full use of this time, we can emerge stronger.⁣

To better support our lower- and middle-income households, I earlier announced that eligible families will get up to 250% of the regular GST Voucher – U-Save rebates this year. These additional rebates are part of the #SGBudget2020 Care and Support Package.
 
940,000 HDB households are benefitting from this scheme. The first two payments were made in April and July. The third payment will be made this month. In total, we will be disbursing $630 million of GSTV – U-Save this financial year.
 
All Singaporean households, including those who do not stay in HDB flats, would have received $100 in Solidarity Utilities Credit for their July or August utilities bill.
 
I hope these additional support goes some way in helping our households cope in these difficult times.

Yesterday, ahead of my upcoming Ministerial Statement, my colleagues and I met up with some of our SMEs in the morning. Together with @ntucsingapore Secretary-General @ng.chee.meng we also met union leaders as well as career coaches with @workforcesingapore in the afternoon.
 
Since we announced that I will be making a Ministerial Statement next Monday, some people have asked if more support was on the way. I took the opportunity to explain to some of our participants that there will not be a new round of support measures. The main purpose of my upcoming Ministerial Statement is to provide context for the Supplementary Supply Bill that will allocate resources for the measures announced in August.
 
At this stage of the crisis, my team and I are fully committed to support our workers and businesses by refining our policies, expanding outreach and improving implementation, to make the most of the $100 billion committed to the fight against COVID-19. We hope that businesses and workers can make the best use of the measures that have been committed
 
The discussions yesterday have given us a better sense of the pain points of jobseekers and businesses, opportunities for collaboration in the coming months, and new ideas that we can develop for Budget next year. Many businesses and jobseekers are going through a tough time. But with the support measures in place and by working closely together, we can help businesses stay viable and keep workers employed.

Yesterday, ahead of my upcoming Ministerial Statement, my colleagues and I met up with some of our SMEs in the morning. Together with @ntucsingapore Secretary-General @ng.chee.meng we also met union leaders as well as career coaches with @workforcesingapore in the afternoon.
 
Since we announced that I will be making a Ministerial Statement next Monday, some people have asked if more support was on the way. I took the opportunity to explain to some of our participants that there will not be a new round of support measures. The main purpose of my upcoming Ministerial Statement is to provide context for the Supplementary Supply Bill that will allocate resources for the measures announced in August.
 
At this stage of the crisis, my team and I are fully committed to support our workers and businesses by refining our policies, expanding outreach and improving implementation, to make the most of the $100 billion committed to the fight against COVID-19. We hope that businesses and workers can make the best use of the measures that have been committed
 
The discussions yesterday have given us a better sense of the pain points of jobseekers and businesses, opportunities for collaboration in the coming months, and new ideas that we can develop for Budget next year.

0,oliviakushu,Happy anniversary to China and Singapore by relation.  Happy working together,2020-09-15T11:22:17.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFJ5xPGBYIo/,2020-09-15T11:00:24.000Z,"Opened the FutureChina Global Forum 2020 this afternoon. The theme for this year is on how Singapore can contribute to China’s and ASEAN’s growth and build a more resilient future. 

I shared that countries must remain open and connected to the world and undertake adjustments so that globalisation works for them. Singapore can do its part by strengthening connectivity with the region. And in an era of tremendous change, businesses must forge new partnerships to emerge stronger from this crisis. You can read my speech here: https://go.gov.sg/fcgf.

This year marks thirty years of Singapore-China diplomatic relations. Next year, we will commemorate three decades of China-ASEAN dialogue. However, our ties go way back. More than a thousand years ago, there was already a vibrant trading network between China and Southeast Asia, and between our region and the world. 

This trading network and the bonds of our peoples have been resilient, ebbing and flowing over the last ten centuries. With such strong foundations, I am confident that we can emerge from this pandemic to a brighter and more resilient future for our peoples and for the world.

很高兴受邀为慧眼中国环球论坛开幕典礼致辞。由于冠病疫情的影响，全球经济正经历这个世纪以来最严重的衰退。后冠病的世界将和过去大不相同，我们必须做好准备。因此，本届论坛的主题是再贴切不过了。
 
世界各国必须确保它们的经济和全球贸易体系保持互联互通。新加坡也正在努力，跟区域国家和世界各国在贸易，数码互联互通及人员流动方面加强合作。在这个瞬息万变的时代，企业更必须注重合作，共同应对未来的挑战，同时把握新机遇。
 
今年是新中建交的30周年。新加坡会继续加深和中国的双边关系。当然，新中两国的合作，以及两国人民的往来，可以追溯到更久以前。只要我们共同努力，就能为后疫情时代做好准备，为人民创造一个更美好的未来。
 
尽管冠病对国际活动带来了严峻的危机，却没有阻挡大家继续交流，互相切磋。在此，我要感谢通商中国举办今年的论坛，将它搬到线上。谨祝本届论坛圆满成功!"

I shared that countries must remain open and connected to the world and undertake adjustments so that globalisation works for them. Singapore can do its part by strengthening connectivity with the region. And in an era of tremendous change, businesses must forge new partnerships to emerge stronger from this crisis.

The latest Jobs Situation Report by MOM on Monday showed that 2 in 5 workers retrenched in Q1 found jobs in June. The Jobs Growth Incentive is also expected to create more opportunities, especially for mature jobseekers.
 
When I met jobseekers and employers at the Trade and Connectivity Career Discovery Job Fair last Friday, together with Secretary-General @ng.chee.meng and his team at @ntucsingapore — many were understandably concerned about the future. The jobseekers I met were resilient, looking to adapt and take on new roles. Two of them were ICT professionals — who lost their jobs when their projects could not proceed due to the economic uncertainty. They were exploring job opportunities in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that were on offer at the Fair.
 
Despite the economic situation, I am glad that some companies are doing well and still hiring. @ilovee2i and @skillsfuturesg career coaches were on site to help our jobseekers. One lady, who lost her job in marketing at a MNC, decided to try a new area that more directly helped others. She discussed her options with an e2i career coach and told me that the coach gave her good advice.
 
So far this year, e2i, @workforcesingapore, and their partners have helped place at least 25,000 jobseekers, while providing career advisory and job search assistance to more than 35,000. I am glad that the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package is helping our workers and businesses, and our strong tripartite partnership is working well to help us weather this crisis and emerge stronger.
 
We will continue to face weaker hiring sentiments. Companies will need to continue to transform, and workers will need to upskill. Together, we need to adapt to the fast-evolving economic situation and prepare for the post-COVID world."

⁣
Several of my colleagues, including Ministers @tanseeleng, @joteo.ylm and @ongyekung spoke about how the Government has gone about doing so, from adjusting our Employment and S-Pass policies to strengthening fair consideration practices. They also shared about what more we could do, including with industries to groom more Singaporeans to take on leadership and specialists positions.⁣
⁣
We understand that many Singaporeans are anxious about their livelihoods, especially given our labour market situation. As I said in my speech yesterday, our starting point is that our economic strategies must serve the interests of Singaporeans. And we will adapt our policies to ensure that Singaporeans’ interests are upheld. But we must resist the temptation to turn inwards, which has happened in many parts of the world. Doing so will undermine the very essence of what has made us successful.⁣
⁣
Instead, our commitment is that we will develop Singaporeans fully, to enable our people to thrive in a post-COVID world. We will also adapt our social safety nets to better support those who have fallen on hard times and those who are more vulnerable. This is how we can serve Singaporeans’ interests best. This is how we can continue to thrive in an increasingly fractious and volatile world.⁣

To walk this journey together.👏,2020-09-01T16:19:29.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CEmMt7EhzUz/,2020-09-01T14:13:19.000Z,"Strengthening the Singaporean core in our workforce and creating more opportunities for our people have been recurrent themes in the first two days of the debate on the President’s Address.⁣
⁣
Several of my colleagues, including Ministers @tanseeleng, @joteo.ylm and @ongyekung spoke about how the Government has gone about doing so, from adjusting our Employment and S-Pass policies to strengthening fair consideration practices. They also shared about what more we could do, including with industries to groom more Singaporeans to take on leadership and specialists positions.⁣
⁣
We understand that many Singaporeans are anxious about their livelihoods, especially given our labour market situation. As I said in my speech yesterday, our starting point is that our economic strategies must serve the interests of Singaporeans. And we will adapt our policies to ensure that Singaporeans’ interests are upheld. But we must resist the temptation to turn inwards, which has happened in many parts of the world. Doing so will undermine the very essence of what has made us successful.⁣
⁣
Instead, our commitment is that we will develop Singaporeans fully, to enable our people to thrive in a post-COVID world. We will also adapt our social safety nets to better support those who have fallen on hard times and those who are more vulnerable. This is how we can serve Singaporeans’ interests best. This is how we can continue to thrive in an increasingly fractious and volatile world.⁣
⁣
Every Singaporean matters. Every worker matters. This is not just a slogan, but our commitment to each and every one of you. We will walk this journey with you, and get through this crisis into a better future.⁣

Another change we are seeing is the new role of Leader of the Opposition. I congratulate @pritamsingh76 on his appointment and trust that he will continue to put our national interest first.

Companies that have remained agile and invested in innovation have been able to pivot to new opportunities during this crisis.
 
I visited one such company — Forefront Medical Technology (FMT) — today. Forefront Medical, a precision engineering company, has been actively venturing into new business lines even before the pandemic. Originally focused on making medical products for drug delivery and respiratory care, they started building up automation capabilities, adding cleanroom capacity and growing their local talent pool.
 
When COVID-19 struck, Forefront Medical expanded into manufacturing products for COVID-19 diagnostics, including the production of swabs. Forefront Medical also hired 80 more staff to meet the increase in production demand.
 
Even in the midst of the crisis, there are still pockets of growth. There are many other companies like Forefront Medical, which are growing and hiring. The Jobs Growth Incentive, which I announced on Monday, will support these companies in increasing their local workforce, with more support for our mature workers. And we hope to better match jobseekers to these new opportunities.

The COVID-19 pandemic rages on in many parts of the world, and the global economy remains very weak. The Government will continue to help our workers and businesses through this crisis.

• First, we will continue to protect jobs by extending the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for up to seven months. We will adjust the level of support based on the pace of recovery of the different sectors. Most businesses will receive wage support for 17 months in total, up to March 2021.

• Second, we will encourage businesses that are growing to hire and increase their local workforce, through the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI).

• Third, we will continue to help those who have fallen on hard times, by extending the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) till Dec 2020. We are also studying how to continue supporting vulnerable employees and self-employed persons beyond 2020.

In addition, we are also providing additional targeted support for sectors that are hardest-hit, such as aerospace, aviation and tourism. We will also strengthen our transformation efforts to capture new opportunities, create better jobs, and reimagine our economy.

The measures announced today will cost $8 billion. We intend to fully fund them by reallocating funds from expenditures that have been delayed due to COVID-19. There are no plans to draw on Past Reserves for these measures, beyond what was approved earlier.

The situation continues to change very rapidly. We must continue to remain nimble and adapt as the pandemic progresses, and will further evolve our support if required. We have also started preparation for #Budget2021.

We are faced with an extraordinary crisis, but we are one people with extraordinary courage, commitment, and can-do spirit. We can beat this crisis as one people, and emerge stronger as a nation.

The COVID-19 pandemic rages on in many parts of the world, and the global economy remains very weak. The Government will continue to help our workers and businesses through this crisis.

• First, we will continue to protect jobs by extending the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for up to seven months. We will adjust the level of support based on the pace of recovery of the different sectors. Most businesses will receive wage support for 17 months in total, up to March 2021.

• Second, we will encourage businesses that are growing to hire and increase their local workforce, through the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI).

• Third, we will continue to help those who have fallen on hard times, by extending the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) till Dec 2020. We are also studying how to continue supporting vulnerable employees and self-employed persons beyond 2020.

In addition, we are also providing additional targeted support for sectors that are hardest-hit, such as aerospace, aviation and tourism. We will also strengthen our transformation efforts to capture new opportunities, create better jobs, and reimagine our economy.

16,s06021966,It's a good scheme. BUT importantly still must STRESS to all companies to retain staffs regardless of high or low wages. It is better to have job than none.,2020-08-18T09:07:56.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CD_Q5crh-7J/,2020-08-17T11:19:28.000Z,"This afternoon, I outlined how the Government will continue and evolve our support for our workers and businesses.

The COVID-19 pandemic rages on in many parts of the world, and the global economy remains very weak. The Government will continue to help our workers and businesses through this crisis.

• First, we will continue to protect jobs by extending the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for up to seven months. We will adjust the level of support based on the pace of recovery of the different sectors. Most businesses will receive wage support for 17 months in total, up to March 2021.

• Second, we will encourage businesses that are growing to hire and increase their local workforce, through the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI).

• Third, we will continue to help those who have fallen on hard times, by extending the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) till Dec 2020. We are also studying how to continue supporting vulnerable employees and self-employed persons beyond 2020.

In addition, we are also providing additional targeted support for sectors that are hardest-hit, such as aerospace, aviation and tourism. We will also strengthen our transformation efforts to capture new opportunities, create better jobs, and reimagine our economy.

The measures announced today will cost $8 billion. We intend to fully fund them by reallocating funds from expenditures that have been delayed due to COVID-19. There are no plans to draw on Past Reserves for these measures, beyond what was approved earlier.

The situation continues to change very rapidly. We must continue to remain nimble and adapt as the pandemic progresses, and will further evolve our support if required. We have also started preparation for #Budget2021.

We are faced with an extraordinary crisis, but we are one people with extraordinary courage, commitment, and can-do spirit. We can beat this crisis as one people, and emerge stronger as a nation.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues unabated in many parts of the world. Since May, the total number of cases has tripled to 20 million. The global economy has taken a very severe hit, and the situation could get worse.
 
In Singapore, we experienced our worst quarterly GDP performance on record in the second quarter. We have provided significant support for workers and businesses with almost $100 billion over four Budgets, with more than half coming from our Past Reserves. However, given the global economic and health crisis, we are likely to see more job losses and retrenchments in the coming months, and it will be many more months before our economy recovers fully. Even then, it will not be back to business as usual.
 
As we gradually re-open our economy, the recovery across industries is likely to be uneven and uncertain. Many sectors are gradually regaining their footing as economic activities resume. A few sectors are growing and even hiring. But several sectors have been very hard-hit and are unlikely to recover for some years to come.
 
Over the past few weeks, many people have shared with me their anxieties and concerns about their livelihoods. Weighing on their minds was also the uncertainty ahead, given that some of the support schemes are expiring. I will be providing more details on how we will evolve and extend our support for our companies and our workers in my Ministerial Statement on Monday.
 
We will continue to support our workers and firms through this crisis. But we are not able to sustain the same level of support indefinitely. As more sectors re-open gradually, we will have to evolve and taper the support provided. We will continue to provide targeted support to sectors that are hardest hit, including helping them pivot to new opportunities in growth areas. 
 
We are committed to walk this difficult journey with you. Together, we can overcome this crisis and emerge stronger as one people.

⁣
Our discussion took place against the backdrop of our worst quarterly GDP performance on record. The economic situation is severe. The road to economic recovery will be long, and the impact on our labour market could further deepen. We discussed the effectiveness of the support measures rolled out in the last few months, which has helped companies keep workers employed.⁣
⁣
Some support schemes, such as the Jobs Support Scheme, are ending soon. Participants acknowledged that these schemes cannot continue indefinitely, but asked how support for our businesses and workers will change in the coming months. I assured them of our continued commitment to support our workers and companies. I have also been having intensive discussions with our agencies to review and evolve our schemes as the situation develops.⁣
⁣
Despite the challenges, it was uplifting to hear how some of them have coped with the crisis. Some are pivoting away from their current businesses to new areas that played to their core strengths. Many have accelerated their digitalisation plans and are offering more services online. Some are sourcing for opportunities abroad through online business engagements. In the process, they are also reskilling their workers and redesigning jobs to take on these new opportunities. There were also many ideas on how we can work better in tripartite partnership during this crisis, including helping our people build new skills and adapt to the post-COVID world.⁣
⁣
Overall, the gravity of our economic situation weighed heavily on the minds of our business and union leaders. But in the midst of this crisis, I am heartened that they saw opportunities and possibilities. The road ahead will be tough, but with determination and a spirit of enterprise and collaboration, we can come out of this crisis stronger.⁣

The road to economic recovery will be long, and the impact on our labour market could further deepen. We discussed the effectiveness of the support measures rolled out in the last few months, which has helped companies keep workers employed.⁣
⁣
Some support schemes, such as the Jobs Support Scheme, are ending soon. Participants acknowledged that these schemes cannot continue indefinitely, but asked how support for our businesses and workers will change in the coming months. I assured them of our continued commitment to support our workers and companies. I have also been having intensive discussions with our agencies to review and evolve our schemes as the situation develops.⁣
⁣
Despite the challenges, it was uplifting to hear how some of them have coped with the crisis. Some are pivoting away from their current businesses to new areas that played to their core strengths. Many have accelerated their digitalisation plans and are offering more services online. Some are sourcing for opportunities abroad through online business engagements. In the process, they are also reskilling their workers and redesigning jobs to take on these new opportunities. There were also many ideas on how we can work better in tripartite partnership during this crisis, including helping our people build new skills and adapt to the post-COVID world.⁣
⁣
Overall, the gravity of our economic situation weighed heavily on the minds of our business and union leaders. But in the midst of this crisis, I am heartened that they saw opportunities and possibilities. The road ahead will be tough, but with determination and a spirit of enterprise and collaboration, we can come out of this crisis stronger.⁣

We spoke to jobseekers and career ambassadors from @workforcesingapore to better understand their needs and challenges. This is one of eight such Centres across the island, with new locations coming up soon.

The latest employment numbers show that the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market has deepened, but we have avoided a spike in unemployment because of the support measures provided over the four Budgets.

The National Jobs Council has been working closely with industry partners and @ntucsingapore to create jobs, traineeships and skills training opportunities for our people under the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. We have made good progress. So far, 18,000 job placements have been completed through the SGUnited Jobs Initiative. Another 65,000 jobs, traineeship and training places have also been committed.

In particular, we have received overwhelming support from our companies for SGUnited Traineeships. 6,400 companies have expressed interest to host over 35,000 traineeships. This is more than what we have expected, and we will be opening up the traineeships to mid-career individuals. This will provide more options for our jobseekers and companies, and improve their chances of finding good job matches when the eventual upswing happens.

I urge companies who are doing well to make full use of the tools under the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), to grow and to hire more workers. And I encourage jobseekers to keep an open mind and embrace the spirit of learning.

By working together, we can emerge stronger as an economy and as one people.

The latest employment numbers show that the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market has deepened, but we have avoided a spike in unemployment because of the support measures provided over the four Budgets.

The National Jobs Council has been working closely with industry partners and @ntucsingapore to create jobs, traineeships and skills training opportunities for our people under the #SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. We have made good progress. So far, 18,000 job placements have been completed through the SGUnited Jobs Initiative. Another 65,000 jobs, traineeship and training places have also been committed.

In particular, we have received overwhelming support from our companies for SGUnited Traineeships. 6,400 companies have expressed interest to host over 35,000 traineeships. This is more than what we have expected, and we will be opening up the traineeships to mid-career individuals. This will provide more options for our jobseekers and companies, and improve their chances of finding good job matches when the eventual upswing happens.

I urge companies who are doing well to make full use of the tools under the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), to grow and to hire more workers. And I encourage jobseekers to keep an open mind and embrace the spirit of learning.

By working together, we can emerge stronger as an economy and as one people.

⁣
Together with PM @leehsienloong and our Cabinet colleagues, we undertook our Oath and Affirmation of Allegiance as well as pledged our unwavering commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans. Some appointees have taken on higher appointments. Some were first time office holders.⁣
⁣
We are humbled that Singaporeans have entrusted us with the responsibility of forming the government. Due to the pandemic, this is the first time in history that the Swearing-in Ceremony was held at two different locations — Istana and Parliament House.⁣
⁣
The work of our new Cabinet has already begun. The road ahead is difficult. We are battling the crisis on multiple fronts. We are not only facing a public health crisis, but also a severe global economic recession. Already, we have committed close to $100 billion in this fight, with more than half the amount funded from past reserves with the support of President @halimahyacob.⁣
⁣
My focus as Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies and Finance Minister will be to protect our workers and to create new opportunities for jobseekers. To achieve this, we will also need to help our companies transform, evolve their business models, and innovate.⁣
⁣
Beyond economic recovery, we are committed to work in close partnership with our people and our companies to build a better and brighter future for everyone. I look forward to growing the Singapore Together movement and the Emerging Stronger Conversations.⁣
⁣
Now that the General Election is over, let us unite and work together to overcome this crisis. We can and we will emerge stronger.⁣

⁣
Together with PM @leehsienloong and our Cabinet colleagues, we undertook our Oath and Affirmation of Allegiance as well as pledged our unwavering commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans. Some appointees have taken on higher appointments. Some were first time office holders.⁣
⁣
We are humbled that Singaporeans have entrusted us with the responsibility of forming the government. Due to the pandemic, this is the first time in history that the Swearing-in Ceremony was held at two different locations — Istana and Parliament House.⁣
⁣
The work of our new Cabinet has already begun. The road ahead is difficult. We are battling the crisis on multiple fronts. We are not only facing a public health crisis, but also a severe global economic recession. Already, we have committed close to $100 billion in this fight, with more than half the amount funded from past reserves with the support of President @halimahyacob.⁣
⁣
My focus as Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies and Finance Minister will be to protect our workers and to create new opportunities for jobseekers. To achieve this, we will also need to help our companies transform, evolve their business models, and innovate.⁣
⁣
Beyond economic recovery, we are committed to work in close partnership with our people and our companies to build a better and brighter future for everyone. I look forward to growing the Singapore Together movement and the Emerging Stronger Conversations.⁣
⁣
Now that the General Election is over, let us unite and work together to overcome this crisis. We can and we will emerge stronger.⁣

Together with PM @leehsienloong and our Cabinet colleagues, we undertook our Oath and Affirmation of Allegiance as well as pledged our unwavering commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans. Some appointees have taken on higher appointments. Some were first time office holders.⁣
⁣
We are humbled that Singaporeans have entrusted us with the responsibility of forming the government. Due to the pandemic, this is the first time in history that the Swearing-in Ceremony was held at two different locations — Istana and Parliament House.⁣
⁣
The work of our new Cabinet has already begun. The road ahead is difficult. We are battling the crisis on multiple fronts. We are not only facing a public health crisis, but also a severe global economic recession. Already, we have committed close to $100 billion in this fight, with more than half the amount funded from past reserves with the support of President @halimahyacob.⁣
⁣
My focus as Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies and Finance Minister will be to protect our workers and to create new opportunities for jobseekers. To achieve this, we will also need to help our companies transform, evolve their business models, and innovate.⁣
⁣
Beyond economic recovery, we are committed to work in close partnership with our people and our companies to build a better and brighter future for everyone. I look forward to growing the Singapore Together movement and the Emerging Stronger Conversations.⁣

Now that the General Election is over, let us unite and work together to overcome this crisis. We can and we will emerge stronger.⁣

Together with PM @leehsienloong and our Cabinet colleagues, we undertook our Oath and Affirmation of Allegiance as well as pledged our unwavering commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans. Some appointees have taken on higher appointments. Some were first time office holders.⁣
⁣
We are humbled that Singaporeans have entrusted us with the responsibility of forming the government. Due to the pandemic, this is the first time in history that the Swearing-in Ceremony was held at two different locations — Istana and Parliament House.⁣
⁣
The work of our new Cabinet has already begun. The road ahead is difficult. We are battling the crisis on multiple fronts. We are not only facing a public health crisis, but also a severe global economic recession. Already, we have committed close to $100 billion in this fight, with more than half the amount funded from past reserves with the support of President @halimahyacob.⁣
⁣
My focus as Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies and Finance Minister will be to protect our workers and to create new opportunities for jobseekers. To achieve this, we will also need to help our companies transform, evolve their business models, and innovate.⁣
⁣
Beyond economic recovery, we are committed to work in close partnership with our people and our companies to build a better and brighter future for everyone. I look forward to growing the Singapore Together movement and the Emerging Stronger Conversations.⁣
⁣
Now that the General Election is over, let us unite and work together to overcome this crisis. We can and we will emerge stronger.⁣

As part of the Resilience Budget, I announced the Workfare Special Payment totalling $1.2 billion to help our lower-income workers. Around 400,000 lower-income Singaporean workers on Workfare will each receive $3,000 in cash to further help them with their expenses. They will receive half the payout in July, and the second half in October.

Workfare provides a wage supplement to our lower-income workers — a top-up of up to 30% of their salaries. Through a combination of cash and CPF top-ups, we help these workers with their immediate needs and also with their retirement adequacy.

An integral part of Workfare is the additional support for training. Taken together with @skillsfuturesg and the Progressive Wage Model, we have a strong ecosystem of support to uplift our lower-wage workers in a sustainable way.

At a time when many workers around the world are experiencing wage stagnation, our lower-wage workers have experienced strong real wage growth — averaging more than 4% per year in the last five years, faster than the growth in median wages. We can and we will continue to invest in and support our lower-wage workers, so that they can continue to learn and grow. 

Our commitment to Singaporeans is that even as we create new opportunities, we will ensure no one will be left behind by progress. We will enable every worker to make a better living, as long as they are willing to work hard.

May you all at home stay healthy and safe 🙏🙏🙏.",2020-07-24T15:31:00.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CDAd4b2nB2j/,2020-07-24T02:00:46.000Z,"During this period of economic uncertainty, many of our workers are going through a tough time. Our lower-income workers in particular, have less to fall back on.

As part of the Resilience Budget, I announced the Workfare Special Payment totalling $1.2 billion to help our lower-income workers. Around 400,000 lower-income Singaporean workers on Workfare will each receive $3,000 in cash to further help them with their expenses. They will receive half the payout in July, and the second half in October.

Workfare provides a wage supplement to our lower-income workers — a top-up of up to 30% of their salaries. Through a combination of cash and CPF top-ups, we help these workers with their immediate needs and also with their retirement adequacy.

An integral part of Workfare is the additional support for training. Taken together with @skillsfuturesg and the Progressive Wage Model, we have a strong ecosystem of support to uplift our lower-wage workers in a sustainable way.

At a time when many workers around the world are experiencing wage stagnation, our lower-wage workers have experienced strong real wage growth — averaging more than 4% per year in the last five years, faster than the growth in median wages. We can and we will continue to invest in and support our lower-wage workers, so that they can continue to learn and grow. 

Our commitment to Singaporeans is that even as we create new opportunities, we will ensure no one will be left behind by progress. We will enable every worker to make a better living, as long as they are willing to work hard.

26,mol5211,Thank you sir👍👍👍,2020-07-24T02:44:33.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CDAd4b2nB2j/,2020-07-24T02:00:46.000Z,"During this period of economic uncertainty, many of our workers are going through a tough time. Our lower-income workers in particular, have less to fall back on.

As part of the Resilience Budget, I announced the Workfare Special Payment totalling $1.2 billion to help our lower-income workers. Around 400,000 lower-income Singaporean workers on Workfare will each receive $3,000 in cash to further help them with their expenses. They will receive half the payout in July, and the second half in October.

Workfare provides a wage supplement to our lower-income workers — a top-up of up to 30% of their salaries. Through a combination of cash and CPF top-ups, we help these workers with their immediate needs and also with their retirement adequacy.

An integral part of Workfare is the additional support for training. Taken together with @skillsfuturesg and the Progressive Wage Model, we have a strong ecosystem of support to uplift our lower-wage workers in a sustainable way.

At a time when many workers around the world are experiencing wage stagnation, our lower-wage workers have experienced strong real wage growth — averaging more than 4% per year in the last five years, faster than the growth in median wages. We can and we will continue to invest in and support our lower-wage workers, so that they can continue to learn and grow. 

Our commitment to Singaporeans is that even as we create new opportunities, we will ensure no one will be left behind by progress. We will enable every worker to make a better living, as long as they are willing to work hard.

This is especially true in times of crisis, and if we are to emerge stronger as an economy in a post-COVID world. Success will require stronger partnerships across all stakeholders and across our entire economy.

To spur greater collaboration in critical areas for our businesses, we will be launching a series of seven National Innovation Challenges today on our Open Innovation Network. These challenges range from how we can strengthen productivity of our air and shipping sectors, to how we can safely re-open our construction, tourism and MICE activities. You can find out more here: www.openinnovationnetwork.sg/national-innovation-challenges.

Through these efforts, we also hope to build a stronger culture of innovation here in Singapore — among individuals, companies, trade associations, research and academic institutions, and the Government. In an increasingly complex and uncertain world, our ability to work together and innovate will give us an edge in seeking opportunities at home and abroad. Our strengths at home will enable us to contribute to the global community.

Through these efforts, we also hope to build a stronger culture of innovation here in Singapore — among individuals, companies, trade associations, research and academic institutions, and the Government. In an increasingly complex and uncertain world, our ability to work together and innovate will give us an edge in seeking opportunities at home and abroad. Our strengths at home will enable us to contribute to the global community.

By working as #SingaporeTogether, we can emerge stronger from this crisis. Not just as an economy, but also as a society and one people.

The path to recovery will be long and uncertain, especially with the fragile state of the global economy. But as long as countries remain committed to work together, we can overcome this crisis. I also called on G20 members to keep our economies open, connected and sustainable, so that we can all emerge stronger. 
 
In this crisis, we must tackle the risks to lives, to our economies and to financial stability. But the crisis also offers opportunity for all countries to strengthen our partnership within the G20 and with the various international financial institutions. Let us work together to rebuild a better future for our peoples.

I have also been very touched by the care and concern residents have shown towards me, often reminding me to take good care of my health and to get ample rest.

I have also been very touched by the care and concern residents have shown towards me, often reminding me to take good care of my health and to get ample rest. I have been taking my health very seriously after recovering from a stroke, and I make an effort to exercise daily and opt for healthier food choices. Yesterday, to my surprise, I received an appreciation card from a stallholder with a thoughtful message — thank you for the sweet gesture, and for the care and enthusiasm. It spurs me on to want to do better and even more for East Coast residents, and for Singaporeans.

We hope our seniors can embrace and adopt technology effectively.

One such example is the Mobile Access for Seniors scheme. Eligible lower-income seniors can purchase a basic smartphone from $20 and subsidised mobile plan.

很高兴受邀参加昨晚的凤山活跃乐龄歌台直播秀。这是我第一次参加网络歌台节目。
 
这个节目主要是让凤山的年长者观赏娱乐表演。因为受到疫情影响，凤山活跃乐龄组的义工们把节目搬上网，让年长者不用出门，也可以在家里享受娱乐。这就是社交媒体和新科技能带给我们的好处。
 
冠状病毒疫情对我们的生活造成了巨大的影响。为了适应新常态，我们需要调整生活。数码 科技让我们可以不出门，依然过着活跃的生活。多年来，政府也通过一系列措施，与社区和 企业携手合作，不遗余力推动数码化进程。最近，政府和电信业者合作，推出津贴计划，为低收入年长者提供负担得起的智能手机和配套。只要符合条件，年长者就可以用 20 块钱购买一台基本款的智能手机，方便他们随时用手机上网。
 
所以，我希望大家，尤其是年长者，继续积极学习和使用数码科技，享受网络所带来的便利，从中受惠。"

冠状病毒疫情对我们的生活造成了巨大的影响。为了适应新常态，我们需要调整生活。数码 科技让我们可以不出门，依然过着活跃的生活。多年来，政府也通过一系列措施，与社区和 企业携手合作，不遗余力推动数码化进程。最近，政府和电信业者合作，推出津贴计划，为低收入年长者提供负担得起的智能手机和配套。只要符合条件，年长者就可以用 20 块钱购买一台基本款的智能手机，方便他们随时用手机上网。
 
所以，我希望大家，尤其是年长者，继续积极学习和使用数码科技，享受网络所带来的便利，从中受惠。"

⁣
This AGM is held under extraordinary circumstances. Our lives, our jobs and our future are at stake. There is profound uncertainty ahead. The fortunes of workers and businesses are closely intertwined. Stabilising our economy and preserving jobs will be very challenging, but rebuilding from a crisis has and will always be a tripartite effort. This is the Singapore Together way. As the apex business chamber, SBF has a critical role to play in galvanizing our companies to work together, upskill their workers and capture new opportunities in a post-COVID world.⁣
⁣
This AGM is also special, as Mr Teo Siong Seng passes the SBF chairmanship to Mr Lim Ming Yan, after six years at the helm. On behalf of the Government, and on behalf of all our tripartite partners, a big thank you to Siong Seng for being a proponent of transformation, a champion of internationalisation, and an advocate of sustainable businesses. Ming Yan has big shoes to fill, especially so in a time of crisis. But I am confident that he will rise to the occasion, and I look forward to working more closely with you and the SBF.⁣

⁣
Everywhere I went, I could feel the spirit of resilience. Businesses are getting active again. Residents told me which Budget measures have been most helpful. But I also got feedback from those who are struggling, and we will see how we can help them. I was assured to hear residents tell me how their MPs have reached out to them, and how local schemes have benefitted them. I can see that our PAP candidates are working for their residents. I am confident that they will keep their residents’ well-being central to all they do.⁣
⁣
The work to help our people and businesses through uncertain times does not stop. We will continue to listen to you and to work with you, to better your lives — our lives, jobs and future are on the line.⁣
⁣
Among my visits, I also swung by Tampines Round Market with @desmond.choo. Happy to learn that the CDC vouchers are serving our residents well, and that our stallholders are going digital. Good work!⁣

Also glad that Tan See Leng, @fahmialimansg and Raymond Lye could join us to learn how residents are coping.⁣ During my visits, I saw how the many developments are serving our residents well, and how our people are supporting one another. I have also discovered many great hawker stalls — and met Singaporeans — who came from all parts of the island to enjoy their favorite food. Singaporeans are truly foodies!⁣

⁣
Everywhere I went, I could feel the spirit of resilience. Businesses are getting active again. Residents told me which Budget measures have been most helpful. But I also got feedback from those who are struggling, and we will see how we can help them. I was assured to hear residents tell me how their MPs have reached out to them, and how local schemes have benefitted them. I can see that our PAP candidates are working for their residents. I am confident that they will keep their residents’ well-being central to all they do.⁣

The work to help our people and businesses through uncertain times does not stop. We will continue to listen to you and to work with you, to better your lives — our lives, jobs and future are on the line.⁣

The work to help our people and businesses through uncertain times does not stop. We will continue to listen to you and to work with you, to better your lives — our lives, jobs and future are on the line.⁣

Among my visits, I also swung by Tampines Round Market with @desmond.choo. Happy to learn that the CDC vouchers are serving our residents well, and that our stallholders are going digital. Good work!⁣
⁣
I thank the many volunteers who have been supporting my team when I walked around with @s.iswaran and Foo Mee Har at Teban Gardens Market and Food Centre; @lawrencewongst and @zaqym around Causeway Point; @chuanjin1, @seahkianpeng, and @edwintong at Eunos; and @ng.chee.meng, @amrinamin and @vpmlam at Sengkang.⁣
⁣
Also glad that Tan See Leng, @fahmialimansg and Raymond Lye could join us to learn how residents are coping.⁣ During my visits, I saw how the many developments are serving our residents well, and how our people are supporting one another. I have also discovered many great hawker stalls — and met Singaporeans — who came from all parts of the island to enjoy their favorite food. Singaporeans are truly foodies!⁣

As we resume activities, please continue to stay vigilant and observe the necessary safeguards during this time! Let us support one another to stay safe and healthy, and to emerge stronger from this crisis."

The Cabinet met on Wednesday. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce convened on Thursday. Today, we had the second meeting of the National Jobs Council, chaired by SM Tharman.

Jobs are our most urgent task. The National Jobs Council has the heavy responsibility of creating as many new jobs and training opportunities as possible. We have made good progress since the first meeting three weeks ago. This afternoon, we went into specific areas on where we could create more job opportunities, such as the tech sector. I thank members of the Council, many from the private sector, and from @ntucsingapore, for their valuable inputs. Together, we can come up with specific measures and mechanisms, to better match job seekers to the jobs available, and to create new jobs and training opportunities.

I visited our @ourtampineshub and Tampines West Neighbourhood Centre on Thursday, to see how our businesses and residents are doing now that we are into Phase 2 of re-opening. The Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers Scheme took effect yesterday — up to 400,000 eligible Singaporean households can collect $50 worth of vouchers to spend at participating local businesses, including hawker stalls and neighbourhood shops.⁣
⁣
The town and community are coming back to life, people are observing the safe management measures, but no mask can hide their good cheer and strong spirit.⁣

I heard stories of people adapting, learning new skills, and making the best of a difficult situation. This is our spirit of fortitude and resilience.⁣

⁣
In the 6th and final national broadcast, I spoke about how we shall not only overcome this crisis, we will emerge from it stronger — as an economy, as a society and as a people.⁣
⁣
We have committed almost $100 billion to protect jobs, keep viable businesses afloat, and support households. We are making a big push to create 100,000 job and training opportunities for those seeking employment. Had we not done so, we would have lost years of progress and an entire generation.⁣
⁣
While all countries are providing a cushion to their people, we are going further by investing to give everyone a springboard to bounce back from this even stronger.⁣
⁣
We have outlined our plans to do so — to grow our economy, create better jobs, strengthen our social compact, and safeguard everything we hold dear.⁣
⁣
To emerge stronger, we must draw on the wits and will of our people. When we launched the #SingaporeTogether movement a year ago, I promised that we would partner with Singaporeans to shape our future together. Now, in this crisis, partnership is more critical than ever.⁣
⁣
We will face the challenges ahead together with you, all the way. We will fight COVID-19 as Singapore Together.⁣

7,meiping_lim,Thank You for your hard work Minister Heng😍😍😊😊👍,2020-06-20T12:53:46.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CBp8J7WHgR_/,2020-06-20T11:31:22.000Z,"COVID-19 has put our way of life, our livelihoods and our future at stake. We face profound uncertainty ahead. This is a crisis of a generation.⁣
⁣
In the 6th and final national broadcast, I spoke about how we shall not only overcome this crisis, we will emerge from it stronger — as an economy, as a society and as a people.⁣
⁣
We have committed almost $100 billion to protect jobs, keep viable businesses afloat, and support households. We are making a big push to create 100,000 job and training opportunities for those seeking employment. Had we not done so, we would have lost years of progress and an entire generation.⁣
⁣
While all countries are providing a cushion to their people, we are going further by investing to give everyone a springboard to bounce back from this even stronger.⁣
⁣
We have outlined our plans to do so — to grow our economy, create better jobs, strengthen our social compact, and safeguard everything we hold dear.⁣
⁣
To emerge stronger, we must draw on the wits and will of our people. When we launched the #SingaporeTogether movement a year ago, I promised that we would partner with Singaporeans to shape our future together. Now, in this crisis, partnership is more critical than ever.⁣
⁣
We will face the challenges ahead together with you, all the way. We will fight COVID-19 as Singapore Together.⁣
⁣
We will overcome this crisis of our generation. We will be a generation that emerges stronger.⁣

Our Community Development Councils (CDCs) serve our people in different regions of Singapore. So I asked our five Mayors of the CDCs — @lowyenling.sg, @denisephua, @desmond.choo, @maliki_osman, @teo_ho_pin, if we could do more, given the uncertainty with COVID-19. They told me that over and above our national-level support schemes, the CDCs have been providing targeted support in the neighbourhoods. I agreed to support them in their outreach.

Today, I joined the five Mayors and the President of the Federation of Merchants’ Association, Yeo Hiang Meng, for the virtual launch of the CDC Vouchers Scheme. The CDCs have now set aside $20 million to provide vouchers for up to 400,000 eligible Singaporean households. They also want to support the many small businesses in our neighbourhoods, which have been hard hit by COVID-19. I am glad that during the circuit breaker period, the CDCs have reached out to our hawkers and neighbourhood shops through various digital means, to sign up 2,500 participating merchants. I hope more will come on board.

This strong collaboration approach to supporting families in need — with the Government, the grassroots and community each doing their part — is one way to help us see through the storm. I thank Hiang Meng, our Mayors, and volunteers for their hard work. I also thank our merchants and hawkers for signing on.

This scheme is a ‘two-in-one’ — we hope to help families cope with the cost of living, and help our hawkers and merchants during this difficult period. Let us continue to be creative to find good ways to support one another. This is the #SingaporeTogether spirit to build a more caring society and to emerge stronger.

So I asked our five Mayors of the CDCs — @lowyenling.sg, @denisephua, @desmond.choo, @maliki_osman, @teo_ho_pin, if we could do more, given the uncertainty with COVID-19. They told me that over and above our national-level support schemes, the CDCs have been providing targeted support in the neighbourhoods. I agreed to support them in their outreach.

Today, I joined the five Mayors and the President of the Federation of Merchants’ Association, Yeo Hiang Meng, for the virtual launch of the CDC Vouchers Scheme. The CDCs have now set aside $20 million to provide vouchers for up to 400,000 eligible Singaporean households. They also want to support the many small businesses in our neighbourhoods, which have been hard hit by COVID-19. I am glad that during the circuit breaker period, the CDCs have reached out to our hawkers and neighbourhood shops through various digital means, to sign up 2,500 participating merchants. I hope more will come on board.

This strong collaboration approach to supporting families in need — with the Government, the grassroots and community each doing their part — is one way to help us see through the storm. I thank Hiang Meng, our Mayors, and volunteers for their hard work. I also thank our merchants and hawkers for signing on.

This scheme is a ‘two-in-one’ — we hope to help families cope with the cost of living, and help our hawkers and merchants during this difficult period. Let us continue to be creative to find good ways to support one another. This is the #SingaporeTogether spirit to build a more caring society and to emerge stronger.

The road ahead will be difficult and fraught with uncertainty, but I am glad that our youths have remained resilient in the face of adversity. The pandemic might have set back their plans temporarily, but the virus will not stop them from fulfilling their potential.⠀
⠀
What will set our youths for success is the willingness to take the initiative and make the most of what they have. By turning anxiety into action, they can build a better tomorrow. This was my main message to our youths when I addressed them at the @young.ntuc’s LIT DISCOvery symposium this evening.⠀
⠀
Here in Singapore, we are determined that there will be no “lost generation” arising from COVID-19. The Labour Movement, our companies and the Government will walk this journey with our youths. I am confident our youths can rise to the occasion, and emerge stronger as a generation.⠀

This global crisis is manifesting on many fronts — healthcare, economy, society — at a time when the global leadership is divided.⁣
⁣
The next five to ten years will be crucial, as we navigate the many uncertainties ahead. It is hard to predict when the next pandemic wave will hit, and how new shockwaves will travel through economies and financial systems.⁣

How we respond in the next five to ten years will determine the fate of our generations and of the generations to come. This was what I shared with @straits_times’s Vikram Khanna when he interviewed me on Monday.⁣
⁣
The path before us will be difficult. Companies will need to adapt their business models and transform their operations. Workers will need to learn new skills in the new normal. Even with our best efforts, some companies will fold and jobs will be lost. So the stakes before us are high.⁣

⁣
We too have mounted a strong response. Our swift and decisive action, backed by our strong financial position and deep social capital, have enabled us to avoid some of the harsher outcomes of COVID-19.⁣
⁣
Today, we concluded the debate on the Fortitude Budget. Over four Budgets, we are committing almost $100 billion, or close to 20% of our GDP, to protect lives and livelihoods as part of our COVID-19 response. Including our usual spending, the total size of our four Budgets stands at $193 billion — more than double the size of our annual Budgets in previous years.⁣
⁣
Never before in Singapore’s history have we set out to preserve so many jobs, and create so many new opportunities to keep people employed, sustain viable businesses, and invest in skills training.⁣
⁣
As one people, we faced adversity with courage. The crisis has brought out the best in our community, as we continue to support and care for those who have less, and those who have fallen on hard times. In the spirit of #SingaporeTogether, we have seen all parts of society work together and support one another.⁣
⁣
This is not the first crisis that Singapore has faced. Nor will it be the last. But we have the benefit of fighting this crisis from a position of strength, thanks to the generations that came before us.⁣

Including our usual spending, the total size of our four Budgets stands at $193 billion — more than double the size of our annual Budgets in previous years.⁣
⁣
Never before in Singapore’s history have we set out to preserve so many jobs, and create so many new opportunities to keep people employed, sustain viable businesses, and invest in skills training.⁣
⁣
As one people, we faced adversity with courage. The crisis has brought out the best in our community, as we continue to support and care for those who have less, and those who have fallen on hard times. In the spirit of #SingaporeTogether, we have seen all parts of society work together and support one another.⁣
⁣
This is not the first crisis that Singapore has faced. Nor will it be the last. But we have the benefit of fighting this crisis from a position of strength, thanks to the generations that came before us.⁣
⁣
We will overcome this crisis with fortitude and solidarity.⁣
⁣
We will emerge stronger, as an economy, as a society, and as one united, resilient and determined people.⁣

I announced the Care and Support Package earlier in the Unity and Resilience Budgets. In April and May, we disbursed the Solidarity Payment and the first tranches of the GST Voucher - U-Save Special Payment and the Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) Rebate.

We will be paying out the remaining Care and Support - Cash from 18 June. Eligible Singaporeans can receive up to an additional $1,000. You can refer to the @mof_sg press release for more details at go.gov.sg/careandsupport-cash. Including the $1.6 billion to be paid out in June, we would have disbursed a total of $3.5 billion to households.

I hope this will alleviate the expenditure concerns of our families. Some of you have donated your Solidarity Payment. You can consider doing likewise for this cash payout to a good cause at www.giving.sg.

Later today, I will be heading to Parliament for the debate on the Fortitude Budget.  This Budget supports you as we gradually re-open our economy, braces us for the difficult months ahead, and prepares us to emerge stronger. I look forward to hearing from all my colleagues.

⁣
This Council is a tripartite partnership, formed to oversee the creation of job opportunities and skills training for our people during this crisis, as many livelihoods are at stake. I announced at the Fortitude Budget that I have appointed SM Tharman to chair the Council. He agreed readily, and invited me to be an advisor. I joined the Council for the first meeting.⁣
⁣

Many have donated generously, including Ms Anita Fam and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who each contributed $1 million to the Fund. Sian Chay Medical Institution, a charity that provides TCM treatment for the needy, also donated $1 million. These generous contributions will go a long way in serving our vulnerable. The Government will be providing an $18 million top-up to the Invictus Fund.

During the pandemic, many Social Service Agencies are facing a fall in donations. As part of the Fortitude Budget, the Government is also partnering the @toteboardsg to enhance the matching for donations through their Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme.

In addition, NCSS has established the Beyond COVID-19 Taskforce to help the sector take this opportunity to transform. I am glad that many Social Service Agencies are accelerating the adoption of technology to serve their clients better.

I encourage those who are coping well to come forward and support our Social Service Agencies and do your part to help the vulnerable among us. There are many ways you can give back to the society — by donating to the Fund (www.comchest.sg/TheInvictusFund) or other worthy causes at @giving.sg.

⁣
I drove to work today, to prepare for the debate on the Fortitude Budget. I took the same route. Traffic was still light. But there were more vehicles and people on the road, perhaps in preparation for the re-opening tomorrow.⁣

The main difference between now and eight weeks ago, is that we have largely brought the spread of the virus under control. But the economic situation, in Singapore and around the world, has worsened, with a deeper recession forecasted.⁣
⁣
Many of us have adapted to the circuit breaker. Working from home and video conferencing have become the norm. Walking around our neighbourhoods has replaced walks in our parks.⁣
⁣
But I am glad to see how Singaporeans have been very responsible, making the efforts to adapt. Let’s turn this into a strength. Our ability to adapt, and to do so quickly, will be crucial not only in the next phase of this fight against COVID-19, but also on other fronts, including the economic front.⁣
⁣
Including the Fortitude Budget, we are committing almost $100 billion to support our businesses, households and frontline in this fight. We are also topping up the Contingencies Funds to $16 billion, which will provide us with additional ammunition to respond quickly.⁣

We are looking forward to life after circuit breaker. But this battle is far from over. We must remain vigilant, and look out for those around us. We must continue to adapt to the crisis and stay ahead of the curve, so that we can come out of this stronger.⁣

Including the Fortitude Budget, we are committing almost $100 billion to support our businesses, households and frontline in this fight. We are also topping up the Contingencies Funds to $16 billion, which will provide us with additional ammunition to respond quickly.⁣

We are looking forward to life after circuit breaker. But this battle is far from over. We must remain vigilant, and look out for those around us. We must continue to adapt to the crisis and stay ahead of the curve, so that we can come out of this stronger.⁣

⁣
I still remember vividly the first day of the circuit breaker, when I drove to Parliament to wrap up the debate on Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Back then, traffic was light with few pedestrians.⁣
⁣
I drove to work today, to prepare for the debate on the Fortitude Budget. I took the same route. Traffic was still light. But there were more vehicles and people on the road, perhaps in preparation for the re-opening tomorrow.⁣
⁣
The main difference between now and eight weeks ago, is that we have largely brought the spread of the virus under control. But the economic situation, in Singapore and around the world, has worsened, with a deeper recession forecasted.⁣
⁣
Many of us have adapted to the circuit breaker. Working from home and video conferencing have become the norm. Walking around our neighbourhoods has replaced walks in our parks.⁣

But I am glad to see how Singaporeans have been very responsible, making the efforts to adapt. Let’s turn this into a strength.

21,ajefucecilia,Thanks ma'am Clara Antoine @official_clarafx,2020-06-03T09:38:23.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CA5E0OtpwEt/,2020-06-01T12:04:16.000Z,"Today marks the last day of the circuit breaker.⁣
⁣
I still remember vividly the first day of the circuit breaker, when I drove to Parliament to wrap up the debate on Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Back then, traffic was light with few pedestrians.⁣
⁣
I drove to work today, to prepare for the debate on the Fortitude Budget. I took the same route. Traffic was still light. But there were more vehicles and people on the road, perhaps in preparation for the re-opening tomorrow.⁣
⁣
The main difference between now and eight weeks ago, is that we have largely brought the spread of the virus under control. But the economic situation, in Singapore and around the world, has worsened, with a deeper recession forecasted.⁣
⁣
Many of us have adapted to the circuit breaker. Working from home and video conferencing have become the norm. Walking around our neighbourhoods has replaced walks in our parks.⁣
⁣
But I am glad to see how Singaporeans have been very responsible, making the efforts to adapt. Let’s turn this into a strength. Our ability to adapt, and to do so quickly, will be crucial not only in the next phase of this fight against COVID-19, but also on other fronts, including the economic front.⁣
⁣
Including the Fortitude Budget, we are committing almost $100 billion to support our businesses, households and frontline in this fight. We are also topping up the Contingencies Funds to $16 billion, which will provide us with additional ammunition to respond quickly.⁣
⁣
We are looking forward to life after circuit breaker. But this battle is far from over. We must remain vigilant, and look out for those around us. We must continue to adapt to the crisis and stay ahead of the curve, so that we can come out of this stronger.⁣

I drove to work today, to prepare for the debate on the Fortitude Budget. I took the same route. Traffic was still light. But there were more vehicles and people on the road, perhaps in preparation for the re-opening tomorrow.⁣
⁣
The main difference between now and eight weeks ago, is that we have largely brought the spread of the virus under control. But the economic situation, in Singapore and around the world, has worsened, with a deeper recession forecasted.⁣
⁣
Many of us have adapted to the circuit breaker. Working from home and video conferencing have become the norm. Walking around our neighbourhoods has replaced walks in our parks.⁣
⁣
But I am glad to see how Singaporeans have been very responsible, making the efforts to adapt. Let’s turn this into a strength. Our ability to adapt, and to do so quickly, will be crucial not only in the next phase of this fight against COVID-19, but also on other fronts, including the economic front.⁣
⁣
Including the Fortitude Budget, we are committing almost $100 billion to support our businesses, households and frontline in this fight. We are also topping up the Contingencies Funds to $16 billion, which will provide us with additional ammunition to respond quickly.⁣
⁣
We are looking forward to life after circuit breaker. But this battle is far from over. We must remain vigilant, and look out for those around us. We must continue to adapt to the crisis and stay ahead of the curve, so that we can come out of this stronger.⁣

The main difference between now and eight weeks ago, is that we have largely brought the spread of the virus under control. But the economic situation, in Singapore and around the world, has worsened, with a deeper recession forecasted.⁣
⁣
Many of us have adapted to the circuit breaker. Working from home and video conferencing have become the norm. Walking around our neighbourhoods has replaced walks in our parks.⁣
⁣
But I am glad to see how Singaporeans have been very responsible, making the efforts to adapt. Let’s turn this into a strength. Our ability to adapt, and to do so quickly, will be crucial not only in the next phase of this fight against COVID-19, but also on other fronts, including the economic front.⁣
⁣
Including the Fortitude Budget, we are committing almost $100 billion to support our businesses, households and frontline in this fight. We are also topping up the Contingencies Funds to $16 billion, which will provide us with additional ammunition to respond quickly.⁣
⁣
We are looking forward to life after circuit breaker. But this battle is far from over. We must remain vigilant, and look out for those around us. We must continue to adapt to the crisis and stay ahead of the curve, so that we can come out of this stronger.⁣

⁣
The start-up scene has also been hard hit by COVID-19. Many of our start-ups are not yet profitable. So during this period, many are watching their cash flow very carefully, especially with slower fundraising.⁣
⁣
Some start-ups have managed to adapt their business models to cater to new demands during this pandemic, such as converting their 3D printing capacity to manufacture swabs for diagnostic tests. But not all start-ups can readily do so. ⁣
⁣
This is why I announced the $285 million Special Situation Fund as part of the Fortitude Budget. This will ensure that start-ups with a good growth record can remain viable during this period, and be better positioned.⁣
⁣
Start-ups are synonymous with disruption. While many of our start-ups are used to creating disruption, I am glad that they are also resilient to the disruption caused by our invisible enemy. The start-up spirit is strong among this group of entrepreneurs.⁣

DPM Heng: Today’s support measures in the Fortitude Budget will commit $33 billion to support the next phase of our fight against COVID-19, and to position ourselves to emerge stronger.⁣

In the earlier Resilience and Solidarity Budgets, President @halimahyacob gave approval to draw up to $21 billion from our Past Reserves.⁣

For the Fortitude Budget, the President, in consultation with the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA), has given her in-principle support for a further draw of $31 billion to fund the measures in this Budget.

⁣
DPM Heng: Today, I introduce this $33 billion Supplementary Budget for the next phase of our fight against COVID-19.⁣
⁣
Jobs is the central focus of this Budget.⁣
⁣
We will continue to support workers and businesses who remain affected by border closures and safe distancing measures. We will help our businesses and workers adapt, transform and seize new opportunities, to emerge stronger.⁣
⁣
We will also provide additional support to our households and the community to cope with the disruptions, and resource our frontline agencies to continue this fight.⁣

⁣
In his first National Day Rally in 1966, our founding PM Mr Lee Kuan Yew said that our capacity to face up to situations, however unpleasant, was one of the great qualities for survival. He believed that we will progress as long as we reward initiative and resourcefulness. As long as whenever we face peril, our courage and resolve is never found wanting.⁣
⁣
Each generation has its own trials and tribulations. The COVID-19 pandemic is our biggest crisis since independence. The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting lives and livelihoods across the world and in Singapore. As we are re-opening our economy in phases, we will continue to support our viable businesses, especially those which are not able to open immediately.⁣
⁣
Jobs will be a key part of tomorrow’s Budget. The Jobs Support Scheme has helped many employers retain their workers. But a number have lost their jobs, and some are worried that they might be retrenched. We will support those in their jobs to learn and upskill. We will create new jobs for those seeking employment and create traineeships and other opportunities.⁣
⁣
We will also provide additional support for our social sector agencies, so that they can continue to help the vulnerable among us.⁣
⁣
These additional measures will require a further draw on our Past Reserves. I have briefed President @halimahyacob on our plans and she has given her in-principle support. I thank Madam President for her support. ⁣
⁣
The decision to use our Past Reserves has not been an easy one — we deliberated long and hard on this. Our past reserves were hard earned, and we have the responsibility of making every dollar count. I will outline the measures in Parliament tomorrow.⁣
⁣
The battle against COVID-19 will be a long one. Our generation must have courage in adversity, to adapt and to emerge stronger, just like our founding generation. This is why I have named the upcoming budget Fortitude.⁣
⁣
Moving forward with Fortitude — as we stay United as one people, remain Resilient in the face of adversity and stand in Solidarity with one another.

⁣
Ahead of my Budget statement in Parliament next Tuesday, I heard their views on how businesses across the various industries are coping with the pandemic, how effective our support provided over the last three Budgets had been, and what more we can do together.⁣
⁣
It was a candid session amongst members, including our tripartite partners. This is a difficult period for many businesses to tide over. The road ahead will be challenging and uncertain. How fast the global economy recovers depends on how well countries can contain the pandemic. There is still much uncertainty ahead, so we must be psychologically prepared.⁣
⁣
I am heartened that beyond suggestions on what more the Government can do, participants also discussed what companies have to do to adapt, and how we can strengthen tripartite collaboration across businesses, our labour movement and the Government.⁣
⁣
Many good ideas were raised. Some of these ideas will be built into our support measures. Others can be studied for the longer-term. I will be working on the ideas over this weekend as I finalise the upcoming Budget.⁣
⁣
Following the pre-Budget consultation, we had our first Future Economy Council (FEC) meeting of the year. The Emerging Stronger Taskforce gave an initial update to the FEC. I set up the Taskforce to study how the global economy will change after this massive disruption, and how Singapore businesses and workers can emerge stronger. Members gave suggestions on where else it could focus its efforts on, to enable our economy to stay resilient and to build new sources of dynamism.⁣
⁣
This has been a very fruitful morning. I learnt a lot. I thank members of the SBF Council and the FEC for your contributions. Beyond the ideas that emerged, I am greatly encouraged by their spirit of enterprise, determination and solidarity. The grit and resilience of our business leaders and workers will be critical in the months ahead, as we navigate turbulent waters ahead.⁣

Thank you sir.",2020-05-23T13:24:38.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAfaJQ-nKNz/,2020-05-22T12:50:23.000Z,"I had a very engaging virtual meeting with more than 60 members of the Future Economy Council (FEC) and Singapore Business Federation (SBF) Council today.⁣
⁣
Ahead of my Budget statement in Parliament next Tuesday, I heard their views on how businesses across the various industries are coping with the pandemic, how effective our support provided over the last three Budgets had been, and what more we can do together.⁣
⁣
It was a candid session amongst members, including our tripartite partners. This is a difficult period for many businesses to tide over. The road ahead will be challenging and uncertain. How fast the global economy recovers depends on how well countries can contain the pandemic. There is still much uncertainty ahead, so we must be psychologically prepared.⁣
⁣
I am heartened that beyond suggestions on what more the Government can do, participants also discussed what companies have to do to adapt, and how we can strengthen tripartite collaboration across businesses, our labour movement and the Government.⁣
⁣
Many good ideas were raised. Some of these ideas will be built into our support measures. Others can be studied for the longer-term. I will be working on the ideas over this weekend as I finalise the upcoming Budget.⁣
⁣
Following the pre-Budget consultation, we had our first Future Economy Council (FEC) meeting of the year. The Emerging Stronger Taskforce gave an initial update to the FEC. I set up the Taskforce to study how the global economy will change after this massive disruption, and how Singapore businesses and workers can emerge stronger. Members gave suggestions on where else it could focus its efforts on, to enable our economy to stay resilient and to build new sources of dynamism.⁣
⁣
This has been a very fruitful morning. I learnt a lot. I thank members of the SBF Council and the FEC for your contributions. Beyond the ideas that emerged, I am greatly encouraged by their spirit of enterprise, determination and solidarity. The grit and resilience of our business leaders and workers will be critical in the months ahead, as we navigate turbulent waters ahead.⁣

When the crisis started, we launched the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to provide wage support for our companies and help them retain local employees. Some companies have coped better than others. I am heartened that a number of them have come forward to return the first payment of JSS they received and to decline future payments. They include MNCs, financial institutions as well as other local enterprises across different sectors. I am very encouraged by their sense of responsibility and shared community. I hope their exemplary action will inspire other companies that are doing well to consider doing the same.

Besides returning the disbursement from the JSS, you may also consider contributing to charitable causes, such as the Invictus Fund (www.comchest.sg/TheInvictusFund) and other worthy causes at @giving.sg (www.giving.sg). Some companies and many individuals are doing so. I hope that you will also show recognition and appreciation for your workers who have stepped up during the circuit breaker period.

The devastating war led to sweeping political, social and economic changes. The effects of war had a lasting effect on those who came of age during those years. Many in that generation lost a sense of hope, purpose and direction. They were known as the “Lost Generation”.⠀
⠀
Two decades into the new century, COVID-19 looks set to define the 21st century. This crisis will likely change globalisation as we know it, further fray social compact in many societies, accelerate the pace of technological change, and even redefine social behaviour and travel patterns.⠀
⠀
But we are determined that there should be no lost generation in Singapore. We are doing our utmost to keep viable companies afloat and to preserve jobs. In a weak job market, we are creating traineeships and other learning opportunities for our students who are graduating.

We do not know what the 21st century will shape up to be post-COVID. But we are sailing into uncharted waters — surveying the new landscape, exploring new growth and opportunities, preparing to seize them when the storm passes.⠀
⠀
This is why I set up the Emerging Stronger Taskforce. We have two able co-chairs — @desmond.lee and Tan Chong Meng — leading this expedition. The Taskforce held its first meeting today. I thank Desmond and Chong Meng for leading this effort, and members of the Taskforce for their commitment to this cause. They will be inviting our people to share their views and co-creating ideas together. You can read more about their first meeting on go.gov.sg/est.

The Taskforce will present its recommendations to the Future Economy Council, which I chair, in phases. It is still early days. With conviction, determination and good planning, we seek to emerge stronger from this crisis, and create a better future for our people. In the process, we also hope to work with people globally to build a better world. ⠀

Our children will belong to a lost generation.,2020-05-06T13:19:13.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_2OfLXAa_j/,2020-05-06T12:59:39.000Z,"The First World War proved to be a turning point for the 20th century. The devastating war led to sweeping political, social and economic changes. The effects of war had a lasting effect on those who came of age during those years. Many in that generation lost a sense of hope, purpose and direction. They were known as the “Lost Generation”.⠀
⠀
Two decades into the new century, COVID-19 looks set to define the 21st century. This crisis will likely change globalisation as we know it, further fray social compact in many societies, accelerate the pace of technological change, and even redefine social behaviour and travel patterns.⠀
⠀
But we are determined that there should be no lost generation in Singapore. We are doing our utmost to keep viable companies afloat and to preserve jobs. In a weak job market, we are creating traineeships and other learning opportunities for our students who are graduating.

We do not know what the 21st century will shape up to be post-COVID. But we are sailing into uncharted waters — surveying the new landscape, exploring new growth and opportunities, preparing to seize them when the storm passes.⠀
⠀
This is why I set up the Emerging Stronger Taskforce. We have two able co-chairs — @desmond.lee and Tan Chong Meng — leading this expedition. The Taskforce held its first meeting today. I thank Desmond and Chong Meng for leading this effort, and members of the Taskforce for their commitment to this cause. They will be inviting our people to share their views and co-creating ideas together. You can read more about their first meeting on go.gov.sg/est.

The Taskforce will present its recommendations to the Future Economy Council, which I chair, in phases. It is still early days. With conviction, determination and good planning, we seek to emerge stronger from this crisis, and create a better future for our people. In the process, we also hope to work with people globally to build a better world. ⠀

This is why I set up the Emerging Stronger Taskforce. We have two able co-chairs — @desmond.lee and Tan Chong Meng — leading this expedition. The Taskforce held its first meeting today. I thank Desmond and Chong Meng for leading this effort, and members of the Taskforce for their commitment to this cause. They will be inviting our people to share their views and co-creating ideas together. You can read more about their first meeting on go.gov.sg/est.

The Taskforce will present its recommendations to the Future Economy Council, which I chair, in phases. It is still early days. With conviction, determination and good planning, we seek to emerge stronger from this crisis, and create a better future for our people. In the process, we also hope to work with people globally to build a better world. ⠀

The devastating war led to sweeping political, social and economic changes. The effects of war had a lasting effect on those who came of age during those years. Many in that generation lost a sense of hope, purpose and direction. They were known as the “Lost Generation”.⠀
⠀
Two decades into the new century, COVID-19 looks set to define the 21st century. This crisis will likely change globalisation as we know it, further fray social compact in many societies, accelerate the pace of technological change, and even redefine social behaviour and travel patterns.⠀
⠀
But we are determined that there should be no lost generation in Singapore. We are doing our utmost to keep viable companies afloat and to preserve jobs. In a weak job market, we are creating traineeships and other learning opportunities for our students who are graduating.

The 1960s was a turbulent period in our history, and for our workers. One pressing challenge then was to ensure that our workers could get a job, and to improve their lives. In those formative years, we forged our brand of tripartism — where workers and unions work with, rather than against, the Government and employers as co-drivers of our future. Over the years, tripartism thrived and with that, the lives of our workers improved year by year.

I have come to know our tripartite brothers and sisters well over the years — the passion and dedication of our union leaders, especially Sister Mary Liew and Brother @ng.chee.meng; and the commitment of our corporate leaders and employers. More recently, the Future Economy Council, which I chair, and the implementation of the Industry Transformation Maps, are important facets of tripartism at work.

Sixty years on, we are facing an unprecedented global pandemic and a looming global economic downturn, which is likely to be severe. The Government has committed a record $60 billion over three Budgets, to support our workers, businesses, and households.

These are challenging times for all of us. But the strength of our tripartite partnership will enable us to get through this rough storm, just as we had done before. The post COVID-19 world may be different, but as long as we stay strong and united, we can emerge stronger!

Each May Day, we commemorate the determination and solidarity of our workers. This year is especially important. I applaud all our workers — the dedication of our frontline teams, the tenacity of our migrant workers, and the resilience of those whose livelihoods have been affected. While we may not be able to save every job, we will take care of every worker. #everyworkermatters. This is our commitment to you. We are here with you, for you.

Stay Resilient and Resolute this May Day!

I'm wondering when you say that: ""While we may not be able to save every job, we will take care of every worker."", do you also mean workers who have been unable to secure a job in the year preceding the Covid-19 situation?",2020-05-01T01:56:46.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_mvF_NHJh-/,2020-04-30T12:36:44.000Z,"#MayDay started in Singapore as a public holiday sixty years ago to commemorate the strength and solidarity of our workers.

The 1960s was a turbulent period in our history, and for our workers. One pressing challenge then was to ensure that our workers could get a job, and to improve their lives. In those formative years, we forged our brand of tripartism — where workers and unions work with, rather than against, the Government and employers as co-drivers of our future. Over the years, tripartism thrived and with that, the lives of our workers improved year by year.

I have come to know our tripartite brothers and sisters well over the years — the passion and dedication of our union leaders, especially Sister Mary Liew and Brother @ng.chee.meng; and the commitment of our corporate leaders and employers. More recently, the Future Economy Council, which I chair, and the implementation of the Industry Transformation Maps, are important facets of tripartism at work.

Sixty years on, we are facing an unprecedented global pandemic and a looming global economic downturn, which is likely to be severe. The Government has committed a record $60 billion over three Budgets, to support our workers, businesses, and households.

These are challenging times for all of us. But the strength of our tripartite partnership will enable us to get through this rough storm, just as we had done before. The post COVID-19 world may be different, but as long as we stay strong and united, we can emerge stronger!

Each May Day, we commemorate the determination and solidarity of our workers. This year is especially important. I applaud all our workers — the dedication of our frontline teams, the tenacity of our migrant workers, and the resilience of those whose livelihoods have been affected. While we may not be able to save every job, we will take care of every worker. #everyworkermatters. This is our commitment to you. We are here with you, for you.

Stay Resilient and Resolute this May Day!

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the economy, both globally and in Singapore. Our companies are doing their utmost to keep their workers during this period, with the help of the Jobs Support Scheme. So it is no surprise that fewer of them are hiring. This was a similar situation in 2008-2009, during the Global Financial Crisis.

Singaporeans have had to adapt their livelihoods to the circumstances. I have come across many stories of this grit and resilience. Our graduates from ITE, polytechnics and universities this year will similarly have to adjust to the job market.

I announced the #SGUnited Traineeships Programme during the Resilience Budget to provide additional opportunities for our fresh graduates. This $100 million programme will provide traineeships of up to one year, with Government funding 80% of the training allowance.

More than 4,000 places are now on offer, from almost 300 companies. I am glad that our companies have stepped up where they can. I urge companies who are able to, to do more.

To those graduating this year, we will create as many opportunities for you as we can in this difficult time. We know this is not easy for you. Those who graduated during the Global Financial Crisis went on to pursue their passion and build their careers when the economy eventually recovered. Like them, you too can soar when the crisis recedes. In the meantime, I hope you can make best use of this time to work, learn, and contribute.

As we import most of our food and essentials, we must be prepared to face some of these pressures, and at the same time, work with like-minded countries to keep supply chains and trade flows open, and accelerate our plans to produce some of our needs in Singapore, even if these take time.

On supply chains, Singapore has been working with several countries. Last Friday, Singapore joined 12 other countries to issue a Declaration on Maintaining Essential Global Links. We also concluded discussions with New Zealand on a similar declaration earlier last week. We hope more like-minded countries will join us in this commitment.

We are also accelerating our ‘30x30’ plan — to produce 30% of our food needs by 2030. @masagosz is leading a Taskforce to oversee this effort. As part of the Resilience Budget, @sgfoodagency has also set-up a “30x30 Express” grant to support our agri-food industry in this endeavour.

We have the potential to produce more of our food needs locally. Earlier this month, I visited Apollo Aquaculture Group and Max Koi farm. I saw how our farms use innovation and technology for high-density and high-quality fish farming.

We will redouble our efforts to support our companies to ramp up local production and strengthen food resilience. You can be part of this effort too — by buying more local produce, even though they might cost slightly more.

At a time when global food security is of increasing concern, we have to pursue a multi-pronged strategy to secure our food needs, for the immediate, and for the longer term.  And each of us can do our part, by not wasting food. (PMO Video by Arina Ong)"

We also concluded discussions with New Zealand on a similar declaration earlier last week. We hope more like-minded countries will join us in this commitment.

We are also accelerating our ‘30x30’ plan — to produce 30% of our food needs by 2030. @masagosz is leading a Taskforce to oversee this effort. As part of the Resilience Budget, @sgfoodagency has also set-up a “30x30 Express” grant to support our agri-food industry in this endeavour.

We have the potential to produce more of our food needs locally. Earlier this month, I visited Apollo Aquaculture Group and Max Koi farm. I saw how our farms use innovation and technology for high-density and high-quality fish farming.

We will redouble our efforts to support our companies to ramp up local production and strengthen food resilience. You can be part of this effort too — by buying more local produce, even though they might cost slightly more.

At a time when global food security is of increasing concern, we have to pursue a multi-pronged strategy to secure our food needs, for the immediate, and for the longer term.  And each of us can do our part, by not wasting food. (PMO Video by Arina Ong)"

This is worth more than $7 billion, as I announced in the Solidarity Budget

As part of the Government’s efforts to help companies and workers with both cash and cashflow during this trying period, the implementing agencies have been working very hard to bring forward the first payouts under the Jobs Support Scheme to April.

For this month, April, I also enhanced the Jobs Support Scheme wage subsidy to 75% for ALL sectors, as the “circuit breaker” measures are affecting all sectors. This will also be paid together with the first tranche from today.

I trust that business leaders will do their best, to retain their workers, and our workers will use this time well, to learn new skills.

Subsequent tranches will be paid in July and October later this year.

For this month, April, I also enhanced the Jobs Support Scheme wage subsidy to 75% for ALL sectors, as the “circuit breaker” measures are affecting all sectors. This will also be paid together with the first tranche from today.

I trust that business leaders will do their best, to retain their workers, and our workers will use this time well, to learn new skills.

Subsequent tranches will be paid in July and October later this year.

More details can be found on the IRAS' website (www.iras.gov.sg).⠀

13,goldrun3375,"So for the month of April 2020 the support is 75% across all sector? I know of some employers that still forcing employees to take unpaid leaves and paid cut despite support given in this scheme. Employees get paid cut while employer get support and keep the money.

Also updated listeners on the current COVID-19 situation, particularly the clusters in our foreign worker dormitories. Our immediate priority is the well-being of our foreign workers and to contain the spread. Beyond the outbreak, we should also look at what more we can do to take care of them.

9,kenfivecheong,I love how you used the cardboard box. 👏,2020-04-13T05:07:59.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-4k4hAnP6l/,2020-04-12T14:22:26.000Z,"Had a ‘live’ Skype interview on CNA938 with John Yip today, in what has become the norm these days.

We had three Budgets in 48 days. Our challenge now is to implement these measures well. Cash flow is a concern for many businesses and households. So we are doing our best to reach as many as we can, as fast as possible.

I shared that we will be disbursing about $9 billion to businesses and households this month. The first payment will be made this Tuesday — Singaporeans will be receiving their $600 Solidarity Payment. You can read more details here: go.gov.sg/sp2020.

Also updated listeners on the current COVID-19 situation, particularly the clusters in our foreign worker dormitories. Our immediate priority is the well-being of our foreign workers and to contain the spread. Beyond the outbreak, we should also look at what more we can do to take care of them.

The “circuit breaker” is one week in. I am glad many of you have remained at home, and have found creative ways to remain active and engaged, connect with your loved ones, and help those around you.

Stay home, stay strong, and we will all emerge stronger.

I shared that we will be disbursing about $9 billion to businesses and households this month. The first payment will be made this Tuesday — Singaporeans will be receiving their $600 Solidarity Payment. You can read more details here: go.gov.sg/sp2020.

Also updated listeners on the current COVID-19 situation, particularly the clusters in our foreign worker dormitories. Our immediate priority is the well-being of our foreign workers and to contain the spread. Beyond the outbreak, we should also look at what more we can do to take care of them.

The “circuit breaker” is one week in. I am glad many of you have remained at home, and have found creative ways to remain active and engaged, connect with your loved ones, and help those around you.

Stay home, stay strong, and we will all emerge stronger.

I was reminded of this when I drove to Parliament today. Traffic was light and I only saw a handful of pedestrians on the streets.

Over the last two days, MPs rose unanimously to speak in support of the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Taken together with what we have set aside in the Unity Budget, we are committing almost $60 billion in our response to COVID-19.

The Resilience Budget provides sustained support for our businesses, workers and households for the rest of this year. The Solidarity Budget gives a boost to help them tide over the period of circuit breaker. Our priority now is to ensure that the payments flow to our businesses and households quickly.

We are navigating in uncharted waters, but we are confronting the crisis from a position of strength.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob’s support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come — when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

The Solidarity Budget gives a boost to help them tide over the period of circuit breaker. Our priority now is to ensure that the payments flow to our businesses and households quickly.

We are navigating in uncharted waters, but we are confronting the crisis from a position of strength.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob’s support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come — when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

My team and I are here to work with you, for you, for Singapore. We stand in solidarity with you during this critical period. 
Singapore Together, Majulah Forever.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come — when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

18,jeff.jtkm,👏👏👏Thank-you Sir (PM) Mr Heng.,2020-04-08T16:51:14.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-rIpPHHULj/,2020-04-07T09:05:34.000Z,"Today marks the first day of the one-month “circuit breaker”. I was reminded of this when I drove to Parliament today. Traffic was light and I only saw a handful of pedestrians on the streets.

Over the last two days, MPs rose unanimously to speak in support of the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Taken together with what we have set aside in the Unity Budget, we are committing almost $60 billion in our response to COVID-19.

The Resilience Budget provides sustained support for our businesses, workers and households for the rest of this year. The Solidarity Budget gives a boost to help them tide over the period of circuit breaker. Our priority now is to ensure that the payments flow to our businesses and households quickly.

We are navigating in uncharted waters, but we are confronting the crisis from a position of strength.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob’s support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

I was reminded of this when I drove to Parliament today. Traffic was light and I only saw a handful of pedestrians on the streets.

Over the last two days, MPs rose unanimously to speak in support of the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Taken together with what we have set aside in the Unity Budget, we are committing almost $60 billion in our response to COVID-19.

The Resilience Budget provides sustained support for our businesses, workers and households for the rest of this year. The Solidarity Budget gives a boost to help them tide over the period of circuit breaker. Our priority now is to ensure that the payments flow to our businesses and households quickly.

We are navigating in uncharted waters, but we are confronting the crisis from a position of strength.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob’s support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come — when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

My team and I are here to work with you, for you, for Singapore. We stand in solidarity with you during this critical period. 
Singapore Together, Majulah Forever.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob’s support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger. The newly-formed Emerging Stronger Taskforce and a strengthened #SingaporeTogether movement will help focus our collective effort to plan and prepare ahead.

Many families are hunkering down at the start of the circuit breaker. The weeks ahead will be long. But we can overcome this. We can take hope that better days will eventually come — when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

My team and I are here to work with you, for you, for Singapore. We stand in solidarity with you during this critical period. 
Singapore Together, Majulah Forever.

We can take hope that better days will eventually come — when we can go back to the office, send our kids to school, catch up with our friends, and dine-in at our favourite hawker centres.

I was reminded of this when I drove to Parliament today. Traffic was light and I only saw a handful of pedestrians on the streets.

Over the last two days, MPs rose unanimously to speak in support of the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Taken together with what we have set aside in the Unity Budget, we are committing almost $60 billion in our response to COVID-19.

The Resilience Budget provides sustained support for our businesses, workers and households for the rest of this year. The Solidarity Budget gives a boost to help them tide over the period of circuit breaker. Our priority now is to ensure that the payments flow to our businesses and households quickly.

We are navigating in uncharted waters, but we are confronting the crisis from a position of strength.

More importantly, like the generations before us, we can and we will chart our own destiny. Let us continue to put our minds together to focus on this challenge, and have the discipline to do what is needed.

We obtained President @halimahyacob’s support to draw on past reserves, to support our people. This storm is far from over and will likely get worse, before it gets better. We must be disciplined in using our dry powder, and stay prepared.

A new world with new opportunities will emerge when the storm passes. We will need the wits and will of all our people to stay resilient and emerge stronger.

As we begin the one-month ‘circuit breaker’ tomorrow, this $5.1 billion Budget will help our businesses, workers, and households tide through the next four weeks.

The Solidarity Budget was put together on very short notice. It was introduced in Parliament even before MPs had the chance to debate the Resilience Budget. Unlike previous Budgets, we did not have the opportunity to consult extensively. But we relied on the various feedback we had received since the Resilience Budget — to design additional measures and refine previously announced ones. We also continued to take a tripartite approach to policy design and implementation.

Many of you have also told my colleagues and me that you are anxious about your cash flow. This is understandably a major concern now. We are therefore ensuring that the additional support reaches as many as we can, as fast as possible. Payments to businesses and households will start this month.

To fund these set of measures, I have sought and obtained President @halimahyacob’s in-principle support to draw on an additional $4 billion from our Past Reserves. The remaining $1.1 billion will be funded from this term of Government.

Parliamentary debate on additional support for businesses and households started today and will resume tomorrow.

As we begin the one-month ‘circuit breaker’ tomorrow, this $5.1 billion Budget will help our businesses, workers, and households tide through the next four weeks.

The Solidarity Budget was put together on very short notice. It was introduced in Parliament even before MPs had the chance to debate the Resilience Budget. Unlike previous Budgets, we did not have the opportunity to consult extensively. But we relied on the various feedback we had received since the Resilience Budget — to design additional measures and refine previously announced ones. We also continued to take a tripartite approach to policy design and implementation.

Many of you have also told my colleagues and me that you are anxious about your cash flow. This is understandably a major concern now. We are therefore ensuring that the additional support reaches as many as we can, as fast as possible. Payments to businesses and households will start this month.

To fund these set of measures, I have sought and obtained President @halimahyacob’s in-principle support to draw on an additional $4 billion from our Past Reserves. The remaining $1.1 billion will be funded from this term of Government.

Parliamentary debate on additional support for businesses and households started today and will resume tomorrow.

My colleagues and I stand in solidarity with you. Let us unite, demonstrate our resilience and press on in solidarity.

Taken together, the Government’s response to COVID-19 will total almost $60 billion, or about 12% of GDP.

This is an unprecedented budget, for an extraordinary time. The situation remains highly fluid and uncertain. The Government stands ready to provide further support, should it become necessary.

DPM Heng: All adult Singaporeans will receive a one-off Solidarity Payment of $600 in cash. This comprises $300 brought forward from the Care and Support Package, and an additional $300.

For Singaporeans who have provided their bank account details to the Government, the payment will be credited directly into their accounts by 14 April 2020.

Other cash payouts under the Care and Support Package, which were announced earlier, will be brought forward to June, instead of August. 
For those who do not need these payouts, I encourage you to donate them to charity or share it with others.

For those who need more support, you can apply for the Temporary Relief Fund and the upcoming COVID-19 Support Grant at any of our Social Service Offices and Community Centres.

DPM Heng:  Since the Resilience Budget on 26 Mar, we have received feedback from various self-employed persons whose livelihoods have been affected. During this circuit breaker period, more will see a further drop in income.

I will therefore extend SIRS to automatically include self-employed persons who also earn small income from employment work.

I will also raise the Annual Value threshold of SIRS from $13,000 to $21,000. This will include those who live in some condominiums and other private properties.

With these enhancements, around 100,000 self-employed persons will be automatically eligible for SIRS. They will receive three payments of $3,000 each starting from May.

For most properties, this works out to slightly more than one month of rent. In the Bill that the @minlawsg will introduce tomorrow, we will include legislation to ensure that property owners pass on the property tax rebate in full to tenants.

The Government will continue to lead by example. I will increase the rental waiver for industrial, office and agricultural tenants of Government agencies to 1 month, up from the 0.5 month announced at the Resilience Budget.

I will waive the monthly Foreign Worker Levy due in April, to ease the labour cost for these firms.

In addition, we will also provide employers with a Foreign Worker Levy rebate of $750 for each work permit or S-pass holder, based on previous levies paid in 2020. Employers will receive the rebate as early as 21 April 2020.

We recognise that firms have been paying Foreign Worker Levies in normal times. In these exceptional times, we are temporarily redirecting resources back to these firms, so that they can support their foreign workers.

DPM Heng: Many firms cannot operate at all, or can only operate at a much reduced level in the coming weeks. But they should still retain and pay their workers.

I will therefore enhance the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for the month of April — I will raise the wage subsidy for all firms to 75% of gross monthly wages.

The wage subsidy will be based on the first $4,600 of wages paid in April 2020, and will apply to every one of our 1.9 million local employees.

I will also bring forward the first JSS payout from May to April. The enhanced payout for April will also be paid in this tranche.

This is part of the Care and Support Package which I announced during #SGBudget2020. Each of these households will receive a GST Voucher – U-Save of up to $300 this month, or up to $800 over four quarters from April 2020 to March 2021, depending on their HDB flat type.

Larger families who are eligible can receive up to $1,000 or 2.5 times their regular GST Voucher – U-Save over the same period. The rebates will be credited to your household’s utilities account directly. I hope that these rebates can help ease concerns and support households for their expenses and bills.

The aviation industry has been one of the sectors hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. With countries closing their borders and restricting the movement of citizens, international travel has been brought to a near standstill. @singaporeair announced a 96% cut to its scheduled capacity up to end-April, and our daily air passenger traffic has fallen by more than 90%. ⠀ ⠀
⠀
I visited @changiairport T3 on Monday to meet some of the ground staff and frontline workers and see how they have been coping. It was a sombre sight to see the quiet and near-empty departure gates, with many planes grounded on the tarmac. Despite this, morale on the ground remains high.⠀
⠀
I was also reassured to see and hear how the aviation sector’s leaders are working together on how we can help the sector recover and bounce back from this, stronger than before. This temporary shock to the sector will not be a permanent one, though it is likely to last longer than anticipated. In the Resilience Budget, I announced targeted measures for the aviation sector to help businesses retain workers and capabilities. Was encouraged to also hear how the enhanced Jobs Support Scheme will help tide through these difficult times.⠀
⠀
Besides using the time to retrain, several companies in the sector have also allowed their workers to volunteer on the COVID-19 frontline as SG Clean ambassadors and other duties. This is the spirit of #SGUnited — and I hope more companies will step forward to do their part.⠀

The aviation industry has been one of the sectors hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. With countries closing their borders and restricting the movement of citizens, international travel has been brought to a near standstill. @singaporeair announced a 96% cut to its scheduled capacity up to end-April, and our daily air passenger traffic has fallen by more than 90%. ⠀ ⠀
⠀
I visited @changiairport T3 on Monday to meet some of the ground staff and frontline workers and see how they have been coping. It was a sombre sight to see the quiet and near-empty departure gates, with many planes grounded on the tarmac. Despite this, morale on the ground remains high.⠀
⠀
I was also reassured to see and hear how the aviation sector’s leaders are working together on how we can help the sector recover and bounce back from this, stronger than before. This temporary shock to the sector will not be a permanent one, though it is likely to last longer than anticipated. In the Resilience Budget, I announced targeted measures for the aviation sector to help businesses retain workers and capabilities. Was encouraged to also hear how the enhanced Jobs Support Scheme will help tide through these difficult times.⠀
⠀
Besides using the time to retrain, several companies in the sector have also allowed their workers to volunteer on the COVID-19 frontline as SG Clean ambassadors and other duties. This is the spirit of #SGUnited — and I hope more companies will step forward to do their part.⠀

During this uncertain period, we will put cash in the hands of all families to help you cope.

I will triple the cash payout for all adult Singaporeans in the Care and Support Package announced in the Unity Budget. For families with young children, I will triple the additional cash payout as well. To further help needy Singaporeans with their household expenses, grocery vouchers will be tripled.

During this time, the Government will exercise greater flexibility on its fees and loans — freezing all government fees and charges for one year, from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021. We will also suspend all loan repayment and interest charges for one year, from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2021, for graduates who have taken a government loan for their university and polytechnic studies.

8,beauty.admirer.lover,"Dear DPM, Finance Minister, good day to you. An extended Unity Budget is better than nothing. So, a big thank you. I try to re-absorb the new budget details, it is not bad a package, if possible, your Ministry can just fine-tune the package ""a bit here, a bit there"" to make it ""more fantastic"". You served Mr Lee Kuan Yew closely for many years. That speaks volumes of your (good) capabilities. After this budget, our next challenge is to fight / contain / eradicate this Covid-19 (Crisis). The Ministerial Task Force are doing well so far so good, though there are still more room for improvements. Another challenge is of course ensuring the food supplies and necessities supply chain will not be adversely abrupted. Suggestion : more red meats from New Zealand. Not sure if Taiwan is a good option for fruits / vegetables supply source. If so, highly recommend them as alternative. (I must confess I aint no expert in these foodstuffs supply chain NEA regulations etc). All said, not least, thank you once again for the hardwork and efforts. @leehsienloong @lawrencewongst @gankimyong @ongyekung @khawboonwan @teocheehean @indraneerajah ***** note : if possible, try to look into the possibility of setting up a large assembly line to produce our own masks in Singapore. This can help create some temp jobs too. Wearing masks help boost confidence & assurance. Maybe after everyone is wearing masks we can open up our business a bit (e.g. restaurants, pubs...etc) to boost our economy ? But for now with not enough masks better be safe in having ""social distancing"" which is a correct move. And, are our ventilators enough if touchwood, Singpore exploded like Italy ? US seems to be in a mess right now after they were caught unprepared by the sudden exploded outbreak. Not enough ventilators, masks etc. I am actually quite shocked by the US news, considering US is one of the ""richest, most high tech"" advanced countries in the world.",2020-03-27T07:14:51.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Ob6TGnoDF/,2020-03-27T05:35:56.000Z,"Yesterday, I introduced measures worth over $48 billion in the Resilience Budget to help businesses, workers and households tide over this period of uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.

This is the first time in our history that we are tabling a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget.

I introduced measures worth over $48 billion — this is more than 7 times the $6.4 billion for support measures in the Unity Budget. With in-principle support from President @halimahyacob, the Government is seeking to draw up to $17 billion from our Past Reserves to fund these measures. This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

When future generations look back on this chapter in our history, it is not the Budget numbers they will remember. It is our resilient spirit, our determination, and our actions in a period of unprecedented disruption that will stand out — as one people standing together, supporting one another with strength, grit, and compassion.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available. Around you — there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures.

With in-principle support from President @halimahyacob, the Government is seeking to draw up to $17 billion from our Past Reserves to fund these measures. This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

When future generations look back on this chapter in our history, it is not the Budget numbers they will remember. It is our resilient spirit, our determination, and our actions in a period of unprecedented disruption that will stand out — as one people standing together, supporting one another with strength, grit, and compassion.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available. Around you — there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures. This Resilience Budget, like everything else we do, is about working with you and for you, for Singapore.

This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

When future generations look back on this chapter in our history, it is not the Budget numbers they will remember. It is our resilient spirit, our determination, and our actions in a period of unprecedented disruption that will stand out — as one people standing together, supporting one another with strength, grit, and compassion.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available. Around you — there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures. This Resilience Budget, like everything else we do, is about working with you and for you, for Singapore.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

When future generations look back on this chapter in our history, it is not the Budget numbers they will remember. It is our resilient spirit, our determination, and our actions in a period of unprecedented disruption that will stand out — as one people standing together, supporting one another with strength, grit, and compassion.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available. Around you — there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures. This Resilience Budget, like everything else we do, is about working with you and for you, for Singapore.

This is the first time in our history that we are tabling a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget.

I introduced measures worth over $48 billion — this is more than 7 times the $6.4 billion for support measures in the Unity Budget. With in-principle support from President @halimahyacob, the Government is seeking to draw up to $17 billion from our Past Reserves to fund these measures. This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP.

Around you — there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures. This Resilience Budget, like everything else we do, is about working with you and for you, for Singapore.

This is the first time in our history that we are tabling a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget.

I introduced measures worth over $48 billion — this is more than 7 times the $6.4 billion for support measures in the Unity Budget. With in-principle support from President @halimahyacob, the Government is seeking to draw up to $17 billion from our Past Reserves to fund these measures. This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

This is the first time in our history that we are tabling a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget.

I introduced measures worth over $48 billion — this is more than 7 times the $6.4 billion for support measures in the Unity Budget. With in-principle support from President @halimahyacob, the Government is seeking to draw up to $17 billion from our Past Reserves to fund these measures. This is only the second time in history that we are drawing on Past Reserves, and we are drawing more than three times what we did in 2009.

Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our workers, companies and households in this battle. This amounts to 11% of our GDP. This is a historic Budget, because we are facing a historic challenge. The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. This is a test of our generation, and a test of our resilience as a people and nation.

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Our Resilience Budget supports our people to rise up to the challenge and ride through these difficult times.

When future generations look back on this chapter in our history, it is not the Budget numbers they will remember. It is our resilient spirit, our determination, and our actions in a period of unprecedented disruption that will stand out — as one people standing together, supporting one another with strength, grit, and compassion.

The details of the Resilience Budget are on www.singaporebudget.gov.sg. I urge you to make best use of the support available. Around you — there are others who may not know how to access the help available, or might need additional support. If you know who they are, offer your help. This is a time for us to be resilient and support one another. And in the meantime, let us know what you think about our measures. This Resilience Budget, like everything else we do, is about working with you and for you, for Singapore.

DPM Heng: The COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious crisis we have faced in a generation. We have been able to respond boldly and decisively to the outbreak in Singapore because we have forged a cohesive and resilient society.

To show solidarity with Singaporeans, all political office holders will take an additional 2-month pay cut, on top of the 1-month pay cut announced last month. President @halimahyacob, Speaker @chuanjin1 and Deputy Speakers Charles Chong and Lim Biow Chuan will take a similar 3-month pay cut in total.

The months ahead will not be easy, as the situation continues to evolve dynamically and unpredictably. We must continue to be on high vigilance, mentally and psychologically prepared for every scenario. The Government will lead the way. We will protect and advance the well-being and livelihoods of Singaporeans. We will take care of our people. We will leave no one behind. We will stand with Singaporeans of all walks of life to battle this crisis together, and keep Singapore going. This is the essence of who we are as a nation. This is #SGUnited.

DPM Heng: The third thrust of the Resilience Budget is to build resilience in our economy and society, as we battle this downturn, and build capabilities for when the eventual recovery comes. We will build economic resilience at all levels — at national, industry and individual levels. We will also strengthen social and psychological resilience. If we prepare ourselves well today, we can emerge stronger, not only as an economy, but as a society.

DPM Heng: On top of the broad-based support to help businesses address the three ‘C’s — cash, cost, credit, I will provide additional help to specific sectors that are most directly affected by COVID-19.

Sectors relying on tourism and international travel have been hit the hardest. The aviation sector sits at the core of this ecosystem.&nbsp;We will provide an enhanced Jobs Support Scheme to help retain local workers for businesses whose activities are based principally in the aviation sector. We will also introduce a $350 million enhanced aviation support package to fund support measures.

Apart from the aviation sector, other tourism-related industries have had a difficult time. We will also set aside $90 million to help the tourism industry rebound strongly, when the time is right.

In addition, sectors that involve a high level of human interaction will take a hit from the recently announced safe distancing measures. We will also support them accordingly.

DPM Heng: The Resilience Budget will address the three Cs on the mind of every business owner now — cash flow, cost, and credit.

Cash is king, and we are doing our best to flow the payouts under the wage support schemes quickly, and to grant an automatic deferment of income tax payments of companies and self-employed.

To keep costs under control, I will enhance the Property Tax Rebate announced in the Unity Budget. Commercial properties which have been most badly affected — such as hotels, shops and restaurants — will pay no property tax this year. Other non-residential properties will benefit from a 30% rebate. I strongly urge landlords to fully pass on the rebate to tenants, by reducing rentals. The Government will lead by example by enhancing rental waivers.

Credit is another key business concern. I will further enhance our financing schemes so that even the hardest-hit businesses can continue to have access to credit. In addition, I will set aside $20 billion of loan capital in this budget. This will help to support good companies with strong capabilities, and catalyse private sector loan capital.

DPM Heng: The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. On the medical front, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe. Yet measures on the medical front to contain the pandemic, both in Singapore and around the world, have made the second front of the battle — the economic front, even more difficult. Our latest GDP growth is forecasted to be between -4.0% and -1.0%. On the social front, we need Singaporeans to be strong, and ride through these challenges together.

Last month, I committed $6.4 billion in the Unity Budget towards the Stabilisation and Support Package, the Care and Support Package, and to support our frontline Agencies. Today, I am introducing measures worth over $48 billion in this Resilience Budget, to deal decisively with the COVID-19 situation.

Altogether, we are putting $55 billion to support our people, amounting to 11% of our GDP. This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation.

The Resilience Budget will focus on three key areas:

1. Save jobs, support workers, and protect livelihoods

DPM Heng: The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. On the medical front, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe. Yet measures on the medical front to contain the pandemic, both in Singapore and around the world, have made the second front of the battle — the economic front, even more difficult. Our latest GDP growth is forecasted to be between -4.0% and -1.0%. On the social front, we need Singaporeans to be strong, and ride through these challenges together.

Last month, I committed $6.4 billion in the Unity Budget towards the Stabilisation and Support Package, the Care and Support Package, and to support our frontline Agencies. Today, I am introducing measures worth over $48 billion in this Resilience Budget, to deal decisively with the COVID-19 situation.

Altogether, we are putting $55 billion to support our people, amounting to 11% of our GDP. This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation.

The Resilience Budget will focus on three key areas:

1. Save jobs, support workers, and protect livelihoods

2. Help enterprises overcome immediate challenges

3. Strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge intact and stronger

COVID-19 has since turned into a global pandemic, one that will be with us for many months to come. We must remain resilient as we brave the difficult times to come. This is why I have named the supplementary budget the Resilience Budget.

Our resilience as a country, as a society, is being put to the test as we face our biggest challenge in more than a decade. I still remember vividly the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, when I was heading up the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Those were dark days, but we bounced back. This time around, we face not just an economic crisis, but also a global pandemic.

The road ahead will not be easy, but with the Resilience Budget — we will help save jobs and support companies, with more for those who have been hardest hit. Households will also receive additional help to tide through this difficult period.

Various analysts and business leaders have been guessing about the size of the Budget, and its reach. It is important not to have excessive expectations or merely focus on the headline numbers. What is more important is that all of us do our part and make the best use of whatever we have.

Together, we can weather the storm and emerge stronger as one Singapore.

The world has undergone tremendous change since. These are extraordinary times — as the world faces a global pandemic, an economic shock, and a test of the financial systems all rolled into one.

On this fifth anniversary, I asked myself — how would a nation that came of age under Mr Lee’s leadership deal with COVID-19?

While Singapore has never faced a situation like this in our history, we have been through many crises before. In our early years of nationhood, Mr Lee told us, “Never fear!”. We did not, and we came together as a united nation. This spirit of staying strong and united, showing resilience and caring for one another, will see us through these difficult times.

Our frontline heroes, public officers, community groups, and people are doing their part — demonstrating our strength in unity. But the outbreak has inevitably taken a big toll on our economy, with many jobs and livelihoods at stake.

We will meet this challenge head-on. I will present a supplementary Budget on 26 March, just 5 weeks after #SGBudget2020. This is a Budget to support Singaporeans to stay united and resilient. This is the first time that we are introducing a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget, reflecting how fast the situation has deteriorated over the past weeks.

COVID-19 is spreading across the globe. No one can foretell the future, but as long as we stay alert and dynamic, we can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation.

We will keep you safe, preserve jobs and livelihoods, as well as help viable enterprises stay strong.

Singaporeans have stood united through past crises. We remember and honour the fighting spirit of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and our pioneer generation, even as we forge our way forward through new challenges.

We will never fear. Together, we will get through this crisis, and emerge stronger, as one united people.

COVID-19 is spreading across the globe. No one can foretell the future, but as long as we stay alert and dynamic, we can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation.

We will keep you safe, preserve jobs and livelihoods, as well as help viable enterprises stay strong.

Singaporeans have stood united through past crises. We remember and honour the fighting spirit of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and our pioneer generation, even as we forge our way forward through new challenges.

We will never fear. Together, we will get through this crisis, and emerge stronger, as one united people.

While Singapore has never faced a situation like this in our history, we have been through many crises before. In our early years of nationhood, Mr Lee told us, “Never fear!”.

We did not, and we came together as a united nation. This spirit of staying strong and united, showing resilience and caring for one another, will see us through these difficult times.

Our frontline heroes, public officers, community groups, and people are doing their part — demonstrating our strength in unity. But the outbreak has inevitably taken a big toll on our economy, with many jobs and livelihoods at stake.

We will meet this challenge head-on. I will present a supplementary Budget on 26 March, just 5 weeks after #SGBudget2020. This is a Budget to support Singaporeans to stay united and resilient. This is the first time that we are introducing a supplementary budget so soon after the main budget, reflecting how fast the situation has deteriorated over the past weeks.

COVID-19 is spreading across the globe. No one can foretell the future, but as long as we stay alert and dynamic, we can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation.

We will keep you safe, preserve jobs and livelihoods, as well as help viable enterprises stay strong.

Singaporeans have stood united through past crises. We remember and honour the fighting spirit of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and our pioneer generation, even as we forge our way forward through new challenges.

We will never fear. Together, we will get through this crisis, and emerge stronger, as one united people.

I announced a $4 billion Stabilisation & Support Package in #SGBudget2020 to support our workers and businesses affected by the outbreak. But the fast-evolving and worsening situation calls for more to be done.

My @mof_sg team has been working hard with other agencies and organisations on the second stimulus package. Today, Minister Chan Chun Sing and I met Council members from the Singapore Business Federation, Trade Associations and Chambers to have a better understanding of the challenges faced by different sectors of the economy, and how a second support package can help viable companies and retain workers.

We had a robust and substantive dialogue as they candidly shared their immediate and long-term concerns and challenges. These covered many ‘Cs’ — cash flow, costs, capabilities and confidence. We will take the feedback into consideration for the second package.

As COVID-19 will be here to stay till the end of the year, or longer, we have to ensure that our measures are sustainable, to weather the impact of a prolonged outbreak. We are focusing on containing the outbreak on the medical front, to protect lives, and to protect workers and livelihoods.

I announced a $4 billion Stabilisation & Support Package in #SGBudget2020 to support our workers and businesses affected by the outbreak. But the fast-evolving and worsening situation calls for more to be done.

My @mof_sg team has been working hard with other agencies and organisations on the second stimulus package. Today, Minister Chan Chun Sing and I met Council members from the Singapore Business Federation, Trade Associations and Chambers to have a better understanding of the challenges faced by different sectors of the economy, and how a second support package can help viable companies and retain workers.

We had a robust and substantive dialogue as they candidly shared their immediate and long-term concerns and challenges. These covered many ‘Cs’ — cash flow, costs, capabilities and confidence. We will take the feedback into consideration for the second package.

As COVID-19 will be here to stay till the end of the year, or longer, we have to ensure that our measures are sustainable, to weather the impact of a prolonged outbreak. We are focusing on containing the outbreak on the medical front, to protect lives, and to protect workers and livelihoods.

The Order will affect the movement of people, including Malaysian workers who commute daily to Singapore.

I am glad that the flow of goods, including food supplies, will continue when the Order is in force. As Chun Sing explained, we have adequate stockpiles, diversified food supply lines, and alternative plans should existing supply lines be disrupted. We do not have all our eggs in one basket.

The Order will affect the movement of people, including Malaysian workers who commute daily to Singapore. We are supporting affected businesses, by helping them house these workers in Singapore during this period, particularly those providing essential services.

I am glad that the flow of goods, including food supplies, will continue when the Order is in force. As Chun Sing explained, we have adequate stockpiles, diversified food supply lines, and alternative plans should existing supply lines be disrupted. We do not have all our eggs in one basket.

While the supermarkets in Tampines and other parts of the island were more crowded than usual, most shoppers are buying what they need. There is no need to panic buy.

In this moment of crisis, remember to look after yourself and look out for those around you. Together, we can overcome the current challenges.

14,123atsummer,"Dear Mr Heng, there are now many Spore citizens, PR returning from UK, USA and other countries with widespread covid-19. Self quarantine of 14 days at home will cause widespread spikes in the nation. Why so? All those who return could already be infected but show no symptom yet. When they stay home, they still mingle with their family members. Majority do not have the luxury of big homes and therefore impossible to be within the safe distant from each other. Realistically, many may not be disciplined enough to do the recommended procedures.  Assuming each family has average 5 people including the helper. Assuming that just 2 family members get infected by the one who returns from overseas, these 2 will go to school, to work, to eat, to socialise without knowing that they are also infected. Their neighbours will also get infected too. Can't imagine the spread with so many thousands returning members!!! Suggest that our govt place these group of returning citizens in designated venues for 14 days instead of returning to their home. This will be safer for the nation. A total lock-down will cause the nation much more than giving designated venues to house all those who returned from overseas regardless of which country whether by air, by rail or by road.  Drastic times require drastic actions but surely all SG citizens will stand united to win this battle together with our government.",2020-03-19T05:43:12.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B91cO2GnJoK/,2020-03-17T12:37:44.000Z,"The global COVID-19 situation has been escalating.

We discussed how the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation has affected global economies and the global supply chain, as well as its impact on Singapore and our economy. I shared that we are expecting the outbreak to last at least till the end of the year — that is why we must not let fear rule over our hearts and minds, and how we can pull through this together, as long as we support one another.

Our current priorities are to limit the spread of the virus and its impact on our economy. As a small and open economy, the fluid developments around the world will inevitably affect us in one way or another. We will continue to keep a close watch and adjust our approach accordingly.

We have been monitoring the global economic and financial developments, and receiving feedback from businesses and unionists. Health experts have warned that it will take many more months before the virus will run its course. I have also been updating President @halimahyacob and the Council of Presidential Advisers on how we must do our very best to protect our people, workers, and businesses.

After assessing the incoming data and post-Budget sentiments, I started work on our second stimulus package 10 days ago. I shared this at this morning’s @straits_times-@businesstimessg Budget Roundtable, moderated by ST’s Associate Editor Vikram Khanna.

Besides exchanging views on the outlook of the Singapore economy, the panellists also shared their wishlists for what they hope to see in the second support package.

Our priority is to support workers and businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises — so that workers can continue to stay employed and viable enterprises can survive. We will also need to look out for self-employed workers and those who have been retrenched — to provide support and to upgrade their skills during this downturn.

Our aim in the second support package is to stabilise our economy through this challenging time, and to emerge stronger together — ready to innovate and meet the needs of the next wave. For us to achieve this — businesses, workers, and the government must work closely together.

We will need to continue to keep our eye on the future — to transform, to innovate, and to grow — this is what the Future Economy Council’s Emerging Stronger Taskforce will be looking at.

I appreciate my officers in @mof_sg who have worked very hard on Budget 2020, and are keeping their spirits high to work on yet another budget package.

It means we never walk alone. It expresses our confidence that Singaporeans will rally to tackle challenges, and go through thick and thin as one Singapore.

We are united in our confidence that Singaporeans come out of this outbreak stronger. As long as we stay united in resilience, trust and solidarity, and to build better lives for all in Singapore, we will get through this, together.

In this fight, our frontline workers, especially our healthcare workers, have shown outstanding courage and dedication. To show our thanks and support, we will award frontline workers up to 1 additional month of special bonus. We will also make a one-off COVID-19 grant to the Public Health Preparedness Clinics, to support them in their active role caring for patients with respiratory symptoms.

All MPs will take a 1-month allowance cut. President @halimahyacob informed me that she will join in. Senior public service officers will take a half-month cut.

Beyond COVID-19, our unity will set the foundation for Singaporeans to press on and write the next chapter of our Singapore story. All of this is within our reach, if we work as One Singapore. Above all, let us never stop thinking and working for tomorrow. #SingaporeTogether, Majulah Forever!

It means we never walk alone. It expresses our confidence that Singaporeans will rally to tackle challenges, and go through thick and thin as one Singapore.

We are united in our determination to preserve and enhance jobs, as well as support businesses impacted by COVID-19. We are united in our confidence that Singaporeans come out of this outbreak stronger. As long as we stay united in resilience, trust and solidarity, and to build better lives for all in Singapore, we will get through this, together.

In this fight, our frontline workers, especially our healthcare workers, have shown outstanding courage and dedication. To show our thanks and support, we will award frontline workers up to 1 additional month of special bonus. We will also make a one-off COVID-19 grant to the Public Health Preparedness Clinics, to support them in their active role caring for patients with respiratory symptoms.

My colleagues and I will do our part to show solidarity with fellow Singaporeans who have been affected by the outbreak. All political office holders will take a 1-month salary cut. All MPs will take a 1-month allowance cut. President @halimahyacob informed me that she will join in. Senior public service officers will take a half-month cut.

Beyond COVID-19, our unity will set the foundation for Singaporeans to press on and write the next chapter of our Singapore story. All of this is within our reach, if we work as One Singapore. Above all, let us never stop thinking and working for tomorrow. #SingaporeTogether, Majulah Forever!

I thank Members and the many Singaporans for contributing to #SGBudget2020 Debate. I have listened intently to all your views, and am heartened that we all have the best interests for Singapore.

Please do continue to follow the Committee of Supply debates next week, when the various Ministries will share more details on the Budget measures.

The tourism and hospitality sectors have been particularly hard hit. Many travellers have also understandably deferred travel plans during this time. I was heartened to hear that businesses are taking opportunity of this unexpected downtime to upgrade themselves and retrain their workers.⠀
⠀
I visited @parkroyalkitchener today to see how our tourism and hospitality frontline workers are managing the impact of the outbreak. The hotel is using this lull period to implement new productivity solutions and facilities, such as self check-in kiosks. The senior management shared how they had embarked on a transformation journey a year ago, and how they are looking at long-term solutions for sustainability by using a food waste digester to reduce energy wastage.⠀
⠀
I spoke to many of the staff at the frontline. Very happy to see them calm, confident and alert, and working closely with the management who are supporting their frontline staff. They shared with me interesting stories of how they are managing. Several are new to the industry, and others had seen previous downturns during SARS and the Global Financial Crisis. Good that the young are learning from the experienced warriors!⠀
⠀
I hope that companies facing similar circumstances will make full use of this ongoing downturn to raise the skills of workers and refine their operations, just like what PARKROYAL is doing. The Stabilisation and Support package I announced during #SGBudget2020 can help support workers and businesses affected by COVID-19. Measures such as the enhancement of the Wage Credit Scheme and the Job Support Scheme are direct wage relief measures. I encourage businesses to fully utilise what is available to tide through this difficult period, so that we emerge stronger and get our economy back on track when the eventual upturn comes.⠀

The tourism and hospitality sectors have been particularly hard hit. Many travellers have also understandably deferred travel plans during this time. I was heartened to hear that businesses are taking opportunity of this unexpected downtime to upgrade themselves and retrain their workers.⠀
⠀
I visited @parkroyalkitchener today to see how our tourism and hospitality frontline workers are managing the impact of the outbreak. The hotel is using this lull period to implement new productivity solutions and facilities, such as self check-in kiosks. The senior management shared how they had embarked on a transformation journey a year ago, and how they are looking at long-term solutions for sustainability by using a food waste digester to reduce energy wastage.⠀
⠀
I spoke to many of the staff at the frontline. Very happy to see them calm, confident and alert, and working closely with the management who are supporting their frontline staff. They shared with me interesting stories of how they are managing. Several are new to the industry, and others had seen previous downturns during SARS and the Global Financial Crisis. Good that the young are learning from the experienced warriors!⠀
⠀
I hope that companies facing similar circumstances will make full use of this ongoing downturn to raise the skills of workers and refine their operations, just like what PARKROYAL is doing. The Stabilisation and Support package I announced during #SGBudget2020 can help support workers and businesses affected by COVID-19. Measures such as the enhancement of the Wage Credit Scheme and the Job Support Scheme are direct wage relief measures. I encourage businesses to fully utilise what is available to tide through this difficult period, so that we emerge stronger and get our economy back on track when the eventual upturn comes.⠀

I was also asked about the need for a strong Budget at this point in time, and I shared more on support packages and measures that I announced yesterday — designed to provide assistance to sectors that have been hard-hit by the outbreak.

We are navigating a huge wave of uncertainty, but while we are at it, we must also prepare for long-term challenges such as climate change and transforming our workforce, while ensuring we do not lose our sense of direction.

#SGBudget2020 has come amidst great uncertainty, as we confront the challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak. I understand Singaporeans’ concerns about the impact on our businesses and jobs. We will help workers and businesses through:

1. A $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package to help stabilise the economy as well as support our workers and enterprises. It will also provide for jobs and cash flow support to help businesses retain and retrain workers. Additional help will be given to sectors more directly impacted by COVID-19; and

2. A $1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help Singaporeans with their household expenses and cost of living, with adult Singaporeans getting a one-off cash payout of between $100-$300.

I also announced that given the current economic situation and our financial position, I would not raise our GST rate in 2021. We will consider the situation carefully before any changes. When we raise GST, we would have a $6 billion Assurance Package to help Singaporean households.

Our ability to have a strong Budget in these uncertain times is only possible thanks to our fiscal prudence over generations.

Beyond immediate challenges, this year’s Budget also presents our long-term strategic financial plan to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans to meet future challenges and seize new opportunities. We will continue to grow our economy, transform our enterprises, care for and nurture Singaporeans, build and secure our nation, while working together with Singaporeans so that we can advance as One Singapore, to build a home we will always call our own.

I thank the many people who participated in our Budget consultation sessions. I also thank my very dedicated team of officers in @mof_sg.

My colleagues in the respective Ministries will elaborate on these plans during the Committee of Supply debates in the coming weeks.

#SGBudget2020 has come amidst great uncertainty, as we confront the challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak. I understand Singaporeans’ concerns about the impact on our businesses and jobs. We will help workers and businesses through:

1. A $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package to help stabilise the economy as well as support our workers and enterprises. It will also provide for jobs and cash flow support to help businesses retain and retrain workers. Additional help will be given to sectors more directly impacted by COVID-19; and

2. A $1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help Singaporeans with their household expenses and cost of living, with adult Singaporeans getting a one-off cash payout of between $100-$300.

I also announced that given the current economic situation and our financial position, I would not raise our GST rate in 2021. We will consider the situation carefully before any changes. When we raise GST, we would have a $6 billion Assurance Package to help Singaporean households.

Our ability to have a strong Budget in these uncertain times is only possible thanks to our fiscal prudence over generations.

Beyond immediate challenges, this year’s Budget also presents our long-term strategic financial plan to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans to meet future challenges and seize new opportunities. We will continue to grow our economy, transform our enterprises, care for and nurture Singaporeans, build and secure our nation, while working together with Singaporeans so that we can advance as One Singapore, to build a home we will always call our own.

I thank the many people who participated in our Budget consultation sessions. I also thank my very dedicated team of officers in @mof_sg.

19,alinek392,Thank you so much  Mr Heng❤️,2020-02-19T04:31:03.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8tbYpInP-_/,2020-02-18T13:25:01.000Z,"I presented the Budget Statement in Parliament today.

#SGBudget2020 has come amidst great uncertainty, as we confront the challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak. I understand Singaporeans’ concerns about the impact on our businesses and jobs. We will help workers and businesses through:

1. A $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package to help stabilise the economy as well as support our workers and enterprises. It will also provide for jobs and cash flow support to help businesses retain and retrain workers. Additional help will be given to sectors more directly impacted by COVID-19; and

2. A $1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help Singaporeans with their household expenses and cost of living, with adult Singaporeans getting a one-off cash payout of between $100-$300.

I also announced that given the current economic situation and our financial position, I would not raise our GST rate in 2021. We will consider the situation carefully before any changes. When we raise GST, we would have a $6 billion Assurance Package to help Singaporean households.

Our ability to have a strong Budget in these uncertain times is only possible thanks to our fiscal prudence over generations.

Beyond immediate challenges, this year’s Budget also presents our long-term strategic financial plan to prepare Singapore and Singaporeans to meet future challenges and seize new opportunities. We will continue to grow our economy, transform our enterprises, care for and nurture Singaporeans, build and secure our nation, while working together with Singaporeans so that we can advance as One Singapore, to build a home we will always call our own.

I thank the many people who participated in our Budget consultation sessions. I also thank my very dedicated team of officers in @mof_sg.

My colleagues in the respective Ministries will elaborate on these plans during the Committee of Supply debates in the coming weeks.

0,feieats,Looking forward to hearing the budget,2020-02-17T14:49:10.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8qnpGbHIyE/,2020-02-17T11:14:24.000Z,"We are hours away from the Budget Statement, which I will deliver in Parliament tomorrow.

Usually, we try to settle the details as early as possible. This year, we could not, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The @mof_sg team has been putting in extra hours to track the fast-evolving situation, listening to Singaporeans’ suggestions, and coming up with targeted support measures. We have many young officers at MOF, and I had really hoped that they could have a nice Valentine’s Day with their loved ones last Friday. Instead, they asked for understanding from their partners, and worked with me through the night and over the weekend.

I have also been working closely with Cabinet colleagues involved in managing various facets of the COVID-19 outbreak. My thanks to all of them, and to @lawrencewongst and @indraneerajah, who are with me in MOF, and have been contributing to this Budget over the months.

#SGBudget2020 will include measures that were not on the table a month ago. We would not have been able to act quickly and decisively, if not for our deep reserves. I do not mean only our financial reserves, but also the reserves of strength, resilience, empathy, and resourcefulness among our public servants and fellow Singaporeans.

Without these, we would have been much worse off — financially and psychologically. My team and I would not be able to spend the last few weeks working on the stabilisation and support measures. We would instead be lying awake trying to project how much of a hit we are going to suffer, rather than what we can do to help our economy and people.

As Finance Minister, I am grateful for the efforts and sacrifices of not just one generation, but of many — going back to my illustrious predecessor Dr Goh Keng Swee, our first Finance Minister, and our Pioneer and Merdeka generations.

I am proud of our public officers, working selflessly on the frontline and in the backrooms. I am moved by our people whose acts of compassion inspire us. I am grateful for the deep reserves we have — of finances, but more importantly of friendship, care, grit. I will do my best to protect and grow these.

Now, it’s back to work on the speech. (MCI Photo by Chwee)"

We have many young officers at MOF, and I had really hoped that they could have a nice Valentine’s Day with their loved ones last Friday. Instead, they asked for understanding from their partners, and worked with me through the night and over the weekend.

I have also been working closely with Cabinet colleagues involved in managing various facets of the COVID-19 outbreak. My thanks to all of them, and to @lawrencewongst and @indraneerajah, who are with me in MOF, and have been contributing to this Budget over the months.

#SGBudget2020 will include measures that were not on the table a month ago. We would not have been able to act quickly and decisively, if not for our deep reserves. I do not mean only our financial reserves, but also the reserves of strength, resilience, empathy, and resourcefulness among our public servants and fellow Singaporeans.

Without these, we would have been much worse off — financially and psychologically. My team and I would not be able to spend the last few weeks working on the stabilisation and support measures. We would instead be lying awake trying to project how much of a hit we are going to suffer, rather than what we can do to help our economy and people.

As Finance Minister, I am grateful for the efforts and sacrifices of not just one generation, but of many — going back to my illustrious predecessor Dr Goh Keng Swee, our first Finance Minister, and our Pioneer and Merdeka generations.

I am proud of our public officers, working selflessly on the frontline and in the backrooms. I am moved by our people whose acts of compassion inspire us. I am grateful for the deep reserves we have — of finances, but more importantly of friendship, care, grit. I will do my best to protect and grow these.

22,leeellengh,"❤️ Many heartfelt thanks to Minister, the Cabinet and all staff who have worked so hard, made sacrifices and always on your toes to make changes as the situation evolves, so that our lives are not too heavily impacted and our country continues to maintain the competitive edge so much needed for us in this global economy! We eagerly await your Budget Statement and thank all who have a hand in it!! Grateful and gratitude abound aplenty!!",2020-02-18T04:12:23.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8qnpGbHIyE/,2020-02-17T11:14:24.000Z,"We are hours away from the Budget Statement, which I will deliver in Parliament tomorrow.

Usually, we try to settle the details as early as possible. This year, we could not, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The @mof_sg team has been putting in extra hours to track the fast-evolving situation, listening to Singaporeans’ suggestions, and coming up with targeted support measures. We have many young officers at MOF, and I had really hoped that they could have a nice Valentine’s Day with their loved ones last Friday. Instead, they asked for understanding from their partners, and worked with me through the night and over the weekend.

I have also been working closely with Cabinet colleagues involved in managing various facets of the COVID-19 outbreak. My thanks to all of them, and to @lawrencewongst and @indraneerajah, who are with me in MOF, and have been contributing to this Budget over the months.

#SGBudget2020 will include measures that were not on the table a month ago. We would not have been able to act quickly and decisively, if not for our deep reserves. I do not mean only our financial reserves, but also the reserves of strength, resilience, empathy, and resourcefulness among our public servants and fellow Singaporeans.

Without these, we would have been much worse off — financially and psychologically. My team and I would not be able to spend the last few weeks working on the stabilisation and support measures. We would instead be lying awake trying to project how much of a hit we are going to suffer, rather than what we can do to help our economy and people.

As Finance Minister, I am grateful for the efforts and sacrifices of not just one generation, but of many — going back to my illustrious predecessor Dr Goh Keng Swee, our first Finance Minister, and our Pioneer and Merdeka generations.

I am proud of our public officers, working selflessly on the frontline and in the backrooms. I am moved by our people whose acts of compassion inspire us. I am grateful for the deep reserves we have — of finances, but more importantly of friendship, care, grit. I will do my best to protect and grow these.

Without these, we would have been much worse off — financially and psychologically. My team and I would not be able to spend the last few weeks working on the stabilisation and support measures. We would instead be lying awake trying to project how much of a hit we are going to suffer, rather than what we can do to help our economy and people.

As Finance Minister, I am grateful for the efforts and sacrifices of not just one generation, but of many — going back to my illustrious predecessor Dr Goh Keng Swee, our first Finance Minister, and our Pioneer and Merdeka generations.

I am proud of our public officers, working selflessly on the frontline and in the backrooms. I am moved by our people whose acts of compassion inspire us. I am grateful for the deep reserves we have — of finances, but more importantly of friendship, care, grit. I will do my best to protect and grow these.

Usually, we try to settle the details as early as possible. This year, we could not, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The @mof_sg team has been putting in extra hours to track the fast-evolving situation, listening to Singaporeans’ suggestions, and coming up with targeted support measures. We have many young officers at MOF, and I had really hoped that they could have a nice Valentine’s Day with their loved ones last Friday. Instead, they asked for understanding from their partners, and worked with me through the night and over the weekend.

I have also been working closely with Cabinet colleagues involved in managing various facets of the COVID-19 outbreak. My thanks to all of them, and to @lawrencewongst and @indraneerajah, who are with me in MOF, and have been contributing to this Budget over the months.

Besides financial assistance, enhanced measures have also been put in place by the @ltasg, together with the MOH, Point-to-Point operators, the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA) — all to protect the health of our taxi and private hire car drivers, as well as their passengers.

Taxi operators conduct temperature screening at their premises daily. 300,000 surgical masks will be given to drivers to give to passengers who are unwell and need a ride to see a doctor or go to the hospital. Drivers have also been reminded to continue good personal hygiene habits, take their temperature, and clean and disinfect their vehicles more frequently.

We will continue to work with our tripartite partners to support workers in the sectors affected by the COVID-19. I will also be announcing more measures to help both workers and affected businesses in my #SGBudget speech on 18 February.

Let’s continue to stay united and navigate through this challenging period together.
