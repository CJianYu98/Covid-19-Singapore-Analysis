9,helenlim2018,"After CB, the government should not be using the criteria whether a biz is carrying out essential services to open in phase 1 or 2 or 3. Rather the criteria used by the government should be whether the company has put in place sufficient safe social distancing measures before it qualifies to be open for business. Shops have been closed for more than 2 months already. Rental and salaries still need to be paid. If shops are not allowed to open soon, all of us will be out of business. It is not fair to specify what kind of business can be open in the various phases. Please reconsider.

It’s extreme given our death rate and community cases. These measures are going to prevent a second wave if that’s the focus but they will drive people insane and cripple our economy. There are many ways to lift measures in a safe but practical way eg allow people to identify 10 people to interact with during phase 1 to limit numbers, allow restaurants to open with measures in place and social distancing.

18,aliciatan4,"Our immune system is our first line of defence. The role is to protect us from invaders be it germs, bacteria, viruses, pathogens, free radicals, environmental agents like microbes or chemicals etc. Our unharmed immune system is the natural protector and healer! Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She reversed all her health problems including infections, high fever, running nose, cough until wheezing, an upper tract lung infection, breathlessness, anaphylactic allergic reaction, obesity arthritis hormonal imbalance high uric acid, and constipation without any medication or exercise. True healing means eliminating toxins, never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! Correct treatment method heals but wrong treatment method kills! I posted proofs including a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication. No expensive ventilators were required. Zero death! I urge the leaders all over the world to contact Jessica Seah at aceofaceent@yahoo.com if they want to swiftly end this unprecedented global pandemic without any dire consequences! Recognise scientific approach has failed miserably in tackling COVID 19! It is time to change the strategy that will not need lockdown or social distancing to cause physical and mental sufferings plus astronomical monetary loss!🇸🇬",2020-04-29T05:04:15.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_hEv_OnzOf/,2020-04-28T07:50:31.000Z,"It’s Day 22 of the Circuit Breaker.

31,elimeredithmd,"Oh hi SINGOV! Well, I got up at noon today and am still unshowered because I watched Netflix from night till 6am. I only stopped because my phone ran out of battery. We really need to make our own TV shows just as addictive as Netflix @nacsingapore 👀. I will now proceed with my day by playing an equally addictive video game on my PC. You should try it too! It’s a completely immersive experience and you totally lose track of time! I’ve tried not to get into arguments with family members. Unfortunately, that didn’t go very well today — argued with my mum over the bad software she uploaded into my 🧠 as a kid. Um, I would like to dedicate a song to all residents of Singapore in these times when entropy is really setting in. It’s an old song by Green Day — it’s called WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS.
