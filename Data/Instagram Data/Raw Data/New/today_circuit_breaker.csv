‘’Having divorced parents who both remarried new partners may mean getting twice the hongbao money, but I also have twice the number of relatives to visit.’’

‘’I will not lie. When the Government announced that family gatherings should be kept to a minimum this Chinese New Year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I heaved a heavy sigh of relief...’’

‘’I will not lie. When the Government announced that family gatherings should be kept to a minimum this Chinese New Year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I heaved a heavy sigh of relief...’’

“Back then, I thought the country’s borders would only be closed for 14 days. I remember being in tears crossing the Causeway, feeling confused and directionless,’’ he says. 

💔The separation from loved ones in Malaysia, including his girlfriend, was worsened by a bout of dengue fever last June. Many of Mr Wong’s personal plans have been put on hold, including his proposal to his girlfriend. 

“I also haven’t visited my parents for two years. This pandemic has made me realise that I should cherish every moment of separation and the people around me,’’ he says.

In January this year, Amos returned to Singapore when the Covid-19 outbreak began worsening in China. The 31-year-old chose to go home for his young daughter Kirsten, now four. 

His wife Laura Ooi, 32, a flight attendant, also had her job disrupted as flights were mostly grounded due to Covid-19 travel restrictions. To support themselves and their kid, the couple decided to start a home-based business during the Circuit Breaker selling hei piah, Hokkien-style deep-fried fritters with whole, shell-on prawns.

Absent from the gathering: singer Tabitha Nauser and burlesque dancer Sukki Singapora, who later joined in via a phone call from the UK.

Singapore Social @singaporesocialnetflix follows the lives of six Singaporeans — per official synopsis — “as they defy expectations and traverse the tricky terrain of career, romance and family”. The series premiered on Netflix in November 2019 to poor reviews, with most dismissing it as a Crazy Rich Asians wannabe and for misrepresenting Singapore and glorifying the cast’s vacuous lifestyles.

Four cast members — tech entrepreneur Nicole Ong, fashion influencer Mae Tan, YouTube personality Vinny Sharp and actor-model Paul Foster — got together recently to mark the show’s first anniversary. 

Absent from the gathering: singer Tabitha Nauser and burlesque dancer Sukki Singapora, who later joined in via a phone call from the UK.

Singapore Social @singaporesocialnetflix follows the lives of six Singaporeans — per official synopsis — “as they defy expectations and traverse the tricky terrain of career, romance and family”. The series premiered on Netflix in November 2019 to poor reviews, with most dismissing it as a Crazy Rich Asians wannabe and for misrepresenting Singapore and glorifying the cast’s vacuous lifestyles.

Said Vinny, in response to the brickbats thrown at them: “It’s impossible to bequeath the responsibility [of representing the culture of an entire nation] to six individuals. They wanted to see themselves in us because they felt our lifestyle, or just the way we spoke, did not necessarily resonate with most people and that was the reason to scrutinise and demonise us.”

Despite a pandemic and an economic recession, it has been a surprising year for the property market. 

Property buyers began snapping up new homes as soon as the circuit breaker eased and they could visit showrooms again, contributing to a seesawing of private home sale numbers in the final months of the year as government regulations kicked in to cool the market.

In June, the same month that Singapore entered Phase One of its circuit breaker exit, private home sales hit a peak not seen since more than two years ago.

Some real estate agents said 2020 was one of their best years. One, Mr Timothy Chen, said his sales revenue doubled this year from last year. Many of his clients are young buyers in their late 20s to early 30s who purchased private property.

Dari tak tau apa pasal aquaculture belajar sampai kenal dan tau setiap karekter , tahun semangat tank nampak cantik je, algae sikit je terus treatment, tahun malas, biar sampai naik semak samun penghuni kat dalam pun tak nampak, bila semangat datang balik, buat maintenance , trim pokok, tukar lighting , refill co2 , reset timer, tukar canister filter, masuk kan species baru, yang lama ada yang beranak pinak. 2010 tempoh untuk pertandingan ambil masa 3 tahun, tank yang matured,  lighting yang betul akan beri panorama yang kita nakkan, submit je gambar , bila tgok competitor lain gempak2 memang memberi inspirasi.

Unable to travel abroad, hobbyists in their 20s and 30s are finding beauty and serenity in creating underwater gardens, which are sometimes inhabited by fish, shrimps or snails.

Mr Jason Toh, 56, owner of That Aquarium, who has stores in Changi, Yishun and Clementi, said that 70 per cent of his new customers since the circuit breaker period are in their 20s and 30s. More surprisingly, about half of them are women. 

He said: “Aquascaping used to be an ‘uncle’ hobby, but not anymore. Now, they can design their tanks with different plants, rocks or wood.”

Hobbyist Joel Soh, 24, says: ""It took me two months to get the water temperature and nitrate level right — it was like a science experiment. Once I got it right, it looked like a piece of living art.”

Her husband, Daryl Lim Chun Leng, 25, proposed to her to annul their marriage on the basis that it had not been consummated, as it would cheaper to do so and they could avoid being branded as divorcees. An annulment would also void the marriage immediately.

He came up with this plan, even though the truth was that they had consensual sex several times after they got married. Investigations also revealed that the couple continued having consensual sex even after an interim judgment for annulment was granted.

He is now back in Singapore. 

Lee Teng and his 28-year-old Taiwanese wife, Gina Lin, went through the worst kind of heartbreak in July when she suffered a miscarriage six months into her pregnancy. The tragedy happened when Lee Teng was in Singapore and Gina, in Taiwan — she had flown back home that same month to prepare for the birth — but COVID-19 travel restrictions and unfinished work here meant that he only saw her a month later. 

When @8dayssg broaches the topic of the miscarriage, Lee says: ""I'm a very optimistic person, so I was more concerned about my wife... After all, she's the one who carried [the baby] and I'm sure she felt the loss a lot more than I did.""
 
He adds that he and Gina have since come to terms with the tragedy. ""[Losing a child] is something you can't ever recover from. You just have to accept [that it happened] and move on.

Lee Teng and his 28-year-old Taiwanese wife, Gina Lin, went through the worst kind of heartbreak in July when she suffered a miscarriage six months into her pregnancy. The tragedy happened when Lee Teng was in Singapore and Gina, in Taiwan — she had flown back home that same month to prepare for the birth — but COVID-19 travel restrictions and unfinished work here meant that he only saw her a month later. 

When @8dayssg broaches the topic of the miscarriage, Lee says: ""I'm a very optimistic person, so I was more concerned about my wife... After all, she's the one who carried [the baby] and I'm sure she felt the loss a lot more than I did.""
 
He adds that he and Gina have since come to terms with the tragedy. ""[Losing a child] is something you can't ever recover from. You just have to accept [that it happened] and move on.

Swedish furniture giant Ikea is opening a three-storey outlet at Jem mall in Jurong next year. But that’s not the only branch it is opening in the Jurong neighbourhood — it is also launching a “planning and renovation studio” at Jurong Point in January 2021.

But don’t expect a massive homeware shopping haven for the Jurong Point studio. It appears to be solely for interior design consultancy, as it occupies a modest two-unit space near a McDonald’s outlet.

According to the store hoarding, which is still up, the studio is a collaboration with Bangalore-based interior design firm Livspace. On Livspace’s website, it calls itself Ikea’s “official renovation partner in Singapore”, and customers can head to Ikea’s existing two outlets at Alexandra and Tampines for a free consultation with an interior designer.

18,iz.syrao2o,"This study is not true. Actually divorce does have good affects on the children, depending on what the cause of divorce is. If the parents divorce, for example, because the father took drugs, abusive, neglecting of family  or the father cheated, then divorce is the best solution for the children's future so to not affect them. Similar if it's the mother, divorce is a good solution. The only reason is won't be a good solution is if the parents blame the child for their divorce. If not, the child has a brighter future because when their parents divorce, the child is out of the toxic environment. My sister and I are children of divorce parents and we're living with our mother. Yet we turn out fine because we are both away from the toxic environment. So in my opinion and experience, this study proves nothing but nonsense. Divorce does have a good affect on children if the child is trapped in a toxic environment",2020-12-19T13:50:17.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIxsdKgAXCk/,2020-12-14T11:27:52.000Z,"A study of 9,000 Singaporeans with divorced parents found that they faced a long-term “divorce penalty” — they were less likely to obtain a university degree and more likely to earn less in their careers.

On the first day of the Singles' Day online shopping bonanza in October, Viya secured 5.32 billion yuan (US$814 million) in sales, Chinese media reported.

With live online shopping continuing to gain momentum, Viya, who has collaborated with American reality television star Kim Kardashian and singer Taylor Swift, is tipped to see her fortune rise even further.

After his colleague contracted Covid-19, Soh Poh Tiong was ordered to return home, but he decided to travel around Singapore instead. 

Even after Ministry of Health (MOH) officials served Soh a home quarantine order, he repeatedly breached it, taking public transportation for hours every day, and interacted with staff members while paying his bills at the HDB Hub in Toa Payoh. On one of the days, he spent more than 10 hours on several buses from Ang Mo Kio and back.

He had been told not to leave even to get food, and that he should either use a mobile application or get friends or family to buy food for him. He had acknowledged this and signed on the quarantine order.

When asked if he had anything to say in mitigation, he told the court in Mandarin: “Talk also no use, I was wrong already… I had no other choice.”

Chia Teck Huat, 41, placed mini cameras inside his bag and went around shopping malls in search of middle-aged female office workers in short skirts, court documents said.

He would delete the clips if they did not capture footage of the victims’ underwear. If he was successful, he would return home, copy the files to his personal electronic devices, organise the files by dates and label them in order.

His lawyers had said in mitigation, that: ""He was actually relieved that he was caught by the police as he knew that his behaviour was obsessive and compulsive, and that he was unable to control himself.""

The defence previously told the court that Chia had difficulties in his marriage and his mother was suffering from late-stage cancer, with Chia experiencing ""tremendous stress and anxiety"". He began experimenting with taking upskirt videos, saying they helped relieve his stress, and his urges were ""triggered when he saw girls in short skirts"".

He would delete the clips if they did not capture footage of the victims’ underwear. If he was successful, he would return home, copy the files to his personal electronic devices, organise the files by dates and label them in order.

His lawyers had said in mitigation, that: ""He was actually relieved that he was caught by the police as he knew that his behaviour was obsessive and compulsive, and that he was unable to control himself.""

The defence previously told the court that Chia had difficulties in his marriage and his mother was suffering from late-stage cancer, with Chia experiencing ""tremendous stress and anxiety"". He began experimenting with taking upskirt videos, saying they helped relieve his stress, and his urges were ""triggered when he saw girls in short skirts"".

The judge noted that Chia attended 34 counselling sessions and has not reoffended since his arrest.

Felicia Chin has had to tone down her ultra-bubbly side considerably on the set of her latest 9pm Mediacorp drama A Jungle Survivor, in which she plays the tough and icy Olivia. 

Olivia is a controversial character because she is the third party in Pierre Png and Rebecca Lim’s troubled onscreen marriage. And a rather brazen and unapologetic one, at that.

Says Chin: “While I don’t always agree with the characters, like for example, I don’t understand why a woman would want to be a mistress like Olivia, it’s my responsibility as an actress to go into her world and try to understand her without judging her too quickly.”

From the show, she has also been reminded of the importance of investing time and effort into a marriage, as well as proper communication.

“It’s not a one-off thing where you paktor, get married, and then that’s it, you just let go. You really need to put in time and effort to work at it, and when cracks start to show, you don’t give up, but keep choosing to love the other party and talk about it.”

For someone whose business has bled almost S$2mil, Teo Heng KTV founder Jackson Teo is still smiling. 

He had to temporarily close all his 14 outlets for the Covid-19 circuit breaker in April this year, and suffers losses for every month that his karaoke chain is non-operational.“When you’ve lost so much money and you’re waiting for your reopening applications to be approved, would you be able to smile?” the 62-year-old asks us rhetorically. 

Still, he exclaims: “Don’t focus on the negative things. If you keep talking about negative things, you’ll get a headache!” 

He tells @8dayssg that if his business woes continue, he is prepared to downsize his family home, a landed property in the Bayshore neighbourhood, to save the company. He had prepared S$2mil worth of funds for his family-run biz to tide over the pandemic. But Jackson’s younger sister Jean Teo, 54, divulges that the chain is now on its last leg for reserves. 

To stretch its reserves, @teohengofficial is planning to reopen with a new concept: As a snack bar-cum-working/study space. Jackson says, “If the government approves, we are likely to reopen in one to two weeks.” There’s a catch to this, though. There will be no karaoke singing allowed, as Teo Heng can’t operate as a karaoke lounge… till January.

For someone whose business has bled almost S$2mil, Teo Heng KTV founder Jackson Teo is still smiling. 

He had to temporarily close all his 14 outlets for the Covid-19 circuit breaker in April this year, and suffers losses for every month that his karaoke chain is non-operational.“When you’ve lost so much money and you’re waiting for your reopening applications to be approved, would you be able to smile?” the 62-year-old asks us rhetorically. 

Still, he exclaims: “Don’t focus on the negative things. If you keep talking about negative things, you’ll get a headache!” 

He tells @8dayssg that if his business woes continue, he is prepared to downsize his family home, a landed property in the Bayshore neighbourhood, to save the company. He had prepared S$2mil worth of funds for his family-run biz to tide over the pandemic. But Jackson’s younger sister Jean Teo, 54, divulges that the chain is now on its last leg for reserves. 

To stretch its reserves, @teohengofficial is planning to reopen with a new concept: As a snack bar-cum-working/study space. Jackson says, “If the government approves, we are likely to reopen in one to two weeks.” There’s a catch to this, though. There will be no karaoke singing allowed, as Teo Heng can’t operate as a karaoke lounge… till January.

For someone whose business has bled almost S$2mil, Teo Heng KTV founder Jackson Teo is still smiling. 

He had to temporarily close all his 14 outlets for the Covid-19 circuit breaker in April this year, and suffers losses for every month that his karaoke chain is non-operational.“When you’ve lost so much money and you’re waiting for your reopening applications to be approved, would you be able to smile?” the 62-year-old asks us rhetorically. 

Still, he exclaims: “Don’t focus on the negative things. If you keep talking about negative things, you’ll get a headache!” 

He tells @8dayssg that if his business woes continue, he is prepared to downsize his family home, a landed property in the Bayshore neighbourhood, to save the company. He had prepared S$2mil worth of funds for his family-run biz to tide over the pandemic. But Jackson’s younger sister Jean Teo, 54, divulges that the chain is now on its last leg for reserves. 

To stretch its reserves, @teohengofficial is planning to reopen with a new concept: As a snack bar-cum-working/study space. Jackson says, “If the government approves, we are likely to reopen in one to two weeks.” There’s a catch to this, though. There will be no karaoke singing allowed, as Teo Heng can’t operate as a karaoke lounge… till January.

For someone whose business has bled almost S$2mil, Teo Heng KTV founder Jackson Teo is still smiling. 

He had to temporarily close all his 14 outlets for the Covid-19 circuit breaker in April this year, and suffers losses for every month that his karaoke chain is non-operational.“When you’ve lost so much money and you’re waiting for your reopening applications to be approved, would you be able to smile?” the 62-year-old asks us rhetorically. 

Still, he exclaims: “Don’t focus on the negative things. If you keep talking about negative things, you’ll get a headache!” 

He tells @8dayssg that if his business woes continue, he is prepared to downsize his family home, a landed property in the Bayshore neighbourhood, to save the company. He had prepared S$2mil worth of funds for his family-run biz to tide over the pandemic. But Jackson’s younger sister Jean Teo, 54, divulges that the chain is now on its last leg for reserves. 

To stretch its reserves, @teohengofficial is planning to reopen with a new concept: As a snack bar-cum-working/study space. Jackson says, “If the government approves, we are likely to reopen in one to two weeks.” There’s a catch to this, though.

One of the six fined is 29-year-old Singaporean Natalie Joanna Sarkies, who posted photographs of the group gathering on Instagram. The photos showed it was a planned outing as they either had their face masks pulled down or were not wearing masks, the court heard. 

The five others who were fined are British nationals.

The court heard that the group took a ferry from mainland Singapore to St John’s Island on Aug 8 at about 11am. They then walked to the beach along Lazarus Island, which has a land connection to St John’s Island, and engaged in various leisure activities together. At 6pm, they took a ferry back to mainland Singapore.

”Their conduct belittles the tremendous efforts and sacrifices of the vast majority, who have, among many things, given up the pleasures of social interaction with family and friends for the public good to contain the spread of Covid-19,"" said the prosecutor.

“Now I know how my dad feels,” Vernon quipped during his phone interview with @8dayssg this morning (Nov 24). “I also come from a family with three boys, so it looks like the genes are really strong. We were hoping for a girl but it’s okay, I don’t mind three boys.”

Now, about the names of his two youngest sons (at least, to those who are familiar with young UK pop heartthrobs), Vernon clarified that it is totally a coincidence that they share the same first names as two members of One Direction, Liam Payne and Niall Horan.

Lynn, who works in the finance field, was “happy and relieved” when the bilateral arrangement of an air travel bubble between the two cities was announced on Nov 11.

But just a few days before she was set to reunite with her family on Dec 4, the bubble was postponed on Nov 21 due to a sudden rise in Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong. The travel bubble had been slated to start on Sunday (Nov 22), with one flight departing each city per day carrying up to 200 people per flight.

“I am devastated, not disappointed. I am heartbroken. I am not going for fun. This is important to me,” said Lynn, who was supposed to return to Singapore on Jan 4. She saved all her annual leave days for the trip.

“I was looking forward to seeing my parents who are ageing, seeing my nephew who is growing up,” she said. “I’m also losing money with existing administrative stuff I can’t deal with from here.” This includes paying rent and keeping her apartment in Hong Kong for longer than originally planned...

“This has been the longest I have not seen my parents for all of my life,” said the 43-year-old Employment Pass (EP) holder (*she declined to reveal her real name for fear of complications with her work pass). She is unmarried with no dependents or family here.

Lynn, who works in the finance field, was “happy and relieved” when the bilateral arrangement of an air travel bubble between the two cities was announced on Nov 11.

But just a few days before she was set to reunite with her family on Dec 4, the bubble was postponed on Nov 21 due to a sudden rise in Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong. The travel bubble had been slated to start on Sunday (Nov 22), with one flight departing each city per day carrying up to 200 people per flight.

“I am devastated, not disappointed. I am heartbroken. I am not going for fun. This is important to me,” said Lynn, who was supposed to return to Singapore on Jan 4. She saved all her annual leave days for the trip.

“I was looking forward to seeing my parents who are ageing, seeing my nephew who is growing up,” she said. “I’m also losing money with existing administrative stuff I can’t deal with from here.” This includes paying rent and keeping her apartment in Hong Kong for longer than originally planned...

Lhamo, a Tibetan farmer in southwestern China, divorced her husband in March this year. But he forced her to remarry him, threatening to kill their children if she refused. The couple remarried, but he did not stop abusing her.

Lhamo refused to live with the abuse, and filed for divorce again. The court granted the couple's second divorce, and Lhamo retreated deep in the mountains with their two sons. 

She documented her days on Douyin, (the Chinese version of the TikTok app) posting videos of herself cooking, singing and picking herbs in the mountains around her village. By this fall, she had about 200,000 followers, many of whom praised her as cheerful and hardworking.

Over 400 of her followers were watching one evening in mid-September as Lhamo, 30, streamed a video live from her kitchen on Douyin. Suddenly, a man stormed in and Lhamo screamed. Then, the screen went dark.

The police are investigating Lhamo’s ex-husband on suspicion that he doused her with gasoline and set her on fire. He had burned almost all of her skin off. 

Lhamo died two weeks later.

Lhamo, a Tibetan farmer in southwestern China, divorced her husband in March this year. But he forced her to remarry him, threatening to kill their children if she refused. The couple remarried, but he did not stop abusing her.

Lhamo refused to live with the abuse, and filed for divorce again. The court granted the couple's second divorce, and Lhamo retreated deep in the mountains with their two sons. 

She documented her days on Douyin, (the Chinese version of the TikTok app) posting videos of herself cooking, singing and picking herbs in the mountains around her village. By this fall, she had about 200,000 followers, many of whom praised her as cheerful and hardworking.

Over 400 of her followers were watching one evening in mid-September as Lhamo, 30, streamed a video live from her kitchen on Douyin. Suddenly, a man stormed in and Lhamo screamed. Then, the screen went dark.

The police are investigating Lhamo’s ex-husband on suspicion that he doused her with gasoline and set her on fire. He had burned almost all of her skin off.

Lhamo, a Tibetan farmer in southwestern China, divorced her husband in March this year. But he forced her to remarry him, threatening to kill their children if she refused. The couple remarried, but he did not stop abusing her.

Lhamo refused to live with the abuse, and filed for divorce again. The court granted the couple's second divorce, and Lhamo retreated deep in the mountains with their two sons. 

She documented her days on Douyin, (the Chinese version of the TikTok app) posting videos of herself cooking, singing and picking herbs in the mountains around her village. By this fall, she had about 200,000 followers, many of whom praised her as cheerful and hardworking.

Over 400 of her followers were watching one evening in mid-September as Lhamo, 30, streamed a video live from her kitchen on Douyin. Suddenly, a man stormed in and Lhamo screamed. Then, the screen went dark.

The police are investigating Lhamo’s ex-husband on suspicion that he doused her with gasoline and set her on fire. He had burned almost all of her skin off. 

Lhamo died two weeks later.

Lhamo, a Tibetan farmer in southwestern China, divorced her husband in March this year. But he forced her to remarry him, threatening to kill their children if she refused. The couple remarried, but he did not stop abusing her.

Lhamo refused to live with the abuse, and filed for divorce again. The court granted the couple's second divorce, and Lhamo retreated deep in the mountains with their two sons. 

She documented her days on Douyin, (the Chinese version of the TikTok app) posting videos of herself cooking, singing and picking herbs in the mountains around her village. By this fall, she had about 200,000 followers, many of whom praised her as cheerful and hardworking.

Over 400 of her followers were watching one evening in mid-September as Lhamo, 30, streamed a video live from her kitchen on Douyin. Suddenly, a man stormed in and Lhamo screamed. Then, the screen went dark.

The police are investigating Lhamo’s ex-husband on suspicion that he doused her with gasoline and set her on fire. He had burned almost all of her skin off. 

Lhamo died two weeks later.

He is among more than 300,000 migrant workers in Singapore who have endured lockdown-like conditions since April.

Now, six months later, he and his dormitory mates are only just starting to sense that they may get some reprieve.

While the wider community here is gradually having some normality as they go about their lives, Mr Shermaraja and many migrant workers remain indoors, save for work and essential errands. As part of the measures to ease restrictions for migrant workers to stay safe within and outside the dormitories, from Oct 31, workers who have recovered and those who have tested negative recently under a rostered routine testing regime are allowed to visit recreation centres on their rest days — at staggered time slots. 

Mr Shermaraja gave TODAY a glimpse into his life since returning to work last month after being cooped up for almost half a year. He also talked about his fears battling an invisible enemy — he had no symptoms when he was infected with the coronavirus back in June — as well as his grim encounters with depressed, suicidal workers.

More surprisingly, about half of them are women. He said: “Aquascaping used to be an ‘uncle’ hobby, but not anymore. Now, they can design their tanks with different plants, rocks or wood.”

Hobbyist Joel Soh, 24, says: ""It took me two months to get the water temperature and nitrate level right — it was like a science experiment. Once I got it right, it looked like a piece of living art.”

That holiday to Hong Kong could be on the horizon for us in Singapore, with the Singapore-Hong Kong air travel bubble (ATB) set to take off on Nov 22. 

Travellers in both places will be able to travel between the cities, with no restrictions on purpose of travel or the need for a controlled itinerary. Plus, there is no need to quarantine or serve a stay-home notice.

Here’s the thing, though. Folks who are planning to travel under the ATB should know that it’s no longer just a matter of booking a flight and a hotel and jetting off for that long-awaited vacay. Nope, there are Covid-19 tests to take (three in total), a limited number of flights you can book, and a heap of other factors to take into account.

Here are some things to note before you fly: 
#1: Ensure that you’re eligible to travel under the ATB. Who's eligible? Anyone who’s stayed in Singapore or Hongkong for the last 14 consecutive days can travel to either city. There are some exceptions: Work permit and S-Pass holders working in construction, marine shipyard or process sectors in Singapore cannot travel under the ATB.

#2: Apply to get a pre-departure polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test done.

#3: Book a pre-departure test in Singapore, at least 72 hours before your scheduled departure.

#4: Submit an online health declaration form before checking in for your flight to HK.

That holiday to Hong Kong could be on the horizon for us in Singapore, with the Singapore-Hong Kong air travel bubble (ATB) set to take off on Nov 22. 

Travellers in both places will be able to travel between the cities, with no restrictions on purpose of travel or the need for a controlled itinerary. Plus, there is no need to quarantine or serve a stay-home notice.

Here’s the thing, though. Folks who are planning to travel under the ATB should know that it’s no longer just a matter of booking a flight and a hotel and jetting off for that long-awaited vacay. Nope, there are Covid-19 tests to take (three in total), a limited number of flights you can book, and a heap of other factors to take into account.

Here are some things to note before you fly: 
#1: Ensure that you’re eligible to travel under the ATB. Who's eligible? Anyone who’s stayed in Singapore or Hongkong for the last 14 consecutive days can travel to either city. There are some exceptions: Work permit and S-Pass holders working in construction, marine shipyard or process sectors in Singapore cannot travel under the ATB.

He has not seen her since the end of last year. 

Yesterday, in a matter of hours, airfares for flights from two designated carriers — Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Cathay Pacific — shot up, by more than three times in some cases.

This happened after the announcement yesterday that all forms of travel between Singapore and Hong Kong will be allowed from Nov 22. The bilateral arrangement of an air travel bubble between the two cities and the start date was announced at 10am by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.

At 11am, a check on the Singapore Airlines’ website showed that it was S$324.50 for a one-way ticket on Nov 22 on an SQ890 flight — one of the designated aircraft under the travel bubble arrangement. 

However, a few hours later at 3pm, the airfare for the same route had jumped to S$816.50, and the website indicated that there were four seats left at that price. By 7pm, the tickets between Nov 22 and 28 were all fully booked.

McDonald's had already tested out a plant-based burger in Canada in cooperation with the company Beyond Meat, which specialises in vegan meat substitutes.

The new line will be produced exclusively for McDonald's, and will be introduced in selected markets next year. The restaurant chain has not yet said if it will renew its collaboration with Beyond Meat.

McDonald's told investors it was also considering plant-based substitutes for chicken products and for its egg and bacon breakfast sandwiches.

Fast food giant McDonald's announced yesterday that it was launching a new plant-based burger to cater to the growing number of people who do not eat meat.

McDonald's had already tested out a plant-based burger in Canada in cooperation with the company Beyond Meat, which specialises in vegan meat substitutes.

The new line will be produced exclusively for McDonald's, and will be introduced in selected markets next year. The restaurant chain has not yet said if it will renew its collaboration with Beyond Meat.

McDonald's told investors it was also considering plant-based substitutes for chicken products and for its egg and bacon breakfast sandwiches.

Will beloved classics like the Big Mac, McNuggets and French fries still be on the menu?

Singapore is experiencing a hiking boom of late. Leisure travellers who would usually be jetsetting to scenic spots around the world are turning into domestic hikers overnight. This comes as Covid-19 travel restrictions remain, forcing people to turn to the nature spots in their backyard.

Without going into the numbers, the National Parks Board @nparksbuzz told TODAY that it has seen a “significant increase” in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves here since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Validating this trend is the number of people who have joined the Singapore Hikers Facebook group since the circuit breaker ended on June 1. The group, which had been around since 2018, had about 2,000 members then, but boomed from August, with its membership surpassing 20,000 by end of last month.

Earlier this week, the actor started a 14-day quarantine in Taiwan at a hotel with his wife Catherine Ng.

That apparently doesn’t leave them with a lot of time to twiddle their thumbs... or to make Baby Number Four, as one of Catherine’s friends coyly suggested to her. The couple have three kids: Calista, 12, Maksonn, nine, and Calynn, seven.

The awards are often referred to as the ‘Oscars of Asia’ and past winners of the Best Leading Actor award include the biggest names in Chinese entertainment, like Tony Leung (both Chiu Wai and Ka Fai), Andy Lau, and Jackie Chan.

Earlier this week, the actor started a 14-day quarantine in Taiwan at a hotel with his wife Catherine Ng.

But he's not sitting around munching on snacks all day long. Mark has a super-packed schedule, and his wife? “She’s very busy too,"" Mark tells @8dayssg. ""She has her Thai and Korean dramas to catch up on and she’s also exercising a lot!”

That apparently doesn’t leave them with a lot of time to twiddle their thumbs... or to make Baby Number Four, as one of Catherine’s friends coyly suggested to her. The couple have three kids: Calista, 12, Maksonn, nine, and Calynn, seven.

Last year, Star Search 2019 contestant Zhang Zetong was a customer relationship manager at Carousell, while most of the other male contenders came from modelling backgrounds.

Seeing his fellow contestants expertly carrying themselves and posing in front of the camera brought Zetong’s already “non-existent confidence even lower”, he tells @8dayssg.

But, it was Zetong who was crowned the Star Search winner. Barely a month after the finals, he landed his first leading role in his drama debut All Around You, which saw him getting to travel to Japan for filming. 

And while he previously shared that he would be taking a pay cut compared to his old job, being appointed as the celeb ambassador of big international brands Samsung @samsung_sg, Audi @audisingapore, and Senka @senkasg seems to have helped to beef up his bank account - he says his pay is now “comparable” to what he used to make. 

Then, COVID-19 struck, bringing the entertainment industry to a standstill. Zetong spent the circuit breaker cooped up at home alone — he is Malaysian and his parents live in JB — and passed the time by creating his own Instagram filter, learning how to make cold brew coffee, taking on fitness challenges, and reading the scripts for his latest drama A Jungle Survivor.

Apart from fellow Star Search pals, he counts @chantalleng @shanepowxp @regene.lim and @thedesmondtan as friends, and is grateful for chats with veteran stars like @zoetay10 and @chenhanwei1969.

You knew exactly what i wanted, to thank you so much @forex_guru_signalz",2020-10-31T04:27:58.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CG_Yldngz0q/,2020-10-31T02:00:49.000Z,"Hougang, a housing estate of many 'firsts'. 

It is home to Singapore’s first McDonald’s in a housing estate, and is also the first housing estate to have a bowling alley and an all-entertainment complex.

These are just some of the many little-known golden nuggets of Hougang, which visitors can now discover for themselves thanks to the new Hougang Heritage Trail. 

Launched earlier this week by @nhb_sg, the trail comprises three thematic, self-guided routes: Landmarks of Hougang, Institutions of Service and Architectural Gems. Each route takes between one hour and one hour 45 minutes to complete with public transport.

Look out for a gigantic rainbow mural painted on Block 316 at Hougang Ave 7; places of worship such Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a national monument; and heritage businesses like Cheong Ann Watch Maker, which has been around for generations.

Chia Teck Huat, 41, bought mini cameras online, modified them so they were concealed within a laptop bag, and used them to take upskirt videos of women in various malls. 

Now married with a one-year-old son and working as a part-time deliveryman, Chia was a “well-respected lecturer at ITE” at the time of his offences in 2017, his lawyers said.

They added that his marriage was “filled with difficulties”, and that his mother was suffering from advanced cancer around 2017, which gave him “tremendous stress and anxiety”.

31,vino.16,"People wonder why women need laws to protect them. if this isnt one of many or countless evidences, i dunno wat is. How often do we read of women filming guys in toilets or in changing rooms or anywhere in public? How often? The idea of equality is not just about equality in opportunities based on merit but equality in feeling safe wherever one is. It may be 21st century, but even till today the vulnerable parties during war or otherwise, r still perceived or even defined as children, women and the elderly. There is a reason for that. Women can be considered to be “spoils of war.” If during non-war time already every other day who knows which random guy (not all) cld be filming u, imagine if captured during war? Ur guess is as good as mine. No more “huat ah” for u, chia teck huat. To prison, u go. There r many ways to seek release from stress. And this is ur excuse?

In its statement, the Catholic Church said the Pope’s remarks are “not considered or admissible as an official papal teaching”.

The Church also defined the Catholic understanding of marriage as “the sacrament by which a baptised man and a baptised woman bind themselves for life in lawful marriage”.

“What is legal in society is not necessarily moral or licit for Catholics in the teaching of the Church,” the statement added.

The Atlantic Sports club, a gym in the southern city of Krakow, has dubbed itself a church in a bid to stay open under new anti-virus restrictions.

The creative rebranding follows the government's decision to shut down most pools and gyms in order to stem a recent surge in coronavirus infections, leading some in the fitness industry scrambling for creative loopholes. 

Church services are still allowed to go ahead in the devout Catholic country of 38 million people, as long as the faithful wear masks and abide by the attendance limit.

Your tickets to the land of egg tarts, milk tea, and dim sum for days, that is. 

Travellers here will soon be able to make leisure trips to Hong Kong without needing to complete a quarantine or stay-home notice period. 

This is the first such travel arrangement that Singapore has established since the two cities collectively shut their borders due to Covid-19.

The arrangement is part of a new in-principle agreement between the two cities which will help to revive cross-border air travel between the two countries in a “safe and progressive way”, said the Ministry of Transport (MOT) in a press release on Thursday (Oct 15).

But shortly after joining the new firm, he found out that his wife was having an extramarital affair. He offered her a second chance but she rebuffed it.

He went into an emotional turmoil, and began drinking heavily. Later on, he began taking meth as he found it stabilised his volatile emotions and stress.

When he met his current wife in late 2017, he stopped taking drugs, but relapsed in 2018 after finding out his ex-wife had remarried. He used meth to stop his “spiral of emotional turbulence” brought on by her betrayal, the judge noted. 

In March 2018, he was caught at Woodlands Checkpoint with several drug utensils and a packet of at least 1.65g of meth in his car. Authorities also found 10 slabs of Erimin-5 tablets.

While international travel is pretty much a distant dream for now, former Mediacorp host Sharon Au recently flew from Singapore back to Paris, where she's been based for the past couple of years.
 
She had been back in town in July to vote in this year’s General Election as well as to celebrate her 45th birthday and catch up with her mum and friends.

Sharon flew to London last month to serve a 14-day quarantine with her two godsons, who are studying in the UK, before heading to Paris to reunite with her cat Rudon. 

She had brought Rudon home for only a few days before her trip to Singapore, and had to entrust the cat in the care of her two Taiwanese friends. 

Recalling her journey home to see Rudon, she says: “I was grinning like a fool throughout the two-hour [train ride from London to Paris]. Fortunately, I had a mask to cover my silly face!”

While international travel is pretty much a distant dream for now, former Mediacorp host Sharon Au recently flew from Singapore back to Paris, where she's been based for the past couple of years.
 
She had been back in town in July to vote in this year’s General Election as well as to celebrate her 45th birthday and catch up with her mum and friends.

Sharon flew to London last month to serve a 14-day quarantine with her two godsons, who are studying in the UK, before heading to Paris to reunite with her cat Rudon. 

She had brought Rudon home for only a few days before her trip to Singapore, and had to entrust the cat in the care of her two Taiwanese friends. 

Recalling her journey home to see Rudon, she says: “I was grinning like a fool throughout the two-hour [train ride from London to Paris]. Fortunately, I had a mask to cover my silly face!”

The training of recruits was suspended for seven weeks when the circuit breaker to restrict activities was implemented in April to curb the spread of the coronavirus, and resumed in late May with safety measures in place. 

This includes, among other things, twice-daily temperature taking, mandatory washing of hands before and after every meal and the frequent disinfection of common areas. In May, the SAF implemented Swab and Send Home — a programme to test for Covid-19.

These are people who typically do not reach out for aid, such as young couples or those living in private properties.

But during this pandemic, they have asked for support to get food.

In the first nine months of this year, non-profit group Food from the Heart revealed that the number of households receiving aid from its food distribution programmes has jumped by 50 per cent, from about 6,000 in January to 9,000 in September. 

The Food Bank Singapore, a charity that does food distribution, also told TODAY that over the two-month circuit breaker period in April and May when stay-home curbs were imposed, it distributed 560 tonnes of food. This is already more than half of the 802 tonnes it distributed in the whole of last year.

The enterprising couple has been running their own online diamond simulant jewellery label, Éclat by Oui @eclatbyoui , when they decided to set up a food biz. 

Chu Collagen offers just one star product, a chicken-based Premium Collagen Soup Pack which is sold on their website. Come September 28, the soup will also be sold exclusively at FairPrice Finest supermarkets.

The couple is working on “two to three more soup flavours”, one of which will be launched “at the end of October”.

Other than setting up Chu Collagen, Ethel and Peter are also expecting a sibling for their 22-month-old son, Flynn Lau. Says Peter, “My wife and I conceived two babies during the Circuit Breaker (laughs).”

They were taken to hospital with injuries including fractured ribs, open leg wounds and a fractured shin bone.

One of the victims continues to undergo psychological counselling for post-traumatic stress disorder. She still has limited knee movement and a pending ligament reconstruction surgery.

Investigations showed that Mr Lim Wei Sheng, 27, had travelled between 96kmh and 102kmh a few seconds before the crash. The stretch of road he was on had a speed limit of 50kmh.

Actor Ben Yeo soft-launched his new chee cheong fun business over a month ago, and his steamed rice rolls have been selling like hot cakes.

Simply named Singapore Chee Cheong Fun (SGCCF), the online biz is a partnership with local heritage brand Kwong Woh Hing, which specialises in artisanal soy sauces. SGCCF only offers one product: a chee cheong fun kit.

This “atas” CCF kit is priced at $28, and each set consists of 10 handmade rice rolls, a packet of toasted sesame seeds and five artisanal sauces — soya sauce, sweet sauce, peanut sauce, fragrant oil and sambal chilli. You are meant to mix all the condiments together according to the instructions provided to get the full flavour experience.

How did the partnership happen? Well, Ben got to know Dickson Woo, a third-generation family member of Kwong Woh Hing, when the latter offered to send him some chee cheong fun and sauces to try during the Circuit Breaker. Being an avid home cook, he decided to “play around” with the CCF, adding his own condiments into the mix, and he hit the flavour jackpot.

“It was really good, so I asked Dickson to try this flavour that I created with his sauces as well as those from other brands and he liked it. From there, we came up with Singapore Chee Cheong Fun,” Ben tells @8dayssg @8days_eat

It was the height of the pandemic, the whole world turned into a slump. Businesses were slowing down as everyone was in lockdown and Wansho Laundry grew eerily quiet.

This was when Mr Chang decided to put a smile on his grandparents’ faces by dressing them up in some of the clothes that had been left in the laundry shop over the years, and posted them to Instagram@wantshowasyoung 

Little did he know that he was also going to brighten everybody’s day, or least the thousands of followers just around the corner.

13,by2_girls,再你们抹黑By2之前，能不能耐心地读完以下的评论再对By2下定论？兔子会很感激的哦不了解By2，请不要用语言伤害她们哟🙂By2姐妹待在中国一直都很好，有很多喜欢她们的兔子陪伴着她们，让姐妹们感到无比的温暖。姐妹们也只是把中国当成她们另一个家而不是不要新加坡这个家了哟。她们有家人有朋友在新加坡，还是会思念自己的家乡的。她们曾在节目提起新加坡美食。By2最喜欢的食物是新加坡的海南鸡饭不要饭。对于姐妹们把自己的东西搬到中国去，正因为姐妹两需要在中国工作。（By2目前正在等待中国哇唧唧哇公司发给她们邀请函好让她们可以回来中国工作）姐妹们不想在新加坡工作的原因。岁数小的姐妹们曾在新加坡的公司海蝶受欺负。因此，姐妹们直接解约了，到中国发展。中国的兔子对By2很热情，让By2感受到了家的温暖。当兔子们听说了By2要到中国的某个城市。兔子都会在机场热烈的迎接By2，给By2写信，送By2礼物。By2一直都有所保留着所有兔子送给她们的东西。身为By2粉丝的我，实在不忍心看到By2又被新加坡的朋友们欺负。拜托了，不喜欢不要伤害。轻轻划过这张文就够了。,2020-09-08T13:50:44.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CEt5rmTnH5g/,2020-09-04T14:00:54.000Z,"Twins Miko and Yumi Bai of Singaporean pop duo BY2 returned to Singapore and have been here the past few months after being stranded in the US earlier this year following Covid-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions.

The fervent customer of Durian Edition eventually became friends with the online durian store's boss.

Then, when he realised he was running out of social media content, he asked the store's boss if he could do an exclusive package for his followers.

The rest, as they say, is history. These days, the actor not only endorses the brand and promotes it on social media, but is also i/c of marketing, delivering and food tasting.

Lee Yit Huat Trading is a seafood stall in Tekka Market that has been operating for almost 30 years. It is run by Mr Alex Lee. 

During the Circuit Breaker, his business took a hit, when foot traffic was practically wiped out in the early weeks. 

Responding to the crisis, Mr Lee's son Kino stepped in and helped his father modernise the business.

13,aliciatan4,"Our immune system is our first line of defence. The role is to protect us from invaders be it germs, bacteria, viruses, pathogens, free radicals, environmental agents like microbes or chemicals etc. Another important function is its ability to repair the damaged cells. Sadly, many people unknowingly impair the immune system through wrong consumption, inhalation of carcinogens, toxic chemicals, staunch belief in the wrong concepts, and other lesser known factors! Fortunately, Jessica Seah, author of Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills, discovered the appropriate cheap food can activate the immune system to fight and subdue the pathogens, infections, diseases, free radicals and cancer cells! Our immune system is capable of reversing diseases without any man-made chemicals! It is also able to protect us from any unseen invaders. How else can the humans survive if our immune system is so poor? There are myriads of viruses, germs, bacteria, carcinogenic air pollutants, cancer causing chemicals like disinfectants, hand sanitizers, alcohol, soap, pesticides, herbicides, permissible toxins in the food and drinks?🇸🇬",2020-04-27T00:46:28.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_cni5uDsQs/,2020-04-26T14:18:22.000Z,"The national flag may be displayed with immediate effect until Sept 30, when the period marking the National Day celebrations ends, said the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY).⁣⁣

14,aliciatan4,"Read this excerpt dated July 17, 2012 Vaccines Are Causing Mutations That May Jeopardize The Health of Future GenerationsVaccines are causing an unprecedented number of mutations creating superbugs and potent viruses and bacteria that may eventually threaten future generations and humanity itself. Evidence continues to mount from the scientific community who now admit that certain vaccines are in-fact causing both viral and bacterial mutations. Ironically, the same researchers assert that ""better"" vaccines are needed to offset the rise in persistent mutations.🇸🇬",2020-04-27T00:51:04.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_cni5uDsQs/,2020-04-26T14:18:22.000Z,"The national flag may be displayed with immediate effect until Sept 30, when the period marking the National Day celebrations ends, said the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY).⁣⁣

5,aliciatan4,"Demonize COVID 19 so they can develop the vaccines to ""save"" the world! If you analyse the facts, the infected patients are killed by the HIV medicine, their existing illnesses and their equally toxic prescriptions not COVID 19! HIV medicine can trigger liver failure, pancreas failure, heart problems, an increase acid in the blood that can be fatal plus other adverse reactions! It is always the wrong treatment that kills the patients. Our unharmed immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, pathogens, diseases, free radicals and cancer cells! However , the so-called experts recommended using cancer causing agents disinfectants, hand sanitizers and alcohol to ""protect"" the population, leaving everyone more vulnerable to COVID 19! Needless to say, the infected cases quadrupled in Singapore and around the world! Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She was a victim of the horrific medicines. Subsequently, she discovered the correct diet will activate the immune system to fight and subdue any unseen enemy without any medication or exercise.True healing means eliminating toxins, never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19. We do not need poison to ""protect""or ""heal"" us. I used Whatsapp to help a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication by replicating Jessica Seah's diet and nontoxic treatment. Appropriate cheap food can activate the immune system. It is cheap, simple and very effective. No expensive ventilators or toxic chemicals like disinfectants and hand sanitizers were needed!🇸🇬",2020-04-26T08:04:38.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_bTGFshUHk/,2020-04-26T02:00:26.000Z,"On April 23, the total number of people infected with Covid-19 crossed the 10,000-mark, 91 days after the first case was reported in Singapore on Jan 23.&nbsp;⁣

15,singaporeuntold,Running without mask is fine although if they make mandatory I am fine with that too as a runner myself. The maids are highly social people. For me as long as they wear masks and keep distance I don’t mind. Because they are here by themselves and now their bosses home 24/7 cannot FaceTime their bf and chill in the day anymore. Must suck for them as well so some flexibility I think is ok within reason.,2020-04-21T06:00:23.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_NDem4p7Eg/,2020-04-20T13:14:36.000Z,"“I can still see maids walking their dogs together and people running without masks from our hotel window,” Mr Chris Tong, 34, told @todayonline by telephone from the Regent Hotel in Cuscaden Road where is serving 14 days of isolation.

16,behappy1010101,"I think it is alright to exercise outside. Our government has made it clear - Vigorous exercises, such as running, can be done without a mask. It is our own responsibility to ensure we run alone or with only one family member living in the same household, as well as to practise proper social distancing whilst on a run. There is no wrong in exercising outside and I would not consider it irresponsible to our society at all. Those who choose to do workouts at home - wonderful choice. Those who choose to continue running whilst adhering to rules properly - wonderful choice too.

And in order to want to have a clean record to increase their chances of getting converted to perm staff, most people sick also dw take MC.

Some of us even went into a frenzy.. panic buying groceries and what have you not.⁣⁣I never ever imagined that people in grocery stores would actually fight(and I mean literally fight) over toilet paper. If they hadn’t been selfish.. if they had been kind and were gracious enough to share and only buy what was needed.. no fights would have broken out. The last thing we need is to go against each other in a time like this. ⁣I think it’s important to understand that more than ever now.... STANDING UNITED is the only way we can overcome this. We also NEED to DO OUR PART, and make sure we are responsible for our health and personal hygiene. Are you washing your hands? Sanitizing? Are you taking care of your health? These are measures we need to take.⁣⁣And in times like these... Be understanding and kind to your friends, families, colleagues and neighbors. Don’t shun them away if they really are sick.

4,saynotovege,"Things haven’t been easy since we first discovered about Covid-19 a few weeks ago. Singapore and the rest of the world panicked. Some of us even went into a frenzy.. panic buying groceries and what have you not.⁣⁣I never ever imagined that people in grocery stores would actually fight(and I mean literally fight) over toilet paper. If they hadn’t been selfish.. if they had been kind and were gracious enough to share and only buy what was needed.. no fights would have broken out. The last thing we need is to go against each other in a time like this. ⁣I think it’s important to understand that more than ever now.... STANDING UNITED is the only way we can overcome this. We also NEED to DO OUR PART, and make sure we are responsible for our health and personal hygiene. Are you washing your hands? Sanitizing? Are you taking care of your health? These are measures we need to take.⁣⁣And in times like these... Be understanding and kind to your friends, families, colleagues and neighbors. Don’t shun them away if they really are sick. Our ability to show care, love and concern is what makes us human. ⁣",2020-03-17T17:52:56.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B915HTcp736/,2020-03-17T16:50:06.000Z,"Yes, Singaporeans in Malaysia can leave the country at anytime during the lockdown which is now in effect.
