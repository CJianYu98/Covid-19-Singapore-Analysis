Our jobless and experienced PMETs can fill those mid to mid high generalist jobs in finance, HR and general business management. This is not the time to indulge in MNC job rotations as it is certainly not business as usual.

1,snowbreeeze,Kudos to 🇮🇩 and 🇲🇾 for open reporting. The more cases reported now the better. We need to prevent a tsunami of cases appearing suddenly due to covering up or face value issues. 🇲🇾's agong is quarantined and openly reports so.  This is a good move.  With 🇸🇬 handling her cases well we must start considering how the neighbours will start loading us with requests for help.  Happened during 2004 boxing day tsunami...
