The vaccines were packed in thermal shipper boxes filled with dry ice designed to keep the vials at -70 degree Celsius.

Upon arrival, ground handler SATS moved the vaccines to its cold chain facility. They were then loaded onto a refrigerated truck that would send them to an external storage facility&nbsp;with capabilities to handle ultra-cold storage at about -80 degree Celsius.

Staff and logistics partners have been trained up to WHO standards to be able to handle the cargo safely.
