The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine was transported on Singapore Airlines flight SQ7979, which departed on Sunday 20 December from Brussels, and landed at Singapore Changi Airport at 7.36pm on Monday.

The vaccines were packed in thermal shipper boxes filled with dry ice designed to keep the vials at -70 degree Celsius.

Upon arrival, ground handler SATS moved the vaccines to its cold chain facility. They were then loaded onto a refrigerated truck that would send them to an external storage facility&nbsp;with capabilities to handle ultra-cold storage at about -80 degree Celsius.

Staff and logistics partners have been trained up to WHO standards to be able to handle the cargo safely.
