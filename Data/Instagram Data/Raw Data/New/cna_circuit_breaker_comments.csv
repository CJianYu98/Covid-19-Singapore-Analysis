And this is causing a lot of problems. Doctors shared they’ve been seeing a rise in patients with WFH-related injuries – whether it’s backaches or sprains – every month. Here’s how to tweak your home office setup to make you more comfortable.

LAPTOP: The best way to set up your laptop is on a table – and not balanced on your lap. Raise it by 5 to 10 inches (13cm to 25cm) with paper reams or laptop raisers to achieve the proper height.

MONITOR: If you’re using an external monitor or have two freestanding monitors at home, make sure they are of the same size and height. Place the monitors directly in front of you to avoid vision and neck problems – at least an arm’s length away (about 45cm to 70cm) at eye level.

KEYBOARD & MOUSE: Use a separate keyboard and mouse when using a laptop – preferably a low-profile keyboard not more than 3cm high and with an incline angle of less than 15 degrees to maintain your wrists’ neutral position. When typing, the elbows should be maintained at a 90-degree-to-120-degree bend with the forearms resting on the table or armrest. Your mouse should fit your palm and kept close to the keyboard.

CHAIR: If you don’t want to splurge on an ergonomic chair, get a cushion or lumbar support for your regular chair. But whatever chair you use, it should be stable and adjustable so that your knees and hips are kept at 90 degrees. Use one with armrests, a backrest, and enough height for your feet to lay flat on the floor or be supported by a footrest to reduce pressure on the thighs.

But you’ll need to be careful not to shock your body by immediately going back to your pre-CB regimen.

Inactivity means your fitness levels have gone down – culminating in weight gain if you haven’t been exercising for eight weeks. But don’t worry, fitness loss is reversible – when you start exercising regularly again, it will return.

The key is to put aside your ego, and start slow and easy. Don’t assume that you are still as fit as your old self. If you don’t feel comfortable any exercises, slow down, reduce the resistance or do fewer repetitions. As a rule of the thumb, resume your activities at half the intensity, frequency, and duration relative to what you used to do. Over the weeks, progressively step up the intensity by 10 per cent each week.

To find out if your starting point is excessive, take note of your post-exercise aches and soreness. If you do not experience any soreness or muscle aches, it is likely that you were too conservative. If you experience excessive soreness and have difficulty going about your daily activities, it is likely that you were too ambitious with your fitness routine. If the soreness is bearable and you can comfortably go about your daily activities, you have struck the right balance.

The key is to put aside your ego, and start slow and easy. Don’t assume that you are still as fit as your old self. If you don’t feel comfortable any exercises, slow down, reduce the resistance or do fewer repetitions. As a rule of the thumb, resume your activities at half the intensity, frequency, and duration relative to what you used to do. Over the weeks, progressively step up the intensity by 10 per cent each week.

To find out if your starting point is excessive, take note of your post-exercise aches and soreness. If you do not experience any soreness or muscle aches, it is likely that you were too conservative. If you experience excessive soreness and have difficulty going about your daily activities, it is likely that you were too ambitious with your fitness routine. If the soreness is bearable and you can comfortably go about your daily activities, you have struck the right balance.

But with everyone virtually connected and social norms undergoing a huge change, it might actually a good time to say hello to a former friend you've lost in touch with.

Although moments of reconnection can be powerful, we often miss out on them. The mere thought of reaching out can make us uncomfortable, ie, there's a ""reason"" you haven't talked. But in most cases, it's because we get busy, we change jobs, we move. We didn’t mean to fall out of touch. In one&nbsp;study, many people felt anxious before reconnecting, but 90 per cent reported afterward that it was fun and enjoyable.

And you've got an excuse now. “People think it will be awkward or unwanted if they pick up the phone and call an old friend they haven’t spoken to in years,” Dan Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, said. “But in this time of crisis, reaching out is even easier because there is a very natural opener:&nbsp;Calling to see if you and your family are okay?” Read more about why you should message your long-lost friend on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #friends #reconnect #relationship #advice #lifelessons #stayconnected (Photo: Pexels)"

Most hawkers aren’t on conventional delivery services such as Grab, Food Panda and Deliveroo – and many don’t even have any social media accounts. The result was the Facebook group Hawkers United – Dabao 2020, which allows hawkers to promote their food and arrange for takeaway or delivery. Since it was set up, the group has had more than 200,000 members, hawkers and patrons alike.

It’s proven so popular that spin-off groups have also been launched, such as Pasar United (for retailers) and Delivery United (for delivery folks). There’s also a Hawkers United Singapore website that groups hawker stalls based on different geographical areas to make things even easier for everyone.

12,aliciatan4,"My anaphylactic allergic reaction had worst symptoms than COVID 19. They include severe sore throat with bloody phlegm, running nose with bloody mucus, cough until wheezing, breathlessness, an upper tract lung infection, an elevated level of enzyme in my liver, high fever of 40 degree Celsius, inability to utter a word, dizziness, itchy/painful/bleeding rashes and a dangerously low level of blood pressure. My diastolic blood pressure was only 49! I posted the proofs and the doctor's remarks that I declined all medicines. My immune system reversed all the symptoms.  I do not disinfect,  sanitise, wash my hands with the toxic soap or wear the mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide, a cancer causing agent. Any product that can kill the viruses will impair our immune system and damage the organs! When the commuters coughed badly, I did not fall sick! Stop believing in the flawed scientific research.  Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She reversed all her health problems without any medication or EXERCISE! True healing means eliminating toxins, never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! It is the toxic treatments that kill the infected patients with preexisting health problems and trigger viral mutations! The doctors are treating the infected people with HIV medicine. It can cause liver and pancreas failure plus other adverse reactions! Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against pathogens, diseases, infections，free radicals and cancer cells!  I posted the proven track record of Jessica Seah's nontoxic treatment method using the correct diet! Use Jessica's method, you do not need the expensive ventilators, masks, disinfectants, alcohol, hand sanitizers and soap! I fervently hope the leaders all over the world will contact Jessica Seah at aceofaceent@yahoo.com🇸🇬",2020-04-05T12:23:39.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-lPnM7JXEd/,2020-04-05T02:11:00.000Z,"While many were out and about busy stocking up on stuff before Singapore's ""circuit breaker"" measures kick in on Apr 7, actress Rebecca Lim was also seen going around different parts of the island this weekend.
