Helmed by Pitch Perfect director Jason Moore, the film is currently being filmed in the Dominican Republic. Tan posted on her social media platforms on Feb 15 (Monday) indicating that she is already in the Dominican Republic and has since undergone her first COVID-19 test.

The Singaporean actress-writer-director will be appearing in the film alongside leads Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel (who replaced scandal-embroiled Armie Hammer) in the role of Marge, the head of the wedding resort.

Lopez and Duhamel will play the soon-to-be-wed couple who gather their lovable but very opinionated families for the ultimate destination wedding just as they themselves begin to get cold feet. Rock star and four-time Grammy award winner Kravitz will play Sean, the globetrotting ex of Lopez's character Grace.

LAPTOP: The best way to set up your laptop is on a table ‚Äì and not balanced on your lap. Raise it by 5 to 10 inches (13cm to 25cm) with paper reams or laptop raisers to achieve the proper height.

KEYBOARD & MOUSE: Use a separate keyboard and mouse when using a laptop ‚Äì preferably a low-profile keyboard not more than 3cm high and with an incline angle of less than 15 degrees to maintain your wrists‚Äô neutral position. When typing, the elbows should be maintained at a 90-degree-to-120-degree bend with the forearms resting on the table or armrest. Your mouse should fit your palm and kept close to the keyboard.

CHAIR: If you don‚Äôt want to splurge on an ergonomic chair, get a cushion or lumbar support for your regular chair. But whatever chair you use, it should be stable and adjustable so that your knees and hips are kept at 90 degrees. Use one with armrests, a backrest, and enough height for your feet to lay flat on the floor or be supported by a footrest to reduce pressure on the thighs.

But if that‚Äôs not your thing, there are still other activities you can do to feel like you‚Äôre on a holiday (or as close to one as you can get) ‚Äì or as the Singapore Tourism Board calls it, a Singapoliday.
GO ISLAND-HOPPING
Island-hopping and taking a day trip to Singapore‚Äôs outer islands is one way to escape the bustle of city life. You can charter a yacht (if you can get groups to chip in) or check out ferry schedules. There‚Äôs Lazarus Island, St John‚Äôs Island, Pulau Jong, Pulau Ubin, among others ‚Äì you can explore some of these and even have activities on the island or circle these at your leisure.
STAYCATIONS WITH BENEFITS
You can‚Äôt really get away from hotel staycations as an option ‚Äì the plus side is there‚Äôs no hassle of dealing with an unfamiliar environment, currency or transport system. Some of these hotels have tied up with tour guides for special experiences. Let‚Äôs Go Tours for example does historic trails for guests of Raffles Hotel. Monster Day Tours is organising SG55 special edition tours, and working with hotels, such as Lyf Funan. 
BOOK YOUR OWN TOURS
Alternatively, you can go directly to the tour companies ‚Äì Monster Day Tours, for example is running a ‚Äúbehind-the-scenes‚Äù tour of Changi Airport and Jewel, and Let‚Äôs Go Tours still does its bike tours if you reach out directly. 
Merchant associations will be working with the Society of Tourist Guides to develop heartland tours slated for September, STB has said. There will also be guidebooks via a Jalan Jalan: Your Good Hoods Guide initiative, to promote local neighbourhoods‚Äô destinations.
ATTEND A WORKSHOP
Workshops are another great way to ‚Äúescape‚Äù your routine at home. After all, when you‚Äôre overseas, people do take cooking classes right?
Schools such as Palate Sensations offer these. Or you might want some heritage-themed alternatives. One suggestion is the tea making and appreciation workshop at family-run Yixing Xuan Teahouse along Tanjong Pagar, after which you can explore the area.

Island-hopping and taking a day trip to Singapore‚Äôs outer islands is one way to escape the bustle of city life. You can charter a yacht (if you can get groups to chip in) or check out ferry schedules. There‚Äôs Lazarus Island, St John‚Äôs Island, Pulau Jong, Pulau Ubin, among others ‚Äì you can explore some of these and even have activities on the island or circle these at your leisure.
STAYCATIONS WITH BENEFITS
You can‚Äôt really get away from hotel staycations as an option ‚Äì the plus side is there‚Äôs no hassle of dealing with an unfamiliar environment, currency or transport system. Some of these hotels have tied up with tour guides for special experiences. Let‚Äôs Go Tours for example does historic trails for guests of Raffles Hotel. Monster Day Tours is organising SG55 special edition tours, and working with hotels, such as Lyf Funan. 
BOOK YOUR OWN TOURS
Alternatively, you can go directly to the tour companies ‚Äì Monster Day Tours, for example is running a ‚Äúbehind-the-scenes‚Äù tour of Changi Airport and Jewel, and Let‚Äôs Go Tours still does its bike tours if you reach out directly. 
Merchant associations will be working with the Society of Tourist Guides to develop heartland tours slated for September, STB has said. There will also be guidebooks via a Jalan Jalan: Your Good Hoods Guide initiative, to promote local neighbourhoods‚Äô destinations.
ATTEND A WORKSHOP
Workshops are another great way to ‚Äúescape‚Äù your routine at home. After all, when you‚Äôre overseas, people do take cooking classes right?
Schools such as Palate Sensations offer these. Or you might want some heritage-themed alternatives. One suggestion is the tea making and appreciation workshop at family-run Yixing Xuan Teahouse along Tanjong Pagar, after which you can explore the area.

Inactivity means your fitness levels have gone down ‚Äì culminating in weight gain if you haven‚Äôt been exercising for eight weeks. But don‚Äôt worry, fitness loss is reversible ‚Äì when you start exercising regularly again, it will return.

The key is to put aside your ego, and start slow and easy. Don‚Äôt assume that you are still as fit as your old self. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable any exercises, slow down, reduce the resistance or do fewer repetitions. As a rule of the thumb, resume your activities at half the intensity, frequency, and duration relative to what you used to do. Over the weeks, progressively step up the intensity by 10 per cent each week.

To find out if your starting point is excessive, take note of your post-exercise aches and soreness. If you do not experience any soreness or muscle aches, it is likely that you were too conservative. If you experience excessive soreness and have difficulty going about your daily activities, it is likely that you were too ambitious with your fitness routine.

Inactivity means your fitness levels have gone down ‚Äì culminating in weight gain if you haven‚Äôt been exercising for eight weeks. But don‚Äôt worry, fitness loss is reversible ‚Äì when you start exercising regularly again, it will return.

The key is to put aside your ego, and start slow and easy. Don‚Äôt assume that you are still as fit as your old self. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable any exercises, slow down, reduce the resistance or do fewer repetitions. As a rule of the thumb, resume your activities at half the intensity, frequency, and duration relative to what you used to do. Over the weeks, progressively step up the intensity by 10 per cent each week.

To find out if your starting point is excessive, take note of your post-exercise aches and soreness. If you do not experience any soreness or muscle aches, it is likely that you were too conservative. If you experience excessive soreness and have difficulty going about your daily activities, it is likely that you were too ambitious with your fitness routine. If the soreness is bearable and you can comfortably go about your daily activities, you have struck the right balance.

The 99-year-old war veteran has become a celebrity by raising at least ¬£6.4 million for Britain's health service with a walk around his garden during the COVID-19 crisis.

Captain Tom, who has used a walking frame to move around since breaking his hip, has set himself the target of walking the 25m around his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday later this month.

The story has lifted the hearts of a nation stuck in lockdown for the last month and weary of the relentless wave of grim news. Moore had originally aimed to raise ¬£500,000 but that target has been smashed as media attention from around the globe has zoomed in on his garden in Bedfordshire, central England.

His son-in-law Colin Ingram said Moore wanted to give something back after receiving such good care from the state-run National Health Service (NHS) when he broke his hip two years ago and in subsequent hospital visits. ""We said we'd give him a pound a lap, and thank goodness I didn't say I'd match any money he raised,‚Äù quipped Ingram.

Raising money for the NHS has given Moore a new lease of life and the veteran has no plans to stop, even though he is due to hit his 100-lap target on Thursday morning. Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #CaptainTom #walking #fundraising #coronavirus #COVID19 #inspiration (Photo: Reuters)"

Captain Tom, who has used a walking frame to move around since breaking his hip, has set himself the target of walking the 25m around his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday later this month.

The story has lifted the hearts of a nation stuck in lockdown for the last month and weary of the relentless wave of grim news. Moore had originally aimed to raise ¬£500,000 but that target has been smashed as media attention from around the globe has zoomed in on his garden in Bedfordshire, central England.

His son-in-law Colin Ingram said Moore wanted to give something back after receiving such good care from the state-run National Health Service (NHS) when he broke his hip two years ago and in subsequent hospital visits. ""We said we'd give him a pound a lap, and thank goodness I didn't say I'd match any money he raised,‚Äù quipped Ingram.

Raising money for the NHS has given Moore a new lease of life and the veteran has no plans to stop, even though he is due to hit his 100-lap target on Thursday morning. Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #CaptainTom #walking #fundraising #coronavirus #COVID19 #inspiration (Photo: Reuters)"

12,aliciatan4,"My anaphylactic allergic reaction had worst symptoms than COVID 19. They include severe sore throat with bloody phlegm, running nose with bloody mucus, cough until wheezing, breathlessness, an upper tract lung infection, an elevated level of enzyme in my liver, high fever of 40 degree Celsius, inability to utter a word, dizziness, itchy/painful/bleeding rashes and a dangerously low level of blood pressure. My diastolic blood pressure was only 49! I posted the proofs and the doctor's remarks that I declined all medicines. My immune system reversed all the symptoms.  I do not disinfect,  sanitise, wash my hands with the toxic soap or wear the mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide, a cancer causing agent. Any product that can kill the viruses will impair our immune system and damage the organs! When the commuters coughed badly, I did not fall sick! Stop believing in the flawed scientific research.  Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She reversed all her health problems without any medication or EXERCISE! True healing means eliminating toxins, never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! It is the toxic treatments that kill the infected patients with preexisting health problems and trigger viral mutations! The doctors are treating the infected people with HIV medicine. It can cause liver and pancreas failure plus other adverse reactions! Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against pathogens, diseases, infectionsÔºåfree radicals and cancer cells!  I posted the proven track record of Jessica Seah's nontoxic treatment method using the correct diet! Use Jessica's method, you do not need the expensive ventilators, masks, disinfectants, alcohol, hand sanitizers and soap!

Rowling said: ""The teachers, parents and carers working to keep children's lives as normal and happy as possible while we're all on lockdown deserve a bit of magic.

18,sherinye,"Opinion: There had been a lot of frustrations & anxiety recently as we are all thrown into this unprecedented circumstances. Some of us had felt warmth through the encouragement of another while some have been left disappointed with their unanswered questions.I really empathise with the commercial airlines at this juncture. Being at the forefront, the airlines had been (one-of) the hardest hit by far and while they struggle to unplan and replan everything in impossible speed, they still have to take on the wrath of the public they are serving. I trust that the airlines, no matter their size, are all putting in their best effort to tide things through. Can we put down our near to flawless expectations of the Singapore Airlines Group service level (that had been constantly pushing her people to their limits) during the global pandemic to show a little more support to the industry fending the frontline.Let us all share a little more patience, a little more understanding and a little more encouragement to these people that have been working round the clock and giving up their daily routine to make things right amid all these uncertainty. Like it or not, we are all in this together. We need more social empathy instead of spiteful words in times as such.Keep going!üíú #singaporeairlines #scoot #airlines #airtransport #covid_19 #covid19",2020-03-18T02:33:42.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9x7wLeJAju/,2020-03-16T03:56:12.000Z,"Good news for those in the midst of changing travel plans.

Your reply is via email but yet u r troubling your customer to respond your emails not via email but to go through your online request again.(and is not stated in e email). And there is always glitch on your website. This is such a bad customer experience. You guys need to work harder on your crisis management and your online communication channel.
