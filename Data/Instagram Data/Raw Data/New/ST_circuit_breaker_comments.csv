However, 2 tests that were conducted on Wednesday night were found to be negative.
The National Public Health Laboratory conducted another test on Thursday to confirm his Covid-19 status, which MOH said was also negative.
MOH said it has rescinded the quarantine orders of close contacts who were earlier quarantined as a precaution while investigations were being done.
The ministry added that it will support the laboratory on board the Quantum of the Seas ship in its review of its testing processes.

Opening up a country to another? Unless both countries have the common same detection, tracing, control methods and direction (just like 1 country) setting measurements to determine when to pull the plug is not enough. Are the countries in a travel bubble willing to adapt and adjust to each other for a common way forward- just like a single country's response, containment and treatment methods?

The exact start date of the arrangement will be reviewed late this month.
The move comes as Hong Kong hunkers down under harsher social distancing measures in anticipation of what health authorities have warned could be the worst Covid-19 wave so far.
Hong Kong's daily new infections have crossed 70 for more than a week.
The spike was led initially by a growing dance club cluster of more than 500, most of whom are tai tais and their young dancing instructors.

26,jerryllk_,"Looks like what ST and Nea has reported is proving to be accurate and that there is no such disinfectant that can last six months or can continue to kill Covid 19 for three to six months. Most disinfectant available can kill some bacteria and germs and not Covid 19. Here it shows Covid19 is highly resistant and contagious. False hope is dangerous and very worrisome. We live to suffer when claims of disinfectant efficacy are not certified nor properly tested. Don‚Äôt put peoples life to any risk, it is so irresponsible. Don‚Äôt lower our guard check what works and what don‚Äôt and protect ourselves and protect our people. All those claims of self disinfect that can last six months is terrible and here is a case where we live to suffer. We need to be alert and protect ourselves. SGUNITED - must be extremely careful with such products that let our guard down. Stay alert.",2020-07-02T21:42:05.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CCJD_r0Fw6W/,2020-07-02T13:36:20.000Z,"The households being offered Covid-19 testing live in the same section of the block that share a common lift lobby and stairwell‚Äã as 9 confirmed Covid-19 case‚Äãs.

23,caprinic,"É??In guidance released by WHO Monday (May 29), the United Nations public Health Agency said É??there is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (what her medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking, can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses, including covid19É?ù. WHO said another concern is people may contaminate themselves by touching their faces more frequently when they adjust, remove and dispose of their masks. The agency said masks should be reserved for those who are infected with the virus or in close contact with infected patients.SO, when are you, Straits Times, going to report on this and question the governmentÉ??s current stance on masks.",2020-06-06T06:56:59.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CA5DdywpF-s/,2020-06-01T11:52:28.000Z,"The task force combating the Covid-19 outbreak said that face shields are not as effective as masks in reducing the risk of transmission.

We canÉ??t have schools compromising the studentsÉ?? education by doing it for 2 months. By pushing forward holidays, teachers and students can look forward to quality face to face teaching when school reopens in June.

They know masks helps, but 6 weeks ago, number of healthy people is higher, probability of spread is low, but irrational fear (selfishness, panic hoarding) was high so that was the recommended approach. But today, there's a higher spread in community over time, but higher trust in government to act (e.g. society observed how they quickly planning resources and manpower to create and give out hand sanitizers and now reusable masks), so the approach changed. It's about adapting quickly based on factors e.g. society, resources needed, time available, probability of virus spread.

Then we must also look as ways we can produce and not stockpile an essential amount of food, water and medicine as part of national defence. This has to be in tandem with population growth. But I'm sure that appropriate consideration is already given to these matters, and that I'm only stating the obvious.

Use your common sense, the toxic chemicals will impair the immune system, our first line of defence and damage the organs. We need the unharmed immune system to fight and subdue COVID 19! Thiese wrong recommendations by WHO have proven ineffective as more people despite following the using instructions get infected. I do not follow and do not wear the mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide another cancer causing agent. When the commuters coughed very badly I did not fall sick! I keep seeing the public areas are disinfect! You are making the population inhale poison! Before you can solve COVID 19, you are creating more health problems! Such stupidity will cause astronomical increase in chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases! This is the fallacy of science that always embrace man-made chemicals! Science created the superbugs, the mutated viruses without realising it and fail to subdue. The next foolish move will be to develop another vaccine. History always repeats itself! Humans are killed by ignorance foolishness and self-inflicted harm! This generation should stop repeating the same errors as our predecessors!

4,saynotovege,"Things havenÉ??t been easy since we first discovered about Covid-19 a few weeks ago. Singapore and the rest of the world panicked. Some of us even went into a frenzy.. panic buying groceries and what have you not.ÉÅúÉÅúI never ever imagined that people in grocery stores would actually fight(and I mean literally fight) over toilet paper. If they hadnÉ??t been selfish.. if they had been kind and were gracious enough to share and only buy what was needed.. no fights would have broken out. The last thing we need is to go against each other in a time like this. ÉÅúI think itÉ??s important to understand that more than ever now.... STANDING UNITED is the only way we can overcome this. We also NEED to DO OUR PART, and make sure we are responsible for our health and personal hygiene. Are you washing your hands? Sanitizing? Are you taking care of your health? These are measures we need to take.ÉÅúÉÅúAnd in times like these... Be understanding and kind to your friends, families, colleagues and neighbors. DonÉ??t shun them away if they really are sick. Our ability to show care, love and concern is what makes us human. ÉÅú",2020-03-18T05:02:15.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B924FoflofY/,2020-03-18T02:00:23.000Z,"A sight not normally seen.

In June 2012, days before her 25th birthday, scans revealed that the twins she was pregnant with had serious brain defects that were incurable.
Her marriage ended 2 years after they were born, leaving her, at age 27, a single mother of 3 children.
But even in the depths of depression, Ms Rozanah said she knew she had to pick herself up because her children depended on her.
Today, she is back on her feet, and wants to give back to society.
