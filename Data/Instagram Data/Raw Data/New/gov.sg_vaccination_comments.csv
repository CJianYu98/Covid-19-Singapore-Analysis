5,calvinelcheng,"This is a terrible message. I can think of so many things that Singaporeans don’t like to do, but are forced to, for our own good.  Not to say measles and diphtheria  vaccinations are compulsory. This is therefore a nonsensical reason. No government is making it compulsory because the vaccine is still new, even if it’s proven to be safe and effective in the short term. And because no government is making it compulsory, the Singapore government will not be brave enough to be the only one to do so. If you can’t be straightforward, don’t make up nonsensical reasons. - CC",2021-02-16T05:26:24.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLTtIYTMOX8/,2021-02-15T09:30:44.000Z,"Your Covid-19 questions answered:

The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine was transported on Singapore Airlines flight SQ7979, which departed on Sunday 20 December from Brussels, and landed at Singapore Changi Airport at 7.36pm on Monday.

The vaccines were packed in thermal shipper boxes filled with dry ice designed to keep the vials at -70 degree Celsius.

Upon arrival, ground handler SATS moved the vaccines to its cold chain facility. They were then loaded onto a refrigerated truck that would send them to an external storage facility&nbsp;with capabilities to handle ultra-cold storage at about -80 degree Celsius.

Staff and logistics partners have been trained up to WHO standards to be able to handle the cargo safely.

11,sarahlim1386,It's new so they won't probably know the side effects.  Plus again it isn't 100% guarantee that it can total prevent you from getting covid-19.Although at least it does some protection Plus I heard other countries news ppl getting vaccine some gotten the side effects of the vaccine include face distortion. & Vaccine usually takes alot more years to do research & trials about 10 year to prove that it is safe. U can't say for sure the side effects could cause health problems if it changes DNA sequence or effect cells in the body.,2020-12-15T02:05:33.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIyFbQNHBjg/,2020-12-14T15:06:04.000Z,"💉 COVID-19 vaccinations will be free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents, with priority given to groups at greater risk, including healthcare workers and the elderly.
