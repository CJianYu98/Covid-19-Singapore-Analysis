But if that’s not your thing, there are still other activities you can do to feel like you’re on a holiday (or as close to one as you can get) – or as the Singapore Tourism Board calls it, a Singapoliday.
GO ISLAND-HOPPING
Island-hopping and taking a day trip to Singapore’s outer islands is one way to escape the bustle of city life. You can charter a yacht (if you can get groups to chip in) or check out ferry schedules. There’s Lazarus Island, St John’s Island, Pulau Jong, Pulau Ubin, among others – you can explore some of these and even have activities on the island or circle these at your leisure.
STAYCATIONS WITH BENEFITS
You can’t really get away from hotel staycations as an option – the plus side is there’s no hassle of dealing with an unfamiliar environment, currency or transport system. Some of these hotels have tied up with tour guides for special experiences. Let’s Go Tours for example does historic trails for guests of Raffles Hotel. Monster Day Tours is organising SG55 special edition tours, and working with hotels, such as Lyf Funan. 
BOOK YOUR OWN TOURS
Alternatively, you can go directly to the tour companies – Monster Day Tours, for example is running a “behind-the-scenes” tour of Changi Airport and Jewel, and Let’s Go Tours still does its bike tours if you reach out directly. 
Merchant associations will be working with the Society of Tourist Guides to develop heartland tours slated for September, STB has said. There will also be guidebooks via a Jalan Jalan: Your Good Hoods Guide initiative, to promote local neighbourhoods’ destinations.
ATTEND A WORKSHOP
Workshops are another great way to “escape” your routine at home. After all, when you’re overseas, people do take cooking classes right?
Schools such as Palate Sensations offer these. Or you might want some heritage-themed alternatives. One suggestion is the tea making and appreciation workshop at family-run Yixing Xuan Teahouse along Tanjong Pagar, after which you can explore the area.

7,csyderek,"There will definitely be a slight increase in community cases two weeks on, so don't be too alarmed by the figures then. Added precautions would be necessary on an individual basis, to slowly mete out the virus from spreading any further in the country. Be diligent in all your protective measures, and we should do just fine overall. Anyone who tries to be funny in this season and flout the rules should be appropriately penalised, preferably monetarily. 😗 Suggestion: If they were to fall sick due to their own negligence of the current situation at hand, then there should be no MediSave claims available for them to offset any hospitalisation fees. 😱 (Scary enough? Then that would work very well in keeping everyone in check.) 😎👍 #getoureconomybackontrack #nomedisaveforrulebreakers #remembertousesafeentry #pleaserespectmy1mcomfortzone #saynotocomplacency #whatiswiththesehashtags #ontophasethree",2020-06-20T04:46:44.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CBorqfBptNC/,2020-06-19T23:48:02.000Z,"Hustle and bustle returned to Singapore yesterday (Jun 19) as people hit hawker centres, shopping centres, stadiums and beaches for the first time since the circuit breaker.

CHOOSE A GYM THAT IS WELL-VENTILATED
Exercising outdoors is still your best bet. If not, choose a gym that’s spacious and well-ventilated – and the air’s not recirculated, if possible.

WIPE DOWN EQUIPMENT BEFORE AND AFTER USE
Avoid touching those nasty respiratory droplets on the kettlebells or medicine ball from fellow gym-goers by wiping these. Other tips include laying down a towel when using gym machines and bringing your own gear when applicable.

WEAR WORKOUT GLOVES IF YOU CAN’T WIPE
If pausing mid-exercise to disinfect is not practical, wear gloves. And don’t use your phone when you’re wearing them to avoid contaminating it. When you’re ready to hit the shower, remove the gloves first, then your mask.

DON’T SPOT YOUR BUDDY DURING WEIGHT TRAINING AND AVOID GROUP CLASSES
Safe distancing, folks.

SPACE OUT AND BYO YOGA MAT
To disinfect your mat, spritz both sides with a disinfecting spray before and after every use.

IT’S OKAY TO CHALK UP
CrossFitters, powerlifters, boulderers and climbers count on chalk to keep their palms and fingers dry, and improve their grip. But the use of chalk also means it gets everywhere – even the very air you breathe. Can COVID-19 hitchhike on those fine chalk particles and get inhaled into our lungs? The odds are low.

TAKE CARE IN AND OUT OF THE POOL
Can COVID-19 spread through the water in swimming pools? Currently, there is no evidence demonstrating transmission via swimming pool water – and proper pool maintenance and use of chlorine helps too. But take care, when you’re out – if shower rooms are crowded, just wash up at home.

If pausing mid-exercise to disinfect is not practical, wear gloves. And don’t use your phone when you’re wearing them to avoid contaminating it. When you’re ready to hit the shower, remove the gloves first, then your mask.

DON’T SPOT YOUR BUDDY DURING WEIGHT TRAINING AND AVOID GROUP CLASSES
Safe distancing, folks.

SPACE OUT AND BYO YOGA MAT
To disinfect your mat, spritz both sides with a disinfecting spray before and after every use.

IT’S OKAY TO CHALK UP
CrossFitters, powerlifters, boulderers and climbers count on chalk to keep their palms and fingers dry, and improve their grip. But the use of chalk also means it gets everywhere – even the very air you breathe. Can COVID-19 hitchhike on those fine chalk particles and get inhaled into our lungs? The odds are low.

TAKE CARE IN AND OUT OF THE POOL
Can COVID-19 spread through the water in swimming pools? Currently, there is no evidence demonstrating transmission via swimming pool water – and proper pool maintenance and use of chlorine helps too. But take care, when you’re out – if shower rooms are crowded, just wash up at home.

Wear a mask. Hug outdoors. Try to avoid touching the other person’s body or clothes with your face and your mask. Also, don’t talk or cough while you’re hugging. And do it quickly. Approach each other and briefly embrace. Back away quickly so you don’t breathe into each other’s faces. Wash your hands afterward.

DON’T: HUG FACE-TO-FACE
When the shorter person looks up, their exhaled breath travels up into the taller person’s breathing zone. If the taller person is looking down, there is opportunity for the huggers’ exhaled and inhaled breaths to mingle.

DO: HUG FACING OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
For a safe, full-body hug, turn your faces in opposite directions, which prevents you from directly breathing each other’s exhaled particles. Wear a mask.

DO: LET CHILDREN HUG YOU AROUND THE KNEES OR WAIST
Hugging at knee or waist level lowers risk for direct exposure to droplets and aerosols because faces are far apart. There is potential for the child’s face and mask to contaminate the adult’s clothing. So you might consider changing clothes, and wash your hands after a visit that includes hugs. The adult also should look away so as not to breathe down on the child.

DO: KISS YOUR GRANDCHILD ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD
In this scenario, the grandparent is minimally exposed to the child’s exhaled breath. The child could be exposed to the taller person’s breath, so kiss through a mask.

DO: HOLD YOUR BREATH
Holding your breath stops you exhaling any virus into their breathing zone, if you are unknowingly infected – and stops you inhaling any virus from them, if they are unknowingly infected.

DO: CHOOSE HUGS WISELY
Close friends and family? Sure. Casual hugs? Maybe not.

Hugging at knee or waist level lowers risk for direct exposure to droplets and aerosols because faces are far apart. There is potential for the child’s face and mask to contaminate the adult’s clothing. So you might consider changing clothes, and wash your hands after a visit that includes hugs. The adult also should look away so as not to breathe down on the child.

DO: KISS YOUR GRANDCHILD ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD
In this scenario, the grandparent is minimally exposed to the child’s exhaled breath. The child could be exposed to the taller person’s breath, so kiss through a mask.

DO: HOLD YOUR BREATH
Holding your breath stops you exhaling any virus into their breathing zone, if you are unknowingly infected – and stops you inhaling any virus from them, if they are unknowingly infected.

DO: CHOOSE HUGS WISELY
Close friends and family? Sure. Casual hugs? Maybe not.

Wear a mask. Hug outdoors. Try to avoid touching the other person’s body or clothes with your face and your mask. Also, don’t talk or cough while you’re hugging. And do it quickly. Approach each other and briefly embrace. Back away quickly so you don’t breathe into each other’s faces. Wash your hands afterward.

Singapore’s Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong made the announcement on Apr 14. Individuals who are caught refusing to wear a mask will be fined S$300 on their first offence, while those who flout the rule a second time will be fined S$1,000.

Foreign residents caught breaching these rules might have their work passes or permanent resident status revoked.

There are some exemptions: Children below the age of two don’t need to, and adults who are exercising (running and jogging) only need to put once they stop.

But that begs the question – how do you clean your reusable cloth masks? Experts say you should wash it as often as you wash your underwear, meaning after every use. You should also boil it in water once in a while.

Please understand toxic chemicals will never protect anyone!  The masks are sterilised with Ethylene oxide another cancer causing agent!  Jessica Seah author of Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills reversed all her health problems including infections, obesity, arthritis, hormonal imbalance, high uric acid, constipation, extreme joint pain and anaphylactic allergic reaction without any medication or exercise. I posted proofs including a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication. Her method is nontoxic, cheap simple and very effective! Isn't it better to activate the immune system to fight and subdue COVID 19 without any repercussions or any expensive ventilators? I urge all the leaders who wish to end this unpredecented global pandemic swiftly to contact Jessica Seah at aceofaceent@yahoo.com Only the already healed can teach the world how to heal!

18,sherinye,"Opinion: There had been a lot of frustrations & anxiety recently as we are all thrown into this unprecedented circumstances. Some of us had felt warmth through the encouragement of another while some have been left disappointed with their unanswered questions.I really empathise with the commercial airlines at this juncture. Being at the forefront, the airlines had been (one-of) the hardest hit by far and while they struggle to unplan and replan everything in impossible speed, they still have to take on the wrath of the public they are serving. I trust that the airlines, no matter their size, are all putting in their best effort to tide things through. Can we put down our near to flawless expectations of the Singapore Airlines Group service level (that had been constantly pushing her people to their limits) during the global pandemic to show a little more support to the industry fending the frontline.Let us all share a little more patience, a little more understanding and a little more encouragement to these people that have been working round the clock and giving up their daily routine to make things right amid all these uncertainty. Like it or not, we are all in this together. We need more social empathy instead of spiteful words in times as such.Keep going!💜 #singaporeairlines #scoot #airlines #airtransport #covid_19 #covid19",2020-03-18T02:33:42.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9x7wLeJAju/,2020-03-16T03:56:12.000Z,"Good news for those in the midst of changing travel plans.

68,ah.linn_nn,Your move to make public of your refund policy is insincere. You guys took more than 2 weeks to reply my request online (via your website). Your reply is via email but yet u r troubling your customer to respond your emails not via email but to go through your online request again.(and is not stated in e email). And there is always glitch on your website. This is such a bad customer experience. You guys need to work harder on your crisis management and your online communication channel.

19,munmeet_kaur,"Honestly, it's not ""socially irresponsible people"", it's the work and general life culture in this country. Taking leave or MC when sick and advised by a doctor is already looked down upon what more if an individual takes a personal decision to rest at home because of a mild flu or as a mental health day. No need to point to these people specifically when its an ingrained national culture. Singaporeans are taught from young that die die also must go to school or work; if not really die!😑 It's so appalling that it takes a virus outbreak for humans to see what is so inherently wrong with our society - being looked down upon for prioritising health or family - basically anything other than work!!

Citing a study done on the coronavirus, Dr Jyoti Somani of the Division of Infectious Diseases at National University Hospital pointed out that the virus can survive on common phone materials such as glass, metal and ceramic ""on average about three days in our local climate"", and ""a shorter period of time on aluminum.” If you’re afraid that cleaning with alcohol might damage your precious (and expensive) phones, try using a solution that’s one part rubbing alcohol (with an alcohol percentage of 70) and one part water to dilute it.

In an Instagram post on Jan 28, she wrote that husband, actor Qi Yuwu, was flying back to Singapore while she stayed put. Qi also posted on his own account how he had “mixed feelings” leaving his family.

Peh’s lengthy post painted a sober image of the situation in Guangzhou, saying the Wuhan virus has “caused widespread fear as people stay indoors and avoid visiting; masks, antibacterial sprays are sold out; restaurants are peddling raw ingredients outside their premise because no one is patronizing.” But she did end with words of encouragement: “To all who are separated from your loved ones, it isn’t a great feeling but stay strong, be safe and keep the light shining in your heart.” Stay safe, Joanne and family!

Peh’s lengthy post painted a sober image of the situation in Guangzhou, saying the Wuhan virus has “caused widespread fear as people stay indoors and avoid visiting; masks, antibacterial sprays are sold out; restaurants are peddling raw ingredients outside their premise because no one is patronizing.” But she did end with words of encouragement: “To all who are separated from your loved ones, it isn’t a great feeling but stay strong, be safe and keep the light shining in your heart.” Stay safe, Joanne and family!
