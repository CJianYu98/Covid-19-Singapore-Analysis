Helmed by Pitch Perfect director Jason Moore, the film is currently being filmed in the Dominican Republic. Tan posted on her social media platforms on Feb 15 (Monday) indicating that she is already in the Dominican Republic and has since undergone her first COVID-19 test.

The Singaporean actress-writer-director will be appearing in the film alongside leads Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel (who replaced scandal-embroiled Armie Hammer) in the role of Marge, the head of the wedding resort.

Lopez and Duhamel will play the soon-to-be-wed couple who gather their lovable but very opinionated families for the ultimate destination wedding just as they themselves begin to get cold feet. Rock star and four-time Grammy award winner Kravitz will play Sean, the globetrotting ex of Lopez's character Grace.

Rock star and four-time Grammy award winner Kravitz will play Sean, the globetrotting ex of Lopez's character Grace.

The 42-year-old also said that What Remains is not meant to be sad. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more about self-discovery, tidying up one‚Äôs emotions, and then moving on and forward.‚Äù

The new track ‚Äì available on digital platforms ‚Äì came about after Sun found herself with time on her hands as she wasn‚Äôt able to fly overseas for work because of the pandemic. This gave her time to reflect on her memories and also reconnect with people whom she hadn‚Äôt seen in a while.

In a press release statement, Sun said that the most significant line in the song for her is the one that roughly translates to, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt said how much I‚Äôve missed you for fear that I'll miss you once I say it‚Äù.

The 42-year-old also said that What Remains is not meant to be sad. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more about self-discovery, tidying up one‚Äôs emotions, and then moving on and forward.‚Äù

Sun took to Instagram to announce the song and also took the opportunity to wish her fans a happy Chinese New Year.

1,kai_the_noble,"First, check the victim if he has any injury or sharp object in their clothing. Eg. A pen or a knife or the victim has a broien leg. This will ensure that you will reduce the risk of you getting hurt or the chances of injuring the victim. Second, tilt his or her head back, and check the airway for blockage. Tilting the head will automatically open the mouth, and checking for blockages will ensure air can go in when you do mouth to mouth. Third, open his or her clothing to reveal his or her chest( be respectful ). Call for help from time to time. If you want the chances of someone to call an ambulance, point directly at the person and specify him or her eg. ""YOU! IN THE BLACK SHIRT, CALL AN AMBULANCE!"". Third, find if the victim has medicine. A heart attack can be recurring or new. If the victim has asprin, break the tablets into pieces and  tell him or her to suck on it. The victim will absorb it better and quicker. If unresponsive, place both of your hands on top of each other, interlocking them. Petform chest compressions 12 times where the heart is located. Perform mouth to mouth. Occasionally check for breathing. As you perform chest compressions, you will hear cracking. That is the ribcage breaking. Relax, you need to pump hard, in order to actually encourage the heart to beat. If the person is still unresponsive, you need to remember he or she won'y magically wake up. You are just preserving the body. The professionals will handle the rest. If the person is responsive to stimuli eg. Eyes looking into yours, hands going towards you, trying to talk. If he or she is breathing, try to make him or her as comfortable as you can. Get him or her under shade. Talk to him or her, try to make sure shes awake the whole time. Explain whats going on. Tell him or her to take deep breathes. Comfort him or her.",2020-09-29T06:25:34.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFtAfxupAuG/,2020-09-29T02:12:36.000Z,"It's World Heart Day, folks.

The event is a much-needed bit of good news for the National Zoo, which had to close for months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Monday (Aug 17), the zoo posted a video of the giant panda's ultrasound on its social media channels that captured the fetus in motion and confirmed the pregnancy.

News of Mei Xiang's pregnancy, which the zoo first teased last week, sparked enthusiasm among animal lovers who flocked to the zoo's panda cams to get a glimpse of the expectant mother. 

Mei Xiang's last cub, Bei Bei, left Washington for China in November last year as part of a breeding program that is key to efforts to reintroduce pandas into the wild.

The event is a much-needed bit of good news for the National Zoo, which had to close for months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Monday (Aug 17), the zoo posted a video of the giant panda's ultrasound on its social media channels that captured the fetus in motion and confirmed the pregnancy.

News of Mei Xiang's pregnancy, which the zoo first teased last week, sparked enthusiasm among animal lovers who flocked to the zoo's panda cams to get a glimpse of the expectant mother.

There are 10 featured species you can adopt at the moment: Ah Meng the Sumatran orangutan; Ben and Bella the African penguins; Bosco the red ruffed lemur; Bunny the two-toed sloth; Coco the Aldabra giant tortoise; Matahari the Malayan sun bear; Pedro the California sea lion; Psota the pygmy hippopotamus; Rambo the eastern grey kangaroo, and Ronnie the rex rabbit.

There are also plans to expand the programme to the animals at WRS' other parks: Jurong Bird Park, River Safari and Night Safari.

You can choose from three adoption tiers ‚Äì S$200, S$800 and S$1,500 ‚Äì all of which will get you a number of free admission tickets to the Singapore Zoo, discount vouchers for admission, invitations for WRS events and an adoption e-certificate.

The funds collected from the programme will go towards an ‚Äúoverall resource pool‚Äù that helps provide meals for the animals, support the purchase of medical equipment for their healthcare and to the general upkeep of animal habitats. You‚Äôll also be contributing to research and education programmes, as well as conservation projects.

Previously, he was also criticised for attending a banquet in February this year with other popular celebrities like Jackie Chan and Eric Tsang because of the appearance of retired superintendent Frankly Chu, who was jailed for hitting a bystander with a baton during Hong Kong's Occupy Central protests in 2014. Netizens also took issue with the group for not wearing masks.

But what other precautions can you take aside from safe distancing and washing hands?

CHOOSE A GYM THAT IS WELL-VENTILATED
Exercising outdoors is still your best bet. If not, choose a gym that‚Äôs spacious and well-ventilated ‚Äì and the air‚Äôs not recirculated, if possible.

WIPE DOWN EQUIPMENT BEFORE AND AFTER USE
Avoid touching those nasty respiratory droplets on the kettlebells or medicine ball from fellow gym-goers by wiping these. Other tips include laying down a towel when using gym machines and bringing your own gear when applicable.

WEAR WORKOUT GLOVES IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT WIPE
If pausing mid-exercise to disinfect is not practical, wear gloves. And don‚Äôt use your phone when you‚Äôre wearing them to avoid contaminating it. When you‚Äôre ready to hit the shower, remove the gloves first, then your mask.

DON‚ÄôT SPOT YOUR BUDDY DURING WEIGHT TRAINING AND AVOID GROUP CLASSES
Safe distancing, folks.

SPACE OUT AND BYO YOGA MAT
To disinfect your mat, spritz both sides with a disinfecting spray before and after every use.

IT‚ÄôS OKAY TO CHALK UP
CrossFitters, powerlifters, boulderers and climbers count on chalk to keep their palms and fingers dry, and improve their grip. But the use of chalk also means it gets everywhere ‚Äì even the very air you breathe. Can COVID-19 hitchhike on those fine chalk particles and get inhaled into our lungs? The odds are low.

TAKE CARE IN AND OUT OF THE POOL
Can COVID-19 spread through the water in swimming pools? Currently, there is no evidence demonstrating transmission via swimming pool water ‚Äì and proper pool maintenance and use of chlorine helps too. But take care, when you‚Äôre out ‚Äì if shower rooms are crowded, just wash up at home.

CHOOSE A GYM THAT IS WELL-VENTILATED

Avoid touching those nasty respiratory droplets on the kettlebells or medicine ball from fellow gym-goers by wiping these. Other tips include laying down a towel when using gym machines and bringing your own gear when applicable.

WEAR WORKOUT GLOVES IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT WIPE
If pausing mid-exercise to disinfect is not practical, wear gloves. And don‚Äôt use your phone when you‚Äôre wearing them to avoid contaminating it. When you‚Äôre ready to hit the shower, remove the gloves first, then your mask.

CHOOSE A GYM THAT IS WELL-VENTILATED
Exercising outdoors is still your best bet. If not, choose a gym that‚Äôs spacious and well-ventilated ‚Äì and the air‚Äôs not recirculated, if possible.

WIPE DOWN EQUIPMENT BEFORE AND AFTER USE
Avoid touching those nasty respiratory droplets on the kettlebells or medicine ball from fellow gym-goers by wiping these. Other tips include laying down a towel when using gym machines and bringing your own gear when applicable.

WEAR WORKOUT GLOVES IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT WIPE
If pausing mid-exercise to disinfect is not practical, wear gloves. And don‚Äôt use your phone when you‚Äôre wearing them to avoid contaminating it. When you‚Äôre ready to hit the shower, remove the gloves first, then your mask.

DON‚ÄôT SPOT YOUR BUDDY DURING WEIGHT TRAINING AND AVOID GROUP CLASSES
Safe distancing, folks.

SPACE OUT AND BYO YOGA MAT
To disinfect your mat, spritz both sides with a disinfecting spray before and after every use.

IT‚ÄôS OKAY TO CHALK UP
CrossFitters, powerlifters, boulderers and climbers count on chalk to keep their palms and fingers dry, and improve their grip. But the use of chalk also means it gets everywhere ‚Äì even the very air you breathe. Can COVID-19 hitchhike on those fine chalk particles and get inhaled into our lungs? The odds are low.

Aside from sticking to groups of five, wearing masks and safe distancing, what else should you do at the restaurant? Here are a few extra tips you might want to consider.

SCENARIO 1: GOING IN AND SITTING DOWN
If possible, try to scoot out of your seat without touching it. Or ask for a table with regular chairs if you‚Äôre not good at hands-free scooting.

SCENARIO 2: YOU‚ÄôRE HANDED THE MENU OR A TABLET TO ORDER
Consider using the napkin or a tissue to hold and flip the menu. If you‚Äôre given an tablet, place it on the table to minimise contact. Maybe ask the waiter to take your order instead. Wipe the iPad‚Äôs screen with an alcohol wipe before using it. After using the menu, disinfect your hands immediately.

SCENARIO 3: TIME TO EAT ‚Äì AND REMOVE YOUR MASK
Place the used mask on a clean tissue, and clean your hands before eating or drinking, and clean your hands again before putting it back on. Alternatively, keep it in a resealable bag instead of leaving it on the table ‚Äì or change to a new mask after a meal.

SCENARIO 4: YOU‚ÄôVE CHOKED ON CHILLI OR DRINKS AND NEED TO COUGH
It‚Äôs good practice to cover your mouth with a tissue ‚Äì and dispose of this and clean your hands after.

SCENARIO 5: YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
Use a piece of tissue or toilet paper to open the door. If you want to be extra safe, apply alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you return to the table.

SCENARIO 6: TIME TO PAY ‚Äì CASH, PAYWAVE OR CARD?
The best option is contactless payment. If you have no choice but to pay with cash or card, don‚Äôt touch your face after you‚Äôve put your change or card back into your wallet. And use the alcohol-based hand sanitiser the F&B establishment has provided after you're done with your transaction.

If possible, try to scoot out of your seat without touching it. Or ask for a table with regular chairs if you‚Äôre not good at hands-free scooting.

SCENARIO 2: YOU‚ÄôRE HANDED THE MENU OR A TABLET TO ORDER
Consider using the napkin or a tissue to hold and flip the menu. If you‚Äôre given an tablet, place it on the table to minimise contact. Maybe ask the waiter to take your order instead. Wipe the iPad‚Äôs screen with an alcohol wipe before using it. After using the menu, disinfect your hands immediately.

SCENARIO 3: TIME TO EAT ‚Äì AND REMOVE YOUR MASK
Place the used mask on a clean tissue, and clean your hands before eating or drinking, and clean your hands again before putting it back on. Alternatively, keep it in a resealable bag instead of leaving it on the table ‚Äì or change to a new mask after a meal.

SCENARIO 4: YOU‚ÄôVE CHOKED ON CHILLI OR DRINKS AND NEED TO COUGH
It‚Äôs good practice to cover your mouth with a tissue ‚Äì and dispose of this and clean your hands after.

SCENARIO 5: YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
Use a piece of tissue or toilet paper to open the door. If you want to be extra safe, apply alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you return to the table.

SCENARIO 6: TIME TO PAY ‚Äì CASH, PAYWAVE OR CARD?
The best option is contactless payment. If you have no choice but to pay with cash or card, don‚Äôt touch your face after you‚Äôve put your change or card back into your wallet. And use the alcohol-based hand sanitiser the F&B establishment has provided after you're done with your transaction.

Rajput, who was known for his numerous hits on the big and small screens (including his portrayal of cricket star MS Dhoni on the silver screen), reportedly battled depression. He died just a few days after the shock death of his former manager Disha Salian.

Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan tweeted ‚ÄúI will miss him so much. His energy, enthusiasm and his full happy smile,‚Äù alongside a selfie with Rajput, while fellow star Akshay Kumar also said he was ‚Äúshocked and speechless‚Äù on Twitter.

Bollywood is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of two luminaries, Irrfan Khan and Rishi Kapoor, in April. In early June, Wajid Khan, one of the top composers of Bollywood dance songs, died at the age of 42 after contracting coronavirus, according to media reports. Celebrated filmmaker Basu Chatterjee passed away just a week ago. He was 90.

Rajput got his big break in Bollywood in 2013 with Kai Po Che, a film about cricket, love and politics that won acclaim at the Berlin film festival.

Wear a mask. Hug outdoors. Try to avoid touching the other person‚Äôs body or clothes with your face and your mask. Also, don‚Äôt talk or cough while you‚Äôre hugging. And do it quickly. Approach each other and briefly embrace. Back away quickly so you don‚Äôt breathe into each other‚Äôs faces. Wash your hands afterward.

DON‚ÄôT: HUG FACE-TO-FACE
When the shorter person looks up, their exhaled breath travels up into the taller person‚Äôs breathing zone. If the taller person is looking down, there is opportunity for the huggers‚Äô exhaled and inhaled breaths to mingle.

DO: HUG FACING OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
For a safe, full-body hug, turn your faces in opposite directions, which prevents you from directly breathing each other‚Äôs exhaled particles. Wear a mask.

DO: LET CHILDREN HUG YOU AROUND THE KNEES OR WAIST
Hugging at knee or waist level lowers risk for direct exposure to droplets and aerosols because faces are far apart. There is potential for the child‚Äôs face and mask to contaminate the adult‚Äôs clothing. So you might consider changing clothes, and wash your hands after a visit that includes hugs. The adult also should look away so as not to breathe down on the child.

DO: KISS YOUR GRANDCHILD ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD
In this scenario, the grandparent is minimally exposed to the child‚Äôs exhaled breath. The child could be exposed to the taller person‚Äôs breath, so kiss through a mask.

DO: HOLD YOUR BREATH
Holding your breath stops you exhaling any virus into their breathing zone, if you are unknowingly infected ‚Äì and stops you inhaling any virus from them, if they are unknowingly infected.

DO: CHOOSE HUGS WISELY
Close friends and family? Sure. Casual hugs? Maybe not.

When the shorter person looks up, their exhaled breath travels up into the taller person‚Äôs breathing zone. If the taller person is looking down, there is opportunity for the huggers‚Äô exhaled and inhaled breaths to mingle.

DO: HUG FACING OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
For a safe, full-body hug, turn your faces in opposite directions, which prevents you from directly breathing each other‚Äôs exhaled particles. Wear a mask.

DO: LET CHILDREN HUG YOU AROUND THE KNEES OR WAIST
Hugging at knee or waist level lowers risk for direct exposure to droplets and aerosols because faces are far apart. There is potential for the child‚Äôs face and mask to contaminate the adult‚Äôs clothing. So you might consider changing clothes, and wash your hands after a visit that includes hugs. The adult also should look away so as not to breathe down on the child.

DO: KISS YOUR GRANDCHILD ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD
In this scenario, the grandparent is minimally exposed to the child‚Äôs exhaled breath. The child could be exposed to the taller person‚Äôs breath, so kiss through a mask.

DO: HOLD YOUR BREATH
Holding your breath stops you exhaling any virus into their breathing zone, if you are unknowingly infected ‚Äì and stops you inhaling any virus from them, if they are unknowingly infected.

DO: CHOOSE HUGS WISELY
Close friends and family? Sure. Casual hugs? Maybe not.

We talked to some health experts on how to cope with our fluctuating lives and accept the reality check that things will probably never go back to the way things were before. Among some helpful tips to stay resilient include establishing a daily routine to reduce anxiety, engaging in a particular activity or hobby to help us be in control and focused, and to stay socially connected with others ‚Äì even if it‚Äôs online for now.

SPOT is a robodog that reminds people to keep to safe distancing measures and she made her debut on May 8 as part of&nbsp;a two-week pilot trial conducted&nbsp;by NParks and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group.

SPOT will be deployed along a 3km stretch in the River Plains section of the park during off-peak hours.&nbsp;As well as broadcasting messages (the voice is female, in case you're wondering) reminding visitors of social distancing measures, SPOT is fitted with cameras and analytics tools to estimate the number of people in the park.&nbsp;These cameras will not be able to track or recognise specific individuals, and no personal data will be collected, said the authorities. The robot, built by Boston Dynamics, is controlled remotely but accompanied by at least one NParks officer.

Should the pilot prove successful, NParks will consider deploying the robot during the morning and evening peak hours, and also study plans to send SPOT to other parks such as&nbsp;Jurong Lake Gardens. SPOT is also being trialled at the a COVID-19 community isolation facility at Changi Exhibition Centre, to deliver essential items such as medicine to patients. #robodog #Singapore #SPOT #safedistancing #exercise #cycling #jogging #park (Photos: AFP, Reuters)"

The robot, built by Boston Dynamics, is controlled remotely but accompanied by at least one NParks officer.

Should the pilot prove successful, NParks will consider deploying the robot during the morning and evening peak hours, and also study plans to send SPOT to other parks such as&nbsp;Jurong Lake Gardens. SPOT is also being trialled at the a COVID-19 community isolation facility at Changi Exhibition Centre, to deliver essential items such as medicine to patients. #robodog #Singapore #SPOT #safedistancing #exercise #cycling #jogging #park (Photos: AFP, Reuters)"

SPOT will be deployed along a 3km stretch in the River Plains section of the park during off-peak hours.&nbsp;As well as broadcasting messages (the voice is female, in case you're wondering) reminding visitors of social distancing measures, SPOT is fitted with cameras and analytics tools to estimate the number of people in the park.&nbsp;These cameras will not be able to track or recognise specific individuals, and no personal data will be collected, said the authorities. The robot, built by Boston Dynamics, is controlled remotely but accompanied by at least one NParks officer.

Should the pilot prove successful, NParks will consider deploying the robot during the morning and evening peak hours, and also study plans to send SPOT to other parks such as&nbsp;Jurong Lake Gardens. SPOT is also being trialled at the a COVID-19 community isolation facility at Changi Exhibition Centre, to deliver essential items such as medicine to patients. #robodog #Singapore #SPOT #safedistancing #exercise #cycling #jogging #park (Photos: AFP, Reuters)"

9,aliciatan4,"""Heal the ills of the world, socially, mentally, emotionally and environmentally before we can cure the toxic body!"" urged Jessica Seah author of Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills. Her nontoxic treatment method to treat infections, pathogens, diseases, free radicals and cancer cells is cheap, simple and very effective. I helped a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication using Jessica Seah's diet. This brilliant author discovered appropriate cheap food can activate the immune system to fight and subdue any unseen enemy! Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19! I posted concrete proofs! I only paid less than US$25 to reverse my life-threatening anaphylactic allergic reaction. The  symptoms were worse than COVID 19! I was suffering from 40 degree Celsius fever, severe sore throat with bloody phlegm, running nose with bloody mucus, an upper tract lung infection, an elevated level of enzyme in my liver, itchy hives, cough until wheezing, breathlessness, nausea, dizziness and a dangerously low blood pressure! My diastolic blood pressure was only 49! I hope the leaders all over the world will contact Jessica Seah at aceofaceent@yahoo.com so there won't be any lives loss to the wrong treatment method and we can prevent a global meltdown!üá∏üá¨",2020-03-31T08:21:15.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Yq-PvJ3SI/,2020-03-31T04:59:57.000Z,"Crazy Rich Asians actor Nico Santos announced on Instagram on Monday (Mar 30) that his stepfather has died from COVID-19... and that his mother is also battling coronavirus.

Likewise I do not disinfect, sanitise, wash my hands with the toxic soap or wear the mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide another cancer causing agent. When people coughed badly, I did not fall sick. I have zero health problem and do not part a single cent to Dr Jekylls or the filthy rich pharmaceutical companies! I did everything mentioned in the book, Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She reversed all her health problems without any medication or exercise. According to the brilliant author, true healing means eliminating toxins, never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! This is a simple concept that scientists and WHO fail to comprehend. Hence, they will use the most toxic method to preempt and treat infections or any health problem! Every generation keeps repeating the same errors as the predecessors. Hence, the health problems keep recurring. It is time to stop this vicious cycle to prevent human annihilation!

18,sherinye,"Opinion: There had been a lot of frustrations & anxiety recently as we are all thrown into this unprecedented circumstances. Some of us had felt warmth through the encouragement of another while some have been left disappointed with their unanswered questions.I really empathise with the commercial airlines at this juncture. Being at the forefront, the airlines had been (one-of) the hardest hit by far and while they struggle to unplan and replan everything in impossible speed, they still have to take on the wrath of the public they are serving. I trust that the airlines, no matter their size, are all putting in their best effort to tide things through. Can we put down our near to flawless expectations of the Singapore Airlines Group service level (that had been constantly pushing her people to their limits) during the global pandemic to show a little more support to the industry fending the frontline.Let us all share a little more patience, a little more understanding and a little more encouragement to these people that have been working round the clock and giving up their daily routine to make things right amid all these uncertainty. Like it or not, we are all in this together. We need more social empathy instead of spiteful words in times as such.Keep going!üíú #singaporeairlines #scoot #airlines #airtransport #covid_19 #covid19",2020-03-18T02:33:42.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9x7wLeJAju/,2020-03-16T03:56:12.000Z,"Good news for those in the midst of changing travel plans.

So him suddenly posting a random pic of ships with a very criptic caption was just suspect about his intentions.  His original caption didn't even make it seem like he was asking us to take care of our health, it was just him tryna further flame the corona virus scare which turns out isnt even true and he only added be careful after he was called out. And that god complex he have, like no one is forcing u @RonanKeating to still perform.. If u truly wanna seem like u are grateful to perform then why tf not post about ur concerts instead???

18,rafaelkoopa,"For people that is like ""Why is it delayed? It just a virus they can just stay at home""and blah blah blah, the reason is simple the virus (Wuhan virus) is able to hide in your body without you knowing. And so you might think your perfectly fine but there might already be the virus inside you but you dont know and it will still spread, and in a cinema there are a lot of people together so if 1 person have the virus the chance of spreading to other people is very high. That the reason why, I rather stay alive than risking my life for a move",2020-01-27T03:29:17.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B7r-lbEpzi7/,2020-01-24T03:22:43.000Z,"If you were planning to catch Jackie Chan‚Äôs latest film over the Chinese New Year holidays, you‚Äôll have to wait longer.
