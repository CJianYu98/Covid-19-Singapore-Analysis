Helmed by Pitch Perfect director Jason Moore, the film is currently being filmed in the Dominican Republic. Tan posted on her social media platforms on Feb 15 (Monday) indicating that she is already in the Dominican Republic and has since undergone her first COVID-19 test.

The Singaporean actress-writer-director will be appearing in the film alongside leads Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel (who replaced scandal-embroiled Armie Hammer) in the role of Marge, the head of the wedding resort.

Lopez and Duhamel will play the soon-to-be-wed couple who gather their lovable but very opinionated families for the ultimate destination wedding just as they themselves begin to get cold feet. Rock star and four-time Grammy award winner Kravitz will play Sean, the globetrotting ex of Lopez's character Grace.

5,truecolours1971,"Japanese are mostly Westernise thinking. So they follow their owner Big Brother. They want freedom.

Well, besides the sheer novelty factor and a full-service, multi-course dinner, guests also get to go on a behind-the-scenes tour of the A380 aircraft, including a look at the exclusive Suites Class, as well as the cockpit. 

It‚Äôs no wonder that the initial offering was sold out within 30 minutes. Bookings for the next experience on Oct 31 and Nov 1 are currently waitlisted.

But if that‚Äôs not your thing, there are still other activities you can do to feel like you‚Äôre on a holiday (or as close to one as you can get) ‚Äì or as the Singapore Tourism Board calls it, a Singapoliday.
GO ISLAND-HOPPING
Island-hopping and taking a day trip to Singapore‚Äôs outer islands is one way to escape the bustle of city life. You can charter a yacht (if you can get groups to chip in) or check out ferry schedules. There‚Äôs Lazarus Island, St John‚Äôs Island, Pulau Jong, Pulau Ubin, among others ‚Äì you can explore some of these and even have activities on the island or circle these at your leisure.
STAYCATIONS WITH BENEFITS
You can‚Äôt really get away from hotel staycations as an option ‚Äì the plus side is there‚Äôs no hassle of dealing with an unfamiliar environment, currency or transport system. Some of these hotels have tied up with tour guides for special experiences. Let‚Äôs Go Tours for example does historic trails for guests of Raffles Hotel. Monster Day Tours is organising SG55 special edition tours, and working with hotels, such as Lyf Funan. 
BOOK YOUR OWN TOURS
Alternatively, you can go directly to the tour companies ‚Äì Monster Day Tours, for example is running a ‚Äúbehind-the-scenes‚Äù tour of Changi Airport and Jewel, and Let‚Äôs Go Tours still does its bike tours if you reach out directly. 
Merchant associations will be working with the Society of Tourist Guides to develop heartland tours slated for September, STB has said. There will also be guidebooks via a Jalan Jalan: Your Good Hoods Guide initiative, to promote local neighbourhoods‚Äô destinations.
ATTEND A WORKSHOP
Workshops are another great way to ‚Äúescape‚Äù your routine at home. After all, when you‚Äôre overseas, people do take cooking classes right?
Schools such as Palate Sensations offer these. Or you might want some heritage-themed alternatives. One suggestion is the tea making and appreciation workshop at family-run Yixing Xuan Teahouse along Tanjong Pagar, after which you can explore the area.

CHOOSE A GYM THAT IS WELL-VENTILATED
Exercising outdoors is still your best bet. If not, choose a gym that‚Äôs spacious and well-ventilated ‚Äì and the air‚Äôs not recirculated, if possible.

WIPE DOWN EQUIPMENT BEFORE AND AFTER USE
Avoid touching those nasty respiratory droplets on the kettlebells or medicine ball from fellow gym-goers by wiping these. Other tips include laying down a towel when using gym machines and bringing your own gear when applicable.

WEAR WORKOUT GLOVES IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT WIPE
If pausing mid-exercise to disinfect is not practical, wear gloves. And don‚Äôt use your phone when you‚Äôre wearing them to avoid contaminating it. When you‚Äôre ready to hit the shower, remove the gloves first, then your mask.

DON‚ÄôT SPOT YOUR BUDDY DURING WEIGHT TRAINING AND AVOID GROUP CLASSES
Safe distancing, folks.

SPACE OUT AND BYO YOGA MAT
To disinfect your mat, spritz both sides with a disinfecting spray before and after every use.

IT‚ÄôS OKAY TO CHALK UP
CrossFitters, powerlifters, boulderers and climbers count on chalk to keep their palms and fingers dry, and improve their grip. But the use of chalk also means it gets everywhere ‚Äì even the very air you breathe. Can COVID-19 hitchhike on those fine chalk particles and get inhaled into our lungs? The odds are low.

TAKE CARE IN AND OUT OF THE POOL
Can COVID-19 spread through the water in swimming pools? Currently, there is no evidence demonstrating transmission via swimming pool water ‚Äì and proper pool maintenance and use of chlorine helps too. But take care, when you‚Äôre out ‚Äì if shower rooms are crowded, just wash up at home.

CHOOSE A GYM THAT IS WELL-VENTILATED
Exercising outdoors is still your best bet. If not, choose a gym that‚Äôs spacious and well-ventilated ‚Äì and the air‚Äôs not recirculated, if possible.

WIPE DOWN EQUIPMENT BEFORE AND AFTER USE
Avoid touching those nasty respiratory droplets on the kettlebells or medicine ball from fellow gym-goers by wiping these. Other tips include laying down a towel when using gym machines and bringing your own gear when applicable.

WEAR WORKOUT GLOVES IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT WIPE
If pausing mid-exercise to disinfect is not practical, wear gloves. And don‚Äôt use your phone when you‚Äôre wearing them to avoid contaminating it. When you‚Äôre ready to hit the shower, remove the gloves first, then your mask.

To disinfect your mat, spritz both sides with a disinfecting spray before and after every use.

But the use of chalk also means it gets everywhere ‚Äì even the very air you breathe. Can COVID-19 hitchhike on those fine chalk particles and get inhaled into our lungs? The odds are low.

Wear a mask. Hug outdoors. Try to avoid touching the other person‚Äôs body or clothes with your face and your mask. Also, don‚Äôt talk or cough while you‚Äôre hugging. And do it quickly. Approach each other and briefly embrace. Back away quickly so you don‚Äôt breathe into each other‚Äôs faces. Wash your hands afterward.

DON‚ÄôT: HUG FACE-TO-FACE
When the shorter person looks up, their exhaled breath travels up into the taller person‚Äôs breathing zone. If the taller person is looking down, there is opportunity for the huggers‚Äô exhaled and inhaled breaths to mingle.

DO: HUG FACING OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
For a safe, full-body hug, turn your faces in opposite directions, which prevents you from directly breathing each other‚Äôs exhaled particles. Wear a mask.

DO: LET CHILDREN HUG YOU AROUND THE KNEES OR WAIST
Hugging at knee or waist level lowers risk for direct exposure to droplets and aerosols because faces are far apart. There is potential for the child‚Äôs face and mask to contaminate the adult‚Äôs clothing. So you might consider changing clothes, and wash your hands after a visit that includes hugs. The adult also should look away so as not to breathe down on the child.

DO: KISS YOUR GRANDCHILD ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD
In this scenario, the grandparent is minimally exposed to the child‚Äôs exhaled breath. The child could be exposed to the taller person‚Äôs breath, so kiss through a mask.

DO: HOLD YOUR BREATH
Holding your breath stops you exhaling any virus into their breathing zone, if you are unknowingly infected ‚Äì and stops you inhaling any virus from them, if they are unknowingly infected.

DO: CHOOSE HUGS WISELY
Close friends and family? Sure. Casual hugs? Maybe not.

When the shorter person looks up, their exhaled breath travels up into the taller person‚Äôs breathing zone. If the taller person is looking down, there is opportunity for the huggers‚Äô exhaled and inhaled breaths to mingle.

DO: HUG FACING OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
For a safe, full-body hug, turn your faces in opposite directions, which prevents you from directly breathing each other‚Äôs exhaled particles. Wear a mask.

DO: LET CHILDREN HUG YOU AROUND THE KNEES OR WAIST
Hugging at knee or waist level lowers risk for direct exposure to droplets and aerosols because faces are far apart. There is potential for the child‚Äôs face and mask to contaminate the adult‚Äôs clothing. So you might consider changing clothes, and wash your hands after a visit that includes hugs. The adult also should look away so as not to breathe down on the child.

DO: KISS YOUR GRANDCHILD ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD
In this scenario, the grandparent is minimally exposed to the child‚Äôs exhaled breath. The child could be exposed to the taller person‚Äôs breath, so kiss through a mask.

DO: HOLD YOUR BREATH
Holding your breath stops you exhaling any virus into their breathing zone, if you are unknowingly infected ‚Äì and stops you inhaling any virus from them, if they are unknowingly infected.

DO: CHOOSE HUGS WISELY
Close friends and family? Sure. Casual hugs? Maybe not.

When it comes to top destinations Singaporeans are hopefully looking at for Jan to Feb 2021, Tokyo came in first again, followed by Maldives, Bangkok, Niseko, Seoul, Bali, Taipei, Johor, Sapporo, and Okinawa.

18,sherinye,"Opinion: There had been a lot of frustrations & anxiety recently as we are all thrown into this unprecedented circumstances. Some of us had felt warmth through the encouragement of another while some have been left disappointed with their unanswered questions.I really empathise with the commercial airlines at this juncture. Being at the forefront, the airlines had been (one-of) the hardest hit by far and while they struggle to unplan and replan everything in impossible speed, they still have to take on the wrath of the public they are serving. I trust that the airlines, no matter their size, are all putting in their best effort to tide things through. Can we put down our near to flawless expectations of the Singapore Airlines Group service level (that had been constantly pushing her people to their limits) during the global pandemic to show a little more support to the industry fending the frontline.Let us all share a little more patience, a little more understanding and a little more encouragement to these people that have been working round the clock and giving up their daily routine to make things right amid all these uncertainty. Like it or not, we are all in this together. We need more social empathy instead of spiteful words in times as such.Keep going!üíú #singaporeairlines #scoot #airlines #airtransport #covid_19 #covid19",2020-03-18T02:33:42.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9x7wLeJAju/,2020-03-16T03:56:12.000Z,"Good news for those in the midst of changing travel plans.

Citing a study done on the coronavirus, Dr Jyoti Somani of the Division of Infectious Diseases at National University Hospital pointed out that the virus can survive on common phone materials such as glass, metal and ceramic ""on average about three days in our local climate"", and ""a shorter period of time on aluminum.‚Äù If you‚Äôre afraid that cleaning with alcohol might damage your precious (and expensive) phones, try using a solution that‚Äôs one part rubbing alcohol (with an alcohol percentage of 70) and one part water to dilute it.

And it‚Äôs always best to use phone covers and have a screen protector ‚Äì cleaning these is safer than a naked phone. Read more on CNA Lifestyle, link in bio. #coronavirus #COVID19 #hygiene #health #handphone #mobilephone (Photo: Pexels)"
