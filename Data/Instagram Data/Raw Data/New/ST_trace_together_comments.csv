26,tr2ica,"why are y'all pressed??? if you didn't get the opportunity to collect the token, just use your phone to download the application. the tokens are for people who may not have access to technology (seniors, foreign workers) or people who just find it more convenient to carry a token around. I know so many people who get lazy to scan Safe Entry to places (causing a higher risk cause no one can trace you if you happen to be in close proximity with someone with COVID-19) and the government is just ensuring that people would have a platform to do so. stop whining, it's troublesome but it's a hecking pandemic.",2020-12-07T21:20:25.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIewkhRJ9NJ/,2020-12-07T02:58:15.000Z,"Have you started using TraceTogether?

So we should actually give priority to the elderly and maybe start using the app instead. No point complaining, because we can’t have everything we want but to sacrifice something for the greater good. We should also set good role models for the young in Singapore, because the future depends on them.

Once you miss this stage of education you can’t get it back. You can’t get your school fees refunded too and your teachers will have to take no-pay leave until August. Your education is more important than anything else because in future it will be your backbone and insurance that allows you to get a job anywhere if your business or idea fails.
