0,spac3walk3r,My friend who works SDA also got complain said alot still do not follow the rules and yet tried to bully him whenever he is working and had no choice sometimes has to enforce the law. If everyone cooperate would  be better. Obey the rules and do not let Government give them the chance to fine you on the spot and take away your money cos it's not worth it. Overall SDA in here are doing their job. They also human like us trying to meet ends meet,2021-02-21T05:49:59.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLivtV4h5nU/,2021-02-21T05:41:52.000Z,"As a safe distancing ambassador, Mr Adrian Goh takes on a role similar to that of school prefects - to remind people that their behaviour is being monitored and they cannot flout Covid-19 rules with impunity.

In the worst case, the world remains always a step behind an evolving virus, said Mr Wong.

The exact start date of the arrangement will be reviewed late this month.
The move comes as Hong Kong hunkers down under harsher social distancing measures in anticipation of what health authorities have warned could be the worst Covid-19 wave so far.
Hong Kong's daily new infections have crossed 70 for more than a week.
The spike was led initially by a growing dance club cluster of more than 500, most of whom are tai tais and their young dancing instructors.

1,davidltwai,"As 1 country it is easy to say what needs to get done and everyone toe the line. This takes some leadership foresight and a public who's generally willing to cooperate. Opening up a country to another? Unless both countries have the common same detection, tracing, control methods and direction (just like 1 country) setting measurements to determine when to pull the plug is not enough. Are the countries in a travel bubble willing to adapt and adjust to each other for a common way forward- just like a single country's response, containment and treatment methods? Are the people of both countries trusting enough of the other?

The exact start date of the arrangement will be reviewed late this month.
The move comes as Hong Kong hunkers down under harsher social distancing measures in anticipation of what health authorities have warned could be the worst Covid-19 wave so far.
Hong Kong's daily new infections have crossed 70 for more than a week.
The spike was led initially by a growing dance club cluster of more than 500, most of whom are tai tais and their young dancing instructors.

The usual prayer assembly at Masjid Sultan used to attract at least 5,000 worshippers, but this year it was split into 2 sessions of just 50 people each.
Most mosques held 3 sessions with no more than 50 worshippers - who had to book slots online - each time.
The Straits Times would like to wish all our readers Selamat Hari Raya Haji. Stay safe!

If you guessed the O-R3 autonomous robot, you're a psychic!
PUB's latest ""safe distancing ambassador"" conducts daily patrols in the mornings and evenings at Bedok Reservoir, when human traffic at the park is the highest.
It is also armed with sensors that can capture, record and process data that can be sent to officers in real time.
Similar robots will be deployed at Pandan and MacRitchie Reservoirs.
Don't be alarmed if you see the O-R3 rumbling around!

39,evenly_,"Guys please be reasonable. The government is quickly adapting approaches based on the situation! Things have changed alot in 6 weeks. They know masks helps, but 6 weeks ago, number of healthy people is higher, probability of spread is low, but irrational fear (selfishness, panic hoarding) was high so that was the recommended approach. But today, there's a higher spread in community over time, but higher trust in government to act (e.g. society observed how they quickly planning resources and manpower to create and give out hand sanitizers and now reusable masks), so the approach changed. It's about adapting quickly based on factors e.g. society, resources needed, time available, probability of virus spread. Not about staunchly sticking to 1 way just because you don't want people to criticise.",2020-04-11T10:00:18.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-1bm6SFU9-/,2020-04-11T09:03:40.000Z,"""We will make mask-wearing compulsory for public transport.

12,aliciatan4,"If the world continues to disinfect, sanitise using cancer causing agents,or wash with the toxic soap, the population will be more vulnerable to COVID 19 and diseases! Use your common sense, the toxic chemicals will impair the immune system, our first line of defence and damage the organs. We need the unharmed immune system to fight and subdue COVID 19! Thiese wrong recommendations by WHO have proven ineffective as more people despite following the using instructions get infected. I do not follow and do not wear the mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide another cancer causing agent. When the commuters coughed very badly I did not fall sick! I keep seeing the public areas are disinfect! You are making the population inhale poison! Before you can solve COVID 19, you are creating more health problems! Such stupidity will cause astronomical increase in chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases! This is the fallacy of science that always embrace man-made chemicals! Science created the superbugs, the mutated viruses without realising it and fail to subdue. The next foolish move will be to develop another vaccine. History always repeats itself! Humans are killed by ignorance foolishness and self-inflicted harm! This generation should stop repeating the same errors as our predecessors! To err is human; to err repeatedly is inhuman and if I may add, pure stupidity!🇸🇬",2020-03-20T22:33:06.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B99E9tLFKNA/,2020-03-20T11:48:20.000Z,"Here are the stricter safe distancing measures that will be introduced to stem the spread of the coronavirus in Singapore:

Staying indoors won't help you. You must be brave and fight against all odds. I'm not saying it's easy but once you have take the first steps and seek help you will see light at the end of the tunnel. I'm saying this because I'm helping a friend who's going through exactly you are going through now. The progress and outcome is so much brighter than before he had the treatment.
