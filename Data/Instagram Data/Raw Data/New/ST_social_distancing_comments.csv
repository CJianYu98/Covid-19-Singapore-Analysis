The exact start date of the arrangement will be reviewed late this month.
The move comes as Hong Kong hunkers down under harsher social distancing measures in anticipation of what health authorities have warned could be the worst Covid-19 wave so far.
Hong Kong's daily new infections have crossed 70 for more than a week.
The spike was led initially by a growing dance club cluster of more than 500, most of whom are tai tais and their young dancing instructors.

Opening up a country to another? Unless both countries have the common same detection, tracing, control methods and direction (just like 1 country) setting measurements to determine when to pull the plug is not enough. Are the countries in a travel bubble willing to adapt and adjust to each other for a common way forward- just like a single country's response, containment and treatment methods?

The exact start date of the arrangement will be reviewed late this month.
The move comes as Hong Kong hunkers down under harsher social distancing measures in anticipation of what health authorities have warned could be the worst Covid-19 wave so far.
Hong Kong's daily new infections have crossed 70 for more than a week.
The spike was led initially by a growing dance club cluster of more than 500, most of whom are tai tais and their young dancing instructors.

The usual prayer assembly at Masjid Sultan used to attract at least 5,000 worshippers, but this year it was split into 2 sessions of just 50 people each.
Most mosques held 3 sessions with no more than 50 worshippers - who had to book slots online - each time.
The Straits Times would like to wish all our readers Selamat Hari Raya Haji. Stay safe!

39,evenly_,"Guys please be reasonable. The government is quickly adapting approaches based on the situation! Things have changed alot in 6 weeks. They know masks helps, but 6 weeks ago, number of healthy people is higher, probability of spread is low, but irrational fear (selfishness, panic hoarding) was high so that was the recommended approach. But today, there's a higher spread in community over time, but higher trust in government to act (e.g. society observed how they quickly planning resources and manpower to create and give out hand sanitizers and now reusable masks), so the approach changed. It's about adapting quickly based on factors e.g. society, resources needed, time available, probability of virus spread.

Essential stuff means food and medicine. Do you think you can still saunter into McD? No! Even the hawkers will be closed. So my dear Singaporeans, be careful what you wish for. Stop complaining, just stay home before the country really goes into a lockdown.",2020-03-28T08:33:43.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Qzkd0nQbu/,2020-03-28T03:41:09.000Z,"Heading to a mall this weekend?

Thiese wrong recommendations by WHO have proven ineffective as more people despite following the using instructions get infected.

Staying indoors won't help you. You must be brave and fight against all odds. I'm not saying it's easy but once you have take the first steps and seek help you will see light at the end of the tunnel. I'm saying this because I'm helping a friend who's going through exactly you are going through now. The progress and outcome is so much brighter than before he had the treatment.
