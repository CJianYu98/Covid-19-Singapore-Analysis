5,calvinelcheng,"This is a terrible message. I can think of so many things that Singaporeans don’t like to do, but are forced to, for our own good.  Not to say measles and diphtheria  vaccinations are compulsory. This is therefore a nonsensical reason. No government is making it compulsory because the vaccine is still new, even if it’s proven to be safe and effective in the short term. And because no government is making it compulsory, the Singapore government will not be brave enough to be the only one to do so. If you can’t be straightforward, don’t make up nonsensical reasons. - CC",2021-02-16T05:26:24.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLTtIYTMOX8/,2021-02-15T09:30:44.000Z,"Your Covid-19 questions answered:

Read this excerpt dated July 17, 2012 Vaccines Are Causing Mutations That May Jeopardize The Health of Future GenerationsVaccines are causing an unprecedented number of mutations creating superbugs and potent viruses and bacteria that may eventually threaten future generations and humanity itself.

34,aliciatan4,"Clueless highly qualified professionals from WHO keep giving useless recommendations that impair the immune system and damage the organs! Soap, disinfectants, hand sanitizers, alcohol contain toxic man-made chemicals that are detrimental to the body! I posted articles of burnt victims from using such products! The man-made chemicals are the root cause of unimaginable permutations of viral mutations! The more toxic chemicals we add to the environment or our body, the more vulnerable will be the population to COVID 19! Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She discovered appropriate cheap food can activate the immune system to fight any unseen enemy like infections, pathogens, diseases, free radicals and cancer cells. Her nontoxic treatment method is cheap, simple and very effective. I posted proofs! It cost me less than US$25 to reverse my anaphylactic allergic reaction! The symptoms were worse than COVID 19! Expect a great depression if people continue to use the toxic man-made chemicals to preempt and treat COVID 19 or continue to be clueless how COVID 19 and other superbugs exist! 🇸🇬",2020-03-30T21:30:11.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-XLUwejcnb/,2020-03-30T15:04:25.000Z,"Singaporeans all over the island cheering our front liners on and showing love in a time of COVID-19.
