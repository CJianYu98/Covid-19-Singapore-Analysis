Titled What Remains, the song about introspection is composed, produced and written by Sun. The last time she did this was 19 years ago with the song, Someone.

The new track – available on digital platforms – came about after Sun found herself with time on her hands as she wasn’t able to fly overseas for work because of the pandemic. This gave her time to reflect on her memories and also reconnect with people whom she hadn’t seen in a while.

In a press release statement, Sun said that the most significant line in the song for her is the one that roughly translates to, “I haven’t said how much I’ve missed you for fear that I'll miss you once I say it”.

The 42-year-old also said that What Remains is not meant to be sad. “It’s more about self-discovery, tidying up one’s emotions, and then moving on and forward.”

Sun took to Instagram to announce the song and also took the opportunity to wish her fans a happy Chinese New Year.

From all of us at CNA, here's wishing you a happy CNY right back, Stef! 🍊🍊🧧🧧

Titled What Remains, the song about introspection is composed, produced and written by Sun. The last time she did this was 19 years ago with the song, Someone.

The new track – available on digital platforms – came about after Sun found herself with time on her hands as she wasn’t able to fly overseas for work because of the pandemic. This gave her time to reflect on her memories and also reconnect with people whom she hadn’t seen in a while.

In a press release statement, Sun said that the most significant line in the song for her is the one that roughly translates to, “I haven’t said how much I’ve missed you for fear that I'll miss you once I say it”.

Wear a mask. Hug outdoors. Try to avoid touching the other person’s body or clothes with your face and your mask. Also, don’t talk or cough while you’re hugging. And do it quickly. Approach each other and briefly embrace. Back away quickly so you don’t breathe into each other’s faces. Wash your hands afterward.

DON’T: HUG FACE-TO-FACE
When the shorter person looks up, their exhaled breath travels up into the taller person’s breathing zone. If the taller person is looking down, there is opportunity for the huggers’ exhaled and inhaled breaths to mingle.

DO: HUG FACING OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
For a safe, full-body hug, turn your faces in opposite directions, which prevents you from directly breathing each other’s exhaled particles. Wear a mask.

DO: LET CHILDREN HUG YOU AROUND THE KNEES OR WAIST
Hugging at knee or waist level lowers risk for direct exposure to droplets and aerosols because faces are far apart. There is potential for the child’s face and mask to contaminate the adult’s clothing. So you might consider changing clothes, and wash your hands after a visit that includes hugs. The adult also should look away so as not to breathe down on the child.

DO: KISS YOUR GRANDCHILD ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD
In this scenario, the grandparent is minimally exposed to the child’s exhaled breath. The child could be exposed to the taller person’s breath, so kiss through a mask.

DO: HOLD YOUR BREATH
Holding your breath stops you exhaling any virus into their breathing zone, if you are unknowingly infected – and stops you inhaling any virus from them, if they are unknowingly infected.

DO: CHOOSE HUGS WISELY

Wear a mask. Hug outdoors. Try to avoid touching the other person’s body or clothes with your face and your mask. Also, don’t talk or cough while you’re hugging. And do it quickly. Approach each other and briefly embrace. Back away quickly so you don’t breathe into each other’s faces. Wash your hands afterward.

DON’T: HUG FACE-TO-FACE
When the shorter person looks up, their exhaled breath travels up into the taller person’s breathing zone. If the taller person is looking down, there is opportunity for the huggers’ exhaled and inhaled breaths to mingle.

DO: HUG FACING OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
For a safe, full-body hug, turn your faces in opposite directions, which prevents you from directly breathing each other’s exhaled particles. Wear a mask.

DO: LET CHILDREN HUG YOU AROUND THE KNEES OR WAIST
Hugging at knee or waist level lowers risk for direct exposure to droplets and aerosols because faces are far apart. There is potential for the child’s face and mask to contaminate the adult’s clothing. So you might consider changing clothes, and wash your hands after a visit that includes hugs. The adult also should look away so as not to breathe down on the child.

DO: KISS YOUR GRANDCHILD ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD
In this scenario, the grandparent is minimally exposed to the child’s exhaled breath. The child could be exposed to the taller person’s breath, so kiss through a mask.

DO: HOLD YOUR BREATH
Holding your breath stops you exhaling any virus into their breathing zone, if you are unknowingly infected – and stops you inhaling any virus from them, if they are unknowingly infected.

DO: CHOOSE HUGS WISELY

Wear a mask. Hug outdoors. Try to avoid touching the other person’s body or clothes with your face and your mask. Also, don’t talk or cough while you’re hugging. And do it quickly. Approach each other and briefly embrace. Back away quickly so you don’t breathe into each other’s faces. Wash your hands afterward.

DON’T: HUG FACE-TO-FACE
When the shorter person looks up, their exhaled breath travels up into the taller person’s breathing zone. If the taller person is looking down, there is opportunity for the huggers’ exhaled and inhaled breaths to mingle.

DO: HUG FACING OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
For a safe, full-body hug, turn your faces in opposite directions, which prevents you from directly breathing each other’s exhaled particles. Wear a mask.

DO: LET CHILDREN HUG YOU AROUND THE KNEES OR WAIST
Hugging at knee or waist level lowers risk for direct exposure to droplets and aerosols because faces are far apart. There is potential for the child’s face and mask to contaminate the adult’s clothing. So you might consider changing clothes, and wash your hands after a visit that includes hugs. The adult also should look away so as not to breathe down on the child.

DO: KISS YOUR GRANDCHILD ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD
In this scenario, the grandparent is minimally exposed to the child’s exhaled breath. The child could be exposed to the taller person’s breath, so kiss through a mask.

DO: HOLD YOUR BREATH
Holding your breath stops you exhaling any virus into their breathing zone, if you are unknowingly infected – and stops you inhaling any virus from them, if they are unknowingly infected.

DO: CHOOSE HUGS WISELY
Close friends and family? Sure. Casual hugs? Maybe not.

No other source of spiritual truth is available to mankind.,2020-01-30T19:33:57.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B77yVbXpgHH/,2020-01-30T06:43:31.000Z,"You might not recognise her because she’s wearing a mask, but that’s Joanne Peh who’s in China right now.

The Singaporean actress is in Guangzhou, where she celebrated the Chinese New Year with her family – and she’s chosen to stay for now with her two-year-old son and four-year-old daughter to “finish up some personal matters” regarding her children.

In an Instagram post on Jan 28, she wrote that husband, actor Qi Yuwu, was flying back to Singapore while she stayed put. Qi also posted on his own account how he had “mixed feelings” leaving his family.

Peh’s lengthy post painted a sober image of the situation in Guangzhou, saying the Wuhan virus has “caused widespread fear as people stay indoors and avoid visiting; masks, antibacterial sprays are sold out; restaurants are peddling raw ingredients outside their premise because no one is patronizing.” But she did end with words of encouragement: “To all who are separated from your loved ones, it isn’t a great feeling but stay strong, be safe and keep the light shining in your heart.” Stay safe, Joanne and family!

18,rafaelkoopa,"For people that is like ""Why is it delayed? It just a virus they can just stay at home""and blah blah blah, the reason is simple the virus (Wuhan virus) is able to hide in your body without you knowing. And so you might think your perfectly fine but there might already be the virus inside you but you dont know and it will still spread, and in a cinema there are a lot of people together so if 1 person have the virus the chance of spreading to other people is very high. That the reason why, I rather stay alive than risking my life for a move",2020-01-27T03:29:17.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B7r-lbEpzi7/,2020-01-24T03:22:43.000Z,"If you were planning to catch Jackie Chan’s latest film over the Chinese New Year holidays, you’ll have to wait longer.
