0,st3v3nlow,No way! Who came up with this ridiculous idea. Some traditions need to be kept.,2021-01-11T10:32:19.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ5TECMpPoa/,2021-01-11T06:51:18.000Z,"If you’re celebrating, why not give out e-hongbaos this year, as this will help to reduce queues for new notes and is more environmentally friendly, suggested the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Monday (Jan 11).

For people who still prefer to use new physical notes, however, they will need to make online reservations with their banks to get the new notes, said MAS.

The best defenses against bathroom contagions are a mask, social distancing, limiting the surfaces you touch with your hands and hand hygiene.

1. Consider larger bathrooms with multiple stalls because they have more air circulation.

2. If someone exits a bathroom stall or a single bathroom right before you, try waiting at least 60 seconds before entering – especially if the toilet seat lid is up, signifying more plume.

3. Skip the paper toilet seat covers. They are likely placebo – we have no idea if they offer protection from bacteria or viruses – and they could easily be contaminated with toilet plume, so touching them with your hands could be a source of infectious transmission.

4. If you need to dispose of a menstrual product in one of those little containers, touch the lid with a wad of toilet paper and sanitise your hands after. Those lids are among the worst surfaces in the bathroom stall: Touched by many unwashed hands and showered with infectious plume.

5. If the toilet has a lid, close it before you flush so it traps the plume. Think of the lid as a mask for the toilet.

6. If an automated toilet is flushing, step back because those things spray.

7. How you dry your hands after washing probably doesn’t matter; paper towels or dryers are likely equal. But do avoid shared, reusable hand towels.

8. Get out of there quickly. Chatting in bathrooms is the new smoking in bathrooms – it’s a relic of the past. If you have to open a door to exit, use hand sanitiser after you leave.

The best defenses against bathroom contagions are a mask, social distancing, limiting the surfaces you touch with your hands and hand hygiene.

1. Consider larger bathrooms with multiple stalls because they have more air circulation.

2. If someone exits a bathroom stall or a single bathroom right before you, try waiting at least 60 seconds before entering – especially if the toilet seat lid is up, signifying more plume.

3. Skip the paper toilet seat covers. They are likely placebo – we have no idea if they offer protection from bacteria or viruses – and they could easily be contaminated with toilet plume, so touching them with your hands could be a source of infectious transmission.

4. If you need to dispose of a menstrual product in one of those little containers, touch the lid with a wad of toilet paper and sanitise your hands after. Those lids are among the worst surfaces in the bathroom stall: Touched by many unwashed hands and showered with infectious plume.

5. If the toilet has a lid, close it before you flush so it traps the plume. Think of the lid as a mask for the toilet.

6. If an automated toilet is flushing, step back because those things spray.

7. How you dry your hands after washing probably doesn’t matter; paper towels or dryers are likely equal. But do avoid shared, reusable hand towels.

Aside from sticking to groups of five, wearing masks and safe distancing, what else should you do at the restaurant? Here are a few extra tips you might want to consider.

SCENARIO 1: GOING IN AND SITTING DOWN
If possible, try to scoot out of your seat without touching it. Or ask for a table with regular chairs if you’re not good at hands-free scooting.

SCENARIO 2: YOU’RE HANDED THE MENU OR A TABLET TO ORDER
Consider using the napkin or a tissue to hold and flip the menu. If you’re given an tablet, place it on the table to minimise contact. Maybe ask the waiter to take your order instead. Wipe the iPad’s screen with an alcohol wipe before using it. After using the menu, disinfect your hands immediately.

SCENARIO 3: TIME TO EAT – AND REMOVE YOUR MASK
Place the used mask on a clean tissue, and clean your hands before eating or drinking, and clean your hands again before putting it back on. Alternatively, keep it in a resealable bag instead of leaving it on the table – or change to a new mask after a meal.

SCENARIO 4: YOU’VE CHOKED ON CHILLI OR DRINKS AND NEED TO COUGH
It’s good practice to cover your mouth with a tissue – and dispose of this and clean your hands after.

SCENARIO 5: YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
Use a piece of tissue or toilet paper to open the door. If you want to be extra safe, apply alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you return to the table.

SCENARIO 6: TIME TO PAY – CASH, PAYWAVE OR CARD?
The best option is contactless payment. If you have no choice but to pay with cash or card, don’t touch your face after you’ve put your change or card back into your wallet. And use the alcohol-based hand sanitiser the F&B establishment has provided after you're done with your transaction.

But with (somewhat) great freedom comes great responsibility.

Aside from sticking to groups of five, wearing masks and safe distancing, what else should you do at the restaurant? Here are a few extra tips you might want to consider.

SCENARIO 1: GOING IN AND SITTING DOWN
If possible, try to scoot out of your seat without touching it. Or ask for a table with regular chairs if you’re not good at hands-free scooting.

SCENARIO 2: YOU’RE HANDED THE MENU OR A TABLET TO ORDER
Consider using the napkin or a tissue to hold and flip the menu. If you’re given an tablet, place it on the table to minimise contact. Maybe ask the waiter to take your order instead. Wipe the iPad’s screen with an alcohol wipe before using it. After using the menu, disinfect your hands immediately.

SCENARIO 3: TIME TO EAT – AND REMOVE YOUR MASK
Place the used mask on a clean tissue, and clean your hands before eating or drinking, and clean your hands again before putting it back on. Alternatively, keep it in a resealable bag instead of leaving it on the table – or change to a new mask after a meal.

SCENARIO 4: YOU’VE CHOKED ON CHILLI OR DRINKS AND NEED TO COUGH
It’s good practice to cover your mouth with a tissue – and dispose of this and clean your hands after.

SCENARIO 5: YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
Use a piece of tissue or toilet paper to open the door. If you want to be extra safe, apply alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you return to the table.

SCENARIO 6: TIME TO PAY – CASH, PAYWAVE OR CARD?
The best option is contactless payment. If you have no choice but to pay with cash or card, don’t touch your face after you’ve put your change or card back into your wallet. And use the alcohol-based hand sanitiser the F&B establishment has provided after you're done with your transaction.

SCENARIO 6: TIME TO PAY – CASH, PAYWAVE OR CARD?
The best option is contactless payment. If you have no choice but to pay with cash or card, don’t touch your face after you’ve put your change or card back into your wallet. And use the alcohol-based hand sanitiser the F&B establishment has provided after you're done with your transaction.

Aside from sticking to groups of five, wearing masks and safe distancing, what else should you do at the restaurant? Here are a few extra tips you might want to consider.

SCENARIO 1: GOING IN AND SITTING DOWN
If possible, try to scoot out of your seat without touching it. Or ask for a table with regular chairs if you’re not good at hands-free scooting.

SCENARIO 2: YOU’RE HANDED THE MENU OR A TABLET TO ORDER
Consider using the napkin or a tissue to hold and flip the menu. If you’re given an tablet, place it on the table to minimise contact. Maybe ask the waiter to take your order instead. Wipe the iPad’s screen with an alcohol wipe before using it. After using the menu, disinfect your hands immediately.

SCENARIO 3: TIME TO EAT – AND REMOVE YOUR MASK
Place the used mask on a clean tissue, and clean your hands before eating or drinking, and clean your hands again before putting it back on. Alternatively, keep it in a resealable bag instead of leaving it on the table – or change to a new mask after a meal.

SCENARIO 4: YOU’VE CHOKED ON CHILLI OR DRINKS AND NEED TO COUGH
It’s good practice to cover your mouth with a tissue – and dispose of this and clean your hands after.

The U2 singer recently posted an original song on Instagram – a piano ballad titled Let Your Love Be Known, which was inspired by the story of Italians singing during lockdown.

The lyrics go: “You can’t touch, but you can sing across rooftops / Sing on the phone / Sing and promise me you won’t stop / Sing your love be known / Oh, let your love be known.” He continued with some encouragement: “Yes, there is isolation / You and me we’re still here / Yes, when we open our eyes we’ll stare down the fear.” Thanks, Bono.
