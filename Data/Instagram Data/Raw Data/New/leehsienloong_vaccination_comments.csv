I took stock of our COVID-19 situation. We want to maintain our current stable position and get Singaporeans vaccinated quickly. The vaccines will take us one big step forward, but not back to business as usual, as many countries will not complete their vaccinations within this year. We have to live with the virus for many more years to come, maybe even permanently.

I also shared my thoughts on our external situation, and the outlook for the future. The next few years will not be easy.

The vaccines will take us one big step forward, but not back to business as usual, as many countries will not complete their vaccinations within this year. We have to live with the virus for many more years to come, maybe even permanently.

I also shared my thoughts on our external situation, and the outlook for the future. The next few years will not be easy. We can’t tell exactly how the world will change after the pandemic, but as long as we work together, hold fast to our principles, and keep faith both with our pioneers as well as generations yet unborn, we will emerge stronger and thrive for many years to come. – LHL

I took stock of our COVID-19 situation. We want to maintain our current stable position and get Singaporeans vaccinated quickly. The vaccines will take us one big step forward, but not back to business as usual, as many countries will not complete their vaccinations within this year. We have to live with the virus for many more years to come, maybe even permanently.

I also shared my thoughts on our external situation, and the outlook for the future. The next few years will not be easy. We can’t tell exactly how the world will change after the pandemic, but as long as we work together, hold fast to our principles, and keep faith both with our pioneers as well as generations yet unborn, we will emerge stronger and thrive for many years to come. – LHL

⠀⠀⠀⠀
It has been a difficult year, and the comfort and support of families and friends have helped us to get through these trying times.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The Year of the Ox brings new hope. Our national vaccination programme is progressing. Please take the vaccine when your turn comes – both for yourself, and&nbsp; your loved ones too.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Let us also give heartfelt thanks to the essential workers keeping Singapore going through the festive period, as well as our Malay, Indian and Eurasian friends who will be covering for their Chinese colleagues.

Teck Ghee CC is one of two CCs being used for vaccinations, along with Tanjong Pagar CC. More centres will be set up in the coming weeks, so that everyone can conveniently receive their vaccinations.
 
Glad the take-up rate from our seniors has been very encouraging. Many thanks to all involved – the vaccination team, the community partners, and volunteers – for your hard work in reaching out to seniors, guiding them along each step, and ensuring a smooth process. – LHL

When your turn comes, I strongly encourage you to take it up too. Especially seniors like myself, for whom COVID-19 can be a serious and dangerous illness. Vaccination will not only protect yourself from COVID-19, but also help keep your loved ones safe. – LHL

These stricter measures will surely disappoint all of us looking forward to celebrating CNY. But just look at the countries near and far experiencing repeated surges in cases, and you will see why we need to stay vigilant.

It’s exactly 1 year since our first confirmed COVID-19 case in Singapore. The year has gone by at breakneck pace, as we all struggled to cope with the unprecedented chaos and disruption to our lives. Through immense effort and sacrifice, we’ve got ourselves to a stable situation. Our vaccination programme is underway, with  seniors starting to get their shots next week.

Let us continue to protect ourselves and our loved ones by adhering to all the measures. – LHL

9,xuanxuan23,"I’m a resident in Chinatown and both my parents working in the hawker of Chinatown Complex. For the past week, the crowd in Chinatown has been increasing by a lot. Happy that the sales for my parents stall increased. However, wishes that the safety measurement become better. From my observation only 20% of the visitor scan in to visit the hawker and there is no temperature taken. Although it will be a hassle as a resident who stays there as I walk up and down and around at least 4 times a day. But for the health benefit of the people staying and working there and also everyone please improve the measurement. Not to mention a lot elderly stay there. I can stay at home but my parents have to work so they need to be out.Thank you for providing free covid testing for people who work at Chinatown. But this method can only help to spot the virus and prevent it from spreading. How about stopping them to reach the owners? Although we all know temperature taking doesn't mean anything but it better than nothing. Please look into it!Thanks for all the hard work. 😍",2021-01-23T17:19:18.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CKYft_JL_um/,2021-01-23T09:38:21.000Z,"The recent community cases remind us that the war against COVID-19 is far from over.

I encourage that you get vaccinated, because you are not just protecting yourself, but people around you.

49,wangshereen,Thank you Sir! I'm proud to be a Singaporean!,2020-12-15T04:19:03.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIxrvG5Ly9R/,2020-12-14T11:21:35.000Z,"It has been a long year. But because of our collective efforts against COVID-19, we are ready to ease into Phase 3 on 28 December. This is possible because of all of you who made many sacrifices, so that our numbers and situation are now under control.

We will also provide free, voluntary vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use, and the first batch will arrive by the end of 2020. We are still looking at other candidates, and by 3Q2021, we should have enough vaccines for everyone. 

I encourage that you get vaccinated, because you are not just protecting yourself, but people around you. This announcement will bring some year-end cheer to you and your friends and family, but we must maintain our vigilance as the virus is not yet eradicated. It might be a year or more before we are in the clear, but at least we can see light at the end of the tunnel. – LHL

We will also provide free, voluntary vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use, and the first batch will arrive by the end of 2020. We are still looking at other candidates, and by 3Q2021, we should have enough vaccines for everyone. 

I encourage that you get vaccinated, because you are not just protecting yourself, but people around you. This announcement will bring some year-end cheer to you and your friends and family, but we must maintain our vigilance as the virus is not yet eradicated.

But because of our collective efforts against COVID-19, we are ready to ease into Phase 3 on 28 December. This is possible because of all of you who made many sacrifices, so that our numbers and situation are now under control.

We will also provide free, voluntary vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use, and the first batch will arrive by the end of 2020. We are still looking at other candidates, and by 3Q2021, we should have enough vaccines for everyone. 

I encourage that you get vaccinated, because you are not just protecting yourself, but people around you.

But because of our collective efforts against COVID-19, we are ready to ease into Phase 3 on 28 December. This is possible because of all of you who made many sacrifices, so that our numbers and situation are now under control.

We will also provide free, voluntary vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use, and the first batch will arrive by the end of 2020. We are still looking at other candidates, and by 3Q2021, we should have enough vaccines for everyone. 

I encourage that you get vaccinated, because you are not just protecting yourself, but people around you. This announcement will bring some year-end cheer to you and your friends and family, but we must maintain our vigilance as the virus is not yet eradicated. It might be a year or more before we are in the clear, but at least we can see light at the end of the tunnel. – LHL

We will also provide free, voluntary vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use, and the first batch will arrive by the end of 2020. We are still looking at other candidates, and by 3Q2021, we should have enough vaccines for everyone. 

I encourage that you get vaccinated, because you are not just protecting yourself, but people around you. This announcement will bring some year-end cheer to you and your friends and family, but we must maintain our vigilance as the virus is not yet eradicated. It might be a year or more before we are in the clear, but at least we can see light at the end of the tunnel. – LHL

We will also provide free, voluntary vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use, and the first batch will arrive by the end of 2020. We are still looking at other candidates, and by 3Q2021, we should have enough vaccines for everyone. 

I encourage that you get vaccinated, because you are not just protecting yourself, but people around you. This announcement will bring some year-end cheer to you and your friends and family, but we must maintain our vigilance as the virus is not yet eradicated. It might be a year or more before we are in the clear, but at least we can see light at the end of the tunnel. – LHL

We are still looking at other candidates, and by 3Q2021, we should have enough vaccines for everyone. 

I encourage that you get vaccinated, because you are not just protecting yourself, but people around you. This announcement will bring some year-end cheer to you and your friends and family, but we must maintain our vigilance as the virus is not yet eradicated. It might be a year or more before we are in the clear, but at least we can see light at the end of the tunnel. – LHL

A big thank you to all our workers for your contributions to Singapore, especially during COVID-19.
2020 has been a year like no other. Many workers have had their wages and livelihoods affected by the pandemic, particularly those in hard-hit sectors. Frontline and essential workers have made many sacrifices, to keep their families and all of us safe.

We do not know when this pandemic will end, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel. We’re closer to getting a vaccine, and starting to reopen our borders. In the meantime, stay safe and stay strong. 
During this pandemic, labour MPs have been working overtime helping union workers, while the Air Transport Executive Staff Union has been working with SIA and other airlines to assist ground staff and protect their interests. Therefore, I nominate NTUC Assistant Secretary-General @patricktaytg and President of the AESU Daniel Loh to show your appreciation next! – LHL

1. All you need to do is record yourself “receiving” the drink from the person who nominated you and give a toast accompanied by a note of appreciation in the post.
2. “Pass” the drink on by nominating two others.

We discussed strengthening cooperation between our countries amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and welcomed the resumption of essential travel between Singapore and Japan. 

Singapore and Japan are like-minded partners enjoying a longstanding close relationship. We have many opportunities to work together, e.g. in vaccine multilateralism, third-country infrastructure cooperation, and preparing for the digital economy. We also both support multilateralism and are working to sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership by the end of this year.

We live in a globalized world and soon the borders will reopen.The aim always should have been to flatten the curve (i.e. not to overburden hospitals). We achieved that a long time ago, and hospitals and ICUs have plenty of space to treat the most severe cases. With all due respect, sir, we are fighting the wrong battle.Let the economy restart faster, and let’s do to phase 2 and phase 3. The long term consequences will be much more severe than having around 10 community cases a day, mostly with mild symptoms. Dengue has killed 12 people in SG, coronavirus 24, in 2020.

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

I was pleased to mark the one-year anniversary of the Singapore-New Zealand Enhanced Partnership, and look forward to expanding our cooperation with new initiatives that both sides value. During the global pandemic, we have spoken up against protectionism and for keeping supply chains intact.

I was pleased to mark the one-year anniversary of the Singapore-New Zealand Enhanced Partnership, and look forward to expanding our cooperation with new initiatives that both sides value. During the global pandemic, we have spoken up against protectionism and for keeping supply chains intact. Earlier in April, we received 20 tonnes of New Zealand’s fine produce, while New Zealand received medical supplies on the return journey.

The times are challenging, but we are dealing with the problems one by one, and planning ahead. As part of safe reopening, we are discussing creating a green lane for short-term essential travel between our countries. I hope this works out, and it will not be long before PM Ardern and I can meet in person again. – LHL

104,tzn.joyce,Our best prime minister💖💖💖💖,2020-05-27T12:43:45.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAsQC7zHEE5/,2020-05-27T12:32:16.000Z,"Held a virtual summit with New Zealand PM @jacindaardern today. Since our last call nearly two months ago, our countries have moved from strict circuit breaking measures to a gradual, careful easing of restrictions. We talked about technological solutions and shared our strategies, including possible collaboration on vaccine development.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I was pleased to mark the one-year anniversary of the Singapore-New Zealand Enhanced Partnership, and look forward to expanding our cooperation with new initiatives that both sides value. During the global pandemic, we have spoken up against protectionism and for keeping supply chains intact. Earlier in April, we received 20 tonnes of New Zealand’s fine produce, while New Zealand received medical supplies on the return journey.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The times are challenging, but we are dealing with the problems one by one, and planning ahead. As part of safe reopening, we are discussing creating a green lane for short-term essential travel between our countries. I hope this works out, and it will not be long before PM Ardern and I can meet in person again. – LHL

39,beauty.admirer.lover,"Feedback from a Pro Govt supporter : it takes an individual Razer Tan Min-Liang to do this : Produce our own masks (a couple of millions masks each month). Finally someone with ""great common sense"" is doing it. My question is : what are our human resources-rich Govt doing all this while ? What are our top civil servants doing ? What are our agencies EDB TDB A*STAR MTI doing all this while since Feb 18 when Minister Lawrence Wong was mooting with the idea of producing our own masks?. You are a very good Prime Minister. Lawrence is a good & hardworking Minister. But a couple of million masks a month may not be enough. Can our Govt support Razer in (1) help him to expedite in setting up the factory with our ""Govt agencies"" rich resources and industrial contacts (2) our Govt to chip in and ramp up the production scale to at least 15  mil to 30 mil masks a month. This will help create some jobs too. This will help ""boost confidence"" if people are going out in public and our Govt to enforce ""All to Wear Masks"" when in public places, in view of the heightened risks as compared to Jan situation. Especially in MRTs, Buses, Supermarkets etc *News Recap 1 : ST 19 Feb : SINGAPORE - Singapore is looking for new sources of supply for masks and developing capabilities to manufacture them locally as other Asian countries clamp down on mask exports, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong has said.""In recent weeks, some places like Taiwan, Thailand and India have banned or tightened regulations on the export of masks,"" he said in a written parliamentary reply on Tuesday (Feb 18). *News Recap 2 : CNA 1 Apr : SINGAPORE: Singapore gaming company Razer announced plans on Wednesday (Apr 1) to set up an automated face mask manufacturing line within 30 days to produce ""a couple of million certified masks"" each month.

Hopefully we will be declared by both the MOH and the WHO as “Covid 19 virus free by late April/middle of May around the third week of May 2020. Hey by the way I got an interesting political solution to the current international economic commerce and tourism for covid 19,how about slowly,but very very slowly we loosen our travel restrictions to like 1.5 countries/2 weeks starting from July 2020,seems like China 🇨🇳 and South Korea is getting hold of the situation soon and also if this is to be done, communications between government to government to city to town must be extremely excellent and meticulous and if let say China and South Korea reports no more cases,then we open up but first they will have to communicate hard to every specific region from cities to cities,test every single one of the population until certain that there is none then we open up with additional terms,and that is their own countries have to ban the rest of the world 🌍 and only trade within ourselves like two,three,four nations etc... especially China 🇨🇳 which is the vital key to economic success of 1.4 billion people,all these in a very very slow ways,that can at least boost our economy as well as theirs!!

(UNQUOTE) It is our Govt's job to do it (ensuring enough masks for the people to wear in public e.g. in crowded mrts and buses). Whether is it buying from China or setting up a factory to produce masks, just do it. Wearing masks definitely is effective in the overall containment efforts.

This is a global crisis, and needs a global solution. I called on the leaders to collaborate in three areas:

1. Public health — helping one another fight the outbreak;
2. Our economies — to save businesses and our citizens’ jobs; 
3. Science and research — to find a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, and prepare for future pandemics.

The pandemic will eventually end, but it will not be the last one the world faces. We must learn from our experiences, and emerge stronger and more resilient from them. – LHL (MCI Photo by Zinkie Aw)"

This is a global crisis, and needs a global solution. I called on the leaders to collaborate in three areas:

1. Public health — helping one another fight the outbreak;
2. Our economies — to save businesses and our citizens’ jobs; 
3. Science and research — to find a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, and prepare for future pandemics.

The pandemic will eventually end, but it will not be the last one the world faces. We must learn from our experiences, and emerge stronger and more resilient from them. – LHL (MCI Photo by Zinkie Aw)"

It was called by Saudi Arabia, holding the G20 Presidency this year, to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak has permeated and changed all the norms of our daily lives — including the way business is conducted.

This is a global crisis, and needs a global solution. I called on the leaders to collaborate in three areas:

1. Public health — helping one another fight the outbreak;
2. Our economies — to save businesses and our citizens’ jobs; 
3. Science and research — to find a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, and prepare for future pandemics.
