⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Celebrations this year have been subdued due to the pandemic. People are meeting in smaller groups and making fewer house visits. Vaccinations for seniors are underway, and progressively for the rest of our population.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If the global pandemic abates, I hope next year we can hold our usual boisterous celebrations, and usher in the Year of the Tiger together with a roar! Wishing everyone a safe and healthy Chap Goh Mei! 祝大家元宵节快乐! – LHL

Our vaccination programme is proceeding smoothly. The latest delivery will allow us to continue as planned. More vaccination centres will open soon across Singapore. I hope seniors will book their appointments when their turn comes, so that we can all stay protected together. 

Until then, do continue to follow safety regulations, wear masks, and remember safe distancing! – LHL

These stricter measures will surely disappoint all of us looking forward to celebrating CNY. But just look at the countries near and far experiencing repeated surges in cases, and you will see why we need to stay vigilant.

It’s exactly 1 year since our first confirmed COVID-19 case in Singapore. The year has gone by at breakneck pace, as we all struggled to cope with the unprecedented chaos and disruption to our lives. Through immense effort and sacrifice, we’ve got ourselves to a stable situation. Our vaccination programme is underway, with  seniors starting to get their shots next week.

⠀
Mr Biden takes office at a time when many pressing challenges confront the US and the rest of the world, not least dealing with COVID-19. Strong American leadership will decisively contribute to our collective recovery, and the shape of the post-pandemic world. ⠀
⠀
This US election was contentious and bitter. I wish Mr Biden every success in his endeavours to heal the divisions. National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman put it beautifully in her poem she recited at the inauguration: “So we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seek harm to none and harmony for all.”⠀
⠀
Singapore has been a long-standing strategic, defence and economic partner of the US. I look forward to working with Mr Biden and his Administration to strengthen America’s engagement of Asia and ASEAN.

It mobilised SG Ambassadors to assist seniors in various ways – distributing food packs, shopping for groceries and collecting medication, so that seniors could stay home safely. SG Ambassadors also called them regularly by phone, to monitor their well-being, and most importantly, assure them someone was looking out for them.⠀

Just as Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Ramadan were observed differently amid the COVID-19 pandemic, adjustments too have been made to this year’s Aidiladha celebration.

Nevertheless, the spirit of Aidiladha remains, and several mosques will be conducting Hari Raya Haji prayers for congregants.

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/B_CgdJTnRdB/,"Paid an “e-visit” to the team at the Singapore Ministry of Manpower Services Center at Bendemeer Road and met the Interagency Task Force.

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B_CgdJTnRdB/,"Paid an “e-visit” to the team at the Singapore Ministry of Manpower Services Center at Bendemeer Road and met the Interagency Task Force.

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless. May the Singapore spirit shine brightly as we go through this difficult period together. – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/B-t81IIHxJl/,"The full suite of “circuit breaker” measures kicked in today. Cabinet still had to meet, but we separated into two locations, connected via teleconferencing. We also spaced out to maintain safe distancing, and wore masks to keep our droplets to ourselves.

The “circuit breaker” is essential to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. As we expected, daily numbers of new cases are still going up, and faster than before. We must bring the numbers down, and the only way is for all of us to observe the circuit breaker measures strictly.

Stay at home, except when you have to go out to do essential work or buy food. If you need to go to the market, stagger your timing too. Avoid being part of the crowd. This is not a month long holiday, when we can go out for jalan jalan or to meet up with friends.

The health of us all depends on the actions of each of us. Please do your part. – LHL

With the new electoral boundaries, Teck Ghee will be taking over part of Yio Chu Kang, while the rest will become a separate single member constituency. I had originally planned a walkabout today to visit markets and meet residents, but unfortunately had to postpone it to comply with safe distancing measures.

And so we kept to a small group, and discussed residents’ concerns and other issues while maintaining an arms-length distance from one another.

I got home to learn the sad news that another COVID-19 patient had passed away. My deepest sympathies to the family.

Keeping a safe physical distance apart should not mean social isolation. Give your friends and family a call, and continue supporting one another during this period. – LHL

Greg asked me about a variety of issues, not only the current COVID-19 situation, but also China-US relations, the CPTPP, and climate change.

It was a pity we could not meet in person. But I am glad for the opportunity to remind our Australian friends that life still goes on, and we will adjust to the new norm. We are getting used to temperature checks, contact tracing forms, safe distancing rules, and frequent reminders to wash our hands. As long as we take the necessary precautions and remember to be socially responsible, we can get through this season together. – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/B9onAlwHOjK/,"It is five weeks since I spoke about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. So it is timely to update Singaporeans again on the medical, economic and psychological outlooks of the situation.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Today, the @WHO officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. This means that while the situation in Singapore remains under control, the COVID-19 threat will be with us for a long time. We cannot be complacent.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
There are some baseline precautions we must get used to, like maintaining good personal hygiene and not holding large gatherings. We must also plan ahead in case a major outbreak happens in Singapore, like in South Korea or Italy.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If a major outbreak happens, we will need more stringent social distancing measures, such as suspending schools and compulsory telecommuting. These will slow down the rate of transmission and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Already our economy has been seriously impacted, so we are working on a second stimulus package to support businesses and workers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singapore’s response to COVID-19 has been recognised by WHO and the international community. This is through the efforts of many Singaporeans, from the frontline staff to all of us keeping #SGclean. I thank all Singaporeans who are dealing with this calmly and responsibly. We must keep up our efforts, and remain #SGUnited.

The 2019 novel coronavirus was foremost on the minds of many residents, but fortunately that did not dampen the festive spirit.

The island-wide mask distribution exercise kicked off today. The SAF and @pafrenz worked round the clock to make this happen. For last-mile distribution, many grassroots leaders and volunteers were activated to organise collection points.

It is perhaps fitting that in the Year of the Rat, Singaporeans have embodied this particular creature’s qualities of resilience and creativity, and stayed united and strong. Wishing all a healthy and prosperous year ahead!
