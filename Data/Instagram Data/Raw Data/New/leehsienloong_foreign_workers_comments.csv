A widely respected unionist, Encik Mahmud first got involved in union work when he joined the Singapore Traction Company (STC) as a bus conductor. He became close friends with Mr Ahmad Ibrahim, Mr Devan Nair and Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and won the support of many unions.

Encik Mahmud was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 1963 General Election, and subsequently to the Parliament of newly independent Singapore. In the years when Singapore was in Malaysia, Malay PAP leaders, including Encik Mahmud, Othman Wok, Rahim Ishak, and others, came under enormous pressure by UMNO politicians to choose race over nation. But Encik Mahmud and his comrades held firm in their conviction. Their courage and leadership kept alive the vision of a multiracial Singapore, and enabled it to become the reality today.
 
Mr Lee was forever grateful for Encik Mahmud’s stout-hearted support at this critical moment in our history, and they kept in touch. At Mr Lee’s state funeral, Encik Mahmud was one of the pallbearers.
 
Encik Mahmud may have left us, but his legacy will live on. My thoughts are with his family in this time of loss. – LHL

23,unicornraksasa,"Hi PM Lee. I chanced upon a post on instagram recently and being a mom, I was deeply affected by it. I humbly seek your kindness to visit @wishforrayyan profile. Rayyan is a 13 months boy who is diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. This causes his muscle to degenerate and go weaker and weaker till he dies. Without treatment,  he will not be able to walk, talk or even eat like a normal person for life. Rayyan's mom is a single mother who had also lost a baby daughter almost a decade ago. Rayyan can be cured in USA via Zolgensma which cost 3.1mil SGD. I do not know Rayyan or any of his aquaintance and family members. I am just a mother who hope to pass this message across to whomever i could. Thank you Sir",2020-11-18T06:45:27.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CHg-4O_rC4-/,2020-11-13T03:10:22.000Z,"Today is World Kindness Day.

Whether donating to a charity on giving.sg, thanking your food delivery person, or just reaching out to a friend to find out how they’re doing, let’s all continue to be kind together, and show that #SGCares. – LHL"

In my message, I thanked public officers for their dedication and efforts during this crisis. Many dealt with situations out of their comfort zone – serving on the frontlines, in hospitals, migrant workers’ dormitories, and at the border. Others worked long hours from offices and homes, to come up with solutions to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, from schools to businesses, travel and our vulnerable groups.⠀

There were inevitably shortcomings to our COVID-19 response. We will learn from them, improve our processes and do better. But as we adjusted and strengthened our responses to the pandemic, our officers rose to the occasion, and pulled together as one public service.⠀

I hope you will join me in saluting our public officers. Without them, we wouldn’t have got thus far. The fight is not over, the battle is far from won. But together, we will overcome. – LHL⠀

I am grateful to the ACE and ITF teams for their hard work.

It has been an enormous task, on a scale beyond what most Singaporeans are aware of.⠀

We are now transitioning to a more permanent arrangement with ACE. The migrant workers are returning to work. We have to ensure that they can work safely, live safely, and rest safely, to prevent COVID-19 from coming back.

I am grateful to the ACE and ITF teams for their hard work. They have been testing our migrant workers, plus delivering meals, providing medical care, keeping them safe and finally bringing the dorm outbreak well under control. It has been an enormous task, on a scale beyond what most Singaporeans are aware of.⠀

We are now transitioning to a more permanent arrangement with ACE. The migrant workers are returning to work. We have to ensure that they can work safely, live safely, and rest safely, to prevent COVID-19 from coming back. We need support from employers, dorm operators, management, and non-government organisations. We also ask for the understanding of the migrant workers themselves, as we strive to keep them safe and well.⠀

34,limkhengs,Good work. .more expected..as rhe covid changes the game ....we protect ourselves first. Yea..,2020-09-14T15:39:08.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFHTTl5Mfqf/,2020-09-14T10:45:49.000Z,"Met the team from the Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group today. The ACE Group is a new division in the Ministry of Manpower. It takes over from the Inter-agency Task Force (ITF), which has been doing COVID-19 operations in the migrant worker dormitories since April.⠀
 ⠀
I am grateful to the ACE and ITF teams for their hard work. They have been testing our migrant workers, plus delivering meals, providing medical care, keeping them safe and finally bringing the dorm outbreak well under control. It has been an enormous task, on a scale beyond what most Singaporeans are aware of.⠀
 ⠀
We are now transitioning to a more permanent arrangement with ACE. The migrant workers are returning to work. We have to ensure that they can work safely, live safely, and rest safely, to prevent COVID-19 from coming back. We need support from employers, dorm operators, management, and non-government organisations. We also ask for the understanding of the migrant workers themselves, as we strive to keep them safe and well.⠀

Thank you all once again for the good work! – LHL⠀

We are now transitioning to a more permanent arrangement with ACE. The migrant workers are returning to work. We have to ensure that they can work safely, live safely, and rest safely, to prevent COVID-19 from coming back. We need support from employers, dorm operators, management, and non-government organisations. We also ask for the understanding of the migrant workers themselves, as we strive to keep them safe and well.⠀
⠀
Thank you all once again for the good work! – LHL⠀

Singapore and China had earlier agreed on a “fast lane” for essential business and official travel between both countries. At the moment this covers six Chinese provinces and municipalities, and hopefully this list will grow if the situation stays under control.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic relations. Our ties with China are substantial and multi-faceted. I am confident that by working with each other and with the international community, we can make more progress in the post-COVID world. – LHL

24,hahabean321,"👍 the Opposition have been beating around the bush in flagging out issues that has been ongoing being consistently and systematically tackled by the incumbent PAP. It is our govt ethos ""never to leave anyone behind."" If truly the Opposition wants to be more represented in Parliament,  then be willing to forge together,  leveraging on resources and brains to compete. Else, what I am seeing is a possible 'self-interest' serving by some of the Opposition.  Some are merely treating their stand more as 'debating'  issues from an 'academia' case study.  Without a potential will-commitment truly to work at ground level With the people. So I urge all Singaporeans let no voice divides us into 'polarisation' , never to embrace this downhill stance ofvthe West. But to stay United and Choose Wisely. Give a strong mandate to the new leadership. The journey ahead for the new Team to recover this 20% of Deficit taken out from our Reserves will not be an easy one. To rebuild the war chest for future generations will require 2-3times this deficit. So we must know our Sums right.",2020-07-02T06:00:00.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CCDjO5znrNf/,2020-06-30T10:14:47.000Z,"Dear AMK voters,

202,monica.tan.3133719,"Thank you Hon PM Lee Hsien Loong&team for doing your  best for our nation.  Thank you Hon PM Lee for  continuing on the foundation, to the best of your ability,  which your  father, our founding father, had  laid for us. We know our best can never be others’ best as we have different yardstick. Whatever is  praiseworthy and noble PAP has done for us we remember and are grateful;  in creating a nation well guided and protected to achieving peace and harmony amongst it’s people. This is of utmost /paramount importance looking at what’s happening at the world around.  And, we lack not.  Governance of a nation is a heavy responsibility and achieving it as witnessed cannot be compared to promises easily made & not proven. Let not our nation’s  peace  and harmony be  taken away from us; let us work constructively  and not destructively  towards our nation’s well-being as we are facing challenging & difficult days lie  ahead. Let us not waste time on opposing for opposing sake.  No one is perfect and let us not point fingers at each other.  Be honest if we have not made mistakes in our lives.  Vote wisely from  grateful hearts and not damaging here-say.  May God continue to bless our nation.“Submission to the Authorities13 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.”‭‭",2020-06-30T13:49:14.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CCDjO5znrNf/,2020-06-30T10:14:47.000Z,"Dear AMK voters,

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This is not a normal election because we are not living in normal times. The central focus of this Manifesto is how we will work together to overcome the crisis of a generation.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe and prevent COVID-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to provide one another care and support, so that together we can keep ourselves safe amidst the uncertainties ahead.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Beyond COVID-19, this Manifesto also sets out the PAP’s longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, beyond the next 5-year term of government — 10, 20 years down the road.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government. What the PAP promises, it delivers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We need a strong and capable leadership team, with the full support of all Singaporeans, to put our Manifesto into action. That is the way to secure our lives, our jobs, and the Future of Singapore.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe and prevent COVID-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to provide one another care and support, so that together we can keep ourselves safe amidst the uncertainties ahead.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Beyond COVID-19, this Manifesto also sets out the PAP’s longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, beyond the next 5-year term of government — 10, 20 years down the road.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government. What the PAP promises, it delivers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We need a strong and capable leadership team, with the full support of all Singaporeans, to put our Manifesto into action. That is the way to secure our lives, our jobs, and the Future of Singapore.

49,ajzahir_ios_photography,GE2020 is not just any other election that we had all this years. This election has a twist having 2 people from one family standing against each other. Our PM has so much experience after LKY in running this country. Just by coming from LKY family that doesn’t make everyone a leader. So don’t get distracted by all this people. Now our PM brother can say anything against our PM . LKY passed away few years have passed . Why his brother never opened his mouth? Why now ? Just because of personal family disputes? I will not trust such people. Ever one will make mistakes here and there . But every term along the way we correct our mistakes.,2020-06-27T09:41:59.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CB7YzffH-02/,2020-06-27T06:08:48.000Z,"This morning, the @papsingapore launched our GE 2020 Manifesto — Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future.

This is not a normal election because we are not living in normal times. The central focus of this Manifesto is how we will work together to overcome the crisis of a generation.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe and prevent COVID-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to provide one another care and support, so that together we can keep ourselves safe amidst the uncertainties ahead.

Beyond COVID-19, this Manifesto also sets out the PAP’s longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, beyond the next 5-year term of government — 10, 20 years down the road.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government. What the PAP promises, it delivers.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe and prevent COVID-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to provide one another care and support, so that together we can keep ourselves safe amidst the uncertainties ahead.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Beyond COVID-19, this Manifesto also sets out the PAP’s longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, beyond the next 5-year term of government — 10, 20 years down the road.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government. What the PAP promises, it delivers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We need a strong and capable leadership team, with the full support of all Singaporeans, to put our Manifesto into action. That is the way to secure our lives, our jobs, and the Future of Singapore.

We discussed their work so far, what comes next, and what we can tweak and improve. We have come a long way, and the migrant workers are now starting to go back to work.

Helping our migrant workers has demanded a multi-faceted approach, with teams from many agencies working together. They have deployed both high tech and the personal touch, and put in enormous efforts to tackle the problem.

79,singlionfish999,"Sir, about 3 months ago with limited medical & human resources, aggressive testing was done on the FWs & the dormitories. At that same period of time, arguably there was no aggressive testing done on the other 5M+ Singaporeans, PRs & the other work permit holders. And catchy words like "" hidden reservoirs "" are coined. Today, 3 months later, some of these 5M+ people will be going to vote in the July election..but under the same risky conditions as before. Because no aggressive testing was planned & done for the 5M+, the asymptomatic & the pre symptomatic carriers walk among us now. The task force should not tell us not to be alarmed to see covid cases rising. Probably its OK to say that 3 months ago but now when Phase 2 is rushed into Phase 1 & then the economy is rushed to open again.. the hidden reservoirs are not flushed out yet & the aggressive testing has just barely begun. After 56 days of circuit breaker days, we are still in the same conditions as we were 3 months ago, still intimidated by the infectious covid bug. Sir, how come there are no virologists or experts on the inter ministries task force briefing & debriefing team. If we are not mistaken, the rep from MOH is a surgeon by training. A Singapore version of Dr Anthony Fauci will be useful to answer many medical & infectious disease questions. Thank you Sir.",2020-06-12T15:22:49.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CBVpFDqHOLz/,2020-06-12T14:19:52.000Z,"Caught up with the different teams of the Inter-Agency Task Force in an e-meeting today.

79,singlionfish999,"Sir, about 3 months ago with limited medical & human resources, aggressive testing was done on the FWs & the dormitories. At that same period of time, arguably there was no aggressive testing done on the other 5M+ Singaporeans, PRs & the other work permit holders. And catchy words like "" hidden reservoirs "" are coined. Today, 3 months later, some of these 5M+ people will be going to vote in the July election..but under the same risky conditions as before. Because no aggressive testing was planned & done for the 5M+, the asymptomatic & the pre symptomatic carriers walk among us now. The task force should not tell us not to be alarmed to see covid cases rising. Probably its OK to say that 3 months ago but now when Phase 2 is rushed into Phase 1 & then the economy is rushed to open again.. the hidden reservoirs are not flushed out yet & the aggressive testing has just barely begun. After 56 days of circuit breaker days, we are still in the same conditions as we were 3 months ago, still intimidated by the infectious covid bug. Sir, how come there are no virologists or experts on the inter ministries task force briefing & debriefing team. If we are not mistaken, the rep from MOH is a surgeon by training. A Singapore version of Dr Anthony Fauci will be useful to answer many medical & infectious disease questions. Thank you Sir.",2020-06-12T15:22:49.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CBVpFDqHOLz/,2020-06-12T14:19:52.000Z,"Caught up with the different teams of the Inter-Agency Task Force in an e-meeting today.

They have been very busy over the past several months, helping our migrant workers in the dorms during this COVID-19 pandemic.

We discussed their work so far, what comes next, and what we can tweak and improve. We have come a long way, and the migrant workers are now starting to go back to work.

Helping our migrant workers has demanded a multi-faceted approach, with teams from many agencies working together. They have deployed both high tech and the personal touch, and put in enormous efforts to tackle the problem.

79,singlionfish999,"Sir, about 3 months ago with limited medical & human resources, aggressive testing was done on the FWs & the dormitories. At that same period of time, arguably there was no aggressive testing done on the other 5M+ Singaporeans, PRs & the other work permit holders. And catchy words like "" hidden reservoirs "" are coined. Today, 3 months later, some of these 5M+ people will be going to vote in the July election..but under the same risky conditions as before. Because no aggressive testing was planned & done for the 5M+, the asymptomatic & the pre symptomatic carriers walk among us now. The task force should not tell us not to be alarmed to see covid cases rising. Probably its OK to say that 3 months ago but now when Phase 2 is rushed into Phase 1 & then the economy is rushed to open again.. the hidden reservoirs are not flushed out yet & the aggressive testing has just barely begun. After 56 days of circuit breaker days, we are still in the same conditions as we were 3 months ago, still intimidated by the infectious covid bug. Sir, how come there are no virologists or experts on the inter ministries task force briefing & debriefing team. If we are not mistaken, the rep from MOH is a surgeon by training. A Singapore version of Dr Anthony Fauci will be useful to answer many medical & infectious disease questions. Thank you Sir.",2020-06-12T15:22:49.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CBVpFDqHOLz/,2020-06-12T14:19:52.000Z,"Caught up with the different teams of the Inter-Agency Task Force in an e-meeting today.

79,singlionfish999,"Sir, about 3 months ago with limited medical & human resources, aggressive testing was done on the FWs & the dormitories. At that same period of time, arguably there was no aggressive testing done on the other 5M+ Singaporeans, PRs & the other work permit holders. And catchy words like "" hidden reservoirs "" are coined. Today, 3 months later, some of these 5M+ people will be going to vote in the July election..but under the same risky conditions as before. Because no aggressive testing was planned & done for the 5M+, the asymptomatic & the pre symptomatic carriers walk among us now. The task force should not tell us not to be alarmed to see covid cases rising. Probably its OK to say that 3 months ago but now when Phase 2 is rushed into Phase 1 & then the economy is rushed to open again.. the hidden reservoirs are not flushed out yet & the aggressive testing has just barely begun. After 56 days of circuit breaker days, we are still in the same conditions as we were 3 months ago, still intimidated by the infectious covid bug. Sir, how come there are no virologists or experts on the inter ministries task force briefing & debriefing team. If we are not mistaken, the rep from MOH is a surgeon by training. A Singapore version of Dr Anthony Fauci will be useful to answer many medical & infectious disease questions.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

Please take care!,2020-05-01T02:27:55.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_mnnUAHmqH/,2020-04-30T11:31:22.000Z,"#MayDay is usually a joyous occasion to celebrate the achievements of our workers and unions. But amidst COVID-19, this year’s event is more sombre.

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

Majulah Singapura! ☝️",2020-04-30T11:56:40.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_mnnUAHmqH/,2020-04-30T11:31:22.000Z,"#MayDay is usually a joyous occasion to celebrate the achievements of our workers and unions. But amidst COVID-19, this year’s event is more sombre.

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

I appreciate all the timely efforts of Singapore and India.  Big fan of yours. Both Singapore and India have been considerate to curb this epidemic.  Although m little disheartened as these were my last days in Singapore. We International Indian students are concerned with our tenancy and student visa as our exams are postponed due to coronavirus outbreak.  I am also unable to vacate my hostel room as India is in lockdown and no international flights. My hostel contract is expiring in a few days. I am also anxious about the exam. All we can do our least is to stay at home with a calm mind and positivity. This too shall pass.  The rest is beyond our control.

May be let barbers n hair dressers to work shorter hours or work on certain days of the week. We can't keep up a good image without a proper hair cut. And not nice n proper for men to keep long hair. One more comment is please allow shops that sell household items like shampoo, detergents  bathing soap or toothpaste n other toiletries to open. The things they are selling are much cheaper than what is sold at ntuc. Eg similar brand of shampoo cost $5.20 at these shop whereas ntuc is charging $7.70.",2020-04-22T03:24:18.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_PEgUuHLXF/,2020-04-21T08:02:03.000Z,"We are now two weeks into our circuit breaker.

No half measures can be tolerate and the messages need to be clear and executed fully. Sir, pls direct your ministers to make it mandatory for wearing masks outside at all times. NO EXCEPTIONS! The current failure to allow exceptions has meant bad actors find loop holes to not wear masks outside (eg joggers) and increase the risk of infection for everyone.

Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless.

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless. May the Singapore spirit shine brightly as we go through this difficult period together. – LHL

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too.

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too.

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless.

40,aclhwanghotmail.com7967,There are not words enough to thank for all that you and your team do,2020-04-17T12:43:00.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_CgdJTnRdB/,2020-04-16T10:56:09.000Z,"Paid an “e-visit” to the team at the Singapore Ministry of Manpower Services Center at Bendemeer Road and met the Interagency Task Force.

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless. May the Singapore spirit shine brightly as we go through this difficult period together. – LHL

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless. May the Singapore spirit shine brightly as we go through this difficult period together. – LHL

Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless.

Please share with your families and friends, especially older Singaporeans.

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

6,k.se.th,"It's important we extract a price on Taiwan for the mask affair. It's ludicrous and provocative for them to ban the exports of essential goods from a factory that we own at a time we need them most. These are not the actions of a friend. Failing a diplomatic solution where the Taiwanese must pay a substantial price not just a token apology, we should take steps to hurt them financially and politically.

I do have one comment when you announce the tightest lockdown - the choice of words may not be so pleasant - circuit breaker - in short CB. It give some real bad connotations as the letters made reference to ""bad language"" in hokien and teochew. Even in western countries it refers to the male organ. It would have been better to just use the Total Lockdown.",2020-04-13T05:45:56.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-y4ttNn17_/,2020-04-10T09:20:17.000Z,"Posted a message on our current COVID-19 situation in English, Chinese and Malay on my Facebook Page, Telegram channel, and the PMO YouTube channel.

28,kopi_ga_dai,Thank you for the proactive management.  I read the news about food sellers and handlers having to wear masks. I hope the coverage extends to them wearing a cap and gloves too.,2020-04-11T12:24:55.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-y4ttNn17_/,2020-04-10T09:20:17.000Z,"Posted a message on our current COVID-19 situation in English, Chinese and Malay on my Facebook Page, Telegram channel, and the PMO YouTube channel. Please share with your families and friends, especially older Singaporeans.

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. – LHL

53,91128655q,尊敬的总理，您好！为了抗疫守国您辛苦了！百忙之中希望您能看得到我们担心新加坡现在因为疫情引发的另一种声音：种族歧视，排斥外来移民！引：【联合早报专栏】“从医院回家没几天，新加坡、中国大陆、台湾、泰国、意大利、瑞士、英国、法国和全球许多城镇，竟遭受冠病病毒的侵袭，宣布封城。我是个缺乏科学知识的老公公，不知此病毒来自何方，出于好奇，到处翻资料，才知道它始于中国武汉，传染速度快得惊人，人们被劝说留在家中，尽量减少出门。”尊敬的总理，作为一个守法公民，最近我们每天关注紧张疫情，每天关注各媒体报章，可是，在早报总能看到类似含沙射影的诱导种族分歧的文字！每当早报发一篇文章，留言区总能看到各种歧视谩骂的评论，真的很伤心！我们很担心在这片安宁的国土也会发生类似欧美歧视亚裔人种霸凌外来移民的现象！请求总理把您反对种族歧视，反对排斥移民的理念传达给各媒体报章杂志，希望他们传递健康的信息给所有国人，保证新加坡国泰民安！,2020-04-11T05:10:29.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-y4ttNn17_/,2020-04-10T09:20:17.000Z,"Posted a message on our current COVID-19 situation in English, Chinese and Malay on my Facebook Page, Telegram channel, and the PMO YouTube channel.

Please share with your families and friends, especially older Singaporeans.

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. – LHL

Please share with your families and friends, especially older Singaporeans.

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. – LHL

140,maryadele8,"Good evening Mr Lee Hsien Loong, my beloved PM. I am very impressed and touched by your concerned speech today. It is a warm, caring and motivating one. Since the pandermic of Covid 19, you and team has done a fantasic and efficient job at 24/7. Day by day, most you are working tirelessly with great effort to identify the cluster to stop the transmission. It is a very tedious job and no short cut business. The chunk of money from the National Reserve to help every Singaporean is a Big Shout! Our solid NR will not happened if our 1st G government has not been frugal, wise and visionary. I am always thankful and grateful to our late founding father, Mr LKY and the old guards. Than comes you and the 4G ministers too are full of integrity and wisdom too. My daughter in the NY who met you once gave non stop of praises and credits  to you and your team for the great Singapore, especially at this turmoil. My beloved PM, words cannot express how grateful and appreciative of the ruling party. To me, you are a successful, awesome, wisest and kind PM. Thank you Sir, wishing you many many more good years to come. My family and I can never thank you enough. Keep healthy and safe, my Awesome PM...🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌🙌💕💕💕💕💕💕💕🙏🙏🙏",2020-04-10T12:20:52.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-y4ttNn17_/,2020-04-10T09:20:17.000Z,"Posted a message on our current COVID-19 situation in English, Chinese and Malay on my Facebook Page, Telegram channel, and the PMO YouTube channel.

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. – LHL

191,jwen2605,"Dear PM @leehsienloong , thank you to you and your team for all the efforts in managing this pressing matter. I teared at your direct speech to the families of the foreign workers. I hope they are able to see what we are seeing, and have the faith in trusting that Singapore will do our best for their loved ones. Thank you for the meticulous efforts in taking care of the people. Beside those frontline measures that are reported, I appreciate the less mentioned efforts in place to keep the elderly active through e-Getai, exercise shows etc. The government didn’t have to, but they did. May I also suggest to use mass media to teach the elderly how to set up applications on their mobile phones to facilitate medical teleconsultations where appropriate. Many of them are on long term follow up for a variety of chronic diseases. They are the vulnerable group, yet are also the ones needing to go to hospital outpatient clinics most for routine follow up that may put them at increased risks. Some of them have the gadgets, but do not know how to maximize the use. Lastly, while a lot had been done, there is the group of old folks and/or less fortunate ones who are living alone and may not have access to technology via smart phones or TV. I have no better solutions how to help them at this moment but I know some may have heightened fears due to disempowerment from a lack of information and/or connection to the world beyond their four walls. Meanwhile, please stay safe, get enough rest, as you and your team continue this long, frontline battle against COVID-19. #sgunited #totaldefence",2020-04-10T10:17:18.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-y4ttNn17_/,2020-04-10T09:20:17.000Z,"Posted a message on our current COVID-19 situation in English, Chinese and Malay on my Facebook Page, Telegram channel, and the PMO YouTube channel.

204,jaffarzuraidah,My family and I will ensure to do all we can to adhere to the lock down.,2020-04-10T09:33:56.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-y4ttNn17_/,2020-04-10T09:20:17.000Z,"Posted a message on our current COVID-19 situation in English, Chinese and Malay on my Facebook Page, Telegram channel, and the PMO YouTube channel. Please share with your families and friends, especially older Singaporeans.

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. – LHL

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. – LHL

We have watched the new coronavirus outbreak in China closely, from the moment the first news came out. Actually we have been preparing for such a situation ever since SARS in 2003. We knew that one day something like that would happen again. So, in a way, this outbreak was a shock, but not a surprise.

9 of the 13 confirmed cases in Singapore are currently being treated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), next to @tantocksenghospital. I visited NCID this morning to see for myself the screening and containment process for affected patients, and to meet and thank some of the people working day and night to treat them. I was very happy with what I saw.

I urge everyone to show understanding and support to our healthcare and medical teams, public officers, the SAF and @pafrenz, who will be distributing masks to Singaporeans over the weekend. We owe them our gratitude for their hard work and dedication.

We have watched the new coronavirus outbreak in China closely, from the moment the first news came out. Actually we have been preparing for such a situation ever since SARS in 2003. We knew that one day something like that would happen again. So, in a way, this outbreak was a shock, but not a surprise.

9 of the 13 confirmed cases in Singapore are currently being treated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), next to @tantocksenghospital. I visited NCID this morning to see for myself the screening and containment process for affected patients, and to meet and thank some of the people working day and night to treat them.
