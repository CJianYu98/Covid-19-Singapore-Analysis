The new masks can be rewashed up to 50 times while retaining the antimicrobial performance. Many of you should be familiar with the collection process by now – just bring your NRIC or government-issued ID with a barcode to the vending machines at your RCs, CCs or bus interchanges. There are four sizes of masks available, so do make sure you pick the right one. Do note that the size S masks can only be collected at CCs, Plaza Singapura, and Temasek Shophouse.

A gentle reminder that there is no need to rush! There is enough stock for everyone and you have up till 13 Dec to pick up your masks. 😷 – LHL",45,2020-11-30T08:55:56.000Z,leehsienloong,2453722535318156746

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHI’s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. – LHL

Our soldiers have played an active part in the fight against COVID-19, from contact tracing to health surveillance, managing quarantine facilities, and taking care of the migrant worker dormitories. They may not have trained specifically for these tasks, but their mission remains unchanged — to protect and safeguard the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans.

Our SAF must remain strong and vigilant, especially as we head into an uncertain future. I am deeply grateful to all the men and women of the SAF, and their families, for their steadfast dedication and service to our nation. – LHL

Greg asked me about a variety of issues, not only the current COVID-19 situation, but also China-US relations, the CPTPP, and climate change.

It was a pity we could not meet in person. But I am glad for the opportunity to remind our Australian friends that life still goes on, and we will adjust to the new norm. We are getting used to temperature checks, contact tracing forms, safe distancing rules, and frequent reminders to wash our hands. As long as we take the necessary precautions and remember to be socially responsible, we can get through this season together. – LHL
