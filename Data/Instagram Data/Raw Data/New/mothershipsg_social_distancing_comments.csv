75,rishiprasath,"Honestly nobody ever really needed to snitch. Some of the guests who attended the wedding as influencers were not only careless with social distancing measures but also with what they post online.  I won't mention who were the influencers who did that , but I am following them on Instagram and I did come across posts about the wedding from them first before this post from mothership. Now back to the point , nobody really had to snitch, such posts about the event  which I mentioned earlier already made its way to social media . For all to see. Members of law enforcement enforcement would already be following Maxi or other celebs involved in the event and found them out . Now , given that those who did not adhere to the SDM measures can be easily traced by those posts ,that in my opinion would be a really horrifying spot to be right now, damn! Now I do understand that SDM measures must be adhered  to deal with this pandemic. But this reminded me of another lesson taught long ago. Please be careful of what you post! The internet is a dangerous world on its own.

BC she was not aware of this being absolutely fucked up or wrong. This is just MY ASSUMPTION based on how the post was phrased. According to the previous post on mothership she wasn't aware it was inappropriate.. she needed another female trainer to tell her about it ... meaning he most probably MANIPULATED her into thinking he's doing his job.
