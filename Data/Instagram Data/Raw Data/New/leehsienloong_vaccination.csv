⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Celebrations this year have been subdued due to the pandemic. People are meeting in smaller groups and making fewer house visits. Vaccinations for seniors are underway, and progressively for the rest of our population.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If the global pandemic abates, I hope next year we can hold our usual boisterous celebrations, and usher in the Year of the Tiger together with a roar! Wishing everyone a safe and healthy Chap Goh Mei! 祝大家元宵节快乐! – LHL

I recorded this video for the launch of Global Citizen’s (@glblctzn) Recover Better Together campaign. I shared how Singapore is contributing to international efforts, like the COVAX Advance Market Commitment. 

The virus has caused turmoil around the world. Singapore must do its part to foster the global recovery, or else all our own efforts will be for naught. Until everyone is safe, no one is safe. – LHL

I took stock of our COVID-19 situation. We want to maintain our current stable position and get Singaporeans vaccinated quickly. The vaccines will take us one big step forward, but not back to business as usual, as many countries will not complete their vaccinations within this year. We have to live with the virus for many more years to come, maybe even permanently.

I also shared my thoughts on our external situation, and the outlook for the future. The next few years will not be easy. We can’t tell exactly how the world will change after the pandemic, but as long as we work together, hold fast to our principles, and keep faith both with our pioneers as well as generations yet unborn, we will emerge stronger and thrive for many years to come. – LHL

Our vaccination programme is proceeding smoothly. The latest delivery will allow us to continue as planned. More vaccination centres will open soon across Singapore. I hope seniors will book their appointments when their turn comes, so that we can all stay protected together. 

Until then, do continue to follow safety regulations, wear masks, and remember safe distancing! – LHL

A big thank you to all our workers for your contributions to Singapore, especially during COVID-19.
2020 has been a year like no other. Many workers have had their wages and livelihoods affected by the pandemic, particularly those in hard-hit sectors. Frontline and essential workers have made many sacrifices, to keep their families and all of us safe.

We do not know when this pandemic will end, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel. We’re closer to getting a vaccine, and starting to reopen our borders. In the meantime, stay safe and stay strong. 
During this pandemic, labour MPs have been working overtime helping union workers, while the Air Transport Executive Staff Union has been working with SIA and other airlines to assist ground staff and protect their interests. Therefore, I nominate NTUC Assistant Secretary-General @patricktaytg and President of the AESU Daniel Loh to show your appreciation next! – LHL

When nominated:
1. All you need to do is record yourself “receiving” the drink from the person who nominated you and give a toast accompanied by a note of appreciation in the post.
2. “Pass” the drink on by nominating two others.
3. Tag @UHeartsg for us to keep track of the donations, and remember to make your post public!

We discussed strengthening cooperation between our countries amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and welcomed the resumption of essential travel between Singapore and Japan. 

Singapore and Japan are like-minded partners enjoying a longstanding close relationship. We have many opportunities to work together, e.g. in vaccine multilateralism, third-country infrastructure cooperation, and preparing for the digital economy. We also both support multilateralism and are working to sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership by the end of this year. 

I look forward to partnering Prime Minister Suga to strengthen ties between our countries, and hope to meet him in person soon. – LHL

But our efforts alone are not enough. A global pandemic requires a coordinated global response, especially in scientific research and government actions. ⠀
⠀
Speaking to the virtual #GlobalGoalUnite Summit by @glblctzn, I emphasised the importance of vaccine multilateralism in our common fight against COVID-19.⠀
⠀
Singapore looks forward to working with the @europeancommission and like-minded countries, as well as the @who, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and @gavialliance, to develop vaccines and distribute them fairly and expeditiously to people in all countries. ⠀

The search for vaccines may take some time, but we will maximise our chances of tackling COVID-19 by working together. – LHL⠀

⠀
In my intervention, I spoke about strengthening cooperation by sharing technologies to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, working as a region to procure an equitable, steady and affordable supply of treatments and vaccines, and upholding the international trading system and maintaining supply chain connectivity.⠀

How we respond to this crisis will decide whether #ASEAN forges ahead of the competition or falls behind. We must stand united to overcome the challenges ahead, enhance regional economic integration, and work towards the long-term safety and prosperity of the region.⠀

The Global Vaccine Summit is a donor pledging conference to fund the immunisation of children in poor countries against deadly but preventable diseases. But in the time of COVID-19, yesterday’s virtual event, which was co-hosted by the UK government and @gavialliance, was also an opportunity for countries to come together to coordinate efforts to develop and produce a COVID-19 vaccine. You can watch the video on my Facebook Page.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I was invited to share Singapore’s efforts in this endeavour. Aside from our US$13 million contribution towards international efforts to combat the virus, we are investing in R&D on diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, as well as building up our vaccine manufacturing capacity.

We are all in the same fight together and Singapore will do our part in this global call for action. – LHL

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

Since our last call nearly two months ago, our countries have moved from strict circuit breaking measures to a gradual, careful easing of restrictions. We talked about technological solutions and shared our strategies, including possible collaboration on vaccine development.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I was pleased to mark the one-year anniversary of the Singapore-New Zealand Enhanced Partnership, and look forward to expanding our cooperation with new initiatives that both sides value. During the global pandemic, we have spoken up against protectionism and for keeping supply chains intact. Earlier in April, we received 20 tonnes of New Zealand’s fine produce, while New Zealand received medical supplies on the return journey.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The times are challenging, but we are dealing with the problems one by one, and planning ahead. As part of safe reopening, we are discussing creating a green lane for short-term essential travel between our countries. I hope this works out, and it will not be long before PM Ardern and I can meet in person again. – LHL

Like the rest of the world, I hope that a treatment or vaccine will happen sooner than later. But we must be psychologically prepared for a long battle ahead, and learn to live with the virus by adjusting our routines and adopting new norms.

It was called by Saudi Arabia, holding the G20 Presidency this year, to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak has permeated and changed all the norms of our daily lives — including the way business is conducted.

This is a global crisis, and needs a global solution. I called on the leaders to collaborate in three areas:

1. Public health — helping one another fight the outbreak;
2. Our economies — to save businesses and our citizens’ jobs; 
3. Science and research — to find a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, and prepare for future pandemics.

The pandemic will eventually end, but it will not be the last one the world faces. We must learn from our experiences, and emerge stronger and more resilient from them. – LHL (MCI Photo by Zinkie Aw)",157,2020-03-26T15:17:20.000Z,leehsienloong,2273445468398558402
