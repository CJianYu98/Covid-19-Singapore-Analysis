A widely respected unionist, Encik Mahmud first got involved in union work when he joined the Singapore Traction Company (STC) as a bus conductor. He became close friends with Mr Ahmad Ibrahim, Mr Devan Nair and Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and won the support of many unions.

Encik Mahmud was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 1963 General Election, and subsequently to the Parliament of newly independent Singapore. In the years when Singapore was in Malaysia, Malay PAP leaders, including Encik Mahmud, Othman Wok, Rahim Ishak, and others, came under enormous pressure by UMNO politicians to choose race over nation. But Encik Mahmud and his comrades held firm in their conviction. Their courage and leadership kept alive the vision of a multiracial Singapore, and enabled it to become the reality today.
 
Mr Lee was forever grateful for Encik Mahmud’s stout-hearted support at this critical moment in our history, and they kept in touch. At Mr Lee’s state funeral, Encik Mahmud was one of the pallbearers.
 
Encik Mahmud may have left us, but his legacy will live on. My thoughts are with his family in this time of loss. – LHL

Many dealt with situations out of their comfort zone – serving on the frontlines, in hospitals, migrant workers’ dormitories, and at the border. Others worked long hours from offices and homes, to come up with solutions to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, from schools to businesses, travel and our vulnerable groups.⠀
⠀
There were inevitably shortcomings to our COVID-19 response. We will learn from them, improve our processes and do better. But as we adjusted and strengthened our responses to the pandemic, our officers rose to the occasion, and pulled together as one public service.⠀
⠀
I hope you will join me in saluting our public officers. Without them, we wouldn’t have got thus far. The fight is not over, the battle is far from won. But together, we will overcome. – LHL⠀

It takes over from the Inter-agency Task Force (ITF), which has been doing COVID-19 operations in the migrant worker dormitories since April.⠀
 ⠀
I am grateful to the ACE and ITF teams for their hard work. They have been testing our migrant workers, plus delivering meals, providing medical care, keeping them safe and finally bringing the dorm outbreak well under control. It has been an enormous task, on a scale beyond what most Singaporeans are aware of.⠀
 ⠀
We are now transitioning to a more permanent arrangement with ACE. The migrant workers are returning to work. We have to ensure that they can work safely, live safely, and rest safely, to prevent COVID-19 from coming back. We need support from employers, dorm operators, management, and non-government organisations. We also ask for the understanding of the migrant workers themselves, as we strive to keep them safe and well.⠀

Had a fruitful meeting with Communist Party of China Politburo member and Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Office Director Yang Jiechi. As you would expect, we discussed our respective COVID-19 situations. Despite the pandemic, both sides have kept up contacts through phone and video calls. Singapore and China had earlier agreed on a “fast lane” for essential business and official travel between both countries. At the moment this covers six Chinese provinces and municipalities, and hopefully this list will grow if the situation stays under control.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic relations. Our ties with China are substantial and multi-faceted. I am confident that by working with each other and with the international community, we can make more progress in the post-COVID world. – LHL

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This is not a normal election because we are not living in normal times. The central focus of this Manifesto is how we will work together to overcome the crisis of a generation.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe and prevent COVID-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- How to provide one another care and support, so that together we can keep ourselves safe amidst the uncertainties ahead.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Beyond COVID-19, this Manifesto also sets out the PAP’s longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, beyond the next 5-year term of government — 10, 20 years down the road.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government. What the PAP promises, it delivers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We need a strong and capable leadership team, with the full support of all Singaporeans, to put our Manifesto into action. That is the way to secure our lives, our jobs, and the Future of Singapore.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.
