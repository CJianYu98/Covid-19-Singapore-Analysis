⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Celebrations this year have been subdued due to the pandemic. People are meeting in smaller groups and making fewer house visits. Vaccinations for seniors are underway, and progressively for the rest of our population.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If the global pandemic abates, I hope next year we can hold our usual boisterous celebrations, and usher in the Year of the Tiger together with a roar! Wishing everyone a safe and healthy Chap Goh Mei! 祝大家元宵节快乐! – LHL

I recorded this video for the launch of Global Citizen’s (@glblctzn) Recover Better Together campaign. I shared how Singapore is contributing to international efforts, like the COVAX Advance Market Commitment. 

The virus has caused turmoil around the world. Singapore must do its part to foster the global recovery, or else all our own efforts will be for naught. Until everyone is safe, no one is safe. – LHL

I took stock of our COVID-19 situation. We want to maintain our current stable position and get Singaporeans vaccinated quickly. The vaccines will take us one big step forward, but not back to business as usual, as many countries will not complete their vaccinations within this year. We have to live with the virus for many more years to come, maybe even permanently.

I also shared my thoughts on our external situation, and the outlook for the future. The next few years will not be easy. We can’t tell exactly how the world will change after the pandemic, but as long as we work together, hold fast to our principles, and keep faith both with our pioneers as well as generations yet unborn, we will emerge stronger and thrive for many years to come. – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/CLdyOX-LgCs/,"Greetings from Mars. 

In the wee hours of this morning SG time, @NASA's Perseverance rover landed safely on the red planet after a 7-month journey from Earth.

It is a remarkable feat of science, engineering, and space exploration. This latest NASA rover builds on the success of the previous four Mars rover missions. But it was complicated by the pandemic – the many teams involved had to collaborate, construct the vehicle, and plan the mission amid COVID-19 safety measures. ‘Perseverance’ was aptly named indeed!

The rover has landed in Jezero crater, which scientists believe was an ancient lake. It is a good spot to look for evidence of microbial life that may have flourished on Mars eons ago, before the planet dried up. In its two-year mission, Perseverance will collect rock and soil samples that will eventually be returned to Earth in future missions. It will also carry out tech experiments in the Martian environment, including flying a mini robotic helicopter (this is very difficult as Mars has a very thin atmosphere, less than 1% of Earth’s).

Even in troubled times, it is important to press on with scientific endeavour, not only in areas with tangible benefits, but also where returns are not immediate or obvious. Seeking to explore and understand the world around us and beyond is vital to the human spirit, and the progress of humanity. – LHL",71,2021-02-19T07:27:39.000Z,leehsienloong,2512385051424931142

Our vaccination programme is proceeding smoothly. The latest delivery will allow us to continue as planned. More vaccination centres will open soon across Singapore. I hope seniors will book their appointments when their turn comes, so that we can all stay protected together. 

Until then, do continue to follow safety regulations, wear masks, and remember safe distancing! – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/CLWaOzHrd9Z/,"As DPM @hengsweekeat announced in his #SGBudget2021 speech today, the FY2020 budget deficit was 13.9% of GDP, the largest ever. This was what we needed, to keep Singaporeans safe and protect their livelihoods during COVID-19.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This year, we will continue to help Singaporeans and businesses through the $11 billion COVID-19 Resilience Package. Although we are again running a deficit, it is much smaller – only 2.2% of GDP. Things are gradually returning to normal.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
While grappling with the pandemic, we must not neglect the future. Hence the Budget has many items that build our capabilities and competitiveness. When the sun shines again, we must be ready to seize the new opportunities.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This “can do” spirit helped us overcome the last financial crisis. With the resilience that our people have shown this time, I am confident that we can do it again.

These stricter measures will surely disappoint all of us looking forward to celebrating CNY. But just look at the countries near and far experiencing repeated surges in cases, and you will see why we need to stay vigilant.

It’s exactly 1 year since our first confirmed COVID-19 case in Singapore. The year has gone by at breakneck pace, as we all struggled to cope with the unprecedented chaos and disruption to our lives.

⠀
Mr Biden takes office at a time when many pressing challenges confront the US and the rest of the world, not least dealing with COVID-19. Strong American leadership will decisively contribute to our collective recovery, and the shape of the post-pandemic world. ⠀
⠀
This US election was contentious and bitter. I wish Mr Biden every success in his endeavours to heal the divisions. National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman put it beautifully in her poem she recited at the inauguration: “So we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seek harm to none and harmony for all.”⠀
⠀
Singapore has been a long-standing strategic, defence and economic partner of the US. I look forward to working with Mr Biden and his Administration to strengthen America’s engagement of Asia and ASEAN. I hope to meet him face-to-face as soon as we are able to, either in Singapore or Washington DC. – LHL⠀

This harvest festival is celebrated by the Tamil community over four days, from yesterday till Saturday, with each day accorded with special significance and practices. You may know about the joyful custom of letting a pot of milk, rice and jaggery boil over, representing abundance and prosperity. This is usually done on the second day (which is today) and is also what gives the festival its name, as Pongal means to ‘overflow’.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This year’s celebrations are somewhat subdued due to the pandemic. There’s still the Pongal light up at Little India to enjoy and plenty of online activities to tune in to here: https://pongal.sg/

A big thank you to all our workers for your contributions to Singapore, especially during COVID-19.
2020 has been a year like no other. Many workers have had their wages and livelihoods affected by the pandemic, particularly those in hard-hit sectors. Frontline and essential workers have made many sacrifices, to keep their families and all of us safe.

We do not know when this pandemic will end, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel. We’re closer to getting a vaccine, and starting to reopen our borders. In the meantime, stay safe and stay strong. 
During this pandemic, labour MPs have been working overtime helping union workers, while the Air Transport Executive Staff Union has been working with SIA and other airlines to assist ground staff and protect their interests. Therefore, I nominate NTUC Assistant Secretary-General @patricktaytg and President of the AESU Daniel Loh to show your appreciation next! – LHL

For every #toast2U hashtag, NTUC Income will pledge $2 to the NTUC U Care Fund, which helps low-income members and their families through various assistance programmes to defray their cost of living and children’s school expenses, as well as members whose livelihood had been affected by Covid-19.
When nominated:
1. All you need to do is record yourself “receiving” the drink from the person who nominated you and give a toast accompanied by a note of appreciation in the post.
2. “Pass” the drink on by nominating two others.
3. Tag @UHeartsg for us to keep track of the donations, and remember to make your post public!

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought on serious challenges for every country, including the United States and Singapore. At this critical time, the duty of a leader is to unite the people, strengthen their trust in the government, and see the nation through the crisis.

With his long history and deep experience as a former US Vice President and US Senator, Mr Biden is well-placed to lead his country through the challenges ahead.

Mr Biden is familiar with the US’ long-standing, multifaceted and robust partnership with Singapore. As Vice President, he visited Singapore in 2013. Three years later, when I visited Washington D.C. in August 2016, he made time to host me to lunch too.

Mr Biden, Singapore looks forward to working with you and your Administration to deepen the partnership between our two countries, enhance the US’ role in Asia-Pacific, and overcome COVID-19. You can count on Singapore to remain a friend and partner. – LHL

The theme was “Reimagining the next normal for Asia and the World”. I shared what we have been doing to see Singapore through this COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;

To wrap up our discussion, moderator Oliver Tonby, Chairman of McKinsey & Company Asia, asked for my views on good leadership.&nbsp;

My answer: a good leader must muster a capable team that you can trust, and tap on others who know more than you. You must also be psychologically prepared for surprises and setbacks, and make the best decision based on the knowledge you have. Above all, focus on your responsibilities and fulfil your duty to your people, regardless of any personal consequences to yourself. – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/CGLsDmFAKGc/,"10 October is World Mental Health Day. The @WHO held an online advocacy event yesterday to raise awareness, and I shared a few words on what we are doing in Singapore.

Ensuring access to quality mental healthcare for every citizen is a major priority for us. COVID-19 has made this especially vital, as more people face stresses, pressures and disruptions to their lives and livelihoods. We’ve set up a National CARE Hotline (1800-202-6868) and a COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce, to help all those who need it.

One of the biggest hurdles dealing with mental health problems is the stigma. But this is also why the best and most reliable support system is the people around us. If we know someone having a tough time, even a simple “how are you?” is a good way to show we care, and to reassure them it’s okay to talk about their problems.&nbsp;

In Singapore, 1 in 7 will suffer from a mental health condition at some point in their lives. Just as we take care of each others’ physical health by wearing masks, let us also work together to understand mental health better, to care for one another during these difficult times. – LHL

⠀
During the circuit breaker, the Silver Generation Office (SGO) stepped up its care for the most vulnerable seniors. It mobilised SG Ambassadors to assist seniors in various ways – distributing food packs, shopping for groceries and collecting medication, so that seniors could stay home safely. SG Ambassadors also called them regularly by phone, to monitor their well-being, and most importantly, assure them someone was looking out for them.⠀
 ⠀
Many volunteers stepped forward to support SGO’s efforts, including 500 public officers. Since February when the COVID-19 outbreak began, SGO has engaged more than 83,000 vulnerable seniors and responded to close to 3,000 requests for assistance.⠀
 ⠀
1 October is the International Day of Older Persons. I am glad that we are also paying tribute to SG Ambassadors and all who volunteered at SGO during this difficult period. You can read their stories in #SGOCares (go.gov.sg/sgocares), an e-book that was launched by SGO.⠀

Thank you SGO and our SG Ambassadors, for your service and care towards our seniors, especially during these challenging times. – LHL⠀

My thanks to our grassroots team for their creative efforts in organising these fun activities for all to enjoy safely despite the pandemic.&nbsp;

If you missed the event, you can watch it on the Teck Ghee Facebook Page, or my Facebook Page. I hope that this time next year, we will be able to celebrate at our usual venue at Bishan-AMK Park once again.

Alex and Fahmi take over from Teo Ho Pin and @maliki_osman, who are stepping down after many years of leadership and contributions.

Our Mayors are chairpersons of the Community Development Councils (CDCs) for the five respective districts. The CDCs play an important role in our social support system. They not only implement government programmes, but also serve as eyes and ears on the ground. They connect with communities, and identify emerging needs and gaps in social support. CDCs deliver services with a human touch, in a way that government agencies that operate on a national scale find harder to do. 

CDCs work quietly to fulfil their mission, but in times of crisis, their contributions are vital. Since COVID-19, the CDCs have rolled out more than 70 initiatives. The CDC Vouchers Scheme is a good example. The five CDCs launched this community scheme to help 400,000 households defray the cost of living, while supporting local businesses through the COVID-19 period.
 
Congratulations to all five Mayors on their appointments. I wish them every success in their new term!

The UN has played a key role giving all countries, including small states like Singapore, a voice in the international system. It must remain relevant and fit for purpose, to address current and future global challenges, including pandemics, climate change, extremist terrorism, sustainable development and cybersecurity. 

Singapore is committed to supporting the UN and the values and ideals of the UN Charter. I wish the UN a Happy 75th Birthday and every success in the years ahead. – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/CFMMXyUM4wO/,"Even as we fight COVID-19, we cannot take our eyes off other threats. We are redoubling our efforts to combat dengue, and one way is to use mosquitoes against themselves.

I visited the @nea_sg – Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHI’s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. – LHL

When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs don’t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you haven’t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHI’s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. – LHL

It takes over from the Inter-agency Task Force (ITF), which has been doing COVID-19 operations in the migrant worker dormitories since April.⠀
 ⠀
I am grateful to the ACE and ITF teams for their hard work. They have been testing our migrant workers, plus delivering meals, providing medical care, keeping them safe and finally bringing the dorm outbreak well under control. It has been an enormous task, on a scale beyond what most Singaporeans are aware of.⠀
 ⠀
We are now transitioning to a more permanent arrangement with ACE. The migrant workers are returning to work. We have to ensure that they can work safely, live safely, and rest safely, to prevent COVID-19 from coming back. We need support from employers, dorm operators, management, and non-government organisations. We also ask for the understanding of the migrant workers themselves, as we strive to keep them safe and well.⠀

Thank you all once again for the good work! – LHL⠀

Never was the opening of a medical facility so timely and fortuitous, as NCID found itself at the forefront of our fight against COVID-19 just a few months later.&nbsp;

We were lucky that NCID was up and running before COVID-19 hit us, but this did not happen by chance. It was the result of years of planning and hard work by government agencies, medical and research institutions, and healthcare partners. Without this, our response to the pandemic would have been very different.

NCID, and all our medical and healthcare institutions and workers, remain our first line of defence against the pandemic. Our situation is stable for now, but the battle is far from won. Let us each continue to do our part by staying vigilant and socially responsible. Congratulations and happy birthday, NCID! – LHL

⠀
This time, our work is cut out for us – not only to deal with the immediate threat of COVID-19, but also to plan for an uncertain new future in its wake. ⠀
⠀
In this climate of economic uncertainty, it is only natural to feel anxious about our social support, and competition from foreigners. I want to reassure Singaporeans that the Government will always be on your side. This is why we are adjusting our work pass schemes, and tightening the Fair Consideration Framework. However, please remember that we must stay open to the world, to attract businesses to set up here, and in turn create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans. ⠀
⠀
During the clarifications, I explained the mindset we should have in elections. Voters are choosing the party they wish to govern Singapore; your vote matters. Vote because you truly support the party, whether PAP or opposition, and not because you want ‘the best of both worlds’. ⠀
⠀
Singaporean voters have spoken, and I respect their choice. The Government will do its part to work with the opposition to keep Parliament a constructive forum for debate. ⠀
⠀
Singapore has survived many life or death crises before. Each time we survived, and came back stronger. Like all previous crises, COVID-19 will be the occasion for us to do better, emerge stronger, and more united than before.

Had a fruitful meeting with Communist Party of China Politburo member and Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Office Director Yang Jiechi. As you would expect, we discussed our respective COVID-19 situations. Despite the pandemic, both sides have kept up contacts through phone and video calls. Singapore and China had earlier agreed on a “fast lane” for essential business and official travel between both countries. At the moment this covers six Chinese provinces and municipalities, and hopefully this list will grow if the situation stays under control.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic relations. Our ties with China are substantial and multi-faceted. I am confident that by working with each other and with the international community, we can make more progress in the post-COVID world. – LHL

Our local attractions have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but with the gradual re-opening of our economy in Phase 2, most have reopened with the necessary precautionary measures in place such as safe distancing, temperature-taking, and safe entry.

No one can tell how long international travel restrictions will last. COVID-19 will remain a problem for a long time yet, and we will all have to learn to live with it. In the meanwhile, take this time to explore our island — from our world-famous tourist attractions to the places off the beaten path. You may be surprised by what you will discover. – LHL

We had a good discussion on how we can do more together as we deal with the pandemic.

Japan is one of the countries with whom we are discussing setting up reciprocal ‘green lanes’, to resume essential travel with the necessary safety precautions. We are proceeding cautiously, as COVID-19 is still very much a threat. But this will be an important step forward in restoring connectivity between countries, and adjusting to life with COVID-19. – LHL

This year, despite COVID-19, we are still holding the Parade — as a symbol of our solidarity, and also to salute those on our frontline, fighting the pandemic.

We need our unity and resilience now more than ever. As we have seen in other countries, the danger of a resurgence of cases is ever present. We also need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Let us brace ourselves for the trials ahead, so that many years from now, when our grandchildren celebrate National Day, they will look back and say that this generation stood together, sacrificed for one another, and built Singapore together.

Let us show the world that whatever the challenges, Singaporeans will stay united, and prevail once more.

I wish all Singaporeans a very happy National Day! 🇸🇬&nbsp;

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Just as Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Ramadan were observed differently amid the COVID-19 pandemic, adjustments too have been made to this year’s Aidiladha celebration. Muslims have had to defer their annual Haj pilgrimage, and the Korban rites will be done overseas instead of at local mosques. Nevertheless, the spirit of Aidiladha remains, and several mosques will be conducting Hari Raya Haji prayers for congregants.

One day, the pandemic will be over. Until then, let us all remain vigilant and do our part by practising social responsibility and observing safe distancing measures.

The project has been suspended since last April, partly because of political transitions in Malaysia, and partly because of COVID-19. Officials on both sides put in many months of hard work into the intense negotiations, in order to complete the revised agreements. Work can now at last resume.

The RTS Link is a valuable project to both sides. It will improve connectivity and people-to-people ties between Singapore and Johor. Once operational, it will ease congestion on the Causeway. So it was apt that we marked this milestone with a bilateral ceremony at the Causeway, which has connected our two countries for almost a hundred years.

I will use this mandate responsibly to deal with COVID-19 and the economic downturn, and to take us safely through the crisis, and beyond.⠀
⠀
At the same time, the results reflect the pain and uncertainty that Singaporeans feel in this crisis. This was not a feel-good election, but one where people are facing real problems, and expect more rough weather to come. There were also real concerns raised during the campaign that we must address.⠀
⠀
I congratulate the Workers’ Party for their strong performance. I look forward to them participating in and contributing to the debate in Parliament, and to the national debate, as we deal with the urgent issues before us.⠀
⠀
My thanks to our PAP activists and candidates for your dedication, loyalty and hard work. Thank you also to all public officers mobilised for election duties, who ensured that Singaporeans could vote safely during this unprecedented GE. Finally, thank you to all voters for your patience and understanding. My team will continue to serve Singaporeans, whichever party you voted for.⠀
⠀
The work of the new government begins today. My government will work with all Singaporeans to overcome our challenges and emerge stronger. With this election behind us, let us now work as one Singapore, to secure Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future. – LHL

I had sent the card 36 years ago to his father, who had saved it all these years, and passed away just a few months ago aged 103.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As PM, my duty is not just to keep Singapore intact through this crisis. I must also hand it over to the next generation, in good shape and into good hands. In this election, the @papsingapore has refreshed and reinforced its team with 27 new candidates. They come from many different backgrounds and experiences. They will represent you and walk with you, as we go through the difficult months and years ahead.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
#GE2020 has been an unusual campaign. With COVID-19, we could not gather and hold rallies as we usually do. Still, the virtual campaign has seen a full and serious discussion of issues, and all candidates have had ample opportunity to put forward their views to Singaporeans.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As you reflect on the campaign on Cooling Off Day tomorrow, and cast your vote on Friday, please think about what is at stake. When you vote, you will be choosing the team that you trust, to lead us through this grave crisis, and on to a brighter future.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My thanks to all candidates for a hard fought campaign. Thank you too to all who will be on duty on Polling Day, making sure that Singaporeans can vote safely.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Lastly, to my supporters and volunteers who have done so much to look after residents in Ang Mo Kio, and to Singaporeans who have supported me all these years in politics: thank you for sharing my journey. I hope you will elect my PAP team to continue serving you, to secure #OurLivesOurJobsOurFuture. – LHL⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀",294,2020-07-08T14:35:51.000Z,leehsienloong,2348801258161220132

- Our Lives: We are still in the thick of the fight against COVID-19 and will have to sustain this effort for perhaps a year, or longer.

- Our Jobs: The key focus of the government in the coming months and years must be jobs. We are investing heavily to reskill Singaporeans, and growing our economy to create more good jobs.

- Our Future: Even as we deal with immediate priorities of COVID-19, we must not lose sight of our longer-term mission to improve Singapore.

We will need the best possible leadership and a solidly united population to see us safely through the pandemic and economic pain, and to lead us beyond, into better days ahead.

Generations of Singaporeans have trusted in the PAP, and worked with us to build this country. Your support has been our biggest strength, and the PAP has never let you down.

We will continue to invest in Singapore so that your children and grandchildren can look forward to a brighter future.

I will devote all my energy to this effort, as I have done for 15 years as PM. But I cannot do this alone – I need your full support, and an able team of Ministers and MPs to help me.

In my intervention, I spoke about strengthening cooperation by sharing technologies to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, working as a region to procure an equitable, steady and affordable supply of treatments and vaccines, and upholding the international trading system and maintaining supply chain connectivity.⠀

How we respond to this crisis will decide whether #ASEAN forges ahead of the competition or falls behind. We must stand united to overcome the challenges ahead, enhance regional economic integration, and work towards the long-term safety and prosperity of the region.⠀

⠀
Boon Wan has made immense contributions to Singapore, and left deep impressions on those he worked with, including me personally as a dear friend. In fact, it was Boon Wan who suggested in 2012 that I venture into social media. But for him you might not even be reading this here on Instagram!⠀
⠀
No task was ever too daunting for Boon Wan. He was in the Ministry of Health when SARS hit us. The hard lessons we learnt from SARS prepared us to deal with COVID-19. Later as the Minister he reformed MediShield and MediSave, and introduced ElderShield, thus keeping healthcare affordable for all Singaporeans. ⠀
⠀
As Minister of National Development, he ramped up the HDB building programme, reducing BTO waiting times.⠀
⠀
As Transport Minister, and later Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure, Boon Wan tackled one of his biggest challenges – the reliability of the MRT system. He succeeded in his own quiet and unassuming way, apparently effortlessly but actually through a prodigious amount of hard work.⠀
⠀
Boon Wan had a special knack of explaining nettlesome issues to Singaporeans. His colleagues could always depend on him for generous and sound advice. I am happy that he has agreed to continue sharing his experience and wisdom even after retirement. ⠀
⠀
On behalf of all Singaporeans, and especially residents in his Sembawang constituency, I thank Boon Wan for all that he has done, and wish him a happy, healthy, and well-deserved rest. We are deeply grateful to him, and his dauntless spirit is an inspiration to us all. – LHL⠀ ⠀

The road to recovery after COVID-19 will be one of Singapore’s greatest tests. To overcome the challenges ahead, we must stand completely united as one people. A general election now, when things are relatively stable, will clear the decks and give the Government a fresh five-year mandate. Then, we can focus on the agenda of recovery, and the difficult decisions that will have to be made.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Many of you are understandably concerned about safety at this time. To keep voters safe, the Elections Department will implement a number of added precautions for Polling Day. There will be more polling stations to reduce crowding. Voters will be given specific time slots for voting. Seniors will also be given priority to vote before others.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This GE will be like no other we have experienced. Not just because of the special arrangements, but also the grave issues at stake. The new Government will have critical decisions to make, which will impact and influence your lives and livelihoods.

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

Tomorrow is the first day of Syawal, which marks the end of Ramadan. Just as Ramadan was observed differently amid COVID-19, so too we have had to adjust Hari Raya celebrations.

Normally, Muslim families would be visiting the mosque tomorrow morning followed by the traditional Hari Raya visits. Instead, this year, they will join the ‘live’ takbir on radio and online, and listen to the Hari Raya khutbah by the Mufti from their homes. Virtual visits will replace actual ones. The jalan raya will be missed; still, with creativity and technology, families have found ways to connect with loved ones and friends, and celebrate together while physically apart.

Besides the annual Hari Raya eve variety show on @mediacorp_suria tonight, @mediacorpch5 also showed a special programme, so that all Singaporeans could join in to celebrate with our Muslim friends.

This pandemic will eventually pass, but the spirit of Hari Raya will endure, and the hope of brighter days ahead. I wish all Muslim friends a joyful and blessed celebration. – LHL",100,2020-05-23T13:39:56.000Z,leehsienloong,2315430706886723058

Namun, tahun ini, mereka akan mendengar laungan takbir Raya dah khutbah oleh Mufti Negara, menerusi radio dan media sosial dari rumah masing-masing. Jalan Raya dibuat di alam maya. Walaupun tidak bersama secara fisikal, keluarga Muslim memanfaatkan teknologi secara kreatif untuk mengeratkan tali persaudaraan dengan ahli keluarga dan teman-teman di Hari Raya ini.

Selain rancangan tahunan Suria, Sinar Lebaran yang disiarkan malam ini, Saluran 5 juga menyiarkan rancangan khas untuk mengajak rakyat Singapura yang lain sama-sama menyemarakkan lagi sambutan Hari Raya bersama masyarakat Islam kita.

An important part of opening up is keeping trade and supply lines open. Many countries have imposed export restrictions, particularly for critical supplies like drugs and medical equipment, even face masks. Others have shut down logistics nodes like ports. But it is in everyone’s interest to keep trade flowing and supply chains connected, and to rebuild confidence in the global trading system.

Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers.

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

PM Ardern shared that after New Zealand implemented their measures, numbers only started to come down on Day 11. We are only in Day 3 and still have a long way to go. If we all comply strictly, as the New Zealanders have done, hopefully by our Day 11 we too will see positive results.

PM Ardern and I also discussed how we can support each other during this time, including keeping supply chains intact between the two countries. Both Singapore and New Zealand will continue to do our part in this global fight against COVID-19.

The “circuit breaker” is essential to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. As we expected, daily numbers of new cases are still going up, and faster than before. We must bring the numbers down, and the only way is for all of us to observe the circuit breaker measures strictly.

Stay at home, except when you have to go out to do essential work or buy food. If you need to go to the market, stagger your timing too. Avoid being part of the crowd. This is not a month long holiday, when we can go out for jalan jalan or to meet up with friends.

Glad that all Members of Parliament supported the measures. They raised useful ideas to improve the policies to support businesses, workers and households through this crisis.

While we deal with immediate challenges, we must keep an eye on the future too. The MPs raised a relevant question: we do need to use the reserves now, but are we being fiscally prudent enough? Will we still have enough reserves to do more later, if the situation calls for it?

When this is over, the past will not come back. Hence DPM @hengsweekeat set up two initiatives to think ahead — a taskforce on Emerging Stronger to cover the economy, as well as a new emphasis on social resilience under the Singapore Together Movement.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B-CSpUGnaJV/,"Visited Teck Ghee Block 341 Market and a few families in Teck Ghee this morning, to see how everyone is coping. ⠀
⠀
People were going about their activities, but making an effort to keep a safe distance. We are not quite there yet – it was a peak time for the market, and it was more crowded than we would like to see. But people were conscious of COVID-19. Nearly everyone remembered not to offer to shake hands. A few wore masks, perhaps because they were not well.⠀
⠀
The pandemic is escalating rapidly around the world. Our own situation here is under control, but we are seeing quite a few new cases among Singaporeans and residents returning from abroad. There is a significant risk that they may infect others and start new clusters. We must do our utmost to prevent this. That is why returnees are being issued stay-home notices. If you are a returnee, please observe the notice strictly to protect others, and help us fight COVID-19. ⠀
⠀
In these volatile times, everyone needs to remain vigilant and socially responsible, and adhere to all measures in place to keep Singapore safe. If we all do our part, we can ride out this storm together. — LHL⠀

https://www.instagram.com/p/B9-ml-qHh1o/,"Last week, I dropped in on a trial run of the #BYOBClean programme, which is giving each household up to 500ml of water-based hand sanitiser, for free. You have to bring your own bottle to be filled up. It’s a timely initiative by the @temasekfoundationcares, to make sure no one is left behind in this fight against COVID-19.⠀
⠀
By now, households in Teck Ghee (and across Singapore) should have received pamphlets informing you of your collection date (the dates are staggered, to avoid overcrowding). You can go to https://stayprepared.sg/ to see where to bring your bottle to fill with hand sanitiser. ⠀
⠀
Do look out for your pamphlets in the mail, and let’s keep our hands clean! – LHL⠀

https://www.instagram.com/p/B901pqAH8lE/,"Last night, Malaysia announced that it would impose a Movement Control Order to combat the spread of COVID-19. This was not surprising, as many other countries have already imposed similar lockdowns.⠀
⠀
Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and I discussed the situation on the phone today. I told him that I understood the reasons why he had made this move, and wished Malaysia success in containing the outbreak. I was happy to hear his reassurance that the flow of goods and cargo between Singapore and Malaysia, including food supplies, would continue.⠀
⠀
However, Malaysians living in Johor but working in Singapore will have to comply with the Malaysian lockdown. This will prevent them from commuting daily, at least for the time being. We are therefore working out arrangements with our companies to help these Malaysian workers stay in Singapore temporarily, if they would like to do so.⠀
⠀
We also agreed to appoint Senior Ministers on both sides — SM @teocheehean and Dato’ Sri Ismail Sabri – to coordinate our responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly on measures where we can work together, or where the actions of one country will affect the other. They are already in touch, but it may take a couple of days for arrangements to be worked out and to settle down.⠀
⠀
Meanwhile, I am happy to see that in the supermarkets, while the queues are longer than usual, people are taking it in their stride and only buying what they need. We need not worry, as we have prepared for such an eventuality, and have plans in place to cope. Glad that Singaporeans are calm, united and resilient as we solve the problems at hand. – LHL⠀

https://www.instagram.com/p/B9tbvnqnd56/,"This morning, I held a dialogue with grassroots leaders on COVID-19 and what lies ahead for Singapore. This was a follow up to my TV broadcast on Thursday.

Fighting COVID-19 is difficult enough. But we also need to deal with COVID-19’s enormous impact on our economy.

Yesterday, the Government released the report of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's (EBRC), which the Committee had just completed.

The General Elections must take place before 21 April 2021. They can only be called after the electoral registers are updated. This will take about a month.

When to hold elections? That depends on the situation, and the outlook.

Singapore faces grave and extended challenges.

We can’t tell when the pandemic will end, but it will likely last at least this year, and quite possibly longer.

The economic hit will likely be more serious than the Global Financial Crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic.

I fully expect things to get more serious before they start getting better.

We have two choices. Either hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances – but we have no certainty of that.

Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.

If we have to hold elections before COVID-19 is over, we will take all the precautions necessary, so that parties can campaign effectively, and people can vote safely.

At stake are jobs, businesses and lives.

Which way to go, and the elections date, will depend on what will best see Singapore through this major crisis.

COVID-19 may well turn out to be the crisis that defines this generation of Singaporeans. We must gird ourselves to overcome this together, and show the world what Singapore can do. – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/B9onAlwHOjK/,"It is five weeks since I spoke about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. So it is timely to update Singaporeans again on the medical, economic and psychological outlooks of the situation.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Today, the @WHO officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. This means that while the situation in Singapore remains under control, the COVID-19 threat will be with us for a long time. We cannot be complacent.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
There are some baseline precautions we must get used to, like maintaining good personal hygiene and not holding large gatherings. We must also plan ahead in case a major outbreak happens in Singapore, like in South Korea or Italy.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If a major outbreak happens, we will need more stringent social distancing measures, such as suspending schools and compulsory telecommuting. These will slow down the rate of transmission and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Already our economy has been seriously impacted, so we are working on a second stimulus package to support businesses and workers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singapore’s response to COVID-19 has been recognised by WHO and the international community. This is through the efforts of many Singaporeans, from the frontline staff to all of us keeping #SGclean. I thank all Singaporeans who are dealing with this calmly and responsibly. We must keep up our efforts, and remain #SGUnited.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Delighted my own residents in Teck Ghee launched some initiatives too. :) The ‘@amktgpv Super Mummies’ group came together to make hand sanitisers from scratch, to place in their estate’s lifts on Saturday. Some residents put up a notice board for neighbours to share notes of cheer with frontline workers. Have also seen on social media how residents in Punggol, Sengkang, and Serangoon are showing the gotong royong spirit, leaving hand sanitisers, alcohol wipes, and face masks in the lifts for others who may need them.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Our healthcare workers have received many notes of gratitude and support from school children, and on notice boards set up at mask distribution points and residential estates. @power98sg has a running dedication where you can share your words of encouragement with our frontline personnel with the hashtag #SGUnited.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
@nus_singapore and @ntu_sg student volunteers have been taking turns to deliver food, and notes of support and concern to their university mates on leave of absence.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This kampung spirit and unity is what makes us Singaporean. I am sure there are many more heartwarming instances going on quietly. If you know of them, please share them in the comments below.

Let us all do our part to help and encourage one another. Together, we will overcome this trying time and emerge stronger. – LHL

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
People are understandably anxious and fearful. But fear can end up doing more harm than the virus itself! It can lead to irrational panic, causing us to hoard facemasks or food.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singapore has ample supplies — already, supermarkets across Singapore have restocked. There is no need to stock up on instant noodles or toilet paper, as was widely seen on social media yesterday.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Instead, let us stay united and resolute in this outbreak. Keep helping one another, as many of you have stepped up to do. And most importantly, stay calm and carry on with our lives.

The 2019-nCov outbreak is, of course, foremost on everybody’s minds. How we react to it is a major test for our nation. In terms of health outcomes, I am confident we will be alright. The real test is to our social and psychological defence. We must come through this challenge together, helping one another to cope, and maintaining confidence in one another and in Singapore.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Even as we fight the coronavirus, we must continue dealing with issues, external and domestic, that will always matter to Singaporeans. Finance Minister @hengsweekeat will deliver the Budget speech just over a week from now. It will support our long term plans for Singapore, and also include measures to see us through the economic fallout from the nCoV outbreak.

Singaporeans would be familiar with the pots of milk and kavadis which devotees carry in procession to fulfill their vows and give thanks for blessings they have received. It is a solemn ceremony, with some spending weeks in advance purifying themselves in both mind and body.

I have every confidence that if we stay vigilant and united, we can overcome this challenge. – LHL (MCI Photos by Betty Chua)",146,2020-01-31T10:09:01.000Z,leehsienloong,2233427613808688008

In the midst of CNY and the Wuhan coronavirus, Singaporeans have to go about our work and lives, to make sure our systems continue to run smoothly and things get done.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We must remain vigilant and take precautions to protect ourselves, but as the saying goes, Keep Calm and Carry On.

We may be thousands of miles away from home, but the familiar accents and local spread of chicken rice and laksa brought warmth and comfort in the midst of snowy Switzerland.

Had a few more meetings with @worldeconomicforum Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab, Dutch PM Mark Rutte (@minpres), and business leaders before I left Davos for Zurich. Glad to be heading home now after a busy and fruitful trip at #wef20, especially in light of the first reported case of Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. MOH has set up a multi-agency task force and we are well-prepared to deal with this situation. Meanwhile we must remain calm and vigilant, practise good personal hygiene and be socially responsible. Most importantly, please do not spread rumours and misinformation! – LHL

https://www.instagram.com/p/B7c0svcHU8Q/,"The government’s task has become more complex and multifaceted, with new challenges emerging every day. To cope with these challenges, the public service must transform itself and build new capabilities. One way it is doing so is by building a deeper, more diverse leadership.

Traditionally, the Administrative Service shaped the leadership of our public sector organisations. AOs are responsible for putting together the big picture and coordinating strategies. However, the downside is that they are less able to build deep expertise in key domains like education, healthcare, and urban planning.

This is why we set up the Public Service Leadership Programme, which allows officers to focus and develop deeper expertise in their fields. This helps our public service leaders maximise one another's strengths, and brings balance in our capabilities. I was happy to attend the first Annual Public Service Leaders dinner last night, and to see the two cadres brought together for the first time.

At the same time, Singapore’s public service can work efficiently and effectively, because it can rely on a supportive political climate, and a competent political leadership. It is the Ministers’ job to get the politics right, and set the strategic direction of the country. I spoke about the importance of getting this vital relationship right in my speech at last night’s dinner.
