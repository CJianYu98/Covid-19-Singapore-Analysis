34,aliciatan4,"Clueless highly qualified professionals from WHO keep giving useless recommendations that impair the immune system and damage the organs! Soap, disinfectants, hand sanitizers, alcohol contain toxic man-made chemicals that are detrimental to the body! I posted articles of burnt victims from using such products! The man-made chemicals are the root cause of unimaginable permutations of viral mutations! The more toxic chemicals we add to the environment or our body, the more vulnerable will be the population to COVID 19! Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She discovered appropriate cheap food can activate the immune system to fight any unseen enemy like infections, pathogens, diseases, free radicals and cancer cells. Her nontoxic treatment method is cheap, simple and very effective. I posted proofs! It cost me less than US$25 to reverse my anaphylactic allergic reaction! The symptoms were worse than COVID 19! Expect a great depression if people continue to use the toxic man-made chemicals to preempt and treat COVID 19 or continue to be clueless how COVID 19 and other superbugs exist! 🇸🇬",2020-03-30T21:30:11.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-XLUwejcnb/,2020-03-30T15:04:25.000Z,"Singaporeans all over the island cheering our front liners on and showing love in a time of COVID-19.
