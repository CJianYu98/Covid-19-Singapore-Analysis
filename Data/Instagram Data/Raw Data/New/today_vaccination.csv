Netizens have accused her of using her wealth and privilege to secure a spot for the vaccination. One asked, ‚ÄúWho opened the back door for her?‚Äù

In response, Kim told @8dayssg: ‚ÄúI think some people were very bo liao and were like, ‚ÄòOh, of course, she‚Äôs rich so she can take the vaccine first‚Äô. But please lor, my father was not offered it, so what makes you think I can get it before him if that‚Äôs the case?‚Äù scoffed Kim. 

She added: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like people to think that just ‚Äòcos I‚Äôm rich, I can do whatever I want. Hello? I don‚Äôt think the government will let me go first just like that. Wah lau, this is Singapore leh! We are not like other countries.‚Äù

Her father is billionaire philanthropist Peter Lim, who owns Thomson Medical and Spanish football club Valencia, and is reportedly worth S$2.7bil according to Forbes.

So why did she manage to get the COVID-19 vaccine so early on?

Singapore received its first shipment of Covid-19 vaccine yesterday evening on board a Singapore Airlines (SIA) cargo flight from Belgium, where it was manufactured.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine arrived at Changi Airport at about 7.35pm.

The vaccine for the Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus is the first one to be approved for use in Singapore. Vaccines produced by other drug manufacturers are expected to arrive in Singapore in the coming months.

In a Facebook post yesterday night, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the governmental Covid-19 task force will announce the details of the roll-out of the vaccination schedules in due course. ""We are prioritising our healthcare workers and the elderly. Vaccination will be voluntary, but I encourage Singaporeans to take the vaccine,"" he said.

The government has since admitted that the order to cull the country's entire mink population was illegal. 

The order was given after authorities found Covid-19 outbreaks at hundreds of mink farms, including a new strain of the virus, suspected of being able to compromise the efficacy of vaccines.

""We have two generations of really skilled mink farmers, father and son, who in a very, very short time have had their life's work shattered,"" Ms Frederiksen told reporters after a meeting with a mink farmer and his son at their farm near Kolding in Western Denmark.

""It has been emotional for them, and... Sorry. It has for me too,"" Ms Frederiksen said with a wavering voice, pausing for breath in between words.

Denmark's mink population is one of the world's biggest and highly valued for the quality of its fur. The head of the Danish mink breeders' association has said that the industry, which employs around 6,000 people and exports fur pelts worth US$800 million (S$1,071 million) annually, is finished.

""It has been emotional for them, and... Sorry. It has for me too,"" Ms Frederiksen said with a wavering voice, pausing for breath in between words.

The government has since admitted that the order to cull the country's entire mink population was illegal. 

The order was given after authorities found Covid-19 outbreaks at hundreds of mink farms, including a new strain of the virus, suspected of being able to compromise the efficacy of vaccines.

""We have two generations of really skilled mink farmers, father and son, who in a very, very short time have had their life's work shattered,"" Ms Frederiksen told reporters after a meeting with a mink farmer and his son at their farm near Kolding in Western Denmark.

""It has been emotional for them, and... Sorry. It has for me too,"" Ms Frederiksen said with a wavering voice, pausing for breath in between words.

Denmark's mink population is one of the world's biggest and highly valued for the quality of its fur. The head of the Danish mink breeders' association has said that the industry, which employs around 6,000 people and exports fur pelts worth US$800 million (S$1,071 million) annually, is finished.

Malaysia has detected a mutation of the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic, that is 10 times more infectious than the original Wuhan strain.

Compared to other strains, D614G produces more viral copies in the respiratory tract and spreads more efficiently from person to person.

This mutation was first detected in July, from samples taken from three cases linked to clusters in Malaysia. 

Studies would likely reveal that any existing vaccine is ineffective against the mutation.

Malaysia has detected a mutation of the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic, that is 10 times more infectious than the original Wuhan strain.

Compared to other strains, D614G produces more viral copies in the respiratory tract and spreads more efficiently from person to person.

This mutation was first detected in July, from samples taken from three cases linked to clusters in Malaysia.

Your detailed article however suggested it will still be effective. @todayonline---WILL VACCINES STILL BE EFFECTIVE?Prof Smith said that vaccines will still remain effective against this strain because¬†they do not target part of the affected genome.A spike protein has a ‚Äústalk‚Äù and a ‚Äúhead‚Äù. Antibodies from vaccines attach themselves to the head to prevent the virus from infecting human cells.However, since¬†the mutation for the D614G occurs on the ‚Äústalk‚Äù, this will not affect how the vaccine works, Prof Smith said.Read more at https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/explainer-d614g-strain-coronavirus-more-infectious-should-singaporeans-be-afraid",2020-08-18T06:06:40.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CD_M_kmHVjP/,2020-08-17T10:45:21.000Z,"ü¶† ‚ö†Ô∏è More bad news.
