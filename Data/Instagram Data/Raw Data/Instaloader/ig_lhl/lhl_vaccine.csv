It was called by Saudi Arabia, holding the G20 Presidency this year, to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak has permeated and changed all the norms of our daily lives — including the way business is conducted.

This is a global crisis, and needs a global solution. I called on the leaders to collaborate in three areas:

1. Public health — helping one another fight the outbreak;
2. Our economies — to save businesses and our citizens’ jobs; 
3. Science and research — to find a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, and prepare for future pandemics.

The pandemic will eventually end, but it will not be the last one the world faces. We must learn from our experiences, and emerge stronger and more resilient from them. – LHL (MCI Photo by Zinkie Aw)","['U sie only sg will be happy', 'Seems too Busy with things Out here Boss...!! 👏👏🙌', 'I like your tea 🍵 cup', '❤️👏', '❤️ take care mr prime minister', '一个人坐着，帅气哦😇', '💕👏👏👏', '👍👍👍', '🙌🙌👏👏😍', '🎉', 'Take care, dear Pm Lee', '@tien_angel_2404 giống ghế cty mình heng', '👏', ""That's really cool"", 'Stay strong Mr Prime Minister!

May be an image of 2 people.","Did a live TV interview with @cnn’s @fareedzakaria via video conferencing last night. Besides Singapore’s response to COVID-19, I also spoke about the wider impact of the pandemic — how it has blighted the global economy and further soured US-China relations.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Like the rest of the world, I hope that a treatment or vaccine will happen sooner than later. But we must be psychologically prepared for a long battle ahead, and learn to live with the virus by adjusting our routines and adopting new norms.

What are our agencies EDB TDB A*STAR MTI doing all this while since Feb 18 when Minister Lawrence Wong was mooting with the idea of producing our own masks?. You are a very good Prime Minister. Lawrence is a good & hardworking Minister. But a couple of million masks a month may not be enough. Can our Govt support Razer in (1) help him to expedite in setting up the factory with our ""Govt agencies"" rich resources and industrial contacts (2) our Govt to chip in and ramp up the production scale to at least 15  mil to 30 mil masks a month. This will help create some jobs too. This will help ""boost confidence"" if people are going out in public and our Govt to enforce ""All to Wear Masks"" when in public places, in view of the heightened risks as compared to Jan situation. Especially in MRTs, Buses, Supermarkets etc *News Recap 1 : ST 19 Feb : SINGAPORE - Singapore is looking for new sources of supply for masks and developing capabilities to manufacture them locally as other Asian countries clamp down on mask exports, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong has said.\n""In recent weeks, some places like Taiwan, Thailand and India have banned or tightened regulations on the export of masks,"" he said in a written parliamentary reply on Tuesday (Feb 18). *News Recap 2 : CNA 1 Apr : SINGAPORE: Singapore gaming company Razer announced plans on Wednesday (Apr 1) to set up an automated face mask manufacturing line within 30 days to produce ""a couple of million certified masks"" each month.

Hey by the way I got an interesting political solution to the current international economic commerce and tourism for covid 19,how about slowly,but very very slowly we loosen our travel restrictions to like 1.5 countries/2 weeks starting from July 2020,seems like China 🇨🇳 and South Korea is getting hold of the situation soon and also if this is to be done, communications between government to government to city to town must be extremely excellent and meticulous and if let say China and South Korea reports no more cases,then we open up but first they will have to communicate hard to every specific region from cities to cities,test every single one of the population until certain that there is none then we open up with additional terms,and that is their own countries have to ban the rest of the world 🌍 and only trade within ourselves like two,three,four nations etc... especially China 🇨🇳 which is the vital key to economic success of 1.4 billion people,all these in a very very slow ways,that can at least boost our economy as well as theirs!!

(UNQUOTE) It is our Govt\'s job to do it (ensuring enough masks for the people to wear in public e.g. in crowded mrts and buses). Whether is it buying from China or setting up a factory to produce masks, just do it. Wearing masks definitely is effective in the overall containment efforts. You cannot have 1 good measure in say foodcourts distancing control and then ""overlook or fail"" in another area : e.g. mrt , buses. If so, the overall containment efforts will not be as effective. @leehsienloong\n@lawrencewongst\n@khawboonwan @gankimyong @ongyekung @teocheehean So in my opinion, our Govt have done a good job in many areas but ""overlook, fail or loophole"" in other areas.

Since our last call nearly two months ago, our countries have moved from strict circuit breaking measures to a gradual, careful easing of restrictions. We talked about technological solutions and shared our strategies, including possible collaboration on vaccine development.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I was pleased to mark the one-year anniversary of the Singapore-New Zealand Enhanced Partnership, and look forward to expanding our cooperation with new initiatives that both sides value. During the global pandemic, we have spoken up against protectionism and for keeping supply chains intact. Earlier in April, we received 20 tonnes of New Zealand’s fine produce, while New Zealand received medical supplies on the return journey.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The times are challenging, but we are dealing with the problems one by one, and planning ahead. As part of safe reopening, we are discussing creating a green lane for short-term essential travel between our countries. I hope this works out, and it will not be long before PM Ardern and I can meet in person again. – LHL

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

The Global Vaccine Summit is a donor pledging conference to fund the immunisation of children in poor countries against deadly but preventable diseases. But in the time of COVID-19, yesterday’s virtual event, which was co-hosted by the UK government and @gavialliance, was also an opportunity for countries to come together to coordinate efforts to develop and produce a COVID-19 vaccine. You can watch the video on my Facebook Page.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I was invited to share Singapore’s efforts in this endeavour. Aside from our US$13 million contribution towards international efforts to combat the virus, we are investing in R&D on diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, as well as building up our vaccine manufacturing capacity.

We are all in the same fight together and Singapore will do our part in this global call for action. – LHL

We discussed strengthening cooperation between our countries amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and welcomed the resumption of essential travel between Singapore and Japan. 

Singapore and Japan are like-minded partners enjoying a longstanding close relationship. We have many opportunities to work together, e.g. in vaccine multilateralism, third-country infrastructure cooperation, and preparing for the digital economy. We also both support multilateralism and are working to sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership by the end of this year.

谢谢!
நன்றி!
 
A big thank you to all our workers for your contributions to Singapore, especially during COVID-19.
2020 has been a year like no other. Many workers have had their wages and livelihoods affected by the pandemic, particularly those in hard-hit sectors. Frontline and essential workers have made many sacrifices, to keep their families and all of us safe.

We do not know when this pandemic will end, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel. We’re closer to getting a vaccine, and starting to reopen our borders. In the meantime, stay safe and stay strong. 
During this pandemic, labour MPs have been working overtime helping union workers, while the Air Transport Executive Staff Union has been working with SIA and other airlines to assist ground staff and protect their interests. Therefore, I nominate NTUC Assistant Secretary-General @patricktaytg and President of the AESU Daniel Loh to show your appreciation next! – LHL
#toast2U #toast2Uchallenge
-------------------------------------------------
For every #toast2U hashtag, NTUC Income will pledge $2 to the NTUC U Care Fund, which helps low-income members and their families through various assistance programmes to defray their cost of living and children’s school expenses, as well as members whose livelihood had been affected by Covid-19.
When nominated:
1. All you need to do is record yourself “receiving” the drink from the person who nominated you and give a toast accompanied by a note of appreciation in the post.
2. “Pass” the drink on by nominating two others.
3. Tag @UHeartsg for us to keep track of the donations, and remember to make your post public!

But because of our collective efforts against COVID-19, we are ready to ease into Phase 3 on 28 December. This is possible because of all of you who made many sacrifices, so that our numbers and situation are now under control.

We will also provide free, voluntary vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use, and the first batch will arrive by the end of 2020. We are still looking at other candidates, and by 3Q2021, we should have enough vaccines for everyone. 

I encourage that you get vaccinated, because you are not just protecting yourself, but people around you. This announcement will bring some year-end cheer to you and your friends and family, but we must maintain our vigilance as the virus is not yet eradicated. It might be a year or more before we are in the clear, but at least we can see light at the end of the tunnel. – LHL

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Prof Mak and I were monitored for 30 minutes after the jab, just in case we developed any side effects, e.g. allergic reactions. Happy to report that we both felt fine.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Today we started vaccinating healthcare workers from public healthcare institutions. We aim to start vaccinating elderly people from February, and then other Singaporeans and long-term residents.

Vaccinations are voluntary, but I hope that when it’s your turn, you will go for it. It will be free, it will protect you and your family, and it will help keep everyone safe. – LHL

It was quite painless, with the tiny needle and the steady hands of Senior Staff Nurse Fatimah Mohd Shah. I was observed for 30 minutes after getting the vaccine but I am happy to report that I feel fine and have no side effects.

I am confident that the vaccine is safe and effective. We will have ample vaccines for everyone, so I hope Singaporeans and long-term residents will get vaccinated when your turn comes, and help keep everyone safer. – LHL

These stricter measures will surely disappoint all of us looking forward to celebrating CNY. But just look at the countries near and far experiencing repeated surges in cases, and you will see why we need to stay vigilant.

It’s exactly 1 year since our first confirmed COVID-19 case in Singapore. The year has gone by at breakneck pace, as we all struggled to cope with the unprecedented chaos and disruption to our lives. Through immense effort and sacrifice, we’ve got ourselves to a stable situation. Our vaccination programme is underway, with  seniors starting to get their shots next week.

Just like my first jab, it was quick and painless. The doctors watched me for 30 minutes afterwards, just in case. Happy to share that I feel fine.

We are ramping up the vaccine programme and opening more vaccination centres. Do go for your vaccination when your turn comes. It will protect not only yourself, but also your family, friends and everyone you come in contact with. – LHL

21,Lee Hsien Loong,2.50304E+18,6/2/2021 17:53,leehsienloong,,"Our pilot COVID-19 vaccination exercise for seniors aged 70 and above is underway. Following my visit to Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic two weeks ago, I dropped by Teck Ghee CC this morning to meet the seniors getting their jabs and observe the vaccination process.

Teck Ghee CC is one of two CCs being used for vaccinations, along with Tanjong Pagar CC. More centres will be set up in the coming weeks, so that everyone can conveniently receive their vaccinations.
 
Glad the take-up rate from our seniors has been very encouraging. Many thanks to all involved – the vaccination team, the community partners, and volunteers – for your hard work in reaching out to seniors, guiding them along each step, and ensuring a smooth process. – LHL

The Health Sciences Authority has given interim authorisation to use this vaccine in Singapore.

Our vaccination programme is proceeding smoothly. The latest delivery will allow us to continue as planned. More vaccination centres will open soon across Singapore. I hope seniors will book their appointments when their turn comes, so that we can all stay protected together. 

Until then, do continue to follow safety regulations, wear masks, and remember safe distancing! – LHL
