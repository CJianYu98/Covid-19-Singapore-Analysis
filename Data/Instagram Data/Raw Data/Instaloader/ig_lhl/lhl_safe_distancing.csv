May be an image of 1 person.","It is five weeks since I spoke about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. So it is timely to update Singaporeans again on the medical, economic and psychological outlooks of the situation.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Today, the @WHO officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. This means that while the situation in Singapore remains under control, the COVID-19 threat will be with us for a long time. We cannot be complacent.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
There are some baseline precautions we must get used to, like maintaining good personal hygiene and not holding large gatherings. We must also plan ahead in case a major outbreak happens in Singapore, like in South Korea or Italy.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If a major outbreak happens, we will need more stringent social distancing measures, such as suspending schools and compulsory telecommuting. These will slow down the rate of transmission and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Already our economy has been seriously impacted, so we are working on a second stimulus package to support businesses and workers.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Singapore’s response to COVID-19 has been recognised by WHO and the international community. This is through the efforts of many Singaporeans, from the frontline staff to all of us keeping #SGclean. I thank all Singaporeans who are dealing with this calmly and responsibly. We must keep up our efforts, and remain #SGUnited.

Ahead of this meeting, I did a Skype interview with Greg Sheridan of @the.australian last week.

Greg asked me about a variety of issues, not only the current COVID-19 situation, but also China-US relations, the CPTPP, and climate change.

It was a pity we could not meet in person. But I am glad for the opportunity to remind our Australian friends that life still goes on, and we will adjust to the new norm. We are getting used to temperature checks, contact tracing forms, safe distancing rules, and frequent reminders to wash our hands. As long as we take the necessary precautions and remember to be socially responsible, we can get through this season together. – LHL

With the new electoral boundaries, Teck Ghee will be taking over part of Yio Chu Kang, while the rest will become a separate single member constituency. I had originally planned a walkabout today to visit markets and meet residents, but unfortunately had to postpone it to comply with safe distancing measures.

And so we kept to a small group, and discussed residents’ concerns and other issues while maintaining an arms-length distance from one another.

I got home to learn the sad news that another COVID-19 patient had passed away. My deepest sympathies to the family.

Keeping a safe physical distance apart should not mean social isolation. Give your friends and family a call, and continue supporting one another during this period. – LHL

Cabinet still had to meet, but we separated into two locations, connected via teleconferencing. We also spaced out to maintain safe distancing, and wore masks to keep our droplets to ourselves.

The “circuit breaker” is essential to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. As we expected, daily numbers of new cases are still going up, and faster than before. We must bring the numbers down, and the only way is for all of us to observe the circuit breaker measures strictly.

Stay at home, except when you have to go out to do essential work or buy food. If you need to go to the market, stagger your timing too. Avoid being part of the crowd. This is not a month long holiday, when we can go out for jalan jalan or to meet up with friends.

The health of us all depends on the actions of each of us. Please do your part. – LHL

For me, when I had my flu, I couldn’t smell and taste, so I thought that was normal for somebody who had just recovered from the flu.”\nWhile serving her Stay Home Notice after returning from the UK, what was perplexing for the wife was that her sense of taste and smell still had not returned.\n“It was frustrating because my body felt well, but I just couldn’t smell and taste,” she said. “At that point our bodies felt perfectly fine, but we didn’t know there was a virus inside of us.""(UNQUOTE) Our taskforce cannot be ""too complacent"". 19800 foreign workers quarantined in 2 dorms ? It is similar to those quarantined in cruise ships. Study those cruise ships cases.  If these 19800 workers are released into the public after 14 Days Quarantine, there may be many ""silent virus carriers"". This would be potentially catastropic. Singapore 1 month ""circuit breaker"" would then be fruitless. Learn from South Korea. They are doing a lot of testing. Think they tested more than 200,000 church members after the church ""widespread explosion"". So, do test these 19800 foreign workers and many more other dorms clusters . Your Approach should be : Take No Chances. Spare No Efforts. And dont be ""too cost calculative"" if say costs is your main concern to test more than 20000 workers. You saved $millions in costs but touchwood, if Singapore exploded like Italy because of ""these costs savings"", Singpore stand to lose $billons in the ""prolonged collapse of Singapore economy"".

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don’t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. – LHL

May be an image of 1 person.","The circuit breaker has ended, but we are still practising safe distancing and holding virtual meetings where possible — including the swearing-in of new members to the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) yesterday.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We witnessed the swearing-in of Mr Eddie Teo, who was reappointed as Chairman of the CPA, Mr Lim Chee Onn and Ms Chua Sock Koong as full members (Ms Chua was previously an alternate member), and Mr Gan Seow Kee, chairman and managing director of ExxonMobil Asia Pacific, as an alternate member.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The CPA plays an important role advising the President in exercising her custodial powers. They have been busy over the last few months, deliberating over the four Budgets that draw on past reserves to fund support measures for Singaporeans affected by COVID-19. I thanked them for their hard work, as well as their collective judgement and advice.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I would also like to thank Mr Stephen Lee for his service and contribution to the CPA. Your counsel and advice has benefitted Mdm @halimahyacob, Dr Tony Tan, and the late Mr SR Nathan over the past 12 years. – LHL

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This huge and complicated operation depends on many individuals all doing their part so that the testing runs smoothly. It is not just getting the swab done, but being on the front line, taking all the precautions and doing the procedures right. It is hard work and I thank all of you who are making this possible.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As we start Phase 2 of our re-opening on 19 June, we are also ramping up testing capacity so that we can safely and progressively resume work and social activities in the COVID world.

To win this battle, we need everyone to continue doing our part by practising safe distancing and good personal hygiene. Let us make a safe and steady transition to Phase 2! – LHL

But please don’t go overboard celebrating. In Phase 2, precautionary rules such as mask wearing and safe distancing are still essential, though this will be the closest thing to normalcy for most of us since the circuit breaker began in April.

I’m glad that most people were conscientious and took the necessary precautions during Phase 1. As Singapore cautiously re-opens, please stay vigilant and keep what we’ve learnt close to heart. If we all do our part, and take responsibility not only for ourselves but those around us, we can all be safe. – LHL

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Just as Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Ramadan were observed differently amid the COVID-19 pandemic, adjustments too have been made to this year’s Aidiladha celebration. Muslims have had to defer their annual Haj pilgrimage, and the Korban rites will be done overseas instead of at local mosques. Nevertheless, the spirit of Aidiladha remains, and several mosques will be conducting Hari Raya Haji prayers for congregants.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
One day, the pandemic will be over. Until then, let us all remain vigilant and do our part by practising social responsibility and observing safe distancing measures.

Our local attractions have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but with the gradual re-opening of our economy in Phase 2, most have reopened with the necessary precautionary measures in place such as safe distancing, temperature-taking, and safe entry.

No one can tell how long international travel restrictions will last. COVID-19 will remain a problem for a long time yet, and we will all have to learn to live with it. In the meanwhile, take this time to explore our island — from our world-famous tourist attractions to the places off the beaten path. You may be surprised by what you will discover. – LHL

Not only are they most at risk from the virus, but the necessary social distancing precautions have had a detrimental effect on old people, especially those living alone and the less digitally savvy.⠀
⠀
During the circuit breaker, the Silver Generation Office (SGO) stepped up its care for the most vulnerable seniors. It mobilised SG Ambassadors to assist seniors in various ways – distributing food packs, shopping for groceries and collecting medication, so that seniors could stay home safely. SG Ambassadors also called them regularly by phone, to monitor their well-being, and most importantly, assure them someone was looking out for them.⠀
 ⠀
Many volunteers stepped forward to support SGO’s efforts, including 500 public officers. Since February when the COVID-19 outbreak began, SGO has engaged more than 83,000 vulnerable seniors and responded to close to 3,000 requests for assistance.⠀
 ⠀
1 October is the International Day of Older Persons. I am glad that we are also paying tribute to SG Ambassadors and all who volunteered at SGO during this difficult period. You can read their stories in #SGOCares (go.gov.sg/sgocares), an e-book that was launched by SGO.⠀

Thank you SGO and our SG Ambassadors, for your service and care towards our seniors, especially during these challenging times. – LHL⠀

The Health Sciences Authority has given interim authorisation to use this vaccine in Singapore.

Our vaccination programme is proceeding smoothly. The latest delivery will allow us to continue as planned. More vaccination centres will open soon across Singapore. I hope seniors will book their appointments when their turn comes, so that we can all stay protected together. 

Until then, do continue to follow safety regulations, wear masks, and remember safe distancing! – LHL
