The travel industry has been hit hard by COVID-19. Changi Airport is on the frontline. Despite this, I found our workers in good spirits. I left the airport heartened by their professionalism and commitment. Thank you for your hard work and dedication, keeping Singapore open for business!

We will ensure the safety of our workers, and enable them to do their jobs. Once again, letâ€™s stay strong and united and we will overcome this challenge. â€“ LHL

QUOTE CNA News Case 170 : \nThe case is a 56-year-old Indonesian woman, believed to be an imported case.\xa0\nShe reported onset of symptoms while in Indonesia on Mar 6. She arrived in Singapore on Mar 9 and went to the Singapore General Hospital. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Mar 10 afternoon.\xa0UNQUOTEThis Indonesian knew she had Covid-19 symptoms on 6 Mar and she intentionally fly to Singapore on 9 Mar ? Singapore cannot afford to be ""a dumping ground for overseas Covid-19 carriers"". Question : if she had symptoms , why was she allowed to board the plane to Singapore ? By doing so, we are putting our airline staff, airport staff, taxi staff, and many others at Changi Airport at ""high exposure risk"". What\'s the point if we spent so much resources and efforts in local containment and seeing some results with controlled increase of Covid-19 cases but then ""all efforts go to waste"" with these ""imported cases dumped by themselves"" into Singapore ? Something urgent needs to be done to curb this. Otherwise, Singapore cases may explode to be like the next Italy and South Korea. Even Beijing after seeing some results in their containment efforts is asking All Foreigners to be quarantied for 14 days upon arrival in Beijing.  Our approach should be : Do All Or Nothing. Since we are doing something about it, do try to do all to prevent Singapore becoming ""a dumping ground for Covid-19 carriers"" MOH starts charging short term visitors for Covid-19 treatment is the correct move, but more needs to be done. If Indonesians know or suspect they are Covid-19 carriers, they should seek treatment in Indonesia instead of flying around, moving around to increase the risk exposure to others.

May be an image of 1 person.","It is five weeks since I spoke about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. So it is timely to update Singaporeans again on the medical, economic and psychological outlooks of the situation.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Today, the @WHO officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. This means that while the situation in Singapore remains under control, the COVID-19 threat will be with us for a long time. We cannot be complacent.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
There are some baseline precautions we must get used to, like maintaining good personal hygiene and not holding large gatherings. We must also plan ahead in case a major outbreak happens in Singapore, like in South Korea or Italy.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
If a major outbreak happens, we will need more stringent social distancing measures, such as suspending schools and compulsory telecommuting. These will slow down the rate of transmission and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Already our economy has been seriously impacted, so we are working on a second stimulus package to support businesses and workers.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Singaporeâ€™s response to COVID-19 has been recognised by WHO and the international community. This is through the efforts of many Singaporeans, from the frontline staff to all of us keeping #SGclean. I thank all Singaporeans who are dealing with this calmly and responsibly. We must keep up our efforts, and remain #SGUnited.

13,Lee Hsien Loong,2.26E+18,14/3/2020 17:59,leehsienloong,,"This morning, I held a dialogue with grassroots leaders on COVID-19 and what lies ahead for Singapore. This was a follow up to my TV broadcast on Thursday.

Fighting COVID-19 is difficult enough. But we also need to deal with COVID-19â€™s enormous impact on our economy.

Yesterday, the Government released the report of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's (EBRC), which the Committee had just completed.

The General Elections must take place before 21 April 2021. They can only be called after the electoral registers are updated. This will take about a month.

When to hold elections? That depends on the situation, and the outlook.

Singapore faces grave and extended challenges.

We canâ€™t tell when the pandemic will end, but it will likely last at least this year, and quite possibly longer.

The economic hit will likely be more serious than the Global Financial Crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic.

I fully expect things to get more serious before they start getting better.

We have two choices. Either hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances â€“ but we have no certainty of that.

Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.

If we have to hold elections before COVID-19 is over, we will take all the precautions necessary, so that parties can campaign effectively, and people can vote safely.

At stake are jobs, businesses and lives.

Which way to go, and the elections date, will depend on what will best see Singapore through this major crisis.

COVID-19 may well turn out to be the crisis that defines this generation of Singaporeans. We must gird ourselves to overcome this together, and show the world what Singapore can do. â€“ LHL

Straight to the point, I am pro Govt pro PAP since my student days (in the 80s). Is our Govt doing a good job in handling this Covid-19 crisis ? Yes. Is there room for improvement. Yes. So, if our politicians priorities now are the Election, then I am fairly disappointed. The priorities now should not be the Election. It should be on how to combat this Covid-19. Look at Hong Kong. One of our Ministers ""made fun (sarcastic remark)"" on them. Fact is, they seem to be doing a better containment job than Singapore. Even though they are close to Epi Center China. And talking about China, they seem to be doing fairly well in their containment efforts too. Why ? Or with all due respect : WHY ? I think the simple reason is : almost everyone is wearing a mask there. Common sense tells us this will help. By doing so, those silent virus carriers will be ""less infectious"" to others in terms of risk exposure. If we dont have enough masks, we should produce them. With all the $billions pumped into biotech hub, medical hub, with local agencies such as EDB well connected to so many big industrial contacts, how difficult can that be ? Making masks is not rocket science. So, you see my point here ? Somehow somewhere some of our ministers and agencies are not doing a fantastic job. E.g. producing our own masks. Such production can cost US$ 10 to 30 mil, but the benefits it brings about, the confidence effect on people after everyone is wearing masks daily, it may even revive our economy. If someone in Singapore does not have symptoms, or only mild symptoms, and h thinks ""he is ok"", when in actual fact he has Covid-19 virus, and he went to work in town by packed bus, then packed mrt in the morning, then mingle with colleagues during work, then go for dinner with friends after work, doing so without wearing a mask, I would say : this spells Disaster. Our containment efforts will not be as effective. And, there is a possibility we may become the next Italy.  Trust your wisdom & understanding that this is not a criticism of our Govt. This is a feedback to remind our Govt its priorities, and there are more room for improvement in handling this crisis.', 'ğŸ™‹\u200dâ™€ï¸Thanks PM Lee!

This was not surprising, as many other countries have already imposed similar lockdowns.â €
â €
Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and I discussed the situation on the phone today. I told him that I understood the reasons why he had made this move, and wished Malaysia success in containing the outbreak. I was happy to hear his reassurance that the flow of goods and cargo between Singapore and Malaysia, including food supplies, would continue.â €
â €
However, Malaysians living in Johor but working in Singapore will have to comply with the Malaysian lockdown. This will prevent them from commuting daily, at least for the time being. We are therefore working out arrangements with our companies to help these Malaysian workers stay in Singapore temporarily, if they would like to do so.â €
â €
We also agreed to appoint Senior Ministers on both sides â€” SM @teocheehean and Datoâ€™ Sri Ismail Sabri â€“ to coordinate our responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly on measures where we can work together, or where the actions of one country will affect the other. They are already in touch, but it may take a couple of days for arrangements to be worked out and to settle down.â €
â €
Meanwhile, I am happy to see that in the supermarkets, while the queues are longer than usual, people are taking it in their stride and only buying what they need. We need not worry, as we have prepared for such an eventuality, and have plans in place to cope. Glad that Singaporeans are calm, united and resilient as we solve the problems at hand. â€“ LHLâ €

Economy will be 10X maybe 100X worse than the current bad situation. Bear in mind this : Singapore society is closely compact and one of the world\'s highest density population. Can you afford to close down all mrts and bus servicces like what China did. We must take a pre-emptive approach in anticipation of ""the worst possible scenario"" and instead of ""let\'s see how then react"" . The latter was what Italy , many European countries did. They waited to see how to react. When the crisis exploded suddenly and situation out of control, then they react. But, it was ""too late"" That is\xa0 fire fighting approach, not fire prevention. I worry a lot. For families, friends, fellow Singaporeans. Reason : Indonesia. I guess Indonesia will be the next Italy due to their ""reported behaviour e.g. attend large groupings even when their Govt bans them"" as well as ""their Govt citing high costs this high costs that even for Covid-19 testing for many of their potential patients"".

â €
People were going about their activities, but making an effort to keep a safe distance. We are not quite there yet â€“ it was a peak time for the market, and it was more crowded than we would like to see. But people were conscious of COVID-19. Nearly everyone remembered not to offer to shake hands. A few wore masks, perhaps because they were not well.â €
â €
The pandemic is escalating rapidly around the world. Our own situation here is under control, but we are seeing quite a few new cases among Singaporeans and residents returning from abroad. There is a significant risk that they may infect others and start new clusters. We must do our utmost to prevent this. That is why returnees are being issued stay-home notices. If you are a returnee, please observe the notice strictly to protect others, and help us fight COVID-19. â €
â €
In these volatile times, everyone needs to remain vigilant and socially responsible, and adhere to all measures in place to keep Singapore safe. If we all do our part, we can ride out this storm together. â€” LHLâ €

Held a virtual bilateral meeting with Australian PM @scottmorrisonmp via video conferencing today. While COVID-19 has certainly made travelling harder or even impossible altogether, technology can bridge the gap and enable us still to communicate with one another and get things done.

PM Morrison and I had a candid and fruitful discussion on the COVID-19 situation, our extensive economic cooperation, and sustainability. We also witnessed the signing of a treaty on military training and two MOUs on Artificial Intelligence and Data Innovation.

Singapore and Australia enjoy close and multifaceted ties, with warm people-to-people ties. Australia is a popular destination for Singaporeans â€“ not just for holidays and visiting friends, but also for studying. The SAF trains in Australia and our two armed forces have a long history of cooperation. I am confident that we will deepen our bilateral relationship further in the future. â€“ LHL (MCI Photos by Lee Jia Wen)","['Why you never wear makeup', 'Visionary Leader ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘', 'social distancing game going strong', 'å‘¼åå­¦æ ¡å…ˆåœè¯¾2å‘¨ï¼Œé¿å¼€é«˜å³°çˆ†å‘æ—¶æœŸï¼Œä½œä¸ºçˆ¶æ¯çœŸçš„å¾ˆæ‹…å¿ƒï¼', 'I am not sure about others, but personally I am extremely disappointed with this Unity Budget.

(Unquote) There are other loopholes. E.g. Landlords who gained on zero property tax if they do not pass down the benefits to their tenants what can tenants do ? Lose Lose ? If landlords strategy is to use the gained benefits to wait out for the crisis to be over, they can easily get new tenants. Even if the landlords pass the savings, is there a clear guideline ? What can tenants do if landlords ""give them bread crumbs "" ? I listened to the Unity Budget. It seems complex, not easy to understand for many laymen or commoners. For those unemployed  due to other valid reasons say since last year, what assistance for these groups really ? Maybe I am not as smart as our leaders, but this Unity Budget for sure is confusingly complex. If Govt is afraid of giving too much direct cash handouts (as some may misuse it such as gambling), why not have assistance as such : Govt to pay 50% of PUB bills for the next 12 months ? Note that people are encouraged to do more hand washing. Surely water bills will shoot up. Or, plus S&CC charges to be waived for the next 12 months ? Whatever costs burden reduced is a good help during this crisis. For those affected that are low on CPF ordinary account balance but still have HDB mortgages to service, a top-up of 6 months equivalent will help with ""straight, direct beneficial effect\'.

May be an image of 1 person.","Sat down with local media today to talk about the Resilience Budget that @hengsweekeat announced in Parliament yesterday, and what lies ahead as the COVID-19 pandemic turns the world upside down.

We are heading into the storm with a major $55 billion package to help save jobs and businesses, support households, and keep our economy going. If the situation worsens, we are ready to do more.

The impact on our economy has been huge. This is only the second time ever we are drawing on our reserves. The last time was for the Global Financial Crisis in 2009. We will be drawing up to $17 billion to fund the support measures, more than triple what was drawn in 2009.

I have no illusions that this will be all we need. Nobody can tell what lies ahead. COVID-19 has shown starkly how vulnerable we are, and how our existential threats essentially remain the same, despite Singapore going from third world to first. The COVID-19 pandemic will be the formative experience for this generation of Singaporeans. If we remain vigilant, resolute, and united, I am confident we will get through this together.

I can see that you are working very hard as our No.1 Leader,  so thank you for that. As a commoner, I cant formulate policies, I cant contribute much. As an indvidual, I can only help by being ""socially responsible"", which I have been doing since Jan. However, I feel that I can also contribute by giving feedback & suggestions, sharing world info with the Govt & etc. E.g. I shared this info : Japanese Flu drug Avigan was said by China doctors to be effective in the treatment. I am not a doctor, but no harm sharing this info for our medical experts to ""further look into it"". Bear in mind China rarely ""praises"" or ""give words of endorsements"" to Japanese-linked whatever. So today my feedback is : repeated many times. agreed by some in the public : daily MASKS wearing when going out is IMPORTANT for more effective containment. Singpost. It says they do ""daily precautionary checks with temp checking"". Was it very effective ?  After so many weeks, still think it worked like SARS ? All over the world, including ground zero China said carriers may not have fever for days even if they are infected. So, yes temp checking can keep out / contain some with obvious symptoms BUT fail to contain those infected for days without much symptoms such as fever. Is this so hard for our Govt to understand ? By enforcing everyone to wear masks when outside in the public help to minimize the transmission risks, especially from those without fever symptoms. China enforced this and was quite successful. So Singapore, why why why ? Is it because we have not enough masks ? Is making our masks Rocket Science ? Cant our Govt who just budgeted tens of $billions crisis $ allocate $30 mil to assemble a large masks assembly lines to produce a million masks a day ? Cant our Govt employ hundreds of unemployed / laid-offs to work in this mask factory ? An un-infected meeting an infected with both wearing masks = double protection. An un-infected meeting a silent infected with both not wearing masks = Disaster . Think about it.

May be an image of 1 person.","Prime Minister @jacindaardern and I spoke on the phone this afternoon. We updated each other on how we are managing COVID-19 in Singapore and New Zealand. We are both implementing strict circuit breaking measures, to break transmission of the virus and squeeze the cases down.

PM Ardern shared that after New Zealand implemented their measures, numbers only started to come down on Day 11. We are only in Day 3 and still have a long way to go. If we all comply strictly, as the New Zealanders have done, hopefully by our Day 11 we too will see positive results.

PM Ardern and I also discussed how we can support each other during this time, including keeping supply chains intact between the two countries. Both Singapore and New Zealand will continue to do our part in this global fight against COVID-19.

At home, @masagosz has announced that enforcement officers will now immediately take down the particulars of anyone breaching the measures. More details on his Facebook post today. We cannot wait to save lives. Please do your part today. â€“ LHL

This spirit of solemnity continues as Christians await the resurrection on Easter Sunday.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
It has been a difficult time for people of faith, including Christians here and elsewhere in the world. They have been unable to hold their usual services because of COVID-19 measures. However, these measures are essential to protect all of us, Christians and non-Christians alike. I am heartened that most Churches have introduced online services, and hope many will continue to find solace in prayer, and be united in spirit.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
I wish all Christians a blessed and healthy Easter weekend, and that you will find joy in your hearts amid the simple celebrations. â€“ LHL

Please share with your families and friends, especially older Singaporeans.

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously â€” stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. â€“ LHL

Beside those frontline measures that are reported, I appreciate the less mentioned efforts in place to keep the elderly active through e-Getai, exercise shows etc. The government didnâ€™t have to, but they did. May I also suggest to use mass media to teach the elderly how to set up applications on their mobile phones to facilitate medical teleconsultations where appropriate. Many of them are on long term follow up for a variety of chronic diseases. They are the vulnerable group, yet are also the ones needing to go to hospital outpatient clinics most for routine follow up that may put them at increased risks. Some of them have the gadgets, but do not know how to maximize the use. Lastly, while a lot had been done, there is the group of old folks and/or less fortunate ones who are living alone and may not have access to technology via smart phones or TV. I have no better solutions how to help them at this moment but I know some may have heightened fears due to disempowerment from a lack of information and/or connection to the world beyond their four walls.

Our largest group is Tamil, but we also have thriving Malayalee, Sikh, and Bengali communities. The Sikhs will be celebrating Vaisakhi, while the others will be marking their new years tomorrow.

I took the photo of the Silat Road Sikh Temple one evening in March 2015, after visiting my father who was then hospitalised in SGH. It was beautifully lit, a serene and inspiring presence at a time of worry and sadness. I thought it would not be out of place to share it now. We are battling COVID-19, and thinking about those among us who are ill with the disease.

The Sri Perumal temple photo was taken in October 2016, on a jalan jalan in Little India to see the Deepavali light up. I am not sure when we will be able to do light ups again, but we will keep the light of confidence and hope shining bright in our hearts.

Wishing all Sikhs a happy Vaisakhi, Malayalees a happy Vishu, Bengalis a happy Pohela Boishakh, and Tamils a happy Puthandu! â€“ LHL (L: Gurdwara Sahib Silat Road, or Silat Road Sikh Temple; R: Sri Perumal Temple, or Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple / Photos by me)","['Omg this is where I live behind the house omg', 'â¤ï¸', 'Iâ€™m from India and I live there, when I came across this post I was about to comment how much I loved what this dude said...

I thank you all for complying with the restrictions. While community cases have fallen, we still need to bring their number down decisively. We also want to make sure that if any cases leak from the migrant worker population into the wider community, we can detect and contain them.

That is why we are tightening the circuit breaker measures, e.g. thinning out crowds at hot spots like wet markets, and closing more workplace premises, till 4 May. We will also extend the circuit breaker itself to 1 June.

I know that this has not been an easy time. The circuit breaker is working, but we need to do a little bit more, and for a bit longer. Let us all do our part to beat the virus, break the chain of transmission, and overcome this together.

This yearâ€™s celebration happens amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Singaporeans, like people across the world, are staying home in an effort to stop the spread of this disease. But thanks to technology, we can still enjoy the breathtaking beauty of our shared home through virtual tours and amazing tools like Google Earth.

As glum as things seem now, COVID-19 will eventually pass. But the wicked problem of climate change will still be with us, and it will be even harder to tackle. It is sobering to think that if we do not succeed in slowing down climate change, these virtual tours may be all future generations have to remind them of what was lost because we did not take action sooner.

Singapore cannot stop climate change by ourselves. It needs a global effort. But we will do our bit. Each of us must do our bit too, through small and sustainable steps, for example by wasting less food, choosing more energy efficient options, and recycling more.

â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Fasting month this year will be markedly different. There will be no communal Terawih prayers, because mosques are all closed. Many would also be unable to break fast with their close family and friends, as they usually do. I hope you understand why the circuit breaker restrictions are being extended, to stamp out new COVID-19 transmissions and protect all of us.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
I am glad that MUIS is providing many online resources, such as SalamSG TV to help foster the Ramadan spirit.

We discussed the COVID-19 situations in our two countries. Singapore is in the midst of the circuit breaker. India implemented a nationwide lockdown since late March, not a simple decision in a huge country of 1.3 billion people.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
I thanked PM Modi for Indiaâ€™s help when we brought home some Singaporeans from India recently. I assured him that we will care for Indian migrant workers here, just as we care for Singaporeans. The migrant workers made personal sacrifices to come to work here. They have made many contributions to Singapore, so we have a responsibility for them.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Appreciate PM Modiâ€™s affirmation of our efforts in looking after the migrant workers, and his assurance that they will not forget this.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
India and Singapore are strategic partners with extensive economic ties. We agreed to work together on the challenges posed by the pandemic, keep supply chains intact, and keep essential supplies flowing. â€“ LHL

Singapore is grateful to the Colombian government for clearing the export of face masks to Singapore early in the outbreak.

Like Singapore, Colombia is using technology, including a â€œCoronApp-Colombiaâ€ mobile app which disseminates official information on the virus.

Despite being on opposite sides of the Pacific, Singapore and Colombia can cooperate and learn from each other, as we tackle the present challenges and prepare for the long recovery ahead. â€“ LHL

In this crisis, it is vital for our unions, employers, and the Government to work together to help workers and families overcome these difficult times.

If you need something to unwind after my speech, the @jazzassociation_sg and its YouTube channel will be live-streaming a â€˜Jass@Homeâ€™ online concert at 8.30pm. This marks the UNESCO International Jazz Day, which commemorates jazz and its role uniting people from all around the world.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Led by jazz maestro @jeremymonteiro, the concert will feature the evergreen folk song â€œSingapuraâ€ as a tribute to our frontline workers, and a special performance by Grammy award winner Randy Brecker on the trumpet.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €

May be an image of 1 person and text that says 'ntuc National Trades Union Congress'.,"#MayDay is usually a joyous occasion to celebrate the achievements of our workers and unions. But amidst COVID-19, this yearâ€™s event is more sombre.

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

During this circuit breaker, many of us have gotten used to a new normal of telecommuting and ordering goods online. This has increased demand, and created new opportunities for business. Some industries, like retail, may never be quite the same again.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
This has been happening all along, though not so suddenly as now. New industries are constantly emerging, and we must be ready for them. 50 years ago who could have imagined a job as a social media manager, or in biotech?
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
I said in my #MayDay speech yesterday that we are determined to help companies prepare for the new operating environment, and to retrain workers for the new jobs available. We canâ€™t save every job, but we will look after every worker, and their families too.

I am juggling a lot working from home and teaching my kid at the same time that it is taking a critical toll on my mental and physical health.\nClosing school leads many people unemployed in an effort to take care of children during working hours, which eventually hit already dire economy situation even harder. Keeping school closed has to be considered very carefully taking all factors into consideration. In addition, every countries vary with respect to efficiency of closure of school. We cannot just follow other countries's case without taking into a unique Singaporean demographical charactor. For instance, Italy and UK that closed school have high rate of elderly population and two-thirds of workable adults live with their parents, which makes often three generations live in one household where normally grandmother take care of children when adults work. \nFor these European countries, closing school was a necessary measure taken  to stop the spread of virus through children to the vulnerable old.\nIf Singapore keep closing school, many households will have to hire Foreign Domestic Helper, which result in more outside mingling that has to be minimized at this stage, let alone those who cannot afford will end up losing their jobs with prioritizing child care at home.\nLastly, even if we close the school for little one, kids are kids and they will run around and mingle with neighborhood' childreb who you don't even  know their travel history. Conversely, at school they control who they interact with by handing out travel declaration forms in advance and putting those unwell in quarantine under the strong supervision of designated teacher.\nIn nutshell, I have heard that there has been no single case children were spreader of virus and closing school will do more harm than good. Opening school will help to stop all this emotional, mental and physical agony that it has put and bring children opportunities to learn better with social and emotional interaction with other children and teachers. Please reopen school soon to stop all this sufferings from both parent and children sides."", 'Thank you PM.

I took part in todayâ€™s dialogue. I found it useful â€“ it helped me understand how different countries are getting ready to open up after lock downs, and what they are doing to keep people safe, from young children going to school, to close knit communities vulnerable to this very infectious disease.

An important part of opening up is keeping trade and supply lines open. Many countries have imposed export restrictions, particularly for critical supplies like drugs and medical equipment, even face masks. Others have shut down logistics nodes like ports. But it is in everyoneâ€™s interest to keep trade flowing and supply chains connected, and to rebuild confidence in the global trading system. If we can work together to strengthen international cooperation, then we can emerge stronger and more resilient after the crisis. â€“ LHL

Esok, 1 Syawal, menandakan cukup sebulan rakan-rakan Muslim kita berpuasa. Seperti Ramadan yang berbeza kali ini, penyesuaian juga perlu dibuat bagi sambutan Hari Raya.

Biasanya, di pagi Hari Raya umat Islam akan ke masjid dan kemudian mereka kunjung-mengunjung ke rumah sanak-saudara. Namun, tahun ini, mereka akan mendengar laungan takbir Raya dah khutbah oleh Mufti Negara, menerusi radio dan media sosial dari rumah masing-masing. Jalan Raya dibuat di alam maya. Walaupun tidak bersama secara fisikal, keluarga Muslim memanfaatkan teknologi secara kreatif untuk mengeratkan tali persaudaraan dengan ahli keluarga dan teman-teman di Hari Raya ini.

Selain rancangan tahunan Suria, Sinar Lebaran yang disiarkan malam ini, Saluran 5 juga menyiarkan rancangan khas untuk mengajak rakyat Singapura yang lain sama-sama menyemarakkan lagi sambutan Hari Raya bersama masyarakat Islam kita.

Pandemik COVID-19 ini akan berlalu. Namun apa yang akan berkekalan adalah semangat Hari Raya dan harapan kita bersama untuk masa depan yang lebih cerah.

Tomorrow is the first day of Syawal, which marks the end of Ramadan. Just as Ramadan was observed differently amid COVID-19, so too we have had to adjust Hari Raya celebrations.

Normally, Muslim families would be visiting the mosque tomorrow morning followed by the traditional Hari Raya visits. Instead, this year, they will join the â€˜liveâ€™ takbir on radio and online, and listen to the Hari Raya khutbah by the Mufti from their homes. Virtual visits will replace actual ones. The jalan raya will be missed; still, with creativity and technology, families have found ways to connect with loved ones and friends, and celebrate together while physically apart.

Besides the annual Hari Raya eve variety show on @mediacorp_suria tonight, @mediacorpch5 also showed a special programme, so that all Singaporeans could join in to celebrate with our Muslim friends.

This pandemic will eventually pass, but the spirit of Hari Raya will endure, and the hope of brighter days ahead. I wish all Muslim friends a joyful and blessed celebration. â€“ LHL","['Love you so much sirâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸', 'â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ u look so handsome ..father lee', 'Salam Aidil Fitri 1 Syawal 1441 Hijriah to all fellow Singaporeans ğŸ™ğŸ™ğŸ™ Mohon Maaf Zahir dan Bathin ....

Brother Kumar was a former General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Daily Rated Workers. He passed away last November at age 68.â €
â €
Three veteran trade unionists were also conferred the Comrade of Labour (Star) (Bar) accolade, the highest award category for unionists this year â€” Brother Karthikeyan Krishnamurthy, Executive Secretary, United Workers Of Petroleum Industry; Brother Tan Hock Soon, General Secretary, Food, Drinks & Allied Workers Union; and Brother Toh Hock Poh, Consultant, Metal Industries Workers Union. All three remain involved in union work, drawing upon decades of experience to help brothers and sisters tackle current challenges.â €
â €
COVID-19 has created an extremely challenging environment for workers and businesses. We will be progressively re-opening our economy and easing circuit breaker measures after 1 June. Our tripartite partnership â€” of government, the Labour Movement and @ntucsingapore, and employers â€” must work harder and more closely than ever to support workers and businesses. Recovery will be long and hard, but I am confident that together, we can overcome our difficulties.â €

The @nycsg, together with @dstnctsg, have created #DearCovid19SG, a platform for youths to share personal experiences and stories of the pandemic.

The accounts are varied â€” those who have suffered and recovered from the disease, a couple who held an e-wedding, resilient young hawkers, and some sharing their NS stories. Many are tales of overcoming adversity, while others are a call for sympathy and empathy for others.

It is a reminder that we are all in this together, and that it is good to reach out and to listen to what others are going through. If you have a COVID-19 story, why not share it with NYC? â€“ LHL

Nevertheless, the SPF remains steadfast in their role as our guardians. They have also taken on new duties as part of the Ministerial Task Force on COVID-19, helping to look after our migrant workers.

â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Previous generations have united, showed their mettle, and brought Singapore to what it is today. The choices that we make in this fight will define who we are as a people, and what values and ideals we pass on to future generations. Faced with adversity, we cannot yield to fear, anger or bitterness. We must not lose heart or falter.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
In the next few weeks, several Ministers will address you, to share our plans for a post-COVID-19 Singapore, and how Singapore will see through this storm and emerge stronger. My Cabinet team, with the support of the whole public service, will do our best to lead us. Working as one, we can take Singapore safely through this crisis, and keep Singapore exceptional: a fair and just society where everyone can chase their dreams. Together, let us make the Singapore spirit flourish in the world.

We discussed their work so far, what comes next, and what we can tweak and improve. We have come a long way, and the migrant workers are now starting to go back to work.

Helping our migrant workers has demanded a multi-faceted approach, with teams from many agencies working together. They have deployed both high tech and the personal touch, and put in enormous efforts to tackle the problem.

It will take us a few more months to resolve the dorms issue. We have kept things under control, and will progressively bring things back up and running again. Thank you all, once again, and keep up the good work! â€“ LHL (MCI Photos by Chwee [1] and Lee Jia Wen [2-4])

The task force should not tell us not to be alarmed to see covid cases rising. Probably its OK to say that 3 months ago but now when Phase 2 is rushed into Phase 1 & then the economy is rushed to open again.. the hidden reservoirs are not flushed out yet & the aggressive testing has just barely begun.

Nomination Day will be on Tuesday, 30 June 2020. The Returning Officer has announced that Polling Day is on 10 July.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
The road to recovery after COVID-19 will be one of Singaporeâ€™s greatest tests. To overcome the challenges ahead, we must stand completely united as one people. A general election now, when things are relatively stable, will clear the decks and give the Government a fresh five-year mandate. Then, we can focus on the agenda of recovery, and the difficult decisions that will have to be made.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Many of you are understandably concerned about safety at this time. To keep voters safe, the Elections Department will implement a number of added precautions for Polling Day. There will be more polling stations to reduce crowding. Voters will be given specific time slots for voting. Seniors will also be given priority to vote before others.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
This GE will be like no other we have experienced. Not just because of the special arrangements, but also the grave issues at stake. The new Government will have critical decisions to make, which will impact and influence your lives and livelihoods. These decisions will shape Singapore for many years to come, far beyond the five-year term of the next Government. I have every confidence you will think carefully, and vote wisely, to secure our lives, our jobs and our future. â€“ LHLâ €â €â €â €â €â €â €","['ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬ ğŸ’™\U0001f90dâ¤ï¸', 'Dear PM Lee, please kindly look to increase wages of Nurses after this ordeal .

He has been in my Cabinets since the beginning, and it is with sadness that I accepted his retirement ahead of this GE.â €
â €
Boon Wan has made immense contributions to Singapore, and left deep impressions on those he worked with, including me personally as a dear friend. In fact, it was Boon Wan who suggested in 2012 that I venture into social media. But for him you might not even be reading this here on Instagram!â €
â €
No task was ever too daunting for Boon Wan. He was in the Ministry of Health when SARS hit us. The hard lessons we learnt from SARS prepared us to deal with COVID-19. Later as the Minister he reformed MediShield and MediSave, and introduced ElderShield, thus keeping healthcare affordable for all Singaporeans. â €
â €
As Minister of National Development, he ramped up the HDB building programme, reducing BTO waiting times.â €
â €
As Transport Minister, and later Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure, Boon Wan tackled one of his biggest challenges â€“ the reliability of the MRT system. He succeeded in his own quiet and unassuming way, apparently effortlessly but actually through a prodigious amount of hard work.â €
â €
Boon Wan had a special knack of explaining nettlesome issues to Singaporeans. His colleagues could always depend on him for generous and sound advice. I am happy that he has agreed to continue sharing his experience and wisdom even after retirement. â €
â €
On behalf of all Singaporeans, and especially residents in his Sembawang constituency, I thank Boon Wan for all that he has done, and wish him a happy, healthy, and well-deserved rest. We are deeply grateful to him, and his dauntless spirit is an inspiration to us all. â€“ LHLâ € â €

â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
This is not a normal election because we are not living in normal times. The central focus of this Manifesto is how we will work together to overcome the crisis of a generation.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
- How to keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe and prevent COVID-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
- How to restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
- How to provide one another care and support, so that together we can keep ourselves safe amidst the uncertainties ahead.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Beyond COVID-19, this Manifesto also sets out the PAPâ€™s longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, beyond the next 5-year term of government â€” 10, 20 years down the road.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government. What the PAP promises, it delivers.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
We need a strong and capable leadership team, with the full support of all Singaporeans, to put our Manifesto into action. That is the way to secure our lives, our jobs, and the Future of Singapore.

May be an image of 1 person.","COVID-19 is the most severe crisis for humanity in a very long time. Every Singaporean has been affected by the pandemic. My Government has spared no effort to support workers, businesses and households. We have done our best to minimise the effects, but the crisis is far from over. 

Some of you have lost jobs, and many more have seen your incomes fall significantly. We are all worried by what lies ahead. We need the most capable team in charge, and a Government which has your strong mandate. Whoever leads Singapore during this crisis must have the full support of its people to make the difficult decisions needed for recovery. I ask you to entrust this responsibility once again to the @papsingapore.

My team and I will work with you to overcome this crisis of a generation. Our manifesto sets out our plans to get through this crisis safely, and then to recover strongly. Our first priority is to save jobs, and help you get back to work if youâ€™ve lost your job. All who need extra help will get it â€” be it for housing, healthcare, education or retirement. We will continue to invest in Singapore so that your children and grandchildren can look forward to a brighter future.

I will devote all my energy to this effort, as I have done for 15 years as PM. But I cannot do this alone â€“ I need your full support, and an able team of Ministers and MPs to help me. Now, more than ever, Singapore needs a capable Government, trusted to make the right decisions for all of us. Please vote for me and my PAP team. Together, we will secure our lives, our jobs, our future. â€“ LHL

Our soldiers have played an active part in the fight against COVID-19, from contact tracing to health surveillance, managing quarantine facilities, and taking care of the migrant worker dormitories. They may not have trained specifically for these tasks, but their mission remains unchanged â€” to protect and safeguard the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans.

Our SAF must remain strong and vigilant, especially as we head into an uncertain future. I am deeply grateful to all the men and women of the SAF, and their families, for their steadfast dedication and service to our nation. â€“ LHL

- Our Lives: We are still in the thick of the fight against COVID-19 and will have to sustain this effort for perhaps a year, or longer.

- Our Jobs: The key focus of the government in the coming months and years must be jobs. We are investing heavily to reskill Singaporeans, and growing our economy to create more good jobs.

- Our Future: Even as we deal with immediate priorities of COVID-19, we must not lose sight of our longer-term mission to improve Singapore.

We will need the best possible leadership and a solidly united population to see us safely through the pandemic and economic pain, and to lead us beyond, into better days ahead.

Generations of Singaporeans have trusted in the PAP, and worked with us to build this country. Your support has been our biggest strength, and the PAP has never let you down.

I ask you once again to give me and my PAP team your mandate, so that we can face the crisis of a generation together, and carve out Singaporeâ€™s place in the world anew. â€“ LHL

â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
BrainHack encourages young participants to explore the latest digital technologies. It provides hands-on training in app development, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, space, 3D printing, and fake news detection. Many of the hackathon projects serve practical, real-world purposes and have the potential to be adopted more widely. Iâ€™m glad to see the strong interest and positive learning attitude among young people, in these challenging times!
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
BrainHack will end on this Sunday, 5 July, which coincidentally is also Youth Day. I hope such events will help youths to pick up technical skills, and more important still a passion to change the world for the better.

Wishing all BrainHack participants a fun learning experience, as well as a happy Youth Day long weekend! â€“ LHL

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this. Its fallout will leave a lasting impact on Singapore and the world.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
This election is arguably our most critical one since independence. The next Government needs the peopleâ€™s strong support, to make difficult decisions, to lead Singapore safely through this crisis and beyond.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Every election, rain or shine, the PAP holds a lunchtime rally at Fullerton. It is the highlight of the campaign. Pandemic or no, we will again hold a Fullerton rally this time, but it will be online.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Join us tomorrow at 12 noon. I will speak about the stakes in this election, and how the PAP can meet the challenges ahead. â€“ LHL

I had sent the card 36 years ago to his father, who had saved it all these years, and passed away just a few months ago aged 103.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
As PM, my duty is not just to keep Singapore intact through this crisis. I must also hand it over to the next generation, in good shape and into good hands. In this election, the @papsingapore has refreshed and reinforced its team with 27 new candidates. They come from many different backgrounds and experiences. They will represent you and walk with you, as we go through the difficult months and years ahead.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
#GE2020 has been an unusual campaign. With COVID-19, we could not gather and hold rallies as we usually do. Still, the virtual campaign has seen a full and serious discussion of issues, and all candidates have had ample opportunity to put forward their views to Singaporeans.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
As you reflect on the campaign on Cooling Off Day tomorrow, and cast your vote on Friday, please think about what is at stake. When you vote, you will be choosing the team that you trust, to lead us through this grave crisis, and on to a brighter future.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
My thanks to all candidates for a hard fought campaign. Thank you too to all who will be on duty on Polling Day, making sure that Singaporeans can vote safely.
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Lastly, to my supporters and volunteers who have done so much to look after residents in Ang Mo Kio, and to Singaporeans who have supported me all these years in politics: thank you for sharing my journey. I hope you will elect my PAP team to continue serving you, to secure #OurLivesOurJobsOurFuture. â€“ LHLâ €â €â €â €â €â €â €","['I love Singaporians from Togetherâ™¡', 'ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘â¤ï¸', 'Love PAP...more cash handouts and dont worry about votes..hahaha', 'The writer wants to give a warning to the local Singaporeans.\nSadly, many people do not bother about this issue until they are personally affected. By that time, it is too late.\nï¿¼ ï¿¼ July 19th, 2020 ï¿¼ Author: Contributions\nï¿¼After reading the article on â€œI am a Seng Kang voterâ€ and many other articles on MSM, I had some reflections. For your information, I voted PAP all my life as I was having good job and pay. I never told all my friends who I voted, I pretended I donâ€™t really care about who wins, as long as my estate is well managed and water still flows.\nActually I am quite aware of whats going on in Singapore, we are surely moving to 6.9M or even 10M, it will come. I believe that Singapore is a small country and we need more people to consume so that the country will become prosperous with GDP growth. Of course, I know whatever the government says or hints, it will happen and we citizens no matter how much we complain or do those feedback, they will still do what they want to do.\nI worked for IT MNC, I was middle management. Over the years, the company had imported so many foreigners that now more than half were foreigners and most are with PRs or new citizenships. It did not affect my job, I collected by five figure a month happily. However, last year the management changed, CECA imported aka new citizen became my boss. And to cut the story short, that was end of my career, I was pushed to limits and pressure forced me to resign. And my replacement, you know better. I quitted my job believing that my knowledge and skills would easily get me another one somewhere. Days turns into months and I remained unemployed since. I used to think people who voted oppositions are those complaint kings who are lazy and instead of upgrading, they complain and complain; in my eyes these people are standard opposition supporters. I went to WSG and E2i events, for your information, they are useless for PMETs, they just want you to rewrite CVs or do some low level menial jobs meant for lower secondary education. Sometimes I wonder why experienced and knowledgeable PMETs like us need to go upgrade to do a low level job while these third world imports get high level jobs and', 'Gay', 'ğŸ‘', 'Is at Hougang St 51 Between Blk 569 & Blk 573 near staircases the grass too Long. @ Blk 572 near coffee shop the grass also too Long', 'â¤ï¸ğŸ™ŒğŸ‘', 'Fully Support PAP .', 'Good morning PM Lee kindly inform between Blk 569 & Blk 573 near the staircase the grass is too Long .

We have a clear mandate and the results show broad-based support for @papsingapore. I will use this mandate responsibly to deal with COVID-19 and the economic downturn, and to take us safely through the crisis, and beyond.â €
â €
At the same time, the results reflect the pain and uncertainty that Singaporeans feel in this crisis. This was not a feel-good election, but one where people are facing real problems, and expect more rough weather to come. There were also real concerns raised during the campaign that we must address.â €
â €
I congratulate the Workersâ€™ Party for their strong performance. I look forward to them participating in and contributing to the debate in Parliament, and to the national debate, as we deal with the urgent issues before us.â €
â €
My thanks to our PAP activists and candidates for your dedication, loyalty and hard work. Thank you also to all public officers mobilised for election duties, who ensured that Singaporeans could vote safely during this unprecedented GE. Finally, thank you to all voters for your patience and understanding. My team will continue to serve Singaporeans, whichever party you voted for.â €
â €
The work of the new government begins today. My government will work with all Singaporeans to overcome our challenges and emerge stronger. With this election behind us, let us now work as one Singapore, to secure Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future. â€“ LHL

I am appreciative of PAP, especially toward LKY and the forefathers who sacrificed their whole lives to build Singapore, a country where I get high standard of education regardless of my background and religion. I didnt come from a well-to-do family and I benefited greatly from the meritocratic system the country has strongly emphasised in. It is a privilege to grow up in Singapore, a place I can call it a home and where I feel my government cares for me as a citizen. As a young voter, Iâ€™ve noticed many fellow young voters voting for the opposition because they do not believe in giving PAP a full mandate in the Parliament. The political landscape is ever-changing, so are the voices of the younger generation. I pray that even as the generations are ever-changing, one thing for sure is we will be appreciative of what we have and not take what we have for granted. What I do hope to see as a young voter, is for PAP to field younger candidates who are not just elites in the army or civil service or top MNCs, but people who are humble in character and truly care for the nation. Politician is more than just about the resume and the impressive, it is also the character, leadership and the zeal to want to sacrifice for our nation. I hope PAP will not lose this relevance in the coming years! (: thank you for serving the nation so wholeheartedly!!', 'Thank you Sir for all the hard work!ğŸ˜ƒ', 'ğŸ˜ğŸ‘', 'Congrats #PAP!

We have a clear mandate and the results show broad-based support for @papsingapore. I will use this mandate responsibly to deal with COVID-19 and the economic downturn, and to take us safely through the crisis, and beyond.â €
â €
At the same time, the results reflect the pain and uncertainty that Singaporeans feel in this crisis. This was not a feel-good election, but one where people are facing real problems, and expect more rough weather to come. There were also real concerns raised during the campaign that we must address.â €
â €
I congratulate the Workersâ€™ Party for their strong performance. I look forward to them participating in and contributing to the debate in Parliament, and to the national debate, as we deal with the urgent issues before us.â €
â €
My thanks to our PAP activists and candidates for your dedication, loyalty and hard work. Thank you also to all public officers mobilised for election duties, who ensured that Singaporeans could vote safely during this unprecedented GE. Finally, thank you to all voters for your patience and understanding. My team will continue to serve Singaporeans, whichever party you voted for.â €
â €
The work of the new government begins today. My government will work with all Singaporeans to overcome our challenges and emerge stronger. With this election behind us, let us now work as one Singapore, to secure Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future. â€“ LHL

We have a clear mandate and the results show broad-based support for @papsingapore. I will use this mandate responsibly to deal with COVID-19 and the economic downturn, and to take us safely through the crisis, and beyond.â €
â €
At the same time, the results reflect the pain and uncertainty that Singaporeans feel in this crisis. This was not a feel-good election, but one where people are facing real problems, and expect more rough weather to come. There were also real concerns raised during the campaign that we must address.â €
â €
I congratulate the Workersâ€™ Party for their strong performance. I look forward to them participating in and contributing to the debate in Parliament, and to the national debate, as we deal with the urgent issues before us.â €
â €
My thanks to our PAP activists and candidates for your dedication, loyalty and hard work. Thank you also to all public officers mobilised for election duties, who ensured that Singaporeans could vote safely during this unprecedented GE. Finally, thank you to all voters for your patience and understanding. My team will continue to serve Singaporeans, whichever party you voted for.â €
â €
The work of the new government begins today. My government will work with all Singaporeans to overcome our challenges and emerge stronger. With this election behind us, let us now work as one Singapore, to secure Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future. â€“ LHL

Todayâ€™s walk was a nice change of pace compared to the hectic schedule of campaign walkabouts. I had time to take some shots of the hawkers â€“ their wares looked mouth-watering!

Now that the dust is settling after the hustings, I am looking forward to getting back to the task at hand â€”Â navigating Singapore through the COVID-19 crisis. â€“ LHL

And of course, we still have an #NDP2020 theme song. Sung by @nathanhartono, this yearâ€™s music video features scenes showcasing the stories of Singaporeans who have selflessly contributed during these tough times. Other stories will be featured during the NDP morning and evening shows.â €

There are also those who cannot find employment need bike to do delivery. Motorcycles do not cause traffic jam. Even if ten motorbikes were to breakdown along CTE during peak hour, they can just park them along the road shoulder and traffic can just move on. But even a very small car stall in the middle of CTE at say Bukit Timah exit during peak hour, the the jam will go right up to Ang Mo Kio. I remember about LTA stand that motorcycle occupy road space like cars, hence the COE. May I suggest that if the government insist on collecting COE on motorbike then lets make it standard that those bike below 200 cc pay COE of say $1000.00. This is for the bottom of our population that need help most.200cc up to say 500cc $2000.00. Those bike above 750 cc pay COE PLUS of say $5000.00.

My team and I are humbled that Singaporeans have entrusted us with this heavy responsibility. We will continue to do our best for Singapore. With your mandate, I have formed the strongest Cabinet I could, to take Singapore through this crisis and beyond. We will use our mandate to act on your behalf, to deal with the challenges ahead, and lead Singapore out of the crisis.
Â 
I have spent my entire adult life in public service and I will continue to devote myself to Singapore. My aim is to see through this crisis, and hand over Singapore, into good hands who can take the country further forward.Â Â

Let us now all come together as one Singapore, unite and focus our energies on the major challenges ahead. Keep improving our lives, securing our future and building a nation we can all be proud to call home. â€“ LHL

The Atlantic Council is an American think tank that focuses on international affairs, and I was grateful for the opportunity to share our perspectives on global issues. We spoke on a great variety of topics, from US-China tensions, developments in Hong Kong, and how Singapore is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the pandemic has forced many countries to turn inwards and focus on domestic issues, we must also remember that we are still friends and partners with the rest of the world. You can watch our discussion from last night on the PMO YouTube channel (link in my profile). â€“ LHL

The project has been suspended since last April, partly because of political transitions in Malaysia, and partly because of COVID-19. Officials on both sides put in many months of hard work into the intense negotiations, in order to complete the revised agreements. Work can now at last resume.

The RTS Link is a valuable project to both sides. It will improve connectivity and people-to-people ties between Singapore and Johor. Once operational, it will ease congestion on the Causeway. So it was apt that we marked this milestone with a bilateral ceremony at the Causeway, which has connected our two countries for almost a hundred years.

The pandemic has shown how deeply entwined our two countries are. Even in these difficult times, we continue to work together, and look forward to doing still more together. â€“ LHL

May be an image of 1 person.","Every 9 August since independence, rain or shine, in good years and difficult ones, we have come together for the National Day Parade, to celebrate the birth of our nation, and renew our commitment to Singapore.

This year, despite COVID-19, we are still holding the Parade â€” as a symbol of our solidarity, and also to salute those on our frontline, fighting the pandemic.

We need our unity and resilience now more than ever. As we have seen in other countries, the danger of a resurgence of cases is ever present. We also need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Let us brace ourselves for the trials ahead, so that many years from now, when our grandchildren celebrate National Day, they will look back and say that this generation stood together, sacrificed for one another, and built Singapore together.

Let us show the world that whatever the challenges, Singaporeans will stay united, and prevail once more.

I wish all Singaporeans a very happy National Day! ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬Â

May be an image of 1 person.","Every 9 August since independence, rain or shine, in good years and difficult ones, we have come together for the National Day Parade, to celebrate the birth of our nation, and renew our commitment to Singapore.

This year, despite COVID-19, we are still holding the Parade â€” as a symbol of our solidarity, and also to salute those on our frontline, fighting the pandemic.

We need our unity and resilience now more than ever. As we have seen in other countries, the danger of a resurgence of cases is ever present. We also need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Let us brace ourselves for the trials ahead, so that many years from now, when our grandchildren celebrate National Day, they will look back and say that this generation stood together, sacrificed for one another, and built Singapore together.

Let us show the world that whatever the challenges, Singaporeans will stay united, and prevail once more.

I wish all Singaporeans a very happy National Day! ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬Â

Japan is one of the countries with whom we are discussing setting up reciprocal â€˜green lanesâ€™, to resume essential travel with the necessary safety precautions. We are proceeding cautiously, as COVID-19 is still very much a threat.

Had a fruitful meeting with Communist Party of China Politburo member and Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Office Director Yang Jiechi. As you would expect, we discussed our respective COVID-19 situations. Despite the pandemic, both sides have kept up contacts through phone and video calls. Singapore and China had earlier agreed on a â€œfast laneâ€ for essential business and official travel between both countries. At the moment this covers six Chinese provinces and municipalities, and hopefully this list will grow if the situation stays under control.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic relations. Our ties with China are substantial and multi-faceted. I am confident that by working with each other and with the international community, we can make more progress in the post-COVID world. â€“ LHL

She laid out five priorities in this new term of government: â€¨1. Secure jobs for Singaporeans; â€¨2. Build a fair and just society; â€¨3. Strengthen our Singaporean identity; â€¨4. Evolve our politics; andÂ 
5. Build a â€˜Singapore Togetherâ€™ spirit in the next phase of nation building.

MPs will debate the Presidentâ€™s speech next week, and I will be speaking in the debate.

These are uncertain times, and we will have to continue adapting to major changes in the world.

I have worked well with Mr Abe for close to nine years. Under his leadership, our bilateral relations have deepened. We last met in person in November, and more recently online in April, during the virtual ASEAN Plus Three Summit on COVID-19.

Mr Abe also played a critical role in concluding the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) after the US left the original Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.

I wish Abe-san a good recovery as he begins treatment for his condition. â€“ LHL

85,Lee Hsien Loong,2.39E+18,2/9/2020 21:06,leehsienloong,,"Gave my first speech of this Parliament this afternoon. Each first Parliament sitting is a valuable opportunity to take stock of how we have done so far, what has gotten us here, and what our immediate priorities are.
â €
This time, our work is cut out for us â€“ not only to deal with the immediate threat of COVID-19, but also to plan for an uncertain new future in its wake. â €
â €
In this climate of economic uncertainty, it is only natural to feel anxious about our social support, and competition from foreigners. I want to reassure Singaporeans that the Government will always be on your side. This is why we are adjusting our work pass schemes, and tightening the Fair Consideration Framework. However, please remember that we must stay open to the world, to attract businesses to set up here, and in turn create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans. â €
â €
During the clarifications, I explained the mindset we should have in elections. Voters are choosing the party they wish to govern Singapore; your vote matters. Vote because you truly support the party, whether PAP or opposition, and not because you want â€˜the best of both worldsâ€™. â €
â €
Singaporean voters have spoken, and I respect their choice. The Government will do its part to work with the opposition to keep Parliament a constructive forum for debate. â €
â €
Singapore has survived many life or death crises before. Each time we survived, and came back stronger. Like all previous crises, COVID-19 will be the occasion for us to do better, emerge stronger, and more united than before.

Never was the opening of a medical facility so timely and fortuitous, as NCID found itself at the forefront of our fight against COVID-19 just a few months later.Â 

We were lucky that NCID was up and running before COVID-19 hit us, but this did not happen by chance. It was the result of years of planning and hard work by government agencies, medical and research institutions, and healthcare partners. Without this, our response to the pandemic would have been very different.

NCID, and all our medical and healthcare institutions and workers, remain our first line of defence against the pandemic. Our situation is stable for now, but the battle is far from won.

It takes over from the Inter-agency Task Force (ITF), which has been doing COVID-19 operations in the migrant worker dormitories since April.â €
 â €
I am grateful to the ACE and ITF teams for their hard work. They have been testing our migrant workers, plus delivering meals, providing medical care, keeping them safe and finally bringing the dorm outbreak well under control. It has been an enormous task, on a scale beyond what most Singaporeans are aware of.â €
 â €
We are now transitioning to a more permanent arrangement with ACE. The migrant workers are returning to work. We have to ensure that they can work safely, live safely, and rest safely, to prevent COVID-19 from coming back. We need support from employers, dorm operators, management, and non-government organisations. We also ask for the understanding of the migrant workers themselves, as we strive to keep them safe and well.â €

I visited the @nea_sg â€“ Environmental Health Institute (EHI) Mosquito Production Facility yesterday. Project Wolbachia involves the release of Wolbachia bacteria-carrying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector that spreads dengue. When the released male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti that do not carry Wolbachia, their eggs donâ€™t hatch. This reduces the mosquito population, and the risk of dengue transmission. 

I learned about various technologies under development that will allow EHI to efficiently produce and release large numbers of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. Project Wolbachia is a collaborative effort: EHI works closely with local and international partners, including Orinno Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Verily Life Sciences, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop such technologies.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito suppression is just one of the ways we are fighting dengue. All of us have an important part to play in helping to destroy mosquito breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Hope you havenâ€™t forgotten how to do the Mozzie Wipeout!

#ProjectWolbachiaSG is one of the EHIâ€™s many projects. They also monitor air quality as well as conduct environmental surveillance. Their waste water surveillance programme has an important role in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. My thanks to NEA, EHI and their partners for their efforts in keeping us safe. â€“ LHL

Alex and Fahmi take over from Teo Ho Pin and @maliki_osman, who are stepping down after many years of leadership and contributions.

Our Mayors are chairpersons of the Community Development Councils (CDCs) for the five respective districts. The CDCs play an important role in our social support system. They not only implement government programmes, but also serve as eyes and ears on the ground. They connect with communities, and identify emerging needs and gaps in social support. CDCs deliver services with a human touch, in a way that government agencies that operate on a national scale find harder to do. 

CDCs work quietly to fulfil their mission, but in times of crisis, their contributions are vital. Since COVID-19, the CDCs have rolled out more than 70 initiatives. The CDC Vouchers Scheme is a good example. The five CDCs launched this community scheme to help 400,000 households defray the cost of living, while supporting local businesses through the COVID-19 period.
 
Congratulations to all five Mayors on their appointments. I wish them every success in their new term!

This year also marks the 5th anniversary of the signing of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP). Despite the COVID-19 disruptions we have made significant progress in key areas of cooperation under the CSP.

Parents know how resilient children can be, but it still makes us proud to see how bravely and responsibly our young ones have adapted â€“ wearing masks in classrooms, getting used to home-based learning, forgoing birthday parties with friends, and celebrating the usual festivals and events, like Childrenâ€™s Day, a little differently.

This yearâ€™s edition of the annual photo contest by @moesingapore, â€œOur Schools, Our Storiesâ€, captures images of school life before and after COVID-19. A roving exhibition of the winning photos is going to 7 locations around the island until 1 March 2021. Do catch it if you can!

Ensuring access to quality mental healthcare for every citizen is a major priority for us. COVID-19 has made this especially vital, as more people face stresses, pressures and disruptions to their lives and livelihoods. Weâ€™ve set up a National CARE Hotline (1800-202-6868) and a COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce, to help all those who need it.

One of the biggest hurdles dealing with mental health problems is the stigma. But this is also why the best and most reliable support system is the people around us. If we know someone having a tough time, even a simple â€œhow are you?â€ is a good way to show we care, and to reassure them itâ€™s okay to talk about their problems.Â 

In Singapore, 1 in 7 will suffer from a mental health condition at some point in their lives. Just as we take care of each othersâ€™ physical health by wearing masks, let us also work together to understand mental health better, to care for one another during these difficult times. â€“ LHL

The theme was â€œReimagining the next normal for Asia and the Worldâ€. I shared what we have been doing to see Singapore through this COVID-19 pandemic.Â 

To wrap up our discussion, moderator Oliver Tonby, Chairman of McKinsey & Company Asia, asked for my views on good leadership.Â 

My answer: a good leader must muster a capable team that you can trust, and tap on others who know more than you. You must also be psychologically prepared for surprises and setbacks, and make the best decision based on the knowledge you have. Above all, focus on your responsibilities and fulfil your duty to your people, regardless of any personal consequences to yourself. â€“ LHL

It was for the Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre in Singapore (HMGICS). Set to open in 2022, this facility will be the first of its kind. It will develop automotive technologies, and manufacture electric vehicles to export around the world. This will help steer us towards our goal to have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040.â €
â €
The HMGICS will also create more jobs for Singaporeans, especially cutting edge roles that will require new skills. COVID-19 has shown the need to integrate technology into more aspects of our lives, whether work or leisure. Climate change, too, is a longer-term issue that we must take action on. The new facility will help us address both issues.â €
â €
Iâ€™m happy to see our relationship with Hyundai deepen. I am confident that Hyundaiâ€™s vision and ambition â€“ to push the limits of what is possible â€“ will make this project a success. May this pave the way for deeper partnerships with our friends from Korea! â€“ LHLâ €

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought on serious challenges for every country, including the United States and Singapore. At this critical time, the duty of a leader is to unite the people, strengthen their trust in the government, and see the nation through the crisis.

With his long history and deep experience as a former US Vice President and US Senator, Mr Biden is well-placed to lead his country through the challenges ahead.

Mr Biden is familiar with the USâ€™ long-standing, multifaceted and robust partnership with Singapore. As Vice President, he visited Singapore in 2013. Three years later, when I visited Washington D.C. in August 2016, he made time to host me to lunch too.

Mr Biden, Singapore looks forward to working with you and your Administration to deepen the partnership between our two countries, enhance the USâ€™ role in Asia-Pacific, and overcome COVID-19. You can count on Singapore to remain a friend and partner. â€“ LHL

This is where it gets good. The house/congress votes on who the President will be. It has nothing to do with what party that has power. Every State gets one vote and 30 States are held by Republicans.and 19 by Democrats. They have to vote down party lines, they have no choice due to the 12th Amendment of the Constitution and the Senate votes for the Vice President where a similar even will take place.

John Micklethwait, Bloombergâ€™s Editor-in-chief, asked me this during my interview for their New Economy Forum.

My answer was simple: COVID-19 is a powerful reminder that while Man proposes, God disposes. Immediately, governments worldwide were forced to change gears, put aside their plans, and make COVID-19 their top priority. It was a stark lesson that no matter how carefully one plans ahead, being able to deal with the unexpected is equally important. â€“ LHL

During Phase 3, such testing will become a regular occurrence. This will allow infectious cases to be quickly identified (particularly asymptomatic cases), isolated and treated. Then the community at large can be kept safe, and life and work can continue more normally. â€“ LHL

â €
Mr Biden takes office at a time when many pressing challenges confront the US and the rest of the world, not least dealing with COVID-19. Strong American leadership will decisively contribute to our collective recovery, and the shape of the post-pandemic world. â €
â €
This US election was contentious and bitter. I wish Mr Biden every success in his endeavours to heal the divisions. National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman put it beautifully in her poem she recited at the inauguration: â€œSo we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seek harm to none and harmony for all.â€â €
â €
Singapore has been a long-standing strategic, defence and economic partner of the US. I look forward to working with Mr Biden and his Administration to strengthen Americaâ€™s engagement of Asia and ASEAN. I hope to meet him face-to-face as soon as we are able to, either in Singapore or Washington DC. â€“ LHLâ €

Healthcare and aviation have had a tough year because of COVID-19. As we celebrate the festive season (safely) with our families and friends, let us remember to thank workers â€“ from frontline and essential services, to transport and retail, and many more â€“ whose hard work allows so many others to enjoy the holiday.

This was what we needed, to keep Singaporeans safe and protect their livelihoods during COVID-19.
â €â €â €â €â €â €
This year, we will continue to help Singaporeans and businesses through the $11 billion COVID-19 Resilience Package. Although we are again running a deficit, it is much smaller â€“ only 2.2% of GDP. Things are gradually returning to normal.
â €â €â €â €â €â €
While grappling with the pandemic, we must not neglect the future. Hence the Budget has many items that build our capabilities and competitiveness. When the sun shines again, we must be ready to seize the new opportunities.
â €â €â €â €â €â €
This â€œcan doâ€ spirit helped us overcome the last financial crisis. With the resilience that our people have shown this time, I am confident that we can do it again.
