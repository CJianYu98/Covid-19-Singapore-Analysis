During my walkabouts, many residents asked about our national vaccination programme. Some also wanted to hear about my personal experience. I assured them that vaccination is safe and effective.

Prior to getting the vaccination, I sat down with Dr Shawn Vasoo to run through the medical questionnaire. The vaccine is safe and effective, even for former stroke patients like myself.
 
During my East Coast Conversation with residents about Phase 3 on Sunday, vaccination was understandably the top discussion topic. We are progressively rolling out our national vaccination strategy in the coming weeks and months. I strongly encourage you to take it up when it becomes available to you. This will not only protect you, but also your loved ones and our community."

I hope the young scientists will be inspired to further pursue their passion for science and technology and to push the frontiers of innovation. And I welcome our overseas participants to visit Singapore when air travel resumes.⁣

It is also the first week of work for adults, including for Parliament. As I walked to Parliament House yesterday, the streets were noticeably busier as offices in the CBD resumed activities.
 
At Parliament yesterday, @gankimyong shared that more vaccine shipments are expected and there will be enough vaccines for all Singaporeans, PRs  and long-term residents by 3Q of 2021 if all goes to plan. @lawrencewongst explained how regular testing will be ramped up and will become a part of our lives during the pandemic.

It is also the first week of work for adults, including for Parliament. As I walked to Parliament House yesterday, the streets were noticeably busier as offices in the CBD resumed activities.
 
At Parliament yesterday, @gankimyong shared that more vaccine shipments are expected and there will be enough vaccines for all Singaporeans, PRs  and long-term residents by 3Q of 2021 if all goes to plan. @lawrencewongst explained how regular testing will be ramped up and will become a part of our lives during the pandemic.
 
This is how we started the year — with a dose of hope and a note of vigilance. And this is how we should approach the year ahead.

Our healthcare workers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases were the first to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Singapore. They will get their second dose in 21 days. We will progressively roll out our vaccination program to staff at public healthcare institutions and private hospitals. We aim to make vaccination available to the elderly from February next year.

This comes after the Government accepted all the recommendations of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccinations on Sunday. The vaccine will enable us to better protect ourselves and our loved ones. 

Let me take this opportunity to thank all our healthcare workers and frontline staff for your dedication and outstanding work in keeping all of us safe in Singapore.

Every country is doing its best to contain the spread of the virus and the economic fallout. But no place can truly be safe, until every place is safe.
 
This is why strong international cooperation is critical to accelerate the development of vaccines, maximise production capacity, and ensure the affordable, fair and equitable access to vaccines for all.
 
New and innovative forms of multilateral cooperation have been created in response to the pandemic, including the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and the COVID-19 Global Vaccines Access (COVAX) Facility. Singapore is an early support of these initiatives, and also co-chairs the Friends of the COVAX Facility with Switzerland.
 
Our collective effort will enable us to overcome this crisis. By working together and strengthening the foundations of international cooperation, we can better deal with future crises and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, so as to build a better future for our people.

COVID-19 is a global crisis, so international cooperation is critical. The #G20, which covers nearly 80% of the world’s economy, and the @who have key roles to play.
 
Countries, International Organisations and the private sector are joining forces to accelerate vaccine development, maximise manufacturing capacity, and ensure equitable distribution. Singapore is an early supporter of the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility. Switzerland and Singapore are also co-chairing the “Friends of the COVAX Facility” to promote vaccine multilateralism. 
 
At the same time, as we restart our economies in a safe manner, countries need to coordinate our resumption of activities. As we restart air travel, testing will be key to give assurance to travellers and public health authorities. We must work together to develop international standards, and share test results quickly including through electronic means.
 
We must also continue to identify gaps and strengthen our health and financial resilience against future outbreaks.

Much has changed since we last spoke in February, as we now face the common challenge of resuming social and economic activities, while safeguarding against further waves of COVID-19 infections.⁣
⁣
Vice Premier Han and I discussed how China and Singapore can deepen existing cooperation and work together in new areas. One key area of cooperation that we discussed was public health, including the development of COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines and treatments. I thanked Vice Premier Han for China’s pledge to make Chinese vaccines available globally. We also agreed that it was important to further strengthen connectivity between our two countries and with the rest of the world, in areas such as supply chain, financial, infrastructure and flight connectivity. This will enable the flow of goods, people and investments that are necessary for economic recovery.⁣
⁣
I am glad that our joint efforts to create new opportunities and enhance connectivity have continued despite COVID-19, including through key bilateral projects and cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative. The strides that we have taken reflects our common resolve to overcome the pandemic together and emerge stronger.⁣
⁣
This is an important year for our countries as we mark the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations. I look forward to welcoming Vice Premier Han to Singapore for the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) meeting when the COVID situation permits.⁣

Much has changed since we last spoke in February, as we now face the common challenge of resuming social and economic activities, while safeguarding against further waves of COVID-19 infections.⁣
⁣
Vice Premier Han and I discussed how China and Singapore can deepen existing cooperation and work together in new areas. One key area of cooperation that we discussed was public health, including the development of COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines and treatments. I thanked Vice Premier Han for China’s pledge to make Chinese vaccines available globally. We also agreed that it was important to further strengthen connectivity between our two countries and with the rest of the world, in areas such as supply chain, financial, infrastructure and flight connectivity. This will enable the flow of goods, people and investments that are necessary for economic recovery.⁣
⁣
I am glad that our joint efforts to create new opportunities and enhance connectivity have continued despite COVID-19, including through key bilateral projects and cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative. The strides that we have taken reflects our common resolve to overcome the pandemic together and emerge stronger.⁣
⁣
This is an important year for our countries as we mark the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations. I look forward to welcoming Vice Premier Han to Singapore for the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) meeting when the COVID situation permits.⁣
