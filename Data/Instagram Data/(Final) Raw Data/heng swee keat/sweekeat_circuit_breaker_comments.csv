So 4,5  years later she would do the same thing 😁",2020-11-23T06:29:27.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CH37VWGhSBy/,2020-11-22T01:01:55.000Z,"Kindergarten graduation ceremonies are a joy to look forward to at this time of the year — seeing the enthusiasm of the graduating children and sharing in the excitement of their parents and teachers.

This year, with the pandemic, the year-end concerts and graduation ceremonies turned into hybrid events, with the children at school and attendees watching online. I joined two virtual kindergarten graduation ceremonies in my constituency this month — My First Skool at Bedok South Blk 1 and @pcf.sg Sparkletots at Bedok Blk 30.

Despite the challenging school year, our children have adjusted well, thanks to the dedication of teachers and parents. Our little ones have been resilient and adapted to new norms, not only in their own lives but accepting changes in their parents’ routines as well.

To our graduating K2 students — congratulations! I hope you continue to enjoy your learning journey as you embark on a new adventure in primary school. Keep learning and keep growing. 🎓

0,cindylim1156,👏👏👏👏👏💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,2020-09-04T03:53:11.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CEsnSWeB_cI/,2020-09-04T02:00:55.000Z,"Like many of our events this year, the annual PCF Teachers’ Day get together went online this year. @maliki_osman, @kiathowsg (and special guest 👶), @chuanjin1 and I joined around 230 PCF teachers and staff from 14 centres across Bedok, Kampong Chai Chee, Siglap and Kembangan-Chai Chee for their virtual Teachers’ Day Celebration on Thursday.

When schools went on full home-based learning during the circuit breaker, our teachers were resilient in the face of the disruptions and uncertainties. They continued on resolutely — coming up with new ways to impart knowledge and adjusting and adapting as the weeks went by. My thanks to parents and family members for your support as we all jointly rediscovered the teaching and learning journey in this new context. And well done to our students for being adaptable. Perhaps the most important lesson our teachers will impart to their students this year will be the one demonstrated by their actions — of not giving up during tough times and finding new ways to overcome challenges together.

The theme of the celebration was “Hats off” so teachers and staff gamely showed up in their most colourful and creative headgear! Indeed, hats off to all our teachers for your dedication, for doing your best to protect and nurture our children. This Teachers’ Day, let us remember to keep learning, innovating and adapting. 

Happy Teachers’ Day to all our wonderful teachers and educators!"

Catherine Tang is a salesperson at this store, which serves as a platform to promote and showcase the talent of people with autism and related challenges. She was a very persuasive salesperson, and I left the store happy with a bagful of purchases. The Autism Resource Centre had trained her well for her job.⁣

We heard from 30 social service sector partners, on the challenges they and their clients are facing. We discussed how our social service agencies can strengthen collaboration and capability building. Their passion to serve came through during the dialogue, as they are doing all they can to strengthen support for vulnerable members of our community during the circuit breaker. The circuit breaker has accelerated the shift to digital, as more services are provided online. This highlighted both the potential and also the current constraints of going digital. Many also shared their concerns about the difficulties with fundraising during this period.

Many good ideas were raised. I will look at how we can better support the social service sector as part of the upcoming Budget. We will also work with the sector to embrace digitalisation, accelerate transformation and scale up new capabilities.

What is even more heartening is how the sector is working together. Some participants were already working closely together, and new areas of collaboration were identified during our discussions. The sector faces many common challenges, but we can overcome them if we work in partnership, and put our collective effort into tackling them. This is the spirit of our #SingaporeTogether movement.

We are making good progress towards building a more caring and inclusive society. We will build an even better tomorrow, with the strong support of social service agencies.

Usually, Tampines residents would come together to celebrate this special occasion with bazaars, performances, and other festive activities in our community. This year, due to COVID-19, we are celebrating a homely Hari Raya.⠀

As we celebrate Hari Raya, we celebrate the spirit of caring, giving, and togetherness — just like the spirit of #SGUnited and #SingaporeTogether.⠀

These are unprecedented and trying times for everyone. However, I am glad to see Singaporeans remain strong and resilient. Our Tampines residents have continued to help and care for those in need. Our Muslim community has also shown kindness and understanding, despite having to scale down on many of our activities during this period.⠀
⠀
Let us continue to stay home and stay safe during this period, so that we can look forward to celebrating many more special occasions with our families and friends!⠀

Our Muslim community has also shown kindness and understanding, despite having to scale down on many of our activities during this period.⠀
⠀
Let us continue to stay home and stay safe during this period, so that we can look forward to celebrating many more special occasions with our families and friends!⠀
⠀
Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri to all Muslims in Singapore.⠀

Saya bangga penduduk Melayu/Islam kita telah menunjukkan kesabaran dan berdaya tahan bersama masyarakat Singapura yang lain dalam usaha menangani penularan COVID-19 ini.&nbsp;⠀
⠀
Meskipun suasana Raya tahun ini mungkin berlainan, namun ia tidak harus mematahkan semangat dan keceriaan kita menyambut bersama orang yang tersayang.⠀

Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri kepada semua penduduk Islam Singapura."

2,123atsummer,"Thank You Mr Heng and your Team for keeping Spore safe and extending help to keep jobs and businesses. Opening up of pre-schools, perhaps should be reconsidered seriously. Reasons: 1. These very young children do not have exam pressure, 2. At this young age, they cannot take care of themselves by wearing face masks properly or keeping hygienic. 3. The teachers do not have the time to look into taking care of each kid. 4. Many grand parents, parents or helpers will congregate to fetch them to and fro. 5.Those children without pte pick up need the school buses to fetch them. Usually buses need an optimum passenger load. Also frequent disinfecting of buses and school areas cannot be guaranteed. 6. Many such young children are prone to flu, cough and fever during normal times, hence covid-19 is even more critical to keep them safe from crowds.",2020-05-19T13:52:00.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAXmL5snM8Z/,2020-05-19T12:01:41.000Z,"We will be exiting the circuit breaker when it ends on 1 June.

I really think your team haven’t thought this through carefully and it’s extremely disappointing. And btw your 75% doesn’t help as we have to pay the rest and are made to pay the foreign workers at least 75% too! Listen to the ground.

I used to go there for events and would often meet many residents shopping, exercising, finding good makan, attending classes, visiting the library, enjoying movie screenings, and so much more — there’s always something going on at OTH.

OTH is a lot quieter these days — and for good reason, as many residents and Singaporeans understand the need and importance of staying home during this period.

The OTH team has worked hard to move the buzz online — with OTH’s Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube channels offering contests, workouts, craft tutorials, and concerts to keep everyone staying safe at home entertained and occupied. So you can check out OTH virtually!

I know many residents are looking forward to visiting OTH again. As we slowly and gradually emerge from the circuit breaker, it will not be the same as before. We will have to observe precautionary measures including SafeEntry, to protect the community and prevent a surge of new cases.

For Teachers, this means putting in extra time and effort to prepare. HBL is a different mode of teaching, and you have to be creative and learn new skills to make online learning as engaging as possible.

For Parents, you have to support your children in the best possible way, even as you juggle working from home and housework.

For Students, I know many of you miss your classmates, your favourite hangouts and CCAs in schools. E-learning is not new, but having to do so remotely for a month is a completely different way to learn.

Challenging as it is for everyone, this experience also creates many memorable stories. I urge you all to share these, so that we can all learn about what worked, what did not; why not, and how we can do better.

Let us all be prepared to try new things, adapt and grow with this new experience, and we may just become more innovative after this! The first step in any innovation is to overcome the fear of the unknown. But if the new approach is better, we can learn better. If the traditional approach is better, we will appreciate it more, and look forward to going back to school!

Education Minister @ongyekung has brought forward our mid-year school holidays, so that everyone can have a respite. I strongly encourage all parents and students to explore new activities to spend quality time together, at home. I hope all our teachers who have been working very hard can also take a well-deserved break, before some of you have to help graduating cohorts prepare for their national exams from 19 May.

The number of new cases has risen sharply, due largely to the clusters in our migrant worker dormitories. There are signs that our measures are working in the wider community, but the numbers — especially unlinked cases — have not come down enough.⠀
⠀
This is why PM @leehsienloong has just announced a further tightening of measures for two weeks, and an extension of the circuit breaker by four weeks, until 1 Jun.⠀
⠀
The decision to extend the circuit breaker is important in our fight against COVID-19. But the difficult global situation coupled with our extension, will put greater stress on our businesses and workers.⠀
⠀
To all our companies and our workers, we are with you in these difficult times. We will extend key support measures in the Solidarity Budget into the month of May.⠀
⠀
• I will extend the 75% wage subsidy under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to all sectors for the month of May. I urge employers to treat their workers fairly, and to do their best to retain them, and make full use of the support measures for training and corporate upgrading.⠀
⠀
• I will further enhance the JSS to include shareholder-directors who did not qualify for JSS, based on the earlier criteria, and also did not qualify for SIRS.⠀
⠀

For Christians, today is a time of reflection. This year, even more so.

Churches in Singapore are physically closed as part of the “circuit breaker”. So are churches in many parts of the world, where cities are in lock-down. Many are holding their Good Friday and Easter services online.

For Christians, today is a time of reflection. This year, even more so.

Churches in Singapore are physically closed as part of the “circuit breaker”. So are churches in many parts of the world, where cities are in lock-down. Many are holding their Good Friday and Easter services online.

⠀
Like many of us, I am concerned about how our seniors are coping, that they may feel lonely or isolated. Our elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19. With the circuit breaker in place, they should stay home as much as possible. We can visit to assist them with their daily needs while keeping the visits short. This is the best way to protect their well-being. It is not easy to explain that we may sometimes have to stay away because we care, but we must do so.

We can still show care and concern for the elderly, even when we are not physically present. There are many ways to keep in touch — through WhatsApp, video-conferencing apps such as Skype, or just a simple phone call.

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page. This is a @gov.sg collaboration with producer @jackneock for our seniors to enjoy the familiar tunes from yesterdays in the comfort of our homes.⠀
⠀
Let us all help our elderly family members adapt so that they can remain happy and engaged at home. Safe distancing does not mean social isolation.⠀ ⠀
I encourage those with good ideas on how to keep our seniors engaged at home to come forward and take part in the #StayhomeforSG challenge.⠀
⠀
Together, we can get through this difficult period.⠀

昨天，我们推出“全民居家防疫大挑战”，让国人不出门，也能做有意义的活动，积极适应新的生活方式。

国人关心年迈父母和年长者，担心照顾不周，我可以理解。年长者是较高风险群。在这段期间，大家不可以和不住在同一个屋檐下的父母或亲人聚会、一起用餐。这些措施是为了保护年长者，希望所有家庭成员凉解。

所谓百善孝为先，国人在这个非常时期尽孝道更是应该的。我们可以用别的方式表达对年长者的关怀。你可以为满足日常生活需要而探访年迈父母，但只有在必要时才这么做，同时减少所接触的时间。你也可以善用网络社交媒体平台，或打电话问候他们。我们也用新颖的方式把年长者喜欢的活动搬到网上直播。例如，对歌台有兴趣的年长者，不出门也可以通过《丽星网络直播台》观赏节目。这个节目是政府与《歌台直播秀》的制作团队合作带给大家的。

希望国人遵守 “三不”原则: “不慌张，不出门，不乱传”，为阻断病毒传播尽一份力。如果你有好点子，请踊跃参与“全民居家防疫大挑战”!⠀ ⠀

We also have much more content on TV during this period. For those who are interested in getai, you can also tune into e-getais every Monday and Thursday on Lex S Watch Live Channel's FB page. This is a @gov.sg collaboration with producer @jackneock for our seniors to enjoy the familiar tunes from yesterdays in the comfort of our homes.⠀
⠀
Let us all help our elderly family members adapt so that they can remain happy and engaged at home. Safe distancing does not mean social isolation.⠀ ⠀
I encourage those with good ideas on how to keep our seniors engaged at home to come forward and take part in the #StayhomeforSG challenge.⠀
⠀
Together, we can get through this difficult period.⠀

昨天，我们推出“全民居家防疫大挑战”，让国人不出门，也能做有意义的活动，积极适应新的生活方式。

国人关心年迈父母和年长者，担心照顾不周，我可以理解。年长者是较高风险群。在这段期间，大家不可以和不住在同一个屋檐下的父母或亲人聚会、一起用餐。这些措施是为了保护年长者，希望所有家庭成员凉解。

所谓百善孝为先，国人在这个非常时期尽孝道更是应该的。我们可以用别的方式表达对年长者的关怀。你可以为满足日常生活需要而探访年迈父母，但只有在必要时才这么做，同时减少所接触的时间。你也可以善用网络社交媒体平台，或打电话问候他们。我们也用新颖的方式把年长者喜欢的活动搬到网上直播。例如，对歌台有兴趣的年长者，不出门也可以通过《丽星网络直播台》观赏节目。这个节目是政府与《歌台直播秀》的制作团队合作带给大家的。

希望国人遵守 “三不”原则: “不慌张，不出门，不乱传”，为阻断病毒传播尽一份力。如果你有好点子，请踊跃参与“全民居家防疫大挑战”!⠀ ⠀

10,123atsummer,"Mr Heng, my questions: 1. What if the whole family stayd together? Does this mean that in order to protect the grandparents, the younger family members should move out? 2. What if the grand parents are not old and fragilecas assumed but lead an active and healthy life and are relatively young and have been looking after the grand children while the parents are working? 3.  If the healthy grandparents actually stay next door or across the block like 3 mins walk,the grand kids are also not allowed to be with the grand parents? 4. If childcare centres are so safe, why do the pre-schools, all schools need to close? Mr Heng, it is good to apply CB but in this case, I think some form of flexibility should be allowed. Reason is now most parents have to work from home and very young kids are a big distraction. They affect the parents work negatively. Also assuming that all grandparents are old, frail and unhealthy is not altogether correct. Hope that certain form of flexibility be allowed. Who can be approached in MOH or govt officers when the appeal has to be carried out?",2020-04-10T03:39:02.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-x9Jl7n3ZO/,2020-04-10T00:39:48.000Z,"#StayhomeforSG challenge was launched yesterday to encourage Singaporeans to stay active and engaged, even as we stay home. ⠀

昨天，我们推出“全民居家防疫大挑战”，让国人不出门，也能做有意义的活动，积极适应新的生活方式。

国人关心年迈父母和年长者，担心照顾不周，我可以理解。年长者是较高风险群。在这段期间，大家不可以和不住在同一个屋檐下的父母或亲人聚会、一起用餐。这些措施是为了保护年长者，希望所有家庭成员凉解。

所谓百善孝为先，国人在这个非常时期尽孝道更是应该的。我们可以用别的方式表达对年长者的关怀。你可以为满足日常生活需要而探访年迈父母，但只有在必要时才这么做，同时减少所接触的时间。你也可以善用网络社交媒体平台，或打电话问候他们。我们也用新颖的方式把年长者喜欢的活动搬到网上直播。例如，对歌台有兴趣的年长者，不出门也可以通过《丽星网络直播台》观赏节目。这个节目是政府与《歌台直播秀》的制作团队合作带给大家的。

希望国人遵守 “三不”原则: “不慌张，不出门，不乱传”，为阻断病毒传播尽一份力。如果你有好点子，请踊跃参与“全民居家防疫大挑战”!⠀ ⠀

Like many of us, I am concerned about how our seniors are coping, that they may feel lonely or isolated. Our elderly are most vulnerable to COVID-19. With the circuit breaker in place, they should stay home as much as possible. We can visit to assist them with their daily needs while keeping the visits short. This is the best way to protect their well-being. It is not easy to explain that we may sometimes have to stay away because we care, but we must do so.

0,martinst_jourlist,Thank alot sir ..We are prepared on COVID19 crisis.,2020-04-05T08:27:53.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-lwBh7HINH/,2020-04-05T06:54:13.000Z,"We are living in extraordinary times.

This is the first time in our history that we will be closing all schools and most workplaces across the island for a month — a painful but necessary ‘circuit breaker’ to stem the tide of COVID-19 cases.

Tomorrow afternoon, when Parliament sits, I will announce additional support for workers, businesses and households, to help tide them through this period.

The COVID-19 situation has taken a very sharp turn, both globally and locally. Strong measures have to be taken to protect lives, but the economy has taken a hit as a result. Tomorrow will mark the third round of support measures in less than two months — coming after the Unity Budget on 18 Feb and the Resilience Budget on 26 March. This too is another first.

We must remain steadfast in the face of crisis, and stand in solidarity with one another during these difficult times. I am therefore naming this set of measures to tide us through the 'circuit breaker' the Solidarity Budget.

Unity, Resilience, Solidarity — these values will come to define who we are as a people. The bonds that bind us together will be forged and renewed in this crisis, much as how the turbulent years of Independence brought our founding generation together. As we battle on, we are most grateful that earlier generations have saved up and built strong foundations for us. These strengths have given us the wherewithal to protect our people and their jobs.

1,anyhowhomecook,Thank you DPM Heng! 🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️,2020-04-05T08:37:32.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-lwBh7HINH/,2020-04-05T06:54:13.000Z,"We are living in extraordinary times.

This is the first time in our history that we will be closing all schools and most workplaces across the island for a month — a painful but necessary ‘circuit breaker’ to stem the tide of COVID-19 cases.

Tomorrow afternoon, when Parliament sits, I will announce additional support for workers, businesses and households, to help tide them through this period.

The COVID-19 situation has taken a very sharp turn, both globally and locally. Strong measures have to be taken to protect lives, but the economy has taken a hit as a result. Tomorrow will mark the third round of support measures in less than two months — coming after the Unity Budget on 18 Feb and the Resilience Budget on 26 March. This too is another first.

We must remain steadfast in the face of crisis, and stand in solidarity with one another during these difficult times. I am therefore naming this set of measures to tide us through the 'circuit breaker' the Solidarity Budget.

Unity, Resilience, Solidarity — these values will come to define who we are as a people. The bonds that bind us together will be forged and renewed in this crisis, much as how the turbulent years of Independence brought our founding generation together. As we battle on, we are most grateful that earlier generations have saved up and built strong foundations for us. These strengths have given us the wherewithal to protect our people and their jobs.

This is the first time in our history that we will be closing all schools and most workplaces across the island for a month — a painful but necessary ‘circuit breaker’ to stem the tide of COVID-19 cases.

Tomorrow afternoon, when Parliament sits, I will announce additional support for workers, businesses and households, to help tide them through this period.

The COVID-19 situation has taken a very sharp turn, both globally and locally. Strong measures have to be taken to protect lives, but the economy has taken a hit as a result. Tomorrow will mark the third round of support measures in less than two months — coming after the Unity Budget on 18 Feb and the Resilience Budget on 26 March. This too is another first.

We must remain steadfast in the face of crisis, and stand in solidarity with one another during these difficult times. I am therefore naming this set of measures to tide us through the 'circuit breaker' the Solidarity Budget.

Unity, Resilience, Solidarity — these values will come to define who we are as a people. The bonds that bind us together will be forged and renewed in this crisis, much as how the turbulent years of Independence brought our founding generation together. As we battle on, we are most grateful that earlier generations have saved up and built strong foundations for us. These strengths have given us the wherewithal to protect our people and their jobs.

This is a defining chapter of our generation. Together, we will pull through and emerge stronger. When the storm eventually subsides, as all storms do, I am confident that as a stronger society, we can build an even better future for our children and our grandchildren.

The bonds that bind us together will be forged and renewed in this crisis, much as how the turbulent years of Independence brought our founding generation together. As we battle on, we are most grateful that earlier generations have saved up and built strong foundations for us. These strengths have given us the wherewithal to protect our people and their jobs.

This is a defining chapter of our generation. Together, we will pull through and emerge stronger. When the storm eventually subsides, as all storms do, I am confident that as a stronger society, we can build an even better future for our children and our grandchildren.

This is the first time in our history that we will be closing all schools and most workplaces across the island for a month — a painful but necessary ‘circuit breaker’ to stem the tide of COVID-19 cases.

Tomorrow afternoon, when Parliament sits, I will announce additional support for workers, businesses and households, to help tide them through this period.

The COVID-19 situation has taken a very sharp turn, both globally and locally. Strong measures have to be taken to protect lives, but the economy has taken a hit as a result. Tomorrow will mark the third round of support measures in less than two months — coming after the Unity Budget on 18 Feb and the Resilience Budget on 26 March. This too is another first.

Our people in Singapore have been very responsible — they are staying calm and helping one another.

In Tampines, more residents are doing their Saturday grocery shopping, with some buying more than usual.

Island-wide, staff in our shops and supermarkets have been working really hard to replenish stocks on the shelves as fast as they can. Supermarkets and wet markets will remain open. You can still get your favourite food — all food establishments may also remain open for delivery or ‘ta pao’ during this month-long period where we come together to fight the spread of COVID-19.

I trust that our people will continue to be patient and understanding towards the hardworking staff — in our supermarkets, F&B outlets and other essential services.

Let’s continue to look out for one another — and stay united to overcome this crisis.

Most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, will close for one month from next Tuesday.

We are implementing these painful but necessary measures to protect lives. The stronger the measures we adopt, the bigger the disruption and costs on businesses. We remain equally committed to protecting jobs and livelihoods during this time. Many businesses are looking at your cash flow and working out alternative arrangements over the weekend. I understand your worries.

That is why I am working with my team at the @mof_sg, together with other government agencies, to further increase support for businesses during the period of the circuit breaker. This includes boosting the Job Support Scheme and waiving the foreign worker levy for the month of April, so that companies can retain and pay their workers. We will also be passing legislation on Tuesday (7 April) in Parliament to ensure that property tax rebates are passed through to tenants.

This is undoubtedly a difficult month for many businesses. Additional help is on the way. I hope that businesses can tide through this month, hold on to your workers, and resume activities once the circuit breaker is lifted. Together, we can pull through this crisis.

I will announce the details in my ministerial statement in Parliament on Monday.

Most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, will close for one month from next Tuesday.

We are implementing these painful but necessary measures to protect lives. The stronger the measures we adopt, the bigger the disruption and costs on businesses. We remain equally committed to protecting jobs and livelihoods during this time. Many businesses are looking at your cash flow and working out alternative arrangements over the weekend. I understand your worries.

That is why I am working with my team at the @mof_sg, together with other government agencies, to further increase support for businesses during the period of the circuit breaker. This includes boosting the Job Support Scheme and waiving the foreign worker levy for the month of April, so that companies can retain and pay their workers. We will also be passing legislation on Tuesday (7 April) in Parliament to ensure that property tax rebates are passed through to tenants.

This is undoubtedly a difficult month for many businesses. Additional help is on the way. I hope that businesses can tide through this month, hold on to your workers, and resume activities once the circuit breaker is lifted. Together, we can pull through this crisis.

I will announce the details in my ministerial statement in Parliament on Monday.

0,fozology,It pains us but we understand and support the precautionary measures. Let’s work together and overcome this. 💪🏼💕,2020-03-16T12:28:15.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9y1yUpHipW/,2020-03-16T12:23:18.000Z,"Last Friday, we announced the closure of all mosques in Singapore for five days, to facilitate cleaning and disinfection procedures so as to prevent the emergence of new clusters. This move came after two Singaporeans who attended a religious gathering in Malaysia had returned here with COVID-19. As of today, a total of five Singaporeans who attended the event have now tested positive for the virus. They had visited 10 mosques in Singapore during their infectious period. Today, @masagosz announced that the mosque closure will be extended till 26 March 2020 to further limit the spread of the virus.

I understand that the closure of mosques and suspension of Friday prayers will cause inconvenience to our friends from the Muslim community. But this is a necessary move in order to reduce the risk of secondary transmission and to protect all Singaporeans. In a mosque setting, it is challenging to conduct contact tracing due to the lack of registration for regular congregants. Upon the reopening of mosques, additional precautionary measures will be implemented to reduce the risk of spread of the virus.

Located in Tampines Central, @darulghufran is Singapore’s largest mosque and caters to around 5,500 congregants. I very much appreciate that our Muslim community understands the need to take these precautionary measures. I thank you all for your support. Let us continue to look out for one another during this critical period.
