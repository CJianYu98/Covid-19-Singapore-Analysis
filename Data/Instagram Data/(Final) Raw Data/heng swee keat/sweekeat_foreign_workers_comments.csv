We are currently going all out to contain the outbreak in our foreign worker dormitories. We are actively testing our workers, and this is one reason we are seeing a big wave of new cases.

Thankfully, most who tested positive are only showing mild symptoms. The measures taken in our dorms will require some time to work, and we are scaling up our community care facilities in anticipation of a higher load in the coming days and weeks.

In the wider community, there are some indications that the circuit breaker is starting to take effect. But these are still early days and we are concerned about the number of undetected cases in the community, as that will lead to further transmission.

This is why we must all stay at home, unless absolutely necessary.

Our healthcare and essential workers are at the centre of our COVID-19 fight. But what has made a big difference is that every part of society has chipped in. You have made sure that those on the frontline are appreciated, our frail and vulnerable are cared for, and our foreign workers are provided for. You have looked out for those around you, in ways big and small.

The spirit of #SingaporeTogether shines through during these challenging times. The coming weeks will be even more critical. We need all hands on deck. We need to act in unison. Together, we can overcome. We will have time later for reflection ‚Äî to learn the lessons, and to collectively shape our shared future.

In this most difficult chapter of our generation, we must persevere, stay united and emerge from this stronger. (MOM Photos)"

Our healthcare and essential workers are at the centre of our COVID-19 fight. But what has made a big difference is that every part of society has chipped in.

You have looked out for those around you, in ways big and small.

The spirit of #SingaporeTogether shines through during these challenging times. The coming weeks will be even more critical. We need all hands on deck. We need to act in unison.
