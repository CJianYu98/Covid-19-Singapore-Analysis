This new mask can be used for up to 7 months. It also has two layers of protection — with an antimicrobial layer on the outside, and an anti-bacterial layer on the inside. Even after 30 washes, it is able to inactivate over 97% of viruses that land on the surface of the mask.
 
By now, residents were familiar with the collection process at the vending machines. The collection will last for two weeks until 14 March. You can find out more here: https://stayprepared.sg/staymasked/reusable/maskplus/
 
I thank the volunteers, @pafrenz and Temasek Foundation staff for coordinating and helping our residents in the mask distribution.

Her words continue to ring true decades after her lifetime. Indeed, this is the spirit of Singapore Together, where we pull together our energy and resources, to help the vulnerable among us. The pandemic has disrupted lives, especially for those who are disadvantaged. But I’m heartened that many have stepped up.
 
Together with @edwintong and @tinpeiling I met staff and volunteers of the Care Community Services Society (CCSS) this morning, and several of their corporate partners. CCSS provides support for families, seniors and children who need extra help. Some of their corporate partners have been supporting CCSS for many years.  Although the volunteers have found it more difficult to run their operations, they have also been pleasantly surprised that many more people are coming forward to help.

Edwin, Pei Ling and I witnessed the launch of the SG Cares Volunteer Centres @ Geylang, which will be operated by CCSS. This new centre  seeks to grow volunteerism, build capabilities, and connect partners in the Geylang area to meet the needs of the local community.

To emerge stronger as a society, we must rally more Singaporeans to play a more active part in building our shared future. As we overcome the crisis and progress as a society, we must not leave anyone behind.
 
This latest SG Cares Volunteer Centre will add to our efforts to galvanise communities to action. I hope that the measures that I announced at #SGBudget2021, to encourage giving and support for our social sector agencies, will bring even more people to donate and volunteer.

Her words continue to ring true decades after her lifetime. Indeed, this is the spirit of Singapore Together, where we pull together our energy and resources, to help the vulnerable among us. The pandemic has disrupted lives, especially for those who are disadvantaged. But I’m heartened that many have stepped up.
 
Together with @edwintong and @tinpeiling I met staff and volunteers of the Care Community Services Society (CCSS) this morning, and several of their corporate partners. CCSS provides support for families, seniors and children who need extra help. Some of their corporate partners have been supporting CCSS for many years.  Although the volunteers have found it more difficult to run their operations, they have also been pleasantly surprised that many more people are coming forward to help.

Edwin, Pei Ling and I witnessed the launch of the SG Cares Volunteer Centres @ Geylang, which will be operated by CCSS. This new centre  seeks to grow volunteerism, build capabilities, and connect partners in the Geylang area to meet the needs of the local community.

To emerge stronger as a society, we must rally more Singaporeans to play a more active part in building our shared future. As we overcome the crisis and progress as a society, we must not leave anyone behind.
 
This latest SG Cares Volunteer Centre will add to our efforts to galvanise communities to action. I hope that the measures that I announced at #SGBudget2021, to encourage giving and support for our social sector agencies, will bring even more people to donate and volunteer.

This is the commitment of @ntucsingapore, and is also a commitment that my Cabinet colleagues and I share.⁣
⁣
Our unionists played a key role in helping our workers and businesses during this crisis of a generation — maintaining a good pulse of the ground situation, helping affected workers transit into new job opportunities, and strengthening support for vulnerable worker segments.&nbsp;⁣
⁣
The crisis is far from over, but our collective tripartite effort to preserve livelihoods and protect our workers has borne fruit. Yesterday, the Ministry of Manpower reported that unemployment rates fell for the second consecutive month in December 2020, with resident employment rebounding to pre-COVID levels.⁣
⁣
For #SGBudget2021, I had a dialogue with more than 200 union leaders on Wednesday evening to hear their perspectives and gather feedback on where we can do better. As usual, they were candid, constructive and collaborative — a hallmark of our brand of tripartism.⁣
⁣
Growing our economy and rebuilding from a crisis will always be a tripartite effort. Just as we had recovered from and thrived after previous crises, I am confident that we can overcome COVID-19 and emerge stronger."

As much as COVID-19 has stressed healthcare systems around the world, the virus has also given new impetus for healthcare innovation. Human health and potential are key pillars of our R&D plans for the next five years, which I announced last month. I am also glad that the drive for innovation is pervasive across all our public healthcare institutions.⁣
⁣
@cghsg, which is situated in East Coast, is one such example. CGH has continued to push the bounds of innovation, working in collaboration with external partners. I witnessed the signing of the collaboration between CGH and Shimadzu Asia Pacific today – the Shimadzu-CGH Clinomics Centre (SC3). This partnership brings together CGH’s clinical and research expertise and Shimadzu’s diagnostic and analytical capabilities.&nbsp;⁣
⁣
Congratulations to Prof Ng Wai Hoe and the CGH team, and to Shimadzu! I look forward to more of such public-private partnerships, as we explore new ways of collaboration to build a more vibrant and resilient future.⁣

1,dianapuichun,Very Good! Press On!,2021-01-27T15:10:21.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CKjSEOCBxY6/,2021-01-27T14:10:42.000Z,"Innovation never stops, even in the midst of a global pandemic. As much as COVID-19 has stressed healthcare systems around the world, the virus has also given new impetus for healthcare innovation. Human health and potential are key pillars of our R&D plans for the next five years, which I announced last month. I am also glad that the drive for innovation is pervasive across all our public healthcare institutions.⁣
⁣
@cghsg, which is situated in East Coast, is one such example. CGH has continued to push the bounds of innovation, working in collaboration with external partners. I witnessed the signing of the collaboration between CGH and Shimadzu Asia Pacific today – the Shimadzu-CGH Clinomics Centre (SC3). This partnership brings together CGH’s clinical and research expertise and Shimadzu’s diagnostic and analytical capabilities.&nbsp;⁣
⁣
Congratulations to Prof Ng Wai Hoe and the CGH team, and to Shimadzu! I look forward to more of such public-private partnerships, as we explore new ways of collaboration to build a more vibrant and resilient future.⁣

In the midst of this pandemic,  our kind Government needs to be more prudent on purchasing the vaccines for everyone as not 100% are opting for it due to medical reasons or have anti-jab mindsets. Can save cost for other needy emergency use.

I was invited to speak at the inaugural @temasekshophouse Conversation yesterday on “Do Good, Together"" on COVID-19 lessons for Disease X. 

The lessons from SARS in 2003 put us in a better position for COVID-19. But COVID-19 also taught us that the nature of each virus, and indeed, each crisis, is different. There will be more lessons to be learnt, and some to be unlearnt, before this crisis is over. The key is to stay nimble and learn as we go. But I shared the fundamentals that will strengthen our overall resilience in preparation for the next global pandemic — continued investment in science and tech, enhancing global cooperation, and strengthening our sense of solidarity and unity in good times.

I thank @temasekfoundation for organising this series of conversations. I hope that the event has galvanized more stakeholders — including companies and philanthropies — to further step forward to overcome COVID-19 and build a more resilient future, for Singapore and the world.

We must also set our sights beyond COVID-19, to emerge stronger. We will work with the sector to refresh the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), finding new ways to collaborate to innovate better.

Last year was a challenging year for the built environment sector. COVID-19 hit the sector hard. With the Government rolling out significant support, the situation has stabilised. But the road to recovery is long and we must all remain vigilant. 
 
We must also set our sights beyond COVID-19, to emerge stronger. We will work with the sector to refresh the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), finding new ways to collaborate to innovate better. For example, we now have Alliances for Action — these are industry-led partnerships, with a focus on rapidly prototyping new ideas and scaling those that are viable. I am glad that REDAS is actively contributing to the Alliance for Action on Digitalising the Built Environment.

As with many other meetings and engagements these days, we did so virtually.
 
It has almost been a year since COVID-19 started. By now most of us have adapted to online meetings and discussions. Yesterday, we organised the session differently. We first held the discussion in small virtual breakout rooms, before having plenary discussions.
 
Managed to drop by a number of the small group discussions — still getting used to “virtual room hopping”. Some technical details to be ironed out, but I found this format more interactive and useful. Hope the participants felt the same way.
 
Change is a constant. We will need to continue to adapt to the changing pandemic situation and prepare ourselves for a post-COVID future. In some ways, how we conduct our discussions showed how we have adapted. From face-to-face meetings to video calls. From holding a simple virtual conference, to experimenting with more interactive formats.
 
How we build capacity for change will chart the course of our economy. The more we build an innovative culture, invest in transformation and skills, and remain agile in our business operations, the more we can emerge stronger from this crisis.
 
I thank our workers and businesses for their resilience and unity through a very difficult year. And I look forward to working with them to chart a better future for everyone."

But competition and cooperation can co-exist, and there are early signs that both could be willing to seek common ground. I also highlighted concrete areas of cooperation that the world can undertake as we seek to exit the pandemic and rebuild — in public health cooperation, climate change and digital governance.
 
As for Singapore, we must remain open to stay relevant and thrive. We must resist any tendencies to turn inwards.

Took the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) today at Parliament House.⁣
⁣
Have been tested on a number of occasions. The swabs are not as uncomfortable as they look, and I’m always impressed by how quick and fuss-free the process is. Got my results in under 15 minutes. More frequent and widespread testing will become a regular feature of our living with COVID-19. Together with safe management measures and contact tracing, testing is a key tool in our fight against the pandemic.⁣
⁣
We may be in Phase 3, but we must not forget the collective effort and sacrifices that got us here. Even with vaccines authorised for use, the virus will be with us for some time and much uncertainty remains ahead. I urge everyone to remain vigilant, continue to practice good personal hygiene, and adhere to safe management measures. This will enable us to resume more activities and further open our economy.⁣

Took the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) today at Parliament House.⁣
⁣
Have been tested on a number of occasions. The swabs are not as uncomfortable as they look, and I’m always impressed by how quick and fuss-free the process is. Got my results in under 15 minutes. More frequent and widespread testing will become a regular feature of our living with COVID-19. Together with safe management measures and contact tracing, testing is a key tool in our fight against the pandemic.⁣
⁣
We may be in Phase 3, but we must not forget the collective effort and sacrifices that got us here. Even with vaccines authorised for use, the virus will be with us for some time and much uncertainty remains ahead. I urge everyone to remain vigilant, continue to practice good personal hygiene, and adhere to safe management measures. This will enable us to resume more activities and further open our economy.⁣

I plan to send off 2020 with gratitude, and enter 2021 with determination.
 
My gratitude is for everyone who made it possible to bring us safely through the year — our courageous healthcare workers who kept us safe, our essential workers who kept us going, and volunteers in every field who continued to look out for those in need. I am also thankful to my colleagues in the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19, the Emerging Stronger Taskforce and my team at @mof_sg.
 
Most of all, I am grateful for Singaporeans’ unity, resilience, solidarity and fortitude this year — for having so much heart and spirit, and for adapting to the crisis and adhering to safe management measures, and for inspiring, encouraging and supporting one another through this period. You have kept me going, and you have been my reason to keep working hard.
 
My determination for 2021 is to ensure that we emerge from the year stronger as we gradually resume a greater degree of normalcy and rebuild our economy. There are many unknowns and uncertainties ahead, but as long as we stay united and grow our adaptive capacities for change, we are in a good position to deal with the challenges ahead.
 
As we approach the last few days of 2020, do join me to thank the people who have made a difference to us and our loved ones this year. Do remember to stay vigilant even as we embark on Phase 3.
 
So how do you plan to face the new year?

I am also thankful to my colleagues in the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19, the Emerging Stronger Taskforce and my team at @mof_sg.
 
Most of all, I am grateful for Singaporeans’ unity, resilience, solidarity and fortitude this year — for having so much heart and spirit, and for adapting to the crisis and adhering to safe management measures, and for inspiring, encouraging and supporting one another through this period. You have kept me going, and you have been my reason to keep working hard.
 
My determination for 2021 is to ensure that we emerge from the year stronger as we gradually resume a greater degree of normalcy and rebuild our economy. There are many unknowns and uncertainties ahead, but as long as we stay united and grow our adaptive capacities for change, we are in a good position to deal with the challenges ahead.
 
As we approach the last few days of 2020, do join me to thank the people who have made a difference to us and our loved ones this year. Do remember to stay vigilant even as we embark on Phase 3.
 
So how do you plan to face the new year?

There are many unknowns and uncertainties ahead, but as long as we stay united and grow our adaptive capacities for change, we are in a good position to deal with the challenges ahead.
 
As we approach the last few days of 2020, do join me to thank the people who have made a difference to us and our loved ones this year. Do remember to stay vigilant even as we embark on Phase 3.
 
So how do you plan to face the new year?

I plan to send off 2020 with gratitude, and enter 2021 with determination.
 
My gratitude is for everyone who made it possible to bring us safely through the year — our courageous healthcare workers who kept us safe, our essential workers who kept us going, and volunteers in every field who continued to look out for those in need. I am also thankful to my colleagues in the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19, the Emerging Stronger Taskforce and my team at @mof_sg.
 
Most of all, I am grateful for Singaporeans’ unity, resilience, solidarity and fortitude this year — for having so much heart and spirit, and for adapting to the crisis and adhering to safe management measures, and for inspiring, encouraging and supporting one another through this period.

He is in Singapore for a working visit.

I first met Minister Kono when I visited Tokyo last May to speak at the Nikkei Conference. Since then, COVID-19 has taken the world by storm, and disrupted our lives and livelihoods. Thankfully, digital technology has given us some degree of normalcy during the crisis — enabling us to stay in touch with our loved ones, purchase food and essentials online, continue with work and business meetings virtually, and adapt our business operations.

During lunch, we discussed the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation in our countries and globally. We also had a good exchange on how we can accelerate the digitalisation efforts in our governments.

Minister Kono spent some time in Singapore early in his career, when he worked for Fuji Xerox. He fondly remembered our local delights. Glad to have the opportunity to reacquaint him with chilli crab and with his favourite local fruit — durian!

I look forward to deepening the partnership between Singapore and Japan in the years to come.

Let me check Oxford dictionary if local fruit means the fruit popular to the local.,2020-12-28T13:22:19.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CJVepXQhDIP/,2020-12-28T08:59:52.000Z,"Hosted Japanese Minister of Administrative Reform Kono Taro for lunch this afternoon, together with @maliki_osman. He is in Singapore for a working visit.

I first met Minister Kono when I visited Tokyo last May to speak at the Nikkei Conference. Since then, COVID-19 has taken the world by storm, and disrupted our lives and livelihoods. Thankfully, digital technology has given us some degree of normalcy during the crisis — enabling us to stay in touch with our loved ones, purchase food and essentials online, continue with work and business meetings virtually, and adapt our business operations.

During lunch, we discussed the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation in our countries and globally. We also had a good exchange on how we can accelerate the digitalisation efforts in our governments.

Minister Kono spent some time in Singapore early in his career, when he worked for Fuji Xerox. He fondly remembered our local delights. Glad to have the opportunity to reacquaint him with chilli crab and with his favourite local fruit — durian!

I look forward to deepening the partnership between Singapore and Japan in the years to come.

Many of us look forward to this day, where we can gather in larger groups and resume more activities. But we must not let our guard down. Many countries have opened up only to experience new waves of infections that are bigger than the initial waves.

As we look forward to enjoying the final stretch of the festive season, I also hope that everyone will do so responsibly and abide by safe distancing measures. Our ability to remain in Phase 3 and eventually exit this pandemic will depend on each of your continued effort and vigilance.

12,kat_tan26,Thank you DPM & your team for all the work done this year. Stay safe & healthy!,2020-12-27T05:49:23.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CJSJ0qOhhN0/,2020-12-27T02:00:11.000Z,"We are entering Phase 3 tomorrow. Many of us look forward to this day, where we can gather in larger groups and resume more activities. But we must not let our guard down. Many countries have opened up only to experience new waves of infections that are bigger than the initial waves.

As we look forward to enjoying the final stretch of the festive season, I also hope that everyone will do so responsibly and abide by safe distancing measures. Our ability to remain in Phase 3 and eventually exit this pandemic will depend on each of your continued effort and vigilance.

It’s been a very difficult year. I hope you can spend some time in the final week of the year with your family and loved ones. And let’s all do so safely!

0,darrellttk,Thanks for the update and it’s nice to hear that ❤️👍💪🏻,2020-12-14T11:16:11.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIxrAw-hv6L/,2020-12-14T11:15:15.000Z,"This afternoon, PM @leehsienloong gave an update on our COVID-19 situation.⁣
⁣
We are ready to progress to Phase 3 in two weeks’ time, on 28 December. Looking back, we have come a long way since the Circuit Breaker. We brought the situation under control thanks to everyone playing their part and adhering to safe management measures. We have also boosted our pandemic defence by building up testing capacity and strengthening contact tracing.⁣
⁣
With Phase 3, one significant change is that groups of up to eight will be allowed, up from the maximum of five today. We will also allow more people at religious services and live events. Phase 3 will likely be with us for some time and we must continue to remain vigilant, as COVID-19 is still raging in many parts of the world.⁣
⁣
PM also announced that the first shipment of vaccines will arrive by the end of this month. If all goes to plan, we will have enough vaccines for everyone by Q3 2021. We also supported local efforts to develop a vaccine. Our researchers also developed test kits, including a neutralising antibody test kit that can check whether a vaccine is effective. Biomedical sciences is a deep capability that we will continue to grow as part of our Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan.⁣
⁣
As a key aviation node, Singapore can play a crucial role in the transportation of vaccines. In particular, vaccines require good cold chain management as they have to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius. The global distribution of vaccines will aid in our recovery as a logistics node. To strengthen our position as a logistics node, our Emerging Stronger Taskforce has also convened an industry-led Alliance for Action to enable the end-to-end digitalisation of supply chains.⁣
⁣
Now that vaccines are available, we can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. As we enter Phase 3, we can hopefully look forward to a better and brighter 2021. But we must continue to remain vigilant and not let our guard down.⁣

⁣
With Phase 3, one significant change is that groups of up to eight will be allowed, up from the maximum of five today. We will also allow more people at religious services and live events. Phase 3 will likely be with us for some time and we must continue to remain vigilant, as COVID-19 is still raging in many parts of the world.⁣
⁣
PM also announced that the first shipment of vaccines will arrive by the end of this month. If all goes to plan, we will have enough vaccines for everyone by Q3 2021. We also supported local efforts to develop a vaccine. Our researchers also developed test kits, including a neutralising antibody test kit that can check whether a vaccine is effective. Biomedical sciences is a deep capability that we will continue to grow as part of our Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan.⁣
⁣
As a key aviation node, Singapore can play a crucial role in the transportation of vaccines. In particular, vaccines require good cold chain management as they have to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius. The global distribution of vaccines will aid in our recovery as a logistics node. To strengthen our position as a logistics node, our Emerging Stronger Taskforce has also convened an industry-led Alliance for Action to enable the end-to-end digitalisation of supply chains.⁣
⁣
Now that vaccines are available, we can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. As we enter Phase 3, we can hopefully look forward to a better and brighter 2021. But we must continue to remain vigilant and not let our guard down.⁣

Some of you may know — my first job was as a policeman. As a policeman, I learnt that the job of a policeman is not just to catch criminals and keep residents safe, but also to make friends with our community and support our community to be the best that it can be.&nbsp;⁣

So when you see our men and women in blue patrolling the neighbourhood, do say hello. They are here to keep you safe and well, and keep this a great home for all of us.⁣

Delighted to launch the annual Christmas Wonderland event last night. Had the chance to explore the dazzling Luminarie installations and this year’s highlights — the Path of Tranquility, and the Spalliera light installation that was handmade by Italian craftsmen. Inside the Flower Dome, the Poinsettia Wishes display is set amidst red, green and white floral arrangements. 
 
Poinsettia Wishes was lovingly put together and designed by the Ambassador of Netherlands to Singapore and Brunei, Margriet Vonno. I was moved by her story on how she picked red and white flowers — to reflect her milestone in life after she was declared cancer-free this year, and also as a tribute to Singapore. 
 
COVID-19 will be with us for some time. This event brings some festive joy and cheer as we end the year, despite the challenging times.

11,sarmistamondol,Beautiful ❤️,2020-12-06T05:10:15.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIai3cWhKc1/,2020-12-05T11:41:33.000Z,"Festive lights, nutcracker dolls, real Christmas trees and poinsettias — the Christmas spirit is back at @gardensbythebay, with safe management measures in place! 🎄
 
Delighted to launch the annual Christmas Wonderland event last night. Had the chance to explore the dazzling Luminarie installations and this year’s highlights — the Path of Tranquility, and the Spalliera light installation that was handmade by Italian craftsmen. Inside the Flower Dome, the Poinsettia Wishes display is set amidst red, green and white floral arrangements. 
 
Poinsettia Wishes was lovingly put together and designed by the Ambassador of Netherlands to Singapore and Brunei, Margriet Vonno. I was moved by her story on how she picked red and white flowers — to reflect her milestone in life after she was declared cancer-free this year, and also as a tribute to Singapore. 
 
COVID-19 will be with us for some time. This event brings some festive joy and cheer as we end the year, despite the challenging times.

⁣
This is an extraordinary year for all Singaporeans. We are in a good position today in the fight against COVID-19, thanks to the dedication and hard work of our Public Service. I thanked our public service leaders for steering their agencies through this very difficult year. I am proud of the grit, innovation and dedication that our public officers have shown, and for the sacrifices that they have made.⁣
⁣
The ability of our public service to work together as one to overcome COVID-19 has been a tremendous source of strength. We must sustain this momentum beyond the crisis, and expand our efforts to work with our businesses and communities. This way, we can tap on the strength of our diversity to forge a new social compact post-COVID.⁣
⁣
As we fight the pandemic, I am glad that our public service leadership continues to plan for the longer-term. COVID-19 has changed our operating context very significantly. And we will need to re-examine our strategies and policies in virtually every domain to emerge stronger from this crisis."

They, together with my Permanent Secretary, Directors and members in various divisions have supported me, @lawrencewongst and @indraneerajah on our four Budgets and two Ministerial Statements. They worked on the details of economic and social programmes to support our workers, families and businesses in Singapore in a most challenging year.
 
They have all been working non-stop since the beginning of this year, with the work becoming even heavier and more intense as the global COVID pandemic situation worsened and disrupted life and businesses. My special thanks to my MOF team, and to all staff in our public agencies and partners who have been working so closely with us!
 
We have started work on #Budget2021. I met some business leaders this afternoon to get their assessment of the current economic outlook, and discussed with them how the Government can partner businesses to emerge stronger. Lawrence listened to grassroots leaders’ Budget-related feedback over the weekend, and Indranee is kickstarting a series of Pre-Budget Conversations tonight. And we will have more sessions in the coming weeks.
 
Everyone can play a role — please join us in the Budget 2021 journey by sharing your ideas. The Budget reflects our collective needs and aspirations as a society, and charts our direction as a nation.
 
My team and I value your views and suggestions, so that we can shape Budget 2021 to support our people and businesses, and your hopes and wishes for Singapore. I look forward to everyone’s active participation, as part of our #SingaporeTogether movement. You can contribute your ideas here: go.gov.sg/budget2021feedback.

During my dialogue with DHL’s Christopher Ong and BT’s Wong Wei Kong, I shared that the pandemic has been a time of stress for workers and businesses. We see that some businesses have stayed resilient, as they committed to innovation and adapted to change early. Business leaders must also take care of their workers during these challenging times, helping to redesign jobs and reskill workers.⁣
⁣
I was also happy to catch up with the four award winners including Forrest Li, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Sea Limited, who won the 2020 Businessman of the Year Award. Together with his co-founders, Forrest grew Sea from strength to strength. Sea just announced they will be creating 500 new tech jobs for both entry-level and mid-career candidates. The company’s success shows that our companies are not constrained by our limited geography, especially in the digital world.⁣
⁣
NTUC @fairpricesg’s @seahkianpeng received the Outstanding CEO of the Year. He led NTUC FairPrice staff during the circuit breaker to ensure accessibility of essentials. Singaporean Jessica Tan, also the Co-CEO of Ping An Group, was awarded Outstanding Overseas Executive of the Year. While AEM Holdings Ltd took the Enterprise Award of the Year — a recognition of how it is advancing with advanced manufacturing solutions and intelligent automation.⁣
⁣
Congratulations to all our 2020 award winners! In these difficult times, you are beacons of inspiration for our businesses in their journey towards recovery, transformation and growth.⁣

To emerge stronger from this crisis, Asia can benefit from stronger partnerships to develop better risk management and spur new insurance innovations and solutions.⁣

I launched the the Global-Asia Insurance Partnership (GAIP) at the virtual Singapore⁣ International Reinsurance Conference 2020 on Monday. GAIP is tripartite partnership between the global insurance industry, regulators and academia. There are many structural protection gaps facing Asia, but pandemic risk and climate risk are two critical areas that demand our immediate and collective attention. The initial focus of GIAP will therefore include these two strategic risks.⁣

With the pandemic, I am glad the organisers still managed to put together a special online edition this year.

COVID-19 has made it more challenging for friends with disabilities, and the Parade is an opportunity for us to stand in solidarity with those among us who are differently abled. One way you can show your support is to recite the Purple Pledge. I recorded mine, and so did more than 2,600 others. I encourage you to join us by doing your part. 

You can also light up the first-ever Purple Map (https://purpleparade.sg/map) — do check

Singapore and Australia have enjoyed strong bilateral multifaceted cooperation, especially in defence, economy and people-to-people ties.&nbsp;⁣

Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, I am glad that the joint development of military training areas and advanced training facilities in Queensland, Australia, continues to make steady progress under our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. We are also marking our 30th anniversary of the Singapore Armed Forces’ training in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area later this year.⁣

Both Minister Reynolds and I agreed on the need to maintain an open, rules-based global order and an inclusive regional security architecture. We look forward to growing Singapore-Australia cooperation from strength to strength.⁣

There will be more of such hybrid events in the future, as we resume more economic and social activities.⁣

This is one manifestation of how digital technology is transforming how we work and live. COVID-19 has brought out the value of digital technology more clearly and accelerated the pace of change. But as more people go online, crime and threats have also gone virtual. There are also other risks and downsides that we must address early.⁣
⁣
The best way to ensure that the digital arena improves our lives, accords with our values and improve the global commons is to work more closely together and strengthen international cooperation. This is especially important at a time when the rules-based multilateral order that has underpinned decades of growth and peace is under pressure.⁣

⁣
Our diplomatic relations with China may only be 30 years old, but our friendship has much deeper roots. Over the years, our exchanges, including at the political, economic and people-to-people levels, have expanded and deepened significantly. Bilateral cooperation has continually evolved to take into consideration the priorities and strengths of both countries. Our cooperation has also grown and expanded in depth and scope in a wide range of areas. Cooperation with all countries is also especially important amidst the uncertainty and changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Singapore will continue to deepen our collaboration and relations with ASEAN member states, and with the rest of the world.⁣
⁣
During the interview, I also shared my thoughts on how the relations between both countries have evolved, the challenges and opportunities we face, and how we can continue to scale new peaks through greater collaboration.⁣

新中两国虽然只有30年的外交关系，但是两国之间的友谊可以追溯到更久以前。长期以来，新加坡和中国在政治，经济和民间交流上有着紧密，多方面的联系。两国的合作兼顾彼此的需要，双边项目也横跨多个领域。接下来，新中关系要与时俱进，两国要探讨如何共同应对挑战，并且在新的领域合作，让双边关系更上一层楼。冠病疫情也带来许多不确定性和变化，这使我们与世界各国的合作变得更重要。新加坡也会继续加强与亚细安和世界各国的关系和友谊。⁣

⁣
Our diplomatic relations with China may only be 30 years old, but our friendship has much deeper roots. Over the years, our exchanges, including at the political, economic and people-to-people levels, have expanded and deepened significantly. Bilateral cooperation has continually evolved to take into consideration the priorities and strengths of both countries. Our cooperation has also grown and expanded in depth and scope in a wide range of areas. Cooperation with all countries is also especially important amidst the uncertainty and changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Singapore will continue to deepen our collaboration and relations with ASEAN member states, and with the rest of the world.⁣
⁣
During the interview, I also shared my thoughts on how the relations between both countries have evolved, the challenges and opportunities we face, and how we can continue to scale new peaks through greater collaboration.⁣

You can catch the first episode on @mewatch.mediacorp (www.go.gov.sg/focus-1). The second episode will be aired on Focus (焦点) programme on 1 Oct 2020.⁣

The gallery features highlights from the 60,000 artefacts recovered from a sunken Arabian dhow off the coast of Sumatra. The cargo comprised ceramics and valuable metal goods made in Tang Dynasty China that were bound for the Middle East. The Tang Shipwreck is proof of a vibrant maritime trading network that existed for centuries between China and Southeast Asia, and between our region and the world.
 
This year marks 30 years of diplomatic relations between China and Singapore. So it is most apt that some of these exhibits have journeyed across the ocean to Shanghai. Last week, the ACM and the Shanghai Museum jointly launched the Tang Shipwreck exhibition in Shanghai. The exhibition is a symbol of the strong bonds between our peoples, and the dedication of the teams from both countries in overcoming the challenges posed by COVID-19.
 
The Tang Shipwreck is also a reminder of how trade has enabled the region to flourish, and how an open and connected global economy enables all countries to develop and prosper. To ensure that the benefits of globalisation remain beneficial to all countries, we will all have to restructure our economies and upskill our workers.

The first was a fire that broke out at a HDB lift landing along Bedok South Road last night. Thankfully, the fire was put out within minutes and no one was hurt. The fire was caused by discarded items at the lift landing area. My thanks to the @myscdf for handling the situation swiftly. I discussed with the Town Council how we can avoid such incidents in the future.
 
Following that, I headed to Bedok CC to check on the mask collection. The second round of free masks distributed by @temasekfoundation started today. Bedok residents can collect your masks anytime from now till 4 October. You can also collect your masks from vending machines at Bedok Interchange, Bedok CC or our RCs. Do visit mask.stayprepared.sg to check the nearest location for mask collection.
 
To keep everyone safe, each of us must do our part, from disposing unwanted items properly to wearing a mask when you are out. Only then can we protect what we cherish and have worked hard to build.

The first was a fire that broke out at a HDB lift landing along Bedok South Road last night. Thankfully, the fire was put out within minutes and no one was hurt. The fire was caused by discarded items at the lift landing area. My thanks to the @myscdf for handling the situation swiftly. I discussed with the Town Council how we can avoid such incidents in the future.

Last week, I visited Changi General Hospital (@cghsg) with @maliki_osman and @cherylchan.fengshan to explore how we can work closely together to keep our people healthy.
 
We have a dedicated, caring and professional team at CGH. Glad to meet some of them and hear their frontline COVID-19 experiences. Some volunteered to be swabbers or contact tracers. Others related how they had to change their work routines in their wards and in ICU. One of them was Mdm Pamah, a healthcare attendant. She has been with the hospital for over 40 years, doing her part to keep the wards clean and safe.
 
Our heartfelt thanks to each and every one of you at CGH, for stepping up and going beyond your call of duty to keep us safe. Thank you also to A/P Ng Wai Hoe and A/P Siau Chuin for your leadership in bringing everyone together as One CGH. We deeply appreciate your courage and commitment!
 
We can each do our part to support our frontline staff, by continuing to observe safe management measures. By fighting as #SingaporeTogether, we can win this battle. 
 
In the coming years, we will strengthen our collaboration with CGH, to improve the health and well-being of our residents. We look forward to more volunteers joining us in this effort, as we realise our plans for a more caring, vibrant and greener East Coast.

We have a dedicated, caring and professional team at CGH. Glad to meet some of them and hear their frontline COVID-19 experiences. Some volunteered to be swabbers or contact tracers. Others related how they had to change their work routines in their wards and in ICU. One of them was Mdm Pamah, a healthcare attendant. She has been with the hospital for over 40 years, doing her part to keep the wards clean and safe.
 
Our heartfelt thanks to each and every one of you at CGH, for stepping up and going beyond your call of duty to keep us safe. Thank you also to A/P Ng Wai Hoe and A/P Siau Chuin for your leadership in bringing everyone together as One CGH. We deeply appreciate your courage and commitment!
 
We can each do our part to support our frontline staff, by continuing to observe safe management measures. By fighting as #SingaporeTogether, we can win this battle. 
 
In the coming years, we will strengthen our collaboration with CGH, to improve the health and well-being of our residents. We look forward to more volunteers joining us in this effort, as we realise our plans for a more caring, vibrant and greener East Coast.
 
#SGUnited"

This inspiring line captures the dedication and hard work of the team at @doverparkhospice, as they continue to innovate and provide the best care to their patients despite the circumstances. 

As an Asian society, dying and death remain difficult conversation topics for most. Palliative care has made great strides since the hospice movement in Singapore started in the 1980s. But more can still be done to raise awareness of palliative care, especially with our population ageing rapidly. 

Dover Park Hospice has also come a long way since their founding in 1992. It has expanded its services over the years to better cater to the growing healthcare needs of our population. 

The generous support of donors helps keep Dover Park Hospice going. I was happy to support their first virtual Sunflower Charity Dinner. With generous support from individuals and businesses, the dinner raised more than one million dollars. 

If there is a silver lining from this crisis, it is how this virus has strengthened our sense of common purpose as a nation and brought out the best from each of us. This is the spirit of #SingaporeTogether — where everyone steps forward to play a part, make a difference and overcome this crisis."

0,shalom_and_love,"Thanks for sharing. Yes. Jobs are being lost, and more will be lost. We need to reign back the excessively loose foreign worker policies. An example is the Finance industry - I know so many friends (PMETs) who are out of work. I hope the Govt comes up with a comprehensive and transparent plan.

COVID-19 is a clear and present danger, but it will fade at some point. On the other hand, the threat of climate change is existential, and will be with us for generations. So even as we fight the virus, we are also building for the future. MOT, MND and MSE released their Addenda with plans on how we can strengthen our connectivity to the world and rejuvenate our city, while placing sustainability at the heart of what we do. We must build a low-carbon and climate resilient future, that is greener and more livable, in partnership with our people.⁣
⁣
And we must also defend what we have built up and our way of life. These efforts are highlighted in MINDEF’s and MHA’s Addenda. When COVID emerged as the new invisible enemy, both agencies pivoted their operations to contribute to this fight. I am confident that our servicemen will continue to protect Singapore from existing and new threats.⁣
⁣
But even as we build for tomorrow, we must help our people get through today, especially in sectors which are hardest-hit such as aviation and construction. We had earlier announced additional targeted measures to help these sectors through these difficult times.⁣

Together, we can overcome this crisis and emerge to a brighter, greener and more resilient future.⁣

Yang Jiechi is an old friend of Singapore. We last met in China in May 2019, and I was happy to meet him again on his visit to Singapore. This is my first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since the COVID-19 situation escalated. As we gradually resume daily activities and re-open our borders, we can look forward to more high-level exchanges, with safe measures in place, as we strengthen our ties with countries around the world. 

Singapore and China commemorate 30 years of diplomatic relations this year. Our bilateral relationship is deep and multi-faceted. Both countries had worked closely to combat the public health and economic impact of COVID-19. Director Yang and I discussed how we can further strengthen cooperation between our countries. These ideas can be taken up at the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation, which I co-chair with PRC Vice Premier Han Zheng. We had a good exchange on regional and global developments. We also discussed how we can work with other countries in the region to build a better and more sustainable future for our peoples.

These ideas can be taken up at the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation, which I co-chair with PRC Vice Premier Han Zheng. We had a good exchange on regional and global developments. We also discussed how we can work with other countries in the region to build a better and more sustainable future for our peoples. 

COVID-19 has highlighted how interconnected we are as a world. And we must work in close cooperation with all countries to overcome this pandemic and emerge stronger.

Yang Jiechi is an old friend of Singapore. We last met in China in May 2019, and I was happy to meet him again on his visit to Singapore. This is my first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since the COVID-19 situation escalated. As we gradually resume daily activities and re-open our borders, we can look forward to more high-level exchanges, with safe measures in place, as we strengthen our ties with countries around the world.

The evening show was a loving tribute to our Singapore. It took us through the adjustments that Singaporeans have had to make, how our people have stepped up and supported one another, and how communities and individuals came together and paid tribute to frontline fighters.
 
It was a moving performance. Our deep appreciation to the performers and crew. They not only put in a huge amount of effort to practise and rehearse. But in order to keep everyone safe, they went through two swab tests and stayed at home, apart from rehearsals. I spoke to a few performers, who told me they were usually freelance dancers. Because of COVID-19, they were unable to perform and were glad to have this opportunity to do so. Let’s do our best in our fight against this virus, so that we can progressively resume our lives.
 
Special thanks to @filmr, the Creative Director for the show, to BG Frederick Choo and our NDP Exco, as well as to all performers, support staff and volunteers, for putting up a memorable parade and evening show despite the challenging environment.

Our Guard of Honour contingent, wearing masks, marched with determination, to the majestic tune of our Combined Band. Our state flags fluttered with dignity in the air, carried by our Chinook helicopters. The presidential gun salute, executed on the Padang field, brought the roar of the guns at close range. Then six F15SG fighters roared over the Padang in a salute to the nation.⁣
⁣
This year’s highlight was our tribute to our frontline heroes. Sixteen individuals staff, representing tens of thousands of frontline workers — including our nurses, doctors, ambulance crew, enforcement officers, safe distancing ambassadors, and volunteers — in this fight against COVID-19 received the nation’s salute!⁣
⁣
Another first was how the Parade was brought to different parts of Singapore. Our F15SG fighters flew across eight hospitals, to pay tribute to our healthcare teams. Our state flag flew across Singapore. Our Navy, Police Coast Guards and MPA vessels sailed in formation. Our Red Lions landed in the heartlands, to loud applause. Our ever popular mobile column went to different parts of Singapore, greeted by cheers.⁣
⁣
I was struck by how Singaporeans have responded — with appreciation and unity. Singaporeans have expressed their appreciation and gratitude to all our frontline officers who have been so dedicated in this COVID-19 battle. We have also responded with unity, with everyone doing our part in the fight against COVID-19.&nbsp;⁣
⁣
Seeing this, I am confident that Singaporeans have the strength and spirit to not only overcome COVID-19 but to emerge stronger.⁣
⁣
Later this evening, do catch the evening performance at the Star Performing Arts Centre on TV. There will also be fireworks around the island — do enjoy, but keep safe!&nbsp;⁣
⁣
Together, we can build a Stronger Singapore! Happy 55th Birthday, 🇸🇬Singapore!&nbsp;⁣

13,ariful.islum.39,Hi EVERYBODY GOOD MORNING CONGRATULATIONS SIR All THE BEST PAP HAPPY NATIONAL DAY SINGAPORE 🇸🇬 55  I LOVE YOU SINGAPORE 🇸🇬,2020-08-09T20:38:02.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CDqqiADhgSj/,2020-08-09T11:19:24.000Z,"This year’s National Day Parade is especially memorable, like our first National Day Parade in 1966 and our Golden Jubilee in 2015, when we paid tribute to our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew.⁣
⁣
This year’s Parade was held in the midst of COVID-19. So it has been scaled down. But it was no less meaningful. Our Guard of Honour contingent, wearing masks, marched with determination, to the majestic tune of our Combined Band. Our state flags fluttered with dignity in the air, carried by our Chinook helicopters. The presidential gun salute, executed on the Padang field, brought the roar of the guns at close range. Then six F15SG fighters roared over the Padang in a salute to the nation.⁣
⁣
This year’s highlight was our tribute to our frontline heroes. Sixteen individuals staff, representing tens of thousands of frontline workers — including our nurses, doctors, ambulance crew, enforcement officers, safe distancing ambassadors, and volunteers — in this fight against COVID-19 received the nation’s salute!⁣
⁣
Another first was how the Parade was brought to different parts of Singapore. Our F15SG fighters flew across eight hospitals, to pay tribute to our healthcare teams. Our state flag flew across Singapore. Our Navy, Police Coast Guards and MPA vessels sailed in formation. Our Red Lions landed in the heartlands, to loud applause. Our ever popular mobile column went to different parts of Singapore, greeted by cheers.⁣
⁣
I was struck by how Singaporeans have responded — with appreciation and unity. Singaporeans have expressed their appreciation and gratitude to all our frontline officers who have been so dedicated in this COVID-19 battle. We have also responded with unity, with everyone doing our part in the fight against COVID-19.&nbsp;⁣
⁣
Seeing this, I am confident that Singaporeans have the strength and spirit to not only overcome COVID-19 but to emerge stronger.⁣
⁣
Later this evening, do catch the evening performance at the Star Performing Arts Centre on TV. There will also be fireworks around the island — do enjoy, but keep safe!&nbsp;⁣
⁣
Together, we can build a Stronger Singapore! Happy 55th Birthday, 🇸🇬Singapore!&nbsp;⁣

I delivered this year’s National Day Message in Mandarin, on behalf of PM @leehsienloong.⁣
⁣
We are unable to celebrate National Day in the usual way this year because of COVID-19.⁣
⁣
But we are determined to still hold the Parade as a symbol of unity as a nation, like we have done every year since independence. This year, we are having a smaller parade at The Padang, and we are bringing the mobile columns and activities to the heartlands.⁣
⁣
The pandemic is far from over, and we will need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Business closures, retrenchments and unemployment are all likely to go up in the coming months. But we have come through previous crises, and I am confident we can emerge stronger from this crisis if we work together and each do our part.⁣
⁣
You can also preview what the future NS Square will look like. NS Square will replace the Float@Marina Bay — a community space for everyone, with a gallery to showcase our National Service story. I look forward to holding future Parades at NS Square when the venue is completed. By then, the pandemic would have passed and we will be celebrating National Day in a post-COVID world.⁣

今年，我代表李显龙总理，宣读华语的国庆献词。⁣
⁣
每年的8月9号，新加坡人都会一同观赏国庆庆典，欢庆我国独立建国。不过，今年因为冠病疫情的影响，国庆庆典别于往年, 以体现全民一心， 克服逆境。 今天，我们在政府大厦大草场举行规模较小的庆典，以及在全岛七个地点举行庆祝仪式。每一个地点都有它的象征意义，代表我国对抗病毒的工作。⁣
⁣
现在，我们比任何时候都更需要保持团结坚韧，以应对严重的经济衰退。接下来，更多公司可能会倒闭，更多员工会被裁退。不过，这不是我们第一次面临经济危机。也许这次危机会持续更久， 但我相信我们一定能够克服它。政府推出了多项援助计划。每个人也要贡献自己的一份力量，同舟共济。这样，我们才能走出危机，越战越勇。⁣
⁣
我也希望在不久的将来可以和国人，一起返回滨海湾浮动舞台庆祝国庆。政府已宣布把浮动舞台改建成永久建筑，称为“卫国广场”。它将肯定国民服役人员为新加坡所做出的贡献。这也会是一个老少咸宜，同欢共乐的场所。⁣
⁣
让我们一起心手相连，坚毅向前，克服挑战，让新加坡再创辉煌。"

Business closures, retrenchments and unemployment are all likely to go up in the coming months. But we have come through previous crises, and I am confident we can emerge stronger from this crisis if we work together and each do our part.⁣

You can also preview what the future NS Square will look like. NS Square will replace the Float@Marina Bay — a community space for everyone, with a gallery to showcase our National Service story. I look forward to holding future Parades at NS Square when the venue is completed. By then, the pandemic would have passed and we will be celebrating National Day in a post-COVID world.⁣

今年，我代表李显龙总理，宣读华语的国庆献词。⁣
⁣
每年的8月9号，新加坡人都会一同观赏国庆庆典，欢庆我国独立建国。不过，今年因为冠病疫情的影响，国庆庆典别于往年, 以体现全民一心， 克服逆境。 今天，我们在政府大厦大草场举行规模较小的庆典，以及在全岛七个地点举行庆祝仪式。每一个地点都有它的象征意义，代表我国对抗病毒的工作。⁣
⁣
现在，我们比任何时候都更需要保持团结坚韧，以应对严重的经济衰退。接下来，更多公司可能会倒闭，更多员工会被裁退。不过，这不是我们第一次面临经济危机。也许这次危机会持续更久， 但我相信我们一定能够克服它。政府推出了多项援助计划。每个人也要贡献自己的一份力量，同舟共济。这样，我们才能走出危机，越战越勇。⁣
⁣
我也希望在不久的将来可以和国人，一起返回滨海湾浮动舞台庆祝国庆。政府已宣布把浮动舞台改建成永久建筑，称为“卫国广场”。它将肯定国民服役人员为新加坡所做出的贡献。这也会是一个老少咸宜，同欢共乐的场所。⁣
⁣
让我们一起心手相连，坚毅向前，克服挑战，让新加坡再创辉煌。"
7,chopinandmysaucepan,"Happy birthday Singapore and congratulations to all Singaporeans today. Singapore is the only country in the world lead by a Chinese diaspora. A tiny island outpost devoid of natural resources, she was thrust into independence against her will. But she dug her toes into the muddy sand and became a first world nation. May you continue to flourish and prosper under the enduring leadership of your PM. Majulah Singapura! 🇸🇬 🇸🇬",2020-08-09T06:12:23.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CDpqi3ght8E/,2020-08-09T02:00:17.000Z,"Happy National Day!⁣

But we are determined to still hold the Parade as a symbol of unity as a nation, like we have done every year since independence. This year, we are having a smaller parade at The Padang, and we are bringing the mobile columns and activities to the heartlands.⁣

⁣
今年，我代表李显龙总理，宣读华语的国庆献词。⁣
⁣
每年的8月9号，新加坡人都会一同观赏国庆庆典，欢庆我国独立建国。不过，今年因为冠病疫情的影响，国庆庆典别于往年, 以体现全民一心， 克服逆境。 今天，我们在政府大厦大草场举行规模较小的庆典，以及在全岛七个地点举行庆祝仪式。每一个地点都有它的象征意义，代表我国对抗病毒的工作。⁣
⁣
现在，我们比任何时候都更需要保持团结坚韧，以应对严重的经济衰退。接下来，更多公司可能会倒闭，更多员工会被裁退。不过，这不是我们第一次面临经济危机。也许这次危机会持续更久， 但我相信我们一定能够克服它。政府推出了多项援助计划。每个人也要贡献自己的一份力量，同舟共济。这样，我们才能走出危机，越战越勇。⁣
⁣
我也希望在不久的将来可以和国人，一起返回滨海湾浮动舞台庆祝国庆。政府已宣布把浮动舞台改建成永久建筑，称为“卫国广场”。它将肯定国民服役人员为新加坡所做出的贡献。这也会是一个老少咸宜，同欢共乐的场所。⁣
⁣
让我们一起心手相连，坚毅向前，克服挑战，让新加坡再创辉煌。"
17,lynettehui,"Happy National Day, Mr Heng, and do take care of your health too 🇸🇬",2020-08-09T17:08:33.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CDpqi3ght8E/,2020-08-09T02:00:17.000Z,"Happy National Day!⁣
⁣
I delivered this year’s National Day Message in Mandarin, on behalf of PM @leehsienloong.⁣
⁣
We are unable to celebrate National Day in the usual way this year because of COVID-19.⁣
⁣
But we are determined to still hold the Parade as a symbol of unity as a nation, like we have done every year since independence. This year, we are having a smaller parade at The Padang, and we are bringing the mobile columns and activities to the heartlands.⁣
⁣
The pandemic is far from over, and we will need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Business closures, retrenchments and unemployment are all likely to go up in the coming months. But we have come through previous crises, and I am confident we can emerge stronger from this crisis if we work together and each do our part.⁣
⁣
You can also preview what the future NS Square will look like. NS Square will replace the Float@Marina Bay — a community space for everyone, with a gallery to showcase our National Service story. I look forward to holding future Parades at NS Square when the venue is completed. By then, the pandemic would have passed and we will be celebrating National Day in a post-COVID world.⁣

每年的8月9号，新加坡人都会一同观赏国庆庆典，欢庆我国独立建国。不过，今年因为冠病疫情的影响，国庆庆典别于往年, 以体现全民一心， 克服逆境。 今天，我们在政府大厦大草场举行规模较小的庆典，以及在全岛七个地点举行庆祝仪式。每一个地点都有它的象征意义，代表我国对抗病毒的工作。⁣
⁣
现在，我们比任何时候都更需要保持团结坚韧，以应对严重的经济衰退。接下来，更多公司可能会倒闭，更多员工会被裁退。不过，这不是我们第一次面临经济危机。也许这次危机会持续更久， 但我相信我们一定能够克服它。政府推出了多项援助计划。每个人也要贡献自己的一份力量，同舟共济。这样，我们才能走出危机，越战越勇。⁣
⁣
我也希望在不久的将来可以和国人，一起返回滨海湾浮动舞台庆祝国庆。政府已宣布把浮动舞台改建成永久建筑，称为“卫国广场”。它将肯定国民服役人员为新加坡所做出的贡献。这也会是一个老少咸宜，同欢共乐的场所。⁣
⁣
让我们一起心手相连，坚毅向前，克服挑战，让新加坡再创辉煌。"

⁣
I delivered this year’s National Day Message in Mandarin, on behalf of PM @leehsienloong.⁣
⁣
We are unable to celebrate National Day in the usual way this year because of COVID-19.⁣
⁣
But we are determined to still hold the Parade as a symbol of unity as a nation, like we have done every year since independence. This year, we are having a smaller parade at The Padang, and we are bringing the mobile columns and activities to the heartlands.⁣
⁣
The pandemic is far from over, and we will need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Business closures, retrenchments and unemployment are all likely to go up in the coming months. But we have come through previous crises, and I am confident we can emerge stronger from this crisis if we work together and each do our part.⁣
⁣
You can also preview what the future NS Square will look like. NS Square will replace the Float@Marina Bay — a community space for everyone, with a gallery to showcase our National Service story. I look forward to holding future Parades at NS Square when the venue is completed. By then, the pandemic would have passed and we will be celebrating National Day in a post-COVID world.⁣

I delivered this year’s National Day Message in Mandarin, on behalf of PM @leehsienloong.⁣
⁣
We are unable to celebrate National Day in the usual way this year because of COVID-19.⁣
⁣
But we are determined to still hold the Parade as a symbol of unity as a nation, like we have done every year since independence. This year, we are having a smaller parade at The Padang, and we are bringing the mobile columns and activities to the heartlands.⁣
⁣
The pandemic is far from over, and we will need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Business closures, retrenchments and unemployment are all likely to go up in the coming months. But we have come through previous crises, and I am confident we can emerge stronger from this crisis if we work together and each do our part.⁣
⁣
You can also preview what the future NS Square will look like. NS Square will replace the Float@Marina Bay — a community space for everyone, with a gallery to showcase our National Service story. I look forward to holding future Parades at NS Square when the venue is completed. By then, the pandemic would have passed and we will be celebrating National Day in a post-COVID world.⁣

每年的8月9号，新加坡人都会一同观赏国庆庆典，欢庆我国独立建国。不过，今年因为冠病疫情的影响，国庆庆典别于往年, 以体现全民一心， 克服逆境。 今天，我们在政府大厦大草场举行规模较小的庆典，以及在全岛七个地点举行庆祝仪式。每一个地点都有它的象征意义，代表我国对抗病毒的工作。⁣

I delivered this year’s National Day Message in Mandarin, on behalf of PM @leehsienloong.⁣
⁣
We are unable to celebrate National Day in the usual way this year because of COVID-19.⁣
⁣
But we are determined to still hold the Parade as a symbol of unity as a nation, like we have done every year since independence. This year, we are having a smaller parade at The Padang, and we are bringing the mobile columns and activities to the heartlands.⁣
⁣
The pandemic is far from over, and we will need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Business closures, retrenchments and unemployment are all likely to go up in the coming months. But we have come through previous crises, and I am confident we can emerge stronger from this crisis if we work together and each do our part.⁣
⁣
You can also preview what the future NS Square will look like. NS Square will replace the Float@Marina Bay — a community space for everyone, with a gallery to showcase our National Service story. I look forward to holding future Parades at NS Square when the venue is completed. By then, the pandemic would have passed and we will be celebrating National Day in a post-COVID world.⁣

今年，我代表李显龙总理，宣读华语的国庆献词。⁣
⁣
每年的8月9号，新加坡人都会一同观赏国庆庆典，欢庆我国独立建国。不过，今年因为冠病疫情的影响，国庆庆典别于往年, 以体现全民一心， 克服逆境。 今天，我们在政府大厦大草场举行规模较小的庆典，以及在全岛七个地点举行庆祝仪式。每一个地点都有它的象征意义，代表我国对抗病毒的工作。⁣
⁣
现在，我们比任何时候都更需要保持团结坚韧，以应对严重的经济衰退。接下来，更多公司可能会倒闭，更多员工会被裁退。不过，这不是我们第一次面临经济危机。也许这次危机会持续更久， 但我相信我们一定能够克服它。政府推出了多项援助计划。每个人也要贡献自己的一份力量，同舟共济。这样，我们才能走出危机，越战越勇。⁣

This year, there was no flag raising ceremony. The building was quiet as most of our officers continue to work from home. Instead, the action was online — with games, quizzes, as well as performances by the @nea_sg in-house Band and the Treasury Choir.⁣

This year’s celebrations may be scaled down, but it remains all the more meaningful as we recommit ourselves in service of the nation - where the entire Public Service has been mobilised in our fight against the pandemic.⁣

Sung by local artiste @benjaminkheng and conducted by Darrell Ang, this emotive yet charming number is a rallying call for all of us to “stand together, heart to heart” during this pandemic. It was nice to see and hear the musicians performing outside of their usual concert hall (but not at home 😉). 

Also, to mark our 55 years of our diplomatic relations with Australia, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra will be performing virtually alongside the @melbournesymphonyorchestra in a cross-border orchestra performance titled “Songs from Home” this Friday (7 Aug). This highlights the longstanding close bonds between Singapore and Australia, as we stand in solidarity with each other in this pandemic.

During the morning parade, @thersaf F15SG Roar of Unity will pay tribute to our frontline and essential workers who have been keeping Singapore safe and well. 16 frontline and essential workers from different vocations will be present to “receive” the salute. The F15SG will then make a series of tribute passes over eight hospitals. The state flag flypast will also make its way over the heartlands. You can catch the flypasts from your homes, at your windows or along your corridor. This is part of our efforts to bring NDP into the heartlands.
 
Let us come together this 9 August to celebrate Singapore’s birthday and stand in unity as one nation.

During the morning parade, @thersaf F15SG Roar of Unity will pay tribute to our frontline and essential workers who have been keeping Singapore safe and well. 16 frontline and essential workers from different vocations will be present to “receive” the salute. The F15SG will then make a series of tribute passes over eight hospitals. The state flag flypast will also make its way over the heartlands. You can catch the flypasts from your homes, at your windows or along your corridor. This is part of our efforts to bring NDP into the heartlands.
 
Let us come together this 9 August to celebrate Singapore’s birthday and stand in unity as one nation.
 
You can find out more about the parade happenings, state flag flypast and mobile column routes, and more at the NDP website (www.ndp.gov.sg).

Today is the last day for pack collection. I joined some of our volunteers and @PAFrenz staff this morning at Bedok Community Centre, one of the collection centres in East Coast.⁣

Each family can collect a #SingaporeTogether Pack, should they choose to. Designed by our Primary Five students and aspiring artists with special needs, the name of the pack serves as a timely reminder for Singaporeans to come together and build a stronger future as one united people.⁣
⁣
To date, more than a million packs have been distributed. Residents shared that the pack is practical and meaningful, as it contains masks, thermometers and hand sanitisers. For the little ones, (besides the snacks) the instant face tattoos and handheld flags are hot favourites!⁣

It is a reminder that the indomitable Singapore spirit will prevail through COVID-19, much as we did in previous crises. 
 
NDP2020 will be conducted in a very different way, compared to previous years and from what was originally planned. The NDP Exco shared with me their challenges on how they had to adapt to the circumstances and quickly reconceptualise NDP when COVID struck, similar to how our people and our businesses had to adapt to the circuit breaker and a new normal.
 
Sitting at the Padang and watching the parade rehearsal this morning, it reminded me of our inaugural National Day Parade back in 1966. Both were simple parades held at the Padang.
 
My thanks to Chief of Defence Force Melvyn Ong, BG Frederick Choo, Chairman of NDP Exco and the team this year for changing the NDP so swiftly to ensure that we can mark our National Day in a safe but meaningful way. 
 
And special kudos to all NDP participants for your passion and hard work. Your commitment makes a difference — Singaporeans can continue to enjoy a meaningful and special NDP. 🇸🇬 
 
Visit the NDP website (www.ndp.gov.sg) to learn more about how this year’s parade and show will be different!

Today, we mark Nurses’ Day. This special day has taken on added significance this year, as our nurses are playing a critical role in our battle against the virus.⁣
⁣
Since we had our first confirmed case six months ago, our nurses have been working tirelessly on the frontline in the fight against COVID-19. They have helped to make a seemingly impossible situation possible as we tackle the pandemic.⁣
⁣
2020 has been designated the “Year of the Nurse” by the @who. It has turned out to be a very challenging year, for the nursing profession, for the healthcare community, and for the world.⁣
⁣
Nursing is more than a job. It is a calling with a deep purpose.Our nurses have answered the call of duty, risen to the challenge, and made a big difference!⁣
⁣
Thank you once again for your sacrifices, dedication and compassion.⁣
⁣
Happy Nurses’ Day!⁣

⁣
@discoverdso and @astarsg have jointly developed the RESOLUTE 2.0 direct RT-PCR test kit that can cut down the lab time to half, compared to the standard PCR test.⁣
⁣
To speed up the testing process even further, A*STAR also developed a robotics lab system — the Rapid Automated Volume Enhancer (RAVE). When used together with the RESOLUTE 2.0 kits, two sets of these made-in-Singapore systems can process close to 4,000 tests per day.⁣

I am very proud to see our R&D ecosystem working in close collaboration to give our fight against COVID-19 a boost. I thank the research teams involved for their hard work in reaching this milestone, within a short span of six months.⁣

An unshrinkable responsibility like you and your team.,2020-07-07T05:35:20.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CCVCmmlnVCh/,2020-07-07T05:15:03.000Z,"I’ve met some really sprightly, spirited seniors in East Coast GRC these last few days. They give me advice on life, health and elections — and I take it seriously! 

They have lived through hard struggles in our early days, and know how serious this COVID-19 challenge is. They do not take safety, stability or prosperity for granted.

Do you know what they care about most at this time? Not themselves. They care most about younger Singaporeans. They ask me to protect Singapore, to keep everyone safe, to make sure younger Singaporeans can continue to work and take care of their families. We are very fortunate that, in Singapore, our earlier generations, who have already built up so much of the country, continue to watch over younger ones.

My team and I are determined to give our pioneers and seniors the care they deserve, and to honour their spirit of providing for and protecting future generations.

⁣
Met families coming together across generations, across East Coast, indeed, across the island, to have a good breakfast in the heart of Bedok.⁣
⁣
Our team got to hear the whole range of feelings in a family — a father proud of his son’s achievements in school, a grandma cheering on the younger ones, an adult who is concerned that his elderly parents stay safe from COVID-19. I could really see and appreciate your love and your hopes for your families. I can also see that families love being in Bedok and East Coast.⁣
⁣
I am glad that we have new homes at Bedok Beacon, Bedok South Horizons and Bedok North Woods coming up that will offer more options for young families and allow them to stay close to their parents. And, in a few more years, the new Bayshore housing precinct. New stations on the Thomson-East Coast Line will also make getting anywhere faster and easier.⁣
⁣
Meeting all of you further strengthens my wish to make sure the young and old in every family can stay safe during this crisis, fulfil their potential in life, and lead happy, meaningful lives.⁣

I look forward to joining the East Coast family, to serve and protect all our residents as a family.⁣

I am glad that we have new homes at Bedok Beacon, Bedok South Horizons and Bedok North Woods coming up that will offer more options for young families and allow them to stay close to their parents. And, in a few more years, the new Bayshore housing precinct. New stations on the Thomson-East Coast Line will also make getting anywhere faster and easier.⁣
⁣
Meeting all of you further strengthens my wish to make sure the young and old in every family can stay safe during this crisis, fulfil their potential in life, and lead happy, meaningful lives.⁣
⁣
I look forward to joining the East Coast family, to serve and protect all our residents as a family.⁣

⁣
Met families coming together across generations, across East Coast, indeed, across the island, to have a good breakfast in the heart of Bedok.⁣
⁣
Our team got to hear the whole range of feelings in a family — a father proud of his son’s achievements in school, a grandma cheering on the younger ones, an adult who is concerned that his elderly parents stay safe from COVID-19. I could really see and appreciate your love and your hopes for your families. I can also see that families love being in Bedok and East Coast.⁣
⁣
I am glad that we have new homes at Bedok Beacon, Bedok South Horizons and Bedok North Woods coming up that will offer more options for young families and allow them to stay close to their parents. And, in a few more years, the new Bayshore housing precinct. New stations on the Thomson-East Coast Line will also make getting anywhere faster and easier.⁣

The COVID-19 threat is very real and serious. I am constantly reminding my team and everyone we meet to keep vigilant. Everyone, especially our seniors, please stay safe and healthy!

It is precisely because of COVID-19 that we are trying out interesting new ways to engage with all of you. Had a good e-rally session at lunchtime together with my East Coast team, talking with all of you about “Knowing Our People, Knowing East Coast”. We shared about our plans to build a caring, vibrant and green East Coast community. Thank you to those of you who shared your lunchtime with us. 

@maliki_osman, @cherylchan.fengshan and Jessica Tan have been serving here for many years, and been engaging with residents over the years — many of your suggestions to them have made their way into the manifesto. For @kiathowsg and me, in these last few days of walking around and listening to you, we are picking up some excellent ideas to follow up on. Indeed, to know the kind of East Coast home we wish to build, we must first know our people’s hopes and aspirations. 

We will continue to listen to you, and try out more and better ways to engage with you. And as we do this, we will continue to grow our plans dynamically to take in your ideas. We will turn your ideas into action, and find ways that each of us can play a meaningful role towards making East Coast a better home for all."

This election will be like no other. Our lives, our jobs and the future of Singapore are at stake. COVID-19 presents us with profound uncertainties ahead.

Our urgent priority is to protect lives and save jobs. Beyond the immediate future, we must continue to transform and grow our economy, build a more fair and just society, and rejuvenate our city into a better and more sustainable home. We will strengthen our partnership with you to achieve this, and bring every citizen on board.

This election will be tough. Singaporeans have been greatly affected by the pandemic, and are anxious about their future. The PAP is up to this task.

The decision to hold an election in the middle of a pandemic is not an easy one to make. But given the profound uncertainty ahead, and the challenges that we must tackle as a nation, it is important that we do so now, when the situation is relatively stable.

7,glotraveller,"Given that elections have to be held by April 2021 only, and that Singapore is just going into Phase 2, where the end is in sight, Is now really the right time to call for elections, when Singaporeans cannot travel back or travel to the nearest voting station to vote? Surely, the act of being able to vote is an Important one. If we are now at the start of a pandemic where things are worsening, one can understand but in this situation, it feels more opportunistic than necessary. The mandate was given to the government for a five year period and that’s to navigate Singapore through what these 5 years may bring, pandemic and all. The coming election is to choose a government that people have faith in and feel will bring them through the next 5 years. Perhaps some sensitivity in the choice of timing for elections will give faith that you are working in partnership with Singaporeans.",2020-06-23T11:44:41.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CBxdnfUHDQR/,2020-06-23T09:38:27.000Z,"PM @leehsienloong has just announced he will call for the General Election now.

8,francissweett,Yes #singaporetogether,2020-06-23T11:47:11.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CBxdnfUHDQR/,2020-06-23T09:38:27.000Z,"PM @leehsienloong has just announced he will call for the General Election now. He explained in his broadcast why he decided to do so.

Elections have to be held by April 2021, which is less than a year away. Our fight against COVID-19 will be long. The road ahead is full of uncertainty. The next few years will be critical, and the actions we take now will chart the course of our nation for decades to come.

The decision to hold an election in the middle of a pandemic is not an easy one to make. But given the profound uncertainty ahead, and the challenges that we must tackle as a nation, it is important that we do so now, when the situation is relatively stable. The election will give the new Government a fresh, five-year mandate to bring Singaporeans together to overcome this crisis.

We will fight COVID-19 as #SingaporeTogether. More than ever, we will need a government, with a strong mandate and a long runway, to lead us out of this crisis. We will face the challenges ahead together, working in partnership with you. We can and we will overcome this crisis of our generation, and emerge stronger as an economy, as a society and as one people.

There is a lot at stake. I trust that fellow Singaporeans will consider very carefully who you choose to form the next government and take Singapore forward. ⠀

But together, we can achieve so much more.

Working in partnership to create our shared future is what #SingaporeTogether is about. More than ever, in a crisis, joining our collective strength and effort will make the difference. Not only to cushion our people and workers, but to give them a springboard to emerge stronger.

On the economic front, the Emerging Stronger Taskforce (EST) of the Future Economy Council was set up in May. The Taskforce is consulting widely, and involving people from a wide spectrum of society. It is also forming the Singapore Together Alliances for Action, which are industry-led coalitions, to prototype and executive new ideas in seven areas.

On the societal front, COVID-19 has brought us closer together as a society. So we are starting the Emerging Stronger Conversations, to hear how we can work together on your ideas to take Singapore forward. True to the spirit of Singapore Together, these conversations will lead to action. We will set up Singapore Together Action Networks — to bring together partners across different sectors, and turn ideas into new solutions.

We will fight COVID-19 as Singapore Together. There are many opportunities to contribute, and many ways you can make a difference. Everyone counts, and can be counted on. Together, we will be a generation that emerges stronger. ⠀

The pandemic has reshaped the roles of many fathers. Some have taken on more responsibilities while working from home, or supporting spouses who are on the frontline. Fathers who are frontline workers themselves have had to sacrifice time with their loved ones or make adjustments to their routines. Others may have had to grapple with loss of income or even job losses.⁣
⁣
Whatever your situation, a father’s top priority in caring for their children and providing for the family remains unchanged. I thank all the fathers who are doing their best during this difficult time.⁣

Fathers who are frontline workers themselves have had to sacrifice time with their loved ones or make adjustments to their routines. Others may have had to grapple with loss of income or even job losses.⁣
⁣
Whatever your situation, a father’s top priority in caring for their children and providing for the family remains unchanged. I thank all the fathers who are doing their best during this difficult time.⁣
⁣
I know many families are happy that they can now have small gatherings to celebrate Father’s Day today, be it indoors or outdoors. But do keep safe and stay vigilant.⁣
⁣
My best wishes to all fathers and not forgetting, fathers-to-be!⁣

This was where I recorded my national broadcast on the last day of Phase 1 when the roads were still empty. The empty roads were a stark reminder of the crisis we are facing.

From this vantage, you can see the Singapore River, edged with rows of shophouses. This used to be our historical lifeblood. This area is rich with our heritage — the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall is nearby, and next to it, the National Gallery and Padang. In the distance, our economic growth is reflected in the ever-changing city line. In clear sight, Parliament House, with our national flag flying high, a symbol of our independence.

Across 200 years of sweeping change, we overcame the odds and grew from Singapore to Singaporeans.

Today, we are less than 200 days into what will be a long-drawn pandemic battle. We must draw on the wits and will of our people to fight COVID-19 as #SingaporeTogether.

This fight is as much about the present as it is about our future. How we respond to this crisis in the next five to ten years will chart the course of our nation for decades to come.

We shall not only overcome this crisis, we will emerge from it stronger — as an economy, as a society, and as a people.

This was where I recorded my national broadcast on the last day of Phase 1 when the roads were still empty. The empty roads were a stark reminder of the crisis we are facing.

From this vantage, you can see the Singapore River, edged with rows of shophouses. This used to be our historical lifeblood. This area is rich with our heritage — the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall is nearby, and next to it, the National Gallery and Padang. In the distance, our economic growth is reflected in the ever-changing city line. In clear sight, Parliament House, with our national flag flying high, a symbol of our independence.

Across 200 years of sweeping change, we overcame the odds and grew from Singapore to Singaporeans.

Today, we are less than 200 days into what will be a long-drawn pandemic battle. We must draw on the wits and will of our people to fight COVID-19 as #SingaporeTogether.

There will also be a gradual resumption of religious activities. Congregational and other worship services can resume, with safeguards in place and no more than fifty worshippers. @mccysg released the details yesterday.

The last few months have highlighted how religiously diverse we are as a society. Looking back, we had to observe Qing Ming, Good Friday, Vesak Day, and Hari Raya Puasa very differently this year. It is not uncommon to see different places of worship in the same locality. It is not out of the ordinary for our religious leaders to work together for the common good.

Earlier this week, I briefly joined the meeting of the National Steering Committee on Racial and Religious Harmony. I had the opportunity to speak to some of our religious and community leaders — to thank them for being resilient, for adapting to the crisis, and standing in solidarity with people of all faiths.

Religious harmony is not something that readily happens in other parts of the world. It is not something that we should take for granted. Diversity is our strength. Especially in a crisis, we must focus on what we have in common, and work together. Only then, can we emerge stronger as a society from this crisis.

I was also heartened to hear that we had residents stepping forward to volunteer and help with the distribution — this shows our gotong royong spirit is alive and well in Tampines.

I hope you will find this latest version of the mask more comfortable as new materials were used to optimise comfort and improve resistance to droplets. There is also a smaller size for kids below 12.  You can check out the care instructions for the masks here: vimeo.com/415442232.

You can collect your mask at all Community Centres islandwide till 14 June. Aside from the usual manual collection counters that open from 10am to 6pm daily, you can also use the mask vending machines that operate 24/7. Do bring along your IC and the ICs of your household members to collect on their behalf.

Our Tampines residents can collect their masks at the vending machines at Central Plaza and @tampinescentralcc in @ourtampineshub, or any RC as well as CC nearest to your home.

This islandwide exercise would not have been possible without the support of @pafrenz, @mindefsg, @temasekfoundation, @govtechsg, @astarsg, @ntu_sg and many other community partners and volunteers working behind the scenes — thank you everyone for the hard work.

I was also heartened to hear that we had residents stepping forward to volunteer and help with the distribution — this shows our gotong royong spirit is alive and well in Tampines.

I hope you will find this latest version of the mask more comfortable as new materials were used to optimise comfort and improve resistance to droplets. There is also a smaller size for kids below 12.  You can check out the care instructions for the masks here: vimeo.com/415442232.

You can collect your mask at all Community Centres islandwide till 14 June. Aside from the usual manual collection counters that open from 10am to 6pm daily, you can also use the mask vending machines that operate 24/7. Do bring along your IC and the ICs of your household members to collect on their behalf.

Our Tampines residents can collect their masks at the vending machines at Central Plaza and @tampinescentralcc in @ourtampineshub, or any RC as well as CC nearest to your home.

This islandwide exercise would not have been possible without the support of @pafrenz, @mindefsg, @temasekfoundation, @govtechsg, @astarsg, @ntu_sg and many other community partners and volunteers working behind the scenes — thank you everyone for the hard work.

3,mymoneywhat,"Knowing Singaporeans, I think if anyone has the fortitude to get through this, it's us. We are positioned perfectly. We have a workforce that is largely able to telecommute, a strong government with sufficient reserves, and an excellent healthcare system bar none.

Like Singapore, our closest neighbours will be celebrating Hari Raya Aidilfitri under exceptional circumstances this year. We discussed how COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our societies and economies, and the measures we have put in place to protect our people. In my conversations with leaders in the region, they shared with me that the Muslim community understands the need for these precautionary measures. They have also taken these changes in their stride. What is most important is to celebrate the spirit of caring for and supporting one another.⁣

Like Singapore, our closest neighbours will be celebrating Hari Raya Aidilfitri under exceptional circumstances this year. We discussed how COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our societies and economies, and the measures we have put in place to protect our people.

From 28 May, more than 140,000 employers will be receiving over $4 billion in wage payout. ⠀ ⠀

The upcoming payout is for the month of May, with the enhanced circuit breaker measures. Employers will receive 75% wage support for their local employees (capped at the first $4,600 of wages paid). Some shareholder-directors will also qualify, an enhancement announced earlier.⠀ ⠀

Our wage support for companies in Singapore is very significant — in total, we have committed more than $20 billion under the JSS over three Budgets — Unity, Resilience and Solidarity. I urge companies to use the JSS wage subsidies to retain their workers during this difficult period. ⠀ ⠀

Some companies are doing well, and have returned the funds — thank you! I hope the rest which are also doing well will do likewise. Many companies and individuals have also been donating to worthy causes that they support. You can find out more on these causes at @giving.sg (www.giving.sg).⠀ ⠀

The upcoming payout is for the month of May, with the enhanced circuit breaker measures. Employers will receive 75% wage support for their local employees (capped at the first $4,600 of wages paid). Some shareholder-directors will also qualify, an enhancement announced earlier.⠀ ⠀

Our wage support for companies in Singapore is very significant — in total, we have committed more than $20 billion under the JSS over three Budgets — Unity, Resilience and Solidarity. I urge companies to use the JSS wage subsidies to retain their workers during this difficult period. ⠀ ⠀

Some companies are doing well, and have returned the funds — thank you! I hope the rest which are also doing well will do likewise. Many companies and individuals have also been donating to worthy causes that they support. You can find out more on these causes at @giving.sg (www.giving.sg).⠀ ⠀

You can refer to the @mof_sg press release for more details at www.go.gov.sg/jss17may.⠀ ⠀

This year, the usual Vesak Day celebrations have been called off, like our other religious and cultural commemorations, due to COVID-19. Instead, some monasteries and temples, like the Singapore Buddhist Lodge, have gone digital by offering live streaming of rituals and prayers to commemorate this special day. I am glad that technology is being put to good use.

Vesak Day is also a time for reflection, showing appreciation and doing good deeds. There are many heartwarming stories of ground up initiatives by individuals and groups who have gone the extra mile to help those in need during these times — thank you!

Let us also remember all our healthcare personnel, public officers, those in essential services as well as our migrant workers — they are giving their all to protect and keep us safe.

This is a Ramadan like no other. Due to the pandemic, there are no congregational prayers, and no Buka Puasa get-togethers. But the spirit of Ramadan continues to shine in the shadow of COVID-19. We have not forgotten Muslim families in need and those on the frontline.

Through the #SGUnited Buka Puasa, 20,000 free meals are provided daily to our vulnerable families and frontline workers. The meals are also distributed at twenty Community Centres across the island, including at @tampinescentralcc (@ourtampineshub) and @tampeastcc.

For our non-Muslim friends, you can also make a difference by donating or volunteering your time.

Our daily lives have been disrupted because of the virus. This is especially hard during Ramadan. But I am glad this has not dampened our community spirit.

Wishing all our Muslim friends a blessed Ramadan.

These were the exact words from a nurse clinician at @nuhig featured in the third version of the @straits_times’ “Stay at Home, Singapore” initiative.⠀

In the previous two versions of the catchy remake of NDP classic “Count on me, Singapore”, local artists and young singers came together to rally everyone to keep safe and healthy. The videos have been so well-received that a third version, featuring our frontline doctors and nurses and recovered COVID-19 patients, has just been released. ⠀
⠀
They are also doing this for a good cause — to help The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF) and the @businesstimessg Budding Artists Fund (BTBAF), which will help the families of those affected by COVID-19.

On another note, our media organisations and celebrities are organising #singtogetherSG. This is a call for everyone to sing another one of our favourites, “Home”, from our windows at 7.55pm tonight, in appreciation of our frontline and migrant workers. ⠀

MUIS has released advisories and guidebooks for the month of Ramadan. It has also launched a digital channel, SalamSG TV, today via go.gov.sg/salamsgtv — with religious and lifestyle content for children and adults. It will also feature videos in Bengali and Tamil for our Muslim migrant workers.⠀

⠀
It will be an unprecedented Ramadan — one without family gatherings and congregational tarawih prayers, with the circuit breaker measures in place. It is also a time to strengthen resilience and deepen spirituality.⠀
⠀
MUIS has released advisories and guidebooks for the month of Ramadan. It has also launched a digital channel, SalamSG TV, today via go.gov.sg/salamsgtv — with religious and lifestyle content for children and adults. It will also feature videos in Bengali and Tamil for our Muslim migrant workers.⠀
⠀
While there are difficult adjustments to make, I hope that the spirit of Ramadan will continue to shine through.⠀
⠀
Selamat Berpuasa to all our Muslim friends in the community.⠀

Malam ini, masyarakat Islam Singapura akan menyambut ketibaan bulan Ramadan — bulan untuk berpuasa, solat dan bermuhasabah.⠀
⠀
Suasana Ramadan kali ini tidak pernah dialami sebelumnya, tanpa adanya keluarga-keluarga berkumpul dan solat tarawih berjemaah, dengan pelaksanaan langkah-langkah pemutus rantaian jangkitan. Ia juga masa untuk memperkukuh daya tahan dan mendalami aspek kerohanian.⠀
⠀
Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) telah mengeluarkan nasihat dan buku panduan berkenaan bulan Ramadan. Ia juga telah melancarkan saluran digital, SalamSG TV, hari ini di lelaman go.gov.sg/salamsgtv — dengan kandungan keagamaan dan gaya hidup bagi kanak-kanak dan orang dewasa. Saluran itu juga akan memaparkan video-video dalam bahasa Bengali dan Tamil bagi para pekerja asing Islam kita.⠀
⠀
Walaupun penyesuaian yang sukar perlu dibuat, saya berharap semangat Ramadan akan terus bersinar.⠀
⠀
Selamat Berpuasa kepada semua rakan Islam kita. ⠀

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Sea levels are rising, and weather patterns are changing. These have very significant implications, especially for a small island state like Singapore.

This year’s Earth Day takes place against the backdrop of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Ironically, COVID has given us a glimpse of what is possible, if we cut back on emissions. Waterways, once polluted, have cleared. The smog in many cities has lifted.

People are now waking up to bluer skies and clearer waters. But the scaled-down economic activities and restrictions on daily living come at huge cost. These painful measures will have to be gradually lifted when the pandemic wanes.

This global pandemic will pass at some point, but the global emergency that is climate change will not. Unlike COVID, climate change is a ""boiling frog” — we can be easily desensitised to the gradual rise in temperature and lulled to its consequences.

Countries have shown that we can move decisively and in concert, much like we did in response to this global pandemic. Post-COVID, there is room for all of us to act more swiftly and in unison to tackle climate change.

We can and should ""build back better”, to find a better balance between human activity and environmental protection. The ""new normal” that comes out from this pandemic can be a greener and more sustainable one. (Photo courtesy of Lee Lay Na)"

You can sign up or find out more here: www.facebook.com/groups/MasksSewnWithLove.

It is very encouraging to see our volunteers sewing at home, making masks for our seniors, our children, and our vulnerable groups.

This is the spirit of the Singapore Together movement in action. This is one way we can strengthen our social fabric during times of crisis, rather than let the pandemic fray us at the seams.

With each of us doing our part, I look forward to a richer, stronger and more diverse tapestry of our society post-COVID-19.

But do remember — during this period, stay at home, and when we go out, wear our masks, and practise good personal hygiene.

This underscores the urgency of the G20’s task to bring countries together to take coordinated action to deal with this pandemic.

In better circumstances, our meeting would have been held in Washington DC at around this time. But in these extraordinary times, we are meeting via video conference from our offices.

COVID-19 is a global pandemic that requires a global response. There is still much uncertainty over how this pandemic will pan out. The virus is also impacting countries on multiple fronts — healthcare, economy, financial stability, and social resilience.

A group of local artists led by the original singer of the song, Clement Chow, partnered @straits_times to create this rallying call for Singaporeans to stay home during the “circuit breaker” period.

This ground-up initiative is also for a good cause. It will help raise funds for the ST School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF) and @businesstimessg Budding Artists Fund (BTBAF), to help families affected by the outbreak.

My thanks to Clement, the artists, and the ST team for the video. You can help the needy and support this campaign here: str.sg/stayathomesg.

@indraneerajah and @desmond.lee have also launched the Stay Home for SG portal (www.sgunited.gov.sg/stay-engaged) — with up-to-date resources to stay active, connected and even to volunteer or seek help.

Together, let’s stay safe, stay healthy, and #StayhomeforSG.

I am very glad to see the project is well underway. The plans we put in place years ago have turned out to be quite timely as they will give us a buffer against global disruptions to food supplies due to unexpected incidents like COVID-19.

Today, I visited Apollo Aquaculture Group and Max Koi Farm, to look at our progress in the aquaculture field. Glad that the partners have brought local fish farming to new heights — literally! — with Apollo’s new 8-tier vertical fish farming facility. Eric and his team have been doing research, and making many innovations in fish farming. I am impressed by their creative and innovative fish farming techniques. Although they have been at it for many years, they are still constantly challenging themselves to do better — it’s a spirit that we should all adopt.

I believe every Singaporean can play a part to contribute to our ‘30 by 30’ vision. Do support our local farmers by purchasing food produced in Singapore. Be open to different and new food options. Last but not least, reduce food wastage as much as possible.

Minister Masagos will provide more details of the plan in the coming months. Adopting innovative ways to cultivate a part of our food needs is an important way to boost Singapore’s food resilience. We look forward to achieving this together with our people! (MCI Photos by Betty Chua)"

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed one of the most serious challenges to the global economy, even more so than the Global Financial Crisis or 9/11. As I shared during the interview, our immediate priority is to build resilience, protect jobs and livelihoods, as well as help viable companies stay afloat. All this while we tackle this crisis on three fronts — public healthcare, financial, and economic.

With expectations of a weaker economic outlook, MAS has eased its monetary policy. I reiterated during the interview that our firepower for managing this is fiscal policy — I am glad we have our past reserves for this purpose, to enable us to do more to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 if the situation calls for it.

Even as we work to stabilise our economy, we must look to the future at what it will be like in a post-COVID world. Let us continue to support one another and together, we can emerge stronger.

We can all step up cleanliness and hygiene standards to make them part and parcel of our everyday habits, so that they become our new norms. This is our first line of defence in the COVID-19 battle.

We have made a good start with the launch of the SG Clean campaign last month, followed by the setting up of the multi-agency SG Clean taskforce on Friday, chaired by Minister @masagosz. We will see some 114 hawker centres and 1,100 coffee shops islandwide covered under SG Clean.

Here in Tampines, the @tampinestowncouncil aims to complete the SG Clean certification of the Tampines Round Market & Food Centre and all 40 coffee shops in Tampines by the end of this month. Got a good start to this this morning by presenting all the stallholders at Tampines Central’s St 82 Coffee House with the “SG Clean” quality mark, together with @cheng_lihui, representatives from Tampines Town Council, @nea_sg, and @sgfoodagency.

Ensuring cleanliness of public spaces is a shared responsibility. Let’s continue to cultivate good personal hygiene and public hygiene habits that will last beyond COVID-19.

Together, we can make SG Clean our way of life, so that we can make Singapore a cleaner and more pleasant home for all!

I am glad the ‘Overcome As One’ initiative kicked off with many ground-up movements coming together with a common goal — to rally Singaporeans to stand together and look out for one another in the fight against COVID-19. ⠀
⠀
If you are not sure where to start, just look around for the many activities that you can play a part in. At the ‘Overcome as One’ event, I saw many thoughtful initiatives by different groups — some showing appreciation for our frontline workers, with others looking out for vulnerable groups in our community during this challenging period. You can check out some of these initiatives below.⠀
⠀
Showing kindness for one another should be very much a part of our Singapore Spirit. Be it a handwritten thank you note, a handmade origami heart, or a bottle of hand sanitiser placed in a lift for our neighbours — as long as we all take care of one another, I believe we can emerge stronger from the outbreak, be more resilient and united as One Singapore.⠀

This is on top of their usual responsibilities of responding to fires and other 995 emergencies.

Even as we are dealing with the challenges and uncertainties now, the SCDF officers were in good spirits and team morale was high. I was impressed by their professional and calm demeanour during the briefing and demonstration. Our @teamsingapore athletes were there on the ground too — to show their support, cheering on our heroes and heroines in blue, with ice cream in hand! 🍦

Such ground-up support may be a simple gesture but they demonstrate the best of our Singapore spirit — to show how our frontline warriors are not alone in tackling this outbreak. Together, we can overcome this outbreak, as well as emerge stronger and more united, as one people.

Met some of our frontline @myscdf personnel at Kallang Fire Station today. Handling COVID-19-related duties are now part of their day-to-day operations, such as the emergency ambulance crew conveying suspected COVID-19 cases and supporting temperature screening at @changiairport. This is on top of their usual responsibilities of responding to fires and other 995 emergencies.

Even as we are dealing with the challenges and uncertainties now, the SCDF officers were in good spirits and team morale was high. I was impressed by their professional and calm demeanour during the briefing and demonstration. Our @teamsingapore athletes were there on the ground too — to show their support, cheering on our heroes and heroines in blue, with ice cream in hand! 🍦

Such ground-up support may be a simple gesture but they demonstrate the best of our Singapore spirit — to show how our frontline warriors are not alone in tackling this outbreak. Together, we can overcome this outbreak, as well as emerge stronger and more united, as one people.

Glad that schools are involving our young in the fight against COVID-19, through lessons of being responsible for one’s personal hygiene, or instilling important life values of helping others and working together for the better good of our society.

From being psychologically resilient to ensuring that our businesses continue to operate as usual, everyone has a part to play to keep Singapore going.

Despite the current 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, I am glad that most of the exhibitors rallied together and continued with the @singaporeairshow.

Credit to the organiser, Experia Events — they put in place additional measures to safeguard all participants and visitors, with a medical team on standby as well as rooms for isolation, if needed. Like other visitors, I had to get my temperature checked at the opening this evening.

Much like how the global aviation sector emerged stronger from SARS and MERS, I am optimistic that they will weather the consequences of this outbreak. In today’s highly interconnected world, no country is immune to the effects of 2019-nCoV. But with close co-operation, I believe that China, Singapore, and the rest of the international community can overcome this challenge together.

We must work together, as an international community, to put in place the hard and soft infrastructure, so that even as we protect ourselves and our people from this virus, we can continue with our daily activities.

I also met Thai Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on the sidelines of the event. Singapore, Thailand and the UK have been affected by the 2019-nCoV outbreak and together with the international community, we are currently working on the best approach to contain the outbreak and protect our people.

The Singapore Airshow is on from now till 16 Feb. Visit their website — www.singaporeairshow.com for more details! (MCI Photos by Betty Chua)"

MOH is doing contact tracing for these as well as seven other confirmed local cases. You can read the latest update on MOH's website.

While we have been seeing more new cases, I am relieved to hear that four more cases have fully recovered and were discharged on Sunday. We have seen a total of six patients who have recovered fully.

With the switch from DORSCON Yellow to Orange, MOH has issued an infographic on precautions you should take to help contain the spread of 2019-nCoV. Just remember the 5Ms, practice them diligently and stay healthy!

Do share it with your friends and loved ones so that they are informed as well.

After a confirmed case was identified in Tampines East, Advisor @cheng_lihui went to the affected block to support the cleaning and sanitisation done by Tampines Town Council and @nea_sg officers. She also brought essential items to the family, as they are now quarantined. Together with my Tampines GRC advisors, we will continue to monitor and provide necessary assistance.

Over the weekend, we have been checking on the situation across Tampines — was glad that our Tampines residents were calmly going about their daily lives after the panic buying incidents witnessed on Friday evening. Supermarket staff have worked long hours over the weekend to replenish stocks that were swept off the shelves as well as clean up the scenes of chaos left behind in some stores. I would like to assure Singaporeans that there is enough for everyone if we all only buy what we need. There is no need to build your own stockpile. Let us do our part, keep calm, and not let fear rule over our hearts and minds.

Amid reports of inconsiderate and racist behaviour, I am heartened by the Tampines Kindness Movement initiative for our healthcare workers who have been at the frontline providing professional medical care to the affected. There is currently a booth at @ourtampineshub that lets residents and visitors pen down messages of appreciation to our medical personnel.

I would like to assure Singaporeans that there is enough for everyone if we all only buy what we need. There is no need to build your own stockpile. Let us do our part, keep calm, and not let fear rule over our hearts and minds.

Amid reports of inconsiderate and racist behaviour, I am heartened by the Tampines Kindness Movement initiative for our healthcare workers who have been at the frontline providing professional medical care to the affected. There is currently a booth at @ourtampineshub that lets residents and visitors pen down messages of appreciation to our medical personnel.

If you are in the area, do show your support! Or you can share your encouragement and stories of good deeds by our people in the comments below, for all to read. Stay Calm, Stay Healthy, Stay Caring!

17,benlawlah,"Dear DPM, First, as a born and bred citizen, I thank the government for its great efforts in coping with this crisis. My purpose of dropping a message here is to request the government to review and enhance on “Total Defence Concept” after this crisis. All societies will have its own vulnerabilities and so do we. I felt the Total Defence Concept has not been ingrained into our lives and much needs to be done. I hope the government would take the opportunity (a strange word to use in times of crisis) to digest our weaknesses. For one, I hope we can differentiate between “Government readiness” and “Citizen readiness”. I think we are weak in the latter. The psychological and mental state of our people are generally lower than government readiness. The gap should be reduced. As examples: 1.  In these “soft aspects” for instance, taking care of one’s health (drinking lots of water for instance) is not only to keep us healthy. It is at this times that our healthcare system will be put under strain. So if we stay away from falling sick, it will allow the medical healthcare providers and system to focus on infected citizens; 2.  Crisis management should be integral to our education system starting from the young – why hoarding is un-necessary and selfish, keep your hands away from un-necessary touching. 3.  Reduce the “shows” of total defence exercises across neighbourhoods that I felt are primarily non-effective and more “illustrative”. Place more focus on citizen readiness on other aspects. 4.  Have policies that address businesses that exploit the crisis. This is simply immoral and whilst it is demand and supply – the only apparatus that can close the valve and send the right message is the government. Minister CCS has already taken actions – but please make sure these people / businessman are brought to light and penalised. If it means taking away their licenses, then perhaps that should be considered. Singapore is too small to allow multiple cracks. Thank you.",2020-02-10T01:57:08.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8WBvX_HLvy/,2020-02-09T11:18:23.000Z,"It has been a busy and challenging time dealing with the 2019 novel coronavirus situation.

My thanks to the PRC government, together with the dedicated @mfa_sg officers as well as the Scoot airline crew, and pilots who all helped to bring our people home. Home Sweet Home! Stay healthy!"

I spoke to PRC Vice-Premier Han Zheng earlier today. I conveyed my condolences and sympathies to the families who have lost their loved ones to the outbreak, and to the communities in China which have been severely affected by the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

I reiterated to Vice-Premier Han that Singapore will continue to work closely with China and the international community to fight the virus —  this includes preventing its further spread and developing better medical testing.

In times like this, with the longstanding special relationship between Singapore and China, it is also important for us to work together.

Singapore researchers have worked to develop diagnostic nCoV test kits for use in laboratories. We can contribute to China’s containment efforts by providing test kits to conduct 10,000 tests at the first instance, together with 3 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines. We will be providing another 10,000 tests in the next couple of weeks. Our scientific experts are also exchanging views with their counterparts in China.

Earlier this week, the @sgredcross, together with various trade associations and chambers, companies and local community organisations, launched a public appeal to raise funds to provide humanitarian assistance to the affected communities in China. The Singapore Government will also contribute $1 million in seed funding to this collective effort by Singaporeans.

Infectious diseases are transboundary in nature. Countries can only overcome this challenge by stepping up measures within each country, and by collaborating with one another.

Singapore will continue to do our part — enhancing our safeguards as the situation evolves, and working with China and the international community to combat this outbreak.

It was good to join 700 residents at this year’s celebratory dinner over the weekend.

Even as we deal with the 2019 novel coronavirus situation, many of the residents were full of not only cheer, but also confidence and encouragement. Many were wishing one another good health and giving reminders to stay vigilant, maintain good hygiene practices, and use masks only when needed.

The current 2019-nCoV situation is a serious challenge for all of us. Shared with residents how the Government will help workers and companies affected by the 2019-nCoV situation. We are continuing to plan for the future by investing in our young, looking after our seniors and supporting the aspirations of Singaporeans.

A big thank you to the organisers, performers and volunteers for organising the dinner! And to my Tampines residents — am heartened by the resilience you have shown in the face of 2019-nCoV — showcasing our Singapore Spirit and how we care for one another, as we celebrate our Home, family and friends together.

I wish everyone good health and success in the Year of the Rat!

The first and third imported cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus had stayed at the hotel. While it is less crowded, I was glad to see that the staff were in good spirits.

Safeguarding the well-being of our people remains our top priority. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has stepped up precautionary measures in the past week to reduce the risk of both community spread and the risk of more imported nCoV cases.

At the same time, the economic impact of the outbreak is understandably weighing on people’s minds. The Government will provide targeted support to sectors that have been directly impacted, such as the aviation sector, taxi and private hire car drivers, hotels and tour agents.

The situation is rapidly evolving. Depending on how the situation progresses, the impact on our economy could intensify. The Government is prepared to support our firms and workers in the event of a broad-based economic slowdown. We will continue to monitor this closely and implement decisive measures as needed.

Full details will be shared at #SGBudget 2020 on 18 February.

The first and third imported cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus had stayed at the hotel. While it is less crowded, I was glad to see that the staff were in good spirits.

Safeguarding the well-being of our people remains our top priority. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has stepped up precautionary measures in the past week to reduce the risk of both community spread and the risk of more imported nCoV cases.

At the same time, the economic impact of the outbreak is understandably weighing on people’s minds. The Government will provide targeted support to sectors that have been directly impacted, such as the aviation sector, taxi and private hire car drivers, hotels and tour agents.

The situation is rapidly evolving. Depending on how the situation progresses, the impact on our economy could intensify.

There are many workers, including our healthcare workers, public transport workers and uniformed officers, who are working tirelessly over the festive period. Let’s show our appreciation for their dedication.

As we welcome the new year, the Wuhan coronavirus is a challenge that we need to overcome. We are monitoring the situation very closely. Our institutions and our people are better prepared to deal with such situations after our experience with the SARS outbreak. We have also stepped up checks at our land, sea and air checkpoints. Our healthcare institutions are geared up, preparing for all contingencies. But this is a rapidly evolving situation and we must stay vigilant.

I hope that every one of us will do our part — take the necessary precautions, be socially responsible and not spread false information. As long as we come together as one people and respond as one Singapore — workers, employers, unions, and individuals alike — I am confident that we will tide over this challenging period.

Let’s continue to stay vigilant, calm and healthy! Here’s wishing everyone a prosperous and blessed #ChineseNewYear! 🐭⠀
