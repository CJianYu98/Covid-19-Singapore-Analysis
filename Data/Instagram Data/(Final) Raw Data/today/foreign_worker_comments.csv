tony_tkc,"Again I reiterate my comment in June when we go into Phase 2: “Dormitories number will continue to drop, or even to 0. However, high possibility that community case will rise as we move into Phase 2. Will it lead to a second wave in August, perhaps 🤷‍♂️? Be vigilant, continue to stay home unless absolutely necessary to go out, stay safe, stay healthy.”",2020-07-06T08:31:58.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CCSz4Zyl8qE/,2020-07-06 08:27:56+00:00,"the ministry of health has confirmed 183 new cases of covid-19 on monday (july 6).⁣⁣⁣

Beside the Urgent renovation to others facilities to cater to those not affected yet. Can the minister in charge pls updated which ministries is spending this additional cost including all the manpower, logistics, rental of space, etc,etc. To execute this overlook mistake made?. Or just like the Youth Olympic where additional hundred millions was cough out due to error of under costing. Or further down where buying the wrong share n cost  to lost sin 500 millions. (No One is responsible???). It high time, the respective in charge is (MAN) enough to admit the mistakes make. Just like in school. WE were told by teacher. Be a (MAN) and admit when mistake is made.. Not to cast it aside, make excuses, blame on others.

jnurfazlin,"The large numbers are inevitable considering their close proximity and high numbers in the dorms. So when all are tested, at least now we have them diagnosed and ascertained and treated. The true effect of the CB is looking at the numbers of other cases involving the rest of the community. As such, we can see how the CB is gradually bringing down the numbers slowly but surely. It will take a little more time to register a flattening.

aliciatan4,"I urge the leaders all over the world to contact Jessica Seah from Singapore so this unpredecented global pandemic can end swiftly without any more deaths, bankruptcies, lockdowns, retrenchments and viral mutations! WHO is clueless how the immune system really works based on their wrong recommendations like using disinfectants, hand sanitizers, alcohol and soap. They contain cancer causing agents like formaldehyde Triclosan， sodium laurel sulphate， parabens etc. that will impair the immune system and damage the organs, leaving the population more vulnerable to COVID 19! True healing means eliminating toxins, never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! I posted proofs including a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication plus other impressive cases. Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, pathogens, diseases, free radicals and cancer cells! It is always the wrong treatment methods that kill the patients! Jessica Seah's nontoxic treatment method is cheap, simple and very effective. No expensive ventilators are needed!🇸🇬",2020-04-11T23:26:20.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-2lbhvB2dW/,2020-04-11 19:48:44+00:00,"covid-19 update from the ministry of health on april 11 : ⁣

aliciatan4,"To radenshahrudin: don't use your low standard to judge Jessica Seah. Selling the book one at a time will not make her a millionaire. Up till now she has not earned because if you minus the printing cost, the time taken to pack and send, the transport charges, the meals, it is impossible to make. Do you know she had to stand almost 1 hour to mail one book due social distancing policy. Read the improved blood sugar report of my friend's sister ,73 years old before you hurl groundless accusations! If you can't contribute significantly to this toxic world don't stop others who can!

It is the best doctor and best defence against infections. Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore.
