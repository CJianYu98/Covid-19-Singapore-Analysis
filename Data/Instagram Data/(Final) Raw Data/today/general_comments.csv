now, six months later, he and his dormitory mates are only just starting to sense that they may get some reprieve.

while the wider community here is gradually having some normality as they go about their lives, mr shermaraja and many migrant workers remain indoors, save for work and essential errands. as part of the measures to ease restrictions for migrant workers to stay safe within and outside the dormitories, from oct 31, workers who have recovered and those who have tested negative recently under a rostered routine testing regime are allowed to visit recreation centres on their rest days — at staggered time slots. 

mr shermaraja gave today a glimpse into his life since returning to work last month after being cooped up for almost half a year. he also talked about his fears battling an invisible enemy — he had no symptoms when he was infected with the coronavirus back in june — as well as his grim encounters with depressed, suicidal workers. more in the link in bio @todayonline.

es_in_tokyo,It took NUS pretty long to fire that sexual predator of a lecturer.,2020-10-30T23:04:03.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CG7GjxJBlEF/,2020-10-29 10:06:20+00:00,"the inconveniences of the university's zoning policy prompted mr foo ce ying, a final-year business administration student, to launch a petition for its removal on the change.org website on oct 24.

the petition has attracted over 600 signatures. 

many of the students interviewed by today said they were unhappy with the policy as it was impractical and inconvenient, and limited their food options. the policy segregates students and employees of the university according to delineated areas of the campus.

yesterday, the national university of singapore (nus) said it is reviewing a zoning policy introduced in june to reduce intermingling on campus due to covid-19. 

mr foo said that he had decided to push for a change in the policy five months after its implementation, since the covid-19 situation had improved in singapore. “while zoning was effective initially, i feel like things are going back to normal and students feel that zoning has outlived its usefulness.”

mr foo added that the university has been quick to respond to his petition. he will be meeting with the university’s president, professor tan eng chye, and the university’s student union next week to discuss how to move forward with the policy.

thomas.tyrone.beiron.tay,"His relating the issues omits the troubles related to the chronology of events: 22 Jan the severity of the outbreak became known and a few days later, it was reported that three days quarantine was sufficient, but by 26 Jan, it became known that 14 days was recommended. In SG, we had not duly restricted air travel nor insisted on precautionary mask usage. By end February, masks were required and some expected a sort of lock-down - but meanwhile it was much business like usual. By the time the circuit-breaker was announced to be put into effect a fortnight later, there was already six weeks or more for MOM Enforcement unit to ensure the FW dorms and communal living supervisors will have implemented the same strict (if not stricter) norms than what was recommended for Singapore generally. This did not happen. The few cases seemingly from Mustafa then were reported and when testing - and only then - were implemented at the affected dormitories that the situation (of clusters erupting) became known as the data showed it had escalated prior to testing. The eventual handling was excellent but the cost of caring for the 50,000 odd infected, not to mention 'exposed' persons has yet to be revealed. The Opposition should call for an independent Public Inquiry into that matter, not for fault finding, but because it represents what has to be accepted as a real, known risk, as long as we have hundreds of thousands in this type of communal living, not to mention aged homes, student dormitories and the such. The data will help us in the future. But Mrs Teo must cooperate and not conceal critical information however condemning. 🕊💐",2020-09-04T00:03:43.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CEqDj2onSdR/,2020-09-03 02:10:28+00:00,"during his speech in parliament on wednesday (sept 2), prime minister lee hsien loong said the government must learn from errors of covid-19 response but right decisions not always possible ‘in fog of war’."

when_junexp,"From what I read in wiki, our prime minister is 68 and some ministers are already in their 50s and 60s. PM Lee is making a “special appeal” to older Singaporeans to stay at home, so does that include themselves? Why are they still working outside in their office? Why are you contradicting your prime ministers word, especially PM Lee? Your chances of dying is higher, and if you get infected and spread to other ministers or family, you put them in danger and destabilise the country. So what are you waiting for dear sirs? PM Lee is already urging y’all to stay at home. Prime Minister sir, you also have to stay at home.

walaoehjessie,"As a contract worker before myself, I believe the reason why they still go back cause no 1, maybe supervisor/manager don't accept the mc OR because contract worker are mostly hired under recruitment agencies and for the first 3 months of contract, any mc or leave they wanna take is counted as NPL. And in order to want to have a clean record to increase their chances of getting converted to perm staff, most people sick also dw take MC. Cause tbh if given an MC, anyone in the right and sane mind would wanna rest at home cause why not?

aliciatan4,"My anaphylactic allergic reaction had worst symptoms than COVID 19. They include severe sore throat with bloody phlegm, running nose with bloody mucus, cough until wheezing, breathlessness, an upper tract lung infection, an elevated level of enzyme in my liver, high fever of 40 degree Celsius, inability to utter a word, dizziness, itchy/painful/bleeding rashes and a dangerously low level of blood pressure. My diastolic blood pressure was only 49! I posted the proofs and the doctor's remarks that I declined all medicines. My immune system reversed all the symptoms.  I do not disinfect,  sanitise, wash my hands with the toxic soap or wear the mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide, a cancer causing agent. Any product that kill the viruses will impair our immune system and damage the organs! When the commuters coughed badly, I did not fall sick! Stop believing in the flawed scientific research.  Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She reversed all her health problems without any medication or EXERCISE! True healing means eliminating toxins, never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body!
