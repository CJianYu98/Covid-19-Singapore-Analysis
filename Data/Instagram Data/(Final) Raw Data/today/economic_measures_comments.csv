each singaporean aged 18 and above (as of 2020) will get $100 in singaporediscovers vouchers that can be used for attraction tickets, hotel stays and local tours in singapore from dec 1, 2020 to june 30, 2021. these will be distributed in denominations of $10.

there are five authorised online platforms to redeem the vouchers: changi recommends, trip.com, klook, globaltix, and traveloka. you will need to use your singpass account to claim your vouchers.

for those who are unable to redeem their vouchers digitally, there will be physical touchpoints set up by booking platforms. stb is also working with the people’s association to set up physical booths at some community centres (ccs).

where can you use your singaporediscovers vouchers?
there are over 200 merchants where you can use those singaporediscover vouchers — 37 attractions, 164 hotels and 79 tour operators are on the list at press time.
