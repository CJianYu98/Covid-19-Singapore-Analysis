I urge the leaders all over the world to contact Jessica Seah at aceofaceent@yahoo.com so this battle against COVID 19 can end swiftly without any medication, expensive ventilators and lockdowns that cripple the world economy. Jessica Seah is the author of Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills. She reversed all her health problems including infections, obesity, arthritis, hormonal imbalance high uric acid, constipation,extreme joint pain and anaphylactic allergic reaction without any medication or exercise. True healing means eliminating toxins never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body! Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, diseases, pathogens, free radicals and cancer cells! I posted proofs including a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication plus other impressive cases! ""Heal the ills of the world, socially, mentally, emotionally and environmentally before we can cure the toxic body!🇸🇬",2020-04-19T22:36:53.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_Kv3NmpMV3/,2020-04-19 15:44:43+00:00,"some essential workers over the weekend had little choice but to ignore safe distancing markers on the train as the authorities’ move to reduce the frequency of services resulted in some relatively crowded trains.

aliciatan4,"Haven't you notice the measures don't work! Japanese always wear masks when they are sick but the rest of the population still get infected! The doctors and nurses were covered from head to toe also get infected means the masks sterilised with Ethylene oxide, a cancer causing agent, only give a false sense of security! Before the compulsory mask wearing policy, I did not wear any mask, disinfect, frequently wash my hands with soap or sanitise . When the commuters coughed badly, I did not fall sick even though I was sitting next to them. I just did everything mentioned in the book, Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She reversed all her health problems without any medication or exercise. Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, diseases, pathogens, free radicals and cancer cells. Only the already healed can teach the world how to heal!

aliciatan4,"If the world continues to disinfect, sanitise using cancer causing agents,or wash with the toxic soap, the population will be more vulnerable to COVID 19 and diseases! Use your common sense, the toxic chemicals will impair the immune system, our first line of defence and damage the organs. We need the unharmed immune system to fight and subdue COVID 19! Thiese wrong recommendations by WHO have proven ineffective as more people despite following the using instructions get infected. I do not follow and do not wear the mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide another cancer causing agent. When the commuters coughed very badly I did not fall sick! I keep seeing the public areas are disinfect! You are making the population inhale poison! Before you can solve COVID 19, you are creating more health problems! Such stupidity will cause astronomical increase in chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases! This is the fallacy of science that always embrace man-made chemicals! Science created the superbugs, the mutated viruses without realising it and fail to subdue. The next foolish move will be to develop another vaccine. History always repeats itself! Humans are killed by ignorance foolishness and self-inflicted harm! This generation should stop repeating the same errors as our predecessors!

aliciatan4,"Clueless people, no matter how highly qualified in the field of science, cannot lead the world out of this unprecedented global pandemic! How can WHO advised the world to disinfect and sanitise when the can causing agents can impair the immune system, our first line of defence and harm the organs! We need our unharmed immune system to fight and subdue COVID 19! I reversed my anaphylactic allergic reaction with symptoms worse than COVID 19 without any medication. I did everything mentioned in the book, Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. The brilliant author discovered we could use appropriate cheap food to activate the immune system to fight and subdue infections, pathogens, diseases, free radicals and cancer cells. I posted concrete proofs. I even helped a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection by replicating Jessica Seah's nontoxic treatment method and diet. It is cheap, simple and very effective. I posted proofs. It is always the toxic treatment that kills the patients. HIV medicine can trigger heart problems, liver and pancreas failure plus other adverse effects!
