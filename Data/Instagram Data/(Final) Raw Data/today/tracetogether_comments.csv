by december, it will be compulsory to use the tracetogether mobile application or token to check in at venues such as workplaces, schools, malls as well as food and beverage outlets under the government's plan to further reopen the economy.

at these venues, people will not be able to check in by scanning their identification cards or safeentry qr codes with their phones, the smart nation and digital government office said in a statement yesterday.

instead, they will have to either use the tracetogether app to scan a qr code at the premises or have the staff there scan the qr code found on their token.

currently, only the use of safeentry is compulsory.
