3,dawntan.sg,It will be good to incorporate some good features of Safe entry into Trace Together app. Personally I like the search feature of locations within close proximity .  I use that when I’m nearing the building to save time and straight to queue for entry instead of scanning the QR code.,2020-12-11T01:53:39.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CInPobSHB2c/,2020-12-10 10:03:48+00:00,"why must the safeentry and tracetogether app/token be used together? 📲

Really defeat the purpose of scanning IC & QR codes! How to trace whether the customers fill up their own particular or just simply fill up only (not their particular) as they just want to go into supermarkets only?
