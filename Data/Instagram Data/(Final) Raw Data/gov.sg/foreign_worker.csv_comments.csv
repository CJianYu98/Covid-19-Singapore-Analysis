9,helenlim2018,"After CB, the government should not be using the criteria whether a biz is carrying out essential services to open in phase 1 or 2 or 3. Rather the criteria used by the government should be whether the company has put in place sufficient safe social distancing measures before it qualifies to be open for business. Shops have been closed for more than 2 months already. Rental and salaries still need to be paid. If shops are not allowed to open soon, all of us will be out of business.
