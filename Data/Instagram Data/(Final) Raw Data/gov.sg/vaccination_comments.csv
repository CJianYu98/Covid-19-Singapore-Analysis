11,sarahlim1386,It's new so they won't probably know the side effects.  Plus again it isn't 100% guarantee that it can total prevent you from getting covid-19.Although at least it does some protection Plus I heard other countries news ppl getting vaccine some gotten the side effects of the vaccine include face distortion. & Vaccine usually takes alot more years to do research & trials about 10 year to prove that it is safe. U can't say for sure the side effects could cause health problems if it changes DNA sequence or effect cells in the body.,2020-12-15T02:05:33.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIyFbQNHBjg/,2020-12-14 15:06:04+00:00,"üíâ covid-19 vaccinations will be free for all singaporeans and long-term residents, with priority given to groups at greater risk, including healthcare workers and the elderly.
