shankar.rajan.1949,"When I went on the appointed date and time to Bishan CC, I was not vaccinated as my medical record shows that I am allergic to the antibiotic tetracycline.The centre says it will contact me in future. Does it mean that I will not be able to travel when all restrictions are lifted as I will not have the vaccination certificate?

m_ask.co,"Vax does not prevent you from being a carrier but since it prevents you from getting really sick from it, you will have less symptoms probably even if you do catch it. Less symptoms means less chance of spreading it to others eg.

calvinelcheng,"This is a terrible message. I can think of so many things that Singaporeans don’t like to do, but are forced to, for our own good.  Not to say measles and diphtheria  vaccinations are compulsory. This is therefore a nonsensical reason. No government is making it compulsory because the vaccine is still new, even if it’s proven to be safe and effective in the short term. And because no government is making it compulsory, the Singapore government will not be brave enough to be the only one to do so. If you can’t be straightforward, don’t make up nonsensical reasons. - CC",2021-02-16T05:26:24.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLTtIYTMOX8/,2021-02-15 09:30:44+00:00,"your covid-19 questions answered:

sarahlim1386,It's new so they won't probably know the side effects.  Plus again it isn't 100% guarantee that it can total prevent you from getting covid-19.Although at least it does some protection Plus I heard other countries news ppl getting vaccine some gotten the side effects of the vaccine include face distortion. & Vaccine usually takes alot more years to do research & trials about 10 year to prove that it is safe. U can't say for sure the side effects could cause health problems if it changes DNA sequence or effect cells in the body.,2020-12-15T02:05:33.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIyFbQNHBjg/,2020-12-14 15:06:04+00:00,"💉 covid-19 vaccinations will be free for all singaporeans and long-term residents, with priority given to groups at greater risk, including healthcare workers and the elderly.

Install Counter Shield plastic in all of OUR Cashier/Concierge/Customer Service countersREASON: STAFF & CUSTOMER are constally interact with one another hence speech droplets are produce although they wore facemask, (Counter Shield clear thick plastic or glass)2. All of our temperature Checker to wear both Facemask, FaceShield and install COUNTER SHIELD CLEAR PLASTIC OR GLASSREASON: same reason as the 1st. Staff and people see each other face to face. Atleast adding this will provide additional protection3. Install table shield arcylic in all of our dine in TablesREASON: PEOPLE in dine in will remove Facemask when eating, hence breath and speech droplets are release in the air.This will add additional protection specially to all service staff and make everyone feel even safer while shopping or dining in ALL PLACES IN SG.Thank you very much",2020-12-10T23:49:04.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CInWskvngMI/,2020-12-10 11:07:06+00:00,"do we need to wear masks when we exercise? 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

jordanielrantornlips27,"Hi,It might be good, as covid is both aerosol AIRBORNE and direct transmission, to add another layer of protection.We can 1. Install Counter Shield plastic in all of OUR Cashier/Concierge/Customer Service countersREASON: STAFF & CUSTOMER are constally interact with one another hence speech droplets are produce although they wore facemask, (Counter Shield clear thick plastic or glass)2. All of our temperature Checker to wear both Facemask, FaceShield and install COUNTER SHIELD CLEAR PLASTIC OR GLASSREASON: same reason as the 1st. Staff and people see each other face to face. Atleast adding this will provide additional protection3. Install table shield arcylic in all of our dine in TablesREASON: PEOPLE in dine in will remove Facemask when eating, hence breath and speech droplets are release in the air.This will add additional protection specially to all service staff and make everyone feel even safer while shopping or dining in ALL PLACES IN SG.Thank you very much",2020-12-10T23:49:17.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIm8tRsHPsV/,2020-12-10 07:19:26+00:00,"why are stay-home notice (shn) durations different for some travellers? 🏠

ragnar_lothbrok1994,"Singapore govt took care of us during the pandemic. But never thought they will lock us down Like this.  Feels like coke chain on my throat. There are a large number of foreign workers in Singapore working not only for ourselves also for the betterment of Singapore, have little mercy on us.  Even when no one was with me i never felt alone,  but now even when people are around me i feel alone... I don't know how many times word suicide cross my mind, but i held on because of my family.... We can't go out to market,  mini mart is too expensive campared to outside market.... Work will finish at 6:45, then we have to stand in queue for punching out and finally reach dorm at mostly at 8 or , then stand in queue for punching in... Then have to wait for turn to cook,  shower , then talk to Family for sometime,  eat then sleep..
