We discussed their work so far, what comes next, and what we can tweak and improve. We have come a long way, and the migrant workers are now starting to go back to work.

Helping our migrant workers has demanded a multi-faceted approach, with teams from many agencies working together. They have deployed both high tech and the personal touch, and put in enormous efforts to tackle the problem.

Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too.

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers’ Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless. May the Singapore spirit shine brightly as we go through this difficult period together. – LHL

Please share with your families and friends, especially older Singaporeans.

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

The next few weeks will be tough. We have to get through them before the sun will shine over us again. Till that day comes, please stay home. – LHL

1,eileen.kuang,"Hi PM Lee, Me and my hubby and two kids (11 years and 3 years) are all SG PR. We are not getting any of the solidarity payment and even my younger one's kindergarten fee is not getting refunded just because none of us are citizen yet. We are equally paying taxes but we are not included or the government hardly think of PRs when they roll out any of the payout or benefit even during such a difficult time to everyone, which is so unique in the world to differentiate the treatment btw PR and citizens.

6,zhushinc,"Sir - will you now acknowledge the ineptitude of your ministers esp Lawrence Wong and Gan Kim Yong in handling this crisis. The momentary congratulatory and smugness on so called “gold standard” response has now been replaced by reacting on the fly and poor leadership. Basics like stay at home and mandatory MASKS wearing were employed last minute. What a disaster with dormitory and 3rd world living conditions! How embarrassing! Your father Lee Kuan Yew would never have let this happen esp letting the ministers make rookie style, deer in head light decisions",2020-04-16T03:51:44.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-y4ttNn17_/,2020-04-10T09:20:17.000Z,"Posted a message on our current COVID-19 situation in English, Chinese and Malay on my Facebook Page, Telegram channel, and the PMO YouTube channel.
