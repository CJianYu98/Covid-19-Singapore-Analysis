We discussed their work so far, what comes next, and what we can tweak and improve. We have come a long way, and the migrant workers are now starting to go back to work.

Helping our migrant workers has demanded a multi-faceted approach, with teams from many agencies working together. They have deployed both high tech and the personal touch, and put in enormous efforts to tackle the problem.

It will take us a few more months to resolve the dorms issue. We have kept things under control, and will progressively bring things back up and running again. Thank you all, once again, and keep up the good work! ‚Äì LHL (MCI Photos by Chwee [1] and Lee Jia Wen [2-4])

Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers‚Äô Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too.

Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers‚Äô Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless.
