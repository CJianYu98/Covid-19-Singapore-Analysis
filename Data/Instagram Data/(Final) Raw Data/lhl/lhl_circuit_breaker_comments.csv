The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We don‚Äôt want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. ‚Äì LHL

There are 1-2 cases a day and if MOH decides to over react and destroy many businesses with these 3 phases, there will be even more unhappy people. There is a delicate balance between too much restrictions on businesses opening and fear of a resurgence. Resurgence may or may not be a way of life going forward but when you force extreme restrictions in businesses down people‚Äôs throats, you will create anger in people with too much time because there is no work in their hands.

(About Mr Chan CS , our local masks factory). You will notice the factory workers who touch, sort , pack the production line masks DID NOT WEAR ANY GLOVES at all. This is totally unacceptable (and shocking!) in my most honest opinion. I thought we Singapore should have ""higher standards"" than say Vietnam ? (I watched Vietnam news their mask factories the workers do wear gloves). If our local mask factories workers are infected with Covid-19 and they do not wear gloves to touch/sort/pack the masks, the consequences can be disastrous. Trust your wisdom and do advise our local mask factories to instruct their workers to wear gloves. Thank you.

I thank you all for complying with the restrictions. While community cases have fallen, we still need to bring their number down decisively. We also want to make sure that if any cases leak from the migrant worker population into the wider community, we can detect and contain them.

That is why we are tightening the circuit breaker measures, e.g. thinning out crowds at hot spots like wet markets, and closing more workplace premises, till 4 May. We will also extend the circuit breaker itself to 1 June.

I know that this has not been an easy time. The circuit breaker is working, but we need to do a little bit more, and for a bit longer. Let us all do our part to beat the virus, break the chain of transmission, and overcome this together.

I thank you all for complying with the restrictions. While community cases have fallen, we still need to bring their number down decisively. We also want to make sure that if any cases leak from the migrant worker population into the wider community, we can detect and contain them.

That is why we are tightening the circuit breaker measures, e.g. thinning out crowds at hot spots like wet markets, and closing more workplace premises, till 4 May. We will also extend the circuit breaker itself to 1 June.

I know that this has not been an easy time. The circuit breaker is working, but we need to do a little bit more, and for a bit longer. Let us all do our part to beat the virus, break the chain of transmission, and overcome this together.

May be let barbers n hair dressers to work shorter hours or work on certain days of the week. We can't keep up a good image without a proper hair cut. And not nice n proper for men to keep long hair. One more comment is please allow shops that sell household items like shampoo, detergents  bathing soap or toothpaste n other toiletries to open.

It has been a difficult time for people of faith, including Christians here and elsewhere in the world. They have been unable to hold their usual services because of COVID-19 measures. However, these measures are essential to protect all of us, Christians and non-Christians alike.

We are both implementing strict circuit breaking measures, to break transmission of the virus and squeeze the cases down.

PM Ardern shared that after New Zealand implemented their measures, numbers only started to come down on Day 11. We are only in Day 3 and still have a long way to go. If we all comply strictly, as the New Zealanders have done, hopefully by our Day 11 we too will see positive results.

PM Ardern and I also discussed how we can support each other during this time, including keeping supply chains intact between the two countries. Both Singapore and New Zealand will continue to do our part in this global fight against COVID-19.

At home, @masagosz has announced that enforcement officers will now immediately take down the particulars of anyone breaching the measures. More details on his Facebook post today. We cannot wait to save lives. Please do your part today. ‚Äì LHL
