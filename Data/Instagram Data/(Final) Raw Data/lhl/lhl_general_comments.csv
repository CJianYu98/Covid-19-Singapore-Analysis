These swab test operations are part of the government’s efforts to keep our community safe as we continue to reopen our economy and allow more activities to resume. We are offering these tests to selected groups whose work involves more frequent interaction with the public, like stall holders and food delivery riders.

I visited the COVID-19 screening centre at Blk 402 in Ang Mo Kio today, and was glad to see many coming forward to be swabbed. Beyond AMK, the testing operations will also be progressively rolled out to other parts in Singapore.

These swab test operations are part of the government’s efforts to keep our community safe as we continue to reopen our economy and allow more activities to resume. We are offering these tests to selected groups whose work involves more frequent interaction with the public, like stall holders and food delivery riders.

I visited the COVID-19 screening centre at Blk 402 in Ang Mo Kio today, and was glad to see many coming forward to be swabbed. Beyond AMK, the testing operations will also be progressively rolled out to other parts in Singapore. This testing exercise requires the joint efforts of multiple agencies working closely together with community partners. Thank you to all the teams managing this, and keep up the good work! – LHL

Reusable masks are a good option as they protect us against viruses and ease the strain on our environment.

From today to 4 Oct, Singapore residents holding a government issued ID can collect two free reusable masks each from vending machines located at CCs, RCs and bus interchanges. Child-size masks are available at certain locations. More details on mask collection and pre-orders can be found at https://mask.stayprepared.sg&nbsp;

For my Teck Ghee residents, you can collect your free adult and child-size masks at Teck Ghee CC. Adult masks are also available at RCs and RNs. You can check the above website for availability. – LHL

We were lucky that NCID was up and running before COVID-19 hit us, but this did not happen by chance. It was the result of years of planning and hard work by government agencies, medical and research institutions, and healthcare partners.

Many seniors were about, as well as my Merdeka Generation peers — doing their marketing or enjoying a kopi break.

Every once in a while when meeting people, we instinctively stretch out our hands to greet one another, before remembering the safety measures — old habits are hard to shake! :) Just one of the things we are getting used to in the new normal. But I’m glad everyone is taking the precautions seriously. We are protecting one another, while carrying on our usual activities as much as possible. As long as we stay united, we will get through these tough times and emerge stronger. – LHL

Testing is a critical part of our strategy to control COVID-19, and the teams have been busy organising and running this.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This huge and complicated operation depends on many individuals all doing their part so that the testing runs smoothly. It is not just getting the swab done, but being on the front line, taking all the precautions and doing the procedures right. It is hard work and I thank all of you who are making this possible.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As we start Phase 2 of our re-opening on 19 June, we are also ramping up testing capacity so that we can safely and progressively resume work and social activities in the COVID world.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To win this battle, we need everyone to continue doing our part by practising safe distancing and good personal hygiene. Let us make a safe and steady transition to Phase 2! – LHL

India implemented a nationwide lockdown since late March, not a simple decision in a huge country of 1.3 billion people.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I thanked PM Modi for India’s help when we brought home some Singaporeans from India recently. I assured him that we will care for Indian migrant workers here, just as we care for Singaporeans. The migrant workers made personal sacrifices to come to work here. They have made many contributions to Singapore, so we have a responsibility for them.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Appreciate PM Modi’s affirmation of our efforts in looking after the migrant workers, and his assurance that they will not forget this.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
India and Singapore are strategic partners with extensive economic ties. We agreed to work together on the challenges posed by the pandemic, keep supply chains intact, and keep essential supplies flowing. – LHL

We feel the air inside is quite bad and feel safe to wear masks even we don’t feel sick. Also some people inside are coughing at will without any masks or thinking anything about hygiene. These people should be fined. At present not feeling safe in the public transportation and please do something before it’s too late. Thank you.",2020-03-29T11:04:14.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-RmK7jHMr-/,2020-03-28T11:03:19.000Z,"@amktowncouncil has completed its Masterplan for the next five years.

This is a global crisis, and needs a global solution. I called on the leaders to collaborate in three areas:

6,seagulllucky,"Dear PM, the Low morality rate outside Hu Bei province in China is not because of the 2019 nCoV’s characteristic itself, it is due to the strong measures China government has taken - focused medical resources on all patients, quarantine of suspects, cancelation of all gathering activists, wearing masks at all time, and extension of CNY holidays for all etc. There is short term negative financial effect but in Long term we will win the battle. However, Singapor is doing in an opposite way- a lot of gathering / parties are still ongoing and people share the respiratory droplets everywhere... We are not able to afford the wide spread of virus in Singapore if it continues.",2020-02-09T23:27:38.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8SyDbAHNZ-/,2020-02-08T05:03:36.000Z,"Today is Chap Goh Mei, the 15th and final day of #ChineseNewYear.

Singaporeans would be familiar with the pots of milk and kavadis which devotees carry in procession to fulfill their vows and give thanks for blessings they have received. It is a solemn ceremony, with some spending weeks in advance purifying themselves in both mind and body.

Thank you",2020-02-05T05:30:17.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B7-upVInSEA/,2020-01-31T10:09:01.000Z,"It has been a stressful week not just for the general public, but in particular for healthcare and medical professionals.

We have watched the new coronavirus outbreak in China closely, from the moment the first news came out. Actually we have been preparing for such a situation ever since SARS in 2003. We knew that one day something like that would happen again. So, in a way, this outbreak was a shock, but not a surprise.

9 of the 13 confirmed cases in Singapore are currently being treated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), next to @tantocksenghospital. I visited NCID this morning to see for myself the screening and containment process for affected patients, and to meet and thank some of the people working day and night to treat them. I was very happy with what I saw.

I urge everyone to show understanding and support to our healthcare and medical teams, public officers, the SAF and @pafrenz, who will be distributing masks to Singaporeans over the weekend. We owe them our gratitude for their hard work and dedication.

I have every confidence that if we stay vigilant and united, we can overcome this challenge. – LHL (MCI Photos by Betty Chua)"
