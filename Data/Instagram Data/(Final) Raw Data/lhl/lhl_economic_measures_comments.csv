A big thank you to all our workers for your contributions to Singapore, especially during COVID-19.
2020 has been a year like no other. Many workers have had their wages and livelihoods affected by the pandemic, particularly those in hard-hit sectors. Frontline and essential workers have made many sacrifices, to keep their families and all of us safe.

We do not know when this pandemic will end, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel. We’re closer to getting a vaccine, and starting to reopen our borders. In the meantime, stay safe and stay strong. 
During this pandemic, labour MPs have been working overtime helping union workers, while the Air Transport Executive Staff Union has been working with SIA and other airlines to assist ground staff and protect their interests. Therefore, I nominate NTUC Assistant Secretary-General @patricktaytg and President of the AESU Daniel Loh to show your appreciation next! – LHL

For every #toast2U hashtag, NTUC Income will pledge $2 to the NTUC U Care Fund, which helps low-income members and their families through various assistance programmes to defray their cost of living and children’s school expenses, as well as members whose livelihood had been affected by Covid-19.
When nominated:
1. All you need to do is record yourself “receiving” the drink from the person who nominated you and give a toast accompanied by a note of appreciation in the post.
2. “Pass” the drink on by nominating two others.
3. Tag @UHeartsg for us to keep track of the donations, and remember to make your post public!
This @UHeartsg initiative is by @nebosg and @young.ntuc, supported by NTUC Income."

3,rogersincere1312,"It'll be good if you can give clearer guidelines on the reopening of businesses like  fitness/yoga/pilates studios, restaurants and food court, retail shops. For example, how many people can gather in a class or place. If the rules and guidelines are clearly stated then businesses can decide if they would want to continue paying existing rentals, close shop, or completely move to online or seek some other modes of making a living. As of now, most things seems blurry, unclear and working on anticipation. We can understand the situation, at present, rentals have to be paid to landlords, irregardless of whether there are any customers. We dont get any salary from any of the govt help packages, other than the $600. Hope you can understand our situation is being now in a limbo.",2020-05-03T14:44:11.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_oICf9HgXK/,2020-05-01T01:33:57.000Z,"COVID-19 has forced us to adapt to a new normal.

May Day is an appropriate moment to thank our brothers and sisters, especially those on the front lines, and those performing essential services. You have kept Singapore going, and far exceeded the call of duty.

Our economy has taken a beating from the pandemic. The circuit breaker has been hard for everyone. Businesses and jobs have been disrupted. But we must hunker down, to stop the virus from spreading, so that we can progressively restart our economy.

Meanwhile, the government is working hard to support companies, and protect workers. We are implementing $60 billion in support measures, through the Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets.

Our forefathers had the foresight to put aside reserves for emergencies like this. We too have to keep an eye on the future, and work together to make sure Singapore emerges stronger from COVID-19.

This included all 10 ASEAN member states plus China, Japan, and Korea.

I called on my counterparts to work together to mitigate the economic damage caused by COVID-19 and recover to a sustainable new normal. I also urged them to sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) this year to boost trade and investment flows.

Glad that all Members of Parliament supported the measures. They raised useful ideas to improve the policies to support businesses, workers and households through this crisis.

While we deal with immediate challenges, we must keep an eye on the future too. The MPs raised a relevant question: we do need to use the reserves now, but are we being fiscally prudent enough? Will we still have enough reserves to do more later, if the situation calls for it?

When this is over, the past will not come back. Hence DPM @hengsweekeat set up two initiatives to think ahead — a taskforce on Emerging Stronger to cover the economy, as well as a new emphasis on social resilience under the Singapore Together Movement.

We are heading into the storm with a major $55 billion package to help save jobs and businesses, support households, and keep our economy going. If the situation worsens, we are ready to do more.

The impact on our economy has been huge. This is only the second time ever we are drawing on our reserves. The last time was for the Global Financial Crisis in 2009. We will be drawing up to $17 billion to fund the support measures, more than triple what was drawn in 2009.

I have no illusions that this will be all we need. Nobody can tell what lies ahead. COVID-19 has shown starkly how vulnerable we are, and how our existential threats essentially remain the same, despite Singapore going from third world to first. The COVID-19 pandemic will be the formative experience for this generation of Singaporeans. If we remain vigilant, resolute, and united, I am confident we will get through this together.

Any by encouraging all to wear masks, it’ll definitely prevent the people who are sick to spread their viruses but also protect people who are well from getting into contact with the viruses. 🙏🏻",2020-03-29T01:52:34.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-O86Xen9Ls/,2020-03-27T10:24:18.000Z,"Sat down with local media today to talk about the Resilience Budget that @hengsweekeat announced in Parliament yesterday, and what lies ahead as the COVID-19 pandemic turns the world upside down.

We are heading into the storm with a major $55 billion package to help save jobs and businesses, support households, and keep our economy going. If the situation worsens, we are ready to do more.

The impact on our economy has been huge. This is only the second time ever we are drawing on our reserves. The last time was for the Global Financial Crisis in 2009. We will be drawing up to $17 billion to fund the support measures, more than triple what was drawn in 2009.

I have no illusions that this will be all we need. Nobody can tell what lies ahead. COVID-19 has shown starkly how vulnerable we are, and how our existential threats essentially remain the same, despite Singapore going from third world to first. The COVID-19 pandemic will be the formative experience for this generation of Singaporeans. If we remain vigilant, resolute, and united, I am confident we will get through this together.

3,humblehumane,"Dear PM Lee: In this COVID-19 situation, we have recognised the hard work and sacrifices of medical and cleaning professionals, and many other people at the frontline. Very seldom do I hear fellow Singaporeans express gratitude for what they have in their lives (roof over their head, access to education and healthcare, food on the table, clean water and air, no guns, no wars, no natural disasters, low crime rate).... let alone appreciate the government’s effort. I do know many who take things for granted, nit-pick, and do not contribute as much to solutions. So besides being thankful for the frontline staff, I want to thank you, the ministers, government officers and everyone behind the scenes, for working tirelessly for the nation. All of you worry, plan and exert yourselves so much, just so that Singapore stays safe and well. THANK YOU. I hope everyone will have enough rest, be safe, and be in good health. I hope Singaporeans will be calm, empathetic, compassionate and measured in how they relate to fellow humans during this difficult period and in the years to come.",2020-03-25T11:01:21.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-EurG9ndVB/,2020-03-23T11:07:29.000Z,"Diplomacy in the time of COVID-19.

7,beauty.admirer.lover,"I am not sure about others, but personally I am extremely disappointed with this Unity Budget. I would like to quote a Yahoo commentator who wrote this feedback (Quote) : ""Veteran@VOTE2 hours ago singapore reserves are money mainly from past bearers and should be given to ALL singaporean household across the board, whom also facing the virus crisis. not just those whom got lay off due to the crisis, whom are mostly aliens. -- it will be exploited by unscrupulous employers to report 'lay offs' then 're-hired' the same after 3 months. (Unquote) There are other loopholes. E.g. Landlords who gained on zero property tax if they do not pass down the benefits to their tenants what can tenants do ? Lose Lose ? If landlords strategy is to use the gained benefits to wait out for the crisis to be over, they can easily get new tenants. Even if the landlords pass the savings, is there a clear guideline ? What can tenants do if landlords ""give them bread crumbs "" ? I listened to the Unity Budget. It seems complex, not easy to understand for many laymen or commoners. For those unemployed  due to other valid reasons say since last year, what assistance for these groups really ? Maybe I am not as smart as our leaders, but this Unity Budget for sure is confusingly complex. If Govt is afraid of giving too much direct cash handouts (as some may misuse it such as gambling), why not have assistance as such : Govt to pay 50% of PUB bills for the next 12 months ? Note that people are encouraged to do more hand washing. Surely water bills will shoot up. Or, plus S&CC charges to be waived for the next 12 months ? Whatever costs burden reduced is a good help during this crisis. For those affected that are low on CPF ordinary account balance but still have HDB mortgages to service, a top-up of 6 months equivalent will help with ""straight, direct beneficial effect'. People can see it. People can feel the benefts straightaway. And correct me if I am wrong, up the skilllscredit $ ? Now? You want people to go for ""mass training or learning of skills conducted in groups"" now ? At this social distancing times ?

PM Morrison and I had a candid and fruitful discussion on the COVID-19 situation, our extensive economic cooperation, and sustainability. We also witnessed the signing of a treaty on military training and two MOUs on Artificial Intelligence and Data Innovation.

Singapore and Australia enjoy close and multifaceted ties, with warm people-to-people ties. Australia is a popular destination for Singaporeans – not just for holidays and visiting friends, but also for studying. The SAF trains in Australia and our two armed forces have a long history of cooperation. I am confident that we will deepen our bilateral relationship further in the future. – LHL (MCI Photos by Lee Jia Wen)"

Fighting COVID-19 is difficult enough. But we also need to deal with COVID-19’s enormous impact on our economy.

Yesterday, the Government released the report of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's (EBRC), which the Committee had just completed.

The General Elections must take place before 21 April 2021. They can only be called after the electoral registers are updated. This will take about a month.

When to hold elections? That depends on the situation, and the outlook.

Singapore faces grave and extended challenges.

We can’t tell when the pandemic will end, but it will likely last at least this year, and quite possibly longer.

The economic hit will likely be more serious than the Global Financial Crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic.

I fully expect things to get more serious before they start getting better.

We have two choices. Either hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances – but we have no certainty of that.

Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.

If we have to hold elections before COVID-19 is over, we will take all the precautions necessary, so that parties can campaign effectively, and people can vote safely.

At stake are jobs, businesses and lives.

Which way to go, and the elections date, will depend on what will best see Singapore through this major crisis.

COVID-19 may well turn out to be the crisis that defines this generation of Singaporeans. We must gird ourselves to overcome this together, and show the world what Singapore can do. – LHL
