Instead, I spoke to a small audience at NTUC Auditorium, while groups joined us from 126 other locations virtually.

I took stock of our COVID-19 situation. We want to maintain our current stable position and get Singaporeans vaccinated quickly. The vaccines will take us one big step forward, but not back to business as usual, as many countries will not complete their vaccinations within this year. We have to live with the virus for many more years to come, maybe even permanently.

I also shared my thoughts on our external situation, and the outlook for the future. The next few years will not be easy. We can’t tell exactly how the world will change after the pandemic, but as long as we work together, hold fast to our principles, and keep faith both with our pioneers as well as generations yet unborn, we will emerge stronger and thrive for many years to come. – LHL

Teck Ghee CC is one of two CCs being used for vaccinations, along with Tanjong Pagar CC. More centres will be set up in the coming weeks, so that everyone can conveniently receive their vaccinations.

Visiting not necessarily where visitors are strangers to my cleaned home,2021-02-06T17:41:49.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CK8kj4mLHb8/,2021-02-06T09:53:19.000Z,"Our pilot COVID-19 vaccination exercise for seniors aged 70 and above is underway. Following my visit to Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic two weeks ago, I dropped by Teck Ghee CC this morning to meet the seniors getting their jabs and observe the vaccination process.

Teck Ghee CC is one of two CCs being used for vaccinations, along with Tanjong Pagar CC. More centres will be set up in the coming weeks, so that everyone can conveniently receive their vaccinations.
 
Glad the take-up rate from our seniors has been very encouraging. Many thanks to all involved – the vaccination team, the community partners, and volunteers – for your hard work in reaching out to seniors, guiding them along each step, and ensuring a smooth process. – LHL

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will announce details of the rollout in due course, so do stay tuned. We are prioritising our healthcare workers and the elderly. Vaccination will be voluntary, but I encourage Singaporeans to take the vaccine. 

It’s been a long and arduous year. I hope that this news will give Singaporeans cheer this festive season, and reason to be optimistic for 2021. – LHL

But because of our collective efforts against COVID-19, we are ready to ease into Phase 3 on 28 December. This is possible because of all of you who made many sacrifices, so that our numbers and situation are now under control.

We will also provide free, voluntary vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use, and the first batch will arrive by the end of 2020. We are still looking at other candidates, and by 3Q2021, we should have enough vaccines for everyone. 

I encourage that you get vaccinated, because you are not just protecting yourself, but people around you. This announcement will bring some year-end cheer to you and your friends and family, but we must maintain our vigilance as the virus is not yet eradicated. It might be a year or more before we are in the clear, but at least we can see light at the end of the tunnel. – LHL
