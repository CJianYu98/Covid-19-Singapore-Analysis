Happy that the sales for my parents stall increased. However, wishes that the safety measurement become better. From my observation only 20% of the visitor scan in to visit the hawker and there is no temperature taken. Although it will be a hassle as a resident who stays there as I walk up and down and around at least 4 times a day. But for the health benefit of the people staying and working there and also everyone please improve the measurement. Not to mention a lot elderly stay there. I can stay at home but my parents have to work so they need to be out.Thank you for providing free covid testing for people who work at Chinatown. But this method can only help to spot the virus and prevent it from spreading. How about stopping them to reach the owners? Although we all know temperature taking doesn't mean anything but it better than nothing.

It‚Äôs exactly 1 year since our first confirmed COVID-19 case in Singapore. The year has gone by at breakneck pace, as we all struggled to cope with the unprecedented chaos and disruption to our lives. Through immense effort and sacrifice, we‚Äôve got ourselves to a stable situation. Our vaccination programme is underway, with  seniors starting to get their shots next week.

The pandemic is escalating rapidly around the world. Our own situation here is under control, but we are seeing quite a few new cases among Singaporeans and residents returning from abroad. There is a significant risk that they may infect others and start new clusters. We must do our utmost to prevent this. That is why returnees are being issued stay-home notices. If you are a returnee, please observe the notice strictly to protect others, and help us fight COVID-19. ‚†Ä

COVID OVER!,2020-03-24T07:01:27.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9onAlwHOjK/,2020-03-12T13:01:47.000Z,"It is five weeks since I spoke about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. So it is timely to update Singaporeans again on the medical, economic and psychological outlooks of the situation.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Today, the @WHO officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. This means that while the situation in Singapore remains under control, the COVID-19 threat will be with us for a long time. We cannot be complacent.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
There are some baseline precautions we must get used to, like maintaining good personal hygiene and not holding large gatherings. We must also plan ahead in case a major outbreak happens in Singapore, like in South Korea or Italy.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
If a major outbreak happens, we will need more stringent social distancing measures, such as suspending schools and compulsory telecommuting. These will slow down the rate of transmission and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Already our economy has been seriously impacted, so we are working on a second stimulus package to support businesses and workers.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Singapore‚Äôs response to COVID-19 has been recognised by WHO and the international community. This is through the efforts of many Singaporeans, from the frontline staff to all of us keeping #SGclean. I thank all Singaporeans who are dealing with this calmly and responsibly. We must keep up our efforts, and remain #SGUnited.
