We will be commencing vaccinations for seniors above 70 years old from next Monday, and more vaccination centres will also be opened progressively for the convenience of all. 

Our vaccination efforts have been going well so far. About 250,000 people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. We are now getting supplies from both Pfizer and Moderna. Based on the expected supply schedule, another 1 million people should be able to get at least one dose of the vaccine by around end-March/early-April. This will cover all seniors above 60. 

Do encourage your seniors at home to get vaccinated when their turn comes, for their protection and safety."
