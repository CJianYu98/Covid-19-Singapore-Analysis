0,tanqinghui,"I recently read this book called “The House on Silat Road”, by Si-Hoe SS to my 9 year old child. Talks about their life from 1941-1945. Very interesting and real life story on their time during the Japanese occupation. I can feel that my child was bewildered that Singapore had such a history and it was a very good history lesson for her. Makes her appreciate the peace and prosperity that we are enjoying now. She inquired more about total defence day, the significance of it, the sounding of the public warning system, the purpose behind it.Great book that perhaps schools can introduce the children to. Lest we forget.",2021-02-15T13:33:33.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLUHpw7HWTK/,2021-02-15T13:22:29.000Z,"居安思危 - to remain vigilant in times of peace.

Many thanks to the @sccci.official for organising the War Memorial Service for the past 54 years, and for launching an e-book this year capturing the stories of those who had suffered through the Occupation and significance of the Civilian War Memorial.

When I saw the theme for this year – “Women Scientists at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19”, I was reminded of Dr Yang YinPing, whom I met at the launch of URA’s “Our Digital World” exhibition in 2016, when I was Minister for National Development. 

At that time, Dr Yang shared how she, together with her A*STAR colleagues, worked with MOH to use social networking sites to monitor the outbreak of avian flu in China. Fast forward to 2020, and Dr Yang is once again using her expertise in sentiment analysis to analyse global sentiments around COVID-19 on Twitter. Her team has observed different emotional responses to the pandemic across different countries, and their ongoing research to find out why may provide valuable insights into how we can better handle such crises in future. 

Also looking forward to enjoy a reunion meal today with one of the very first women in Science I knew growing up – my mother, who was also my Science teacher in school 🙂

There are no words to describe the year. Just this image of the virus. It wreaked havoc across the globe and brought everything to a standstill. Our lives changed completely. We will never forget what we’ve been through.

What will 2021 be like? No one can tell. But one thing is certain: the virus is still with us, and circulating in our community. The family cluster we detected today is a sobering reminder of the need for all of us to remain vigilant. 

So as we welcome the new year, let’s do so with some circumspection and reflection. We still have much to do in the fight against Covid. Keeping the infection under control while we re-open safely, and implementing the vaccination programme smoothly will be two major priorities in the year ahead.

So if I have a wish for 2021, it’s that we continue to stay united, and we work hard to complete our mission to defeat Covid-19 together as Team Singapore!"

But please remember: there are still rules in Phase 3. So comply with the measures and do not let your guard down. Around the world, some experts are already warning about a post-seasonal surge in cases, as people are ignoring the restrictions and flocking together for festive celebrations. We must not allow that to happen here.

I thank the majority of residents here who are doing their part. Unfortunately there are a few who continue to disregard the rules. Some book multiple tables in restaurants; others hold large parties in their homes. We will step up enforcement checks, and will take firm actions against these breaches, even for first-time offences - business outlets will be closed, individuals fined, and as highlighted before, those who are work-pass holders risk getting their passes revoked.

Here are their nuggets of advice for peers who are facing stressful times – believe in yourself, and take things slow and steady, step by step, when you feel overwhelmed.

A key topic we discussed was the role of technology in education. There are many views about how best we should utilise and integrate technology in teaching and learning. But the starting premise should always be centred on human needs, and that of our students.

We must therefore work to harness technology in a way that supports our students’ learning needs, well-being and holistic development. This way, technology becomes a force for good in education: to enable, inspire, and uplift every child, and to help prepare them for a rapidly changing future."

All the Education Ministers are grappling with how to reopen and resume schools safely during this pandemic. But the silver lining amidst this crisis is the opportunity to reimagine and transform education. We have seen how technological tools can be harnessed to improve education dramatically. So we are all looking at new models of hybrid learning that involve an integration of face-to-face with home-based learning. 

I shared with my counterparts Singapore’s experience, and also learnt a lot from the insights gleaned from other countries. Global cooperation has never been more pertinent as we combat COVID-19, and the G20 stands as an important platform for such cooperation.

These times have truly tested us as a government, and as a nation. For me, personally, it has reinforced my conviction and resolve to serve.  We all want Singapore to be the best home for our people. Everyone must have views on how to do things. But with every decision, there will be difficult trade-offs. As an elected government, we have a responsibility to think through the issues, and govern for all our people. We need to work with everyone to get things done, and do things right, because the consequences affect every Singaporean. Now with more opposition voices in Parliament, I look forward to both sides of the House working responsibly and together - to secure the best for our people, and a better future for Singapore."

Yesterday, we announced our plans to further expand testing in the community. From 1 July, we will test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection when they see a doctor. We will also test additional specific groups who may face greater exposure risks such as the frontline staff interacting with travellers at the airport; as well as vulnerable groups who need more protection, specifically the seniors living in communal facilities and shelters.

Yesterday, we announced our plans to further expand testing in the community. From 1 July, we will test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection when they see a doctor. We will also test additional specific groups who may face greater exposure risks such as the frontline staff interacting with travellers at the airport; as well as vulnerable groups who need more protection, specifically the seniors living in communal facilities and shelters.

Last night, the authorities were alerted to large crowds gathering around the Outdoor Refreshment Areas (ORA) and on the road along Lor Mambong in Holland Village.  Based on their inspections, the crowds were largely gathering outside one restaurant, namely the British Indian Curry Hut. We will close the restaurant with immediate effect.
All ORAs along Lor Mambong will also be removed. So F&B outlets along this stretch will have to ensure that their customers dine only within their premises, and are not eating or drinking outside.

Last night, the authorities were alerted to large crowds gathering around the Outdoor Refreshment Areas (ORA) and on the road along Lor Mambong in Holland Village.  Based on their inspections, the crowds were largely gathering outside one restaurant, namely the British Indian Curry Hut. We will close the restaurant with immediate effect.
All ORAs along Lor Mambong will also be removed. So F&B outlets along this stretch will have to ensure that their customers dine only within their premises, and are not eating or drinking outside.

But there is no need to rush to go out. You have plenty of time to do so. So please keep your guard up, and continue to stay disciplined and vigilant. 
We are allowing gatherings of not more than 5 people.

If you are dining out, put your masks back on right away after eating. Avoid lingering around at the table and talking without your masks. 
Public officials will be out and about to enforce the rules. But a safe and sustainable Phase 2 re-opening cannot be achieved through rules alone. Some people may even be thinking of ways to outsmart the rules. But in the end, you and your loved ones will end up paying the price.

This means that from Friday onwards, almost all businesses will be able to re-open, be it retail, F&B dining-in or personalised consumer services. The key requirement is that individuals must maintain safe distancing of at least 1 m at all times, and if that’s not feasible (eg when dining at a table), then each group will be limited to a maximum of 5 persons. Sports, gyms, playgrounds, and other public facilities will open, as will similar facilities in condominiums and clubs. Small group gatherings of up to any 5 persons can also resume, and households may receive up to 5 visitors at any time. 
There are a small number of activities that will take more time to resume. These are activities where large numbers of people are likely to come into close contact, often in enclosed spaces and for prolonged periods of time. They include religious services and congregations; large-scale events and venues; and entertainment outlets like bars, clubs and karaoke outlets. We will continue to work with these organisations and business owners on the safe management measures that are needed before they can open.
Phase 2 is a significant step forward in our reopening process. But please do not treat this as a signal to relax and let our guard down. 
Businesses must take the rules seriously. Do not rush to open if you are not ready, because you will be putting your own customers and employees at risk. All of us must continue to exercise individual and social responsibility. There’s no need to rush to go out this weekend. We should continue to limit our close contacts, even if we can now meet in groups.

The key requirement is that individuals must maintain safe distancing of at least 1 m at all times, and if that’s not feasible (eg when dining at a table), then each group will be limited to a maximum of 5 persons. Sports, gyms, playgrounds, and other public facilities will open, as will similar facilities in condominiums and clubs. Small group gatherings of up to any 5 persons can also resume, and households may receive up to 5 visitors at any time. 
There are a small number of activities that will take more time to resume. These are activities where large numbers of people are likely to come into close contact, often in enclosed spaces and for prolonged periods of time. They include religious services and congregations; large-scale events and venues; and entertainment outlets like bars, clubs and karaoke outlets. We will continue to work with these organisations and business owners on the safe management measures that are needed before they can open.
Phase 2 is a significant step forward in our reopening process. But please do not treat this as a signal to relax and let our guard down. 
Businesses must take the rules seriously. Do not rush to open if you are not ready, because you will be putting your own customers and employees at risk. All of us must continue to exercise individual and social responsibility. There’s no need to rush to go out this weekend. We should continue to limit our close contacts, even if we can now meet in groups. As customers, we should also be discerning about the establishments we patronise, and insist on high safety standards everywhere we go.

Let’s continue to work together on this collective journey to achieve a Covid-safe Singapore!"

Our expectations, lifestyles and norms will have to change. All of us - businesses, organisations, and individuals - will have to make adjustments to the way we do things, and some transitions will be difficult.  But as one united people, we will get through this together, and overcome this crisis of our generation.

Where employees can work from home and who were able to do so during the CB, and employers ""insist"" for this group of workers to work from the office, the Govt may wish to  mandate that older workers perhaps aged 50 and above in this category must be allowed to work from home and/or work on rotational basis from home. Remote work  arrangements will be the default for a considerable amount of time, beyond Phase 1, hence some sort of  regulation ought to be put in place. Many employees may not speak up for fear of losing their job and simply comply with the employers instructions to return to the office.",2020-06-05T08:45:38.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CA62WDhHaBs/,2020-06-02T04:36:17.000Z,We have exited the circuit breaker and today’s the first day of the Phase 1 re-opening!

Because of our collective efforts, we can now exit the circuit breaker and resume activities in phases starting from 2 June. 
The first phase of re-opening will be done in a careful and calibrated manner. More Singaporeans will be able to return to work, and students will go back to school. But many restrictions will still be in place. I know some were hoping to be able to go out freely - to start dining out and meeting their friends. Unfortunately, all this will have to wait. 
I hope everyone understands why we have to be cautious. We cannot risk the virus flaring up again. We also must not sacrifice all the efforts that we’ve put in over the last few weeks to bring the outbreak under control. 
Some businesses will remain closed in the first phase. They include retail shops and those offering personalised services. The government will continue to extend support to these businesses and their workers. DPM @hengsweekeat will announce the details of these support measures in Parliament next week. 
We expect to be in Phase 1 for a few weeks. If the infection rate in the community remains low and stable, and the situation in the dormitories remains under control, then we will be able to move to Phase 2, where we will allow social activities and F&B dining in small groups, and re-open more consumer-facing businesses, as well as public spaces and sports facilities. 
So we will need everyone to cooperate and do your part during this first phase of re-opening. Continue to practise good personal hygiene and social responsibility. Let’s stay disciplined and focussed, so that we can allow a broader range of activities to resume in good time."

I hope everyone understands why we have to be cautious. We cannot risk the virus flaring up again. We also must not sacrifice all the efforts that we’ve put in over the last few weeks to bring the outbreak under control. 
Some businesses will remain closed in the first phase. They include retail shops and those offering personalised services. The government will continue to extend support to these businesses and their workers. DPM @hengsweekeat will announce the details of these support measures in Parliament next week. 
We expect to be in Phase 1 for a few weeks. If the infection rate in the community remains low and stable, and the situation in the dormitories remains under control, then we will be able to move to Phase 2, where we will allow social activities and F&B dining in small groups, and re-open more consumer-facing businesses, as well as public spaces and sports facilities. 
So we will need everyone to cooperate and do your part during this first phase of re-opening. Continue to practise good personal hygiene and social responsibility. Let’s stay disciplined and focussed, so that we can allow a broader range of activities to resume in good time."

Because of our collective efforts, we can now exit the circuit breaker and resume activities in phases starting from 2 June. 
The first phase of re-opening will be done in a careful and calibrated manner. More Singaporeans will be able to return to work, and students will go back to school. But many restrictions will still be in place. I know some were hoping to be able to go out freely - to start dining out and meeting their friends. Unfortunately, all this will have to wait. 
I hope everyone understands why we have to be cautious. We cannot risk the virus flaring up again. We also must not sacrifice all the efforts that we’ve put in over the last few weeks to bring the outbreak under control. 
Some businesses will remain closed in the first phase. They include retail shops and those offering personalised services. The government will continue to extend support to these businesses and their workers. DPM @hengsweekeat will announce the details of these support measures in Parliament next week. 
We expect to be in Phase 1 for a few weeks. If the infection rate in the community remains low and stable, and the situation in the dormitories remains under control, then we will be able to move to Phase 2, where we will allow social activities and F&B dining in small groups, and re-open more consumer-facing businesses, as well as public spaces and sports facilities.

We will do so in a very careful and calibrated manner. It won’t simply be a return to life before the circuit breaker. 
For example, in the construction sector, we will only re-start with a few projects and insist on very tight end-to-end safeguards for these projects. The safeguards include requiring all the workers involved in a project to be housed together (instead of being at multiple dormitories); safe distancing measures at the work sites; and periodic testing of the workers (at 2 week intervals). We expect only about 5% of the construction workforce to work on these projects, and will scale up over time as the industry gains confidence and experience with the measures. 
We will apply this same calibrated approach in how we resume normal activities, be it at work, schools, or in our social settings. In other words, don’t expect 100% resumption of activities after 1 June.

You are simply extending the CB for many of our businesses while you allow others to open based on some contact logic.

Now you make us pay the price and announce like the 75% help us a lot!? I don’t mind eating basic meals and not even spending any money but if you destroy my kids future and my hard work for them, I get very angry. What right do you have destroying people’s livelihoods? It’s not just me that is angry but virtually all my close to 100 workers and many many of my colleagues and friends affected.

38,connectingdadots,"Really amazing and hats off to the health workers and the government of Singapore, in the way this crisis  has been handled. As a expat working in the country and having worked in three other countries and travelled to many others. This city country which is home to us now never fails to amaze me. Singapore mortality rate is among the lowest and if you calculate it in percentage terms arguably Lowe than the world average for annual death rates with normal pneumonia, that speaks volumes of the dedication of health workers, their professionalism and the treatment regimen that they seem to have evolved as we battle this pandemic. We are all so proud of you!",2020-05-01T03:36:56.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_oVcJlHrEH/,2020-05-01T03:31:02.000Z,"Over 3,000 healthcare professionals have volunteered so far in our fight against COVID-19.

6,beauty.admirer.lover,"Feedback : (Quote CNA news 6 Apr) "" MOH said 25 more cases are linked to the cluster at S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, which has a total of 88 confirmed cases now.The cluster at Westlite Toh Guan dormitory now has a total of 29 confirmed cases linked to it, after one more case was identified in Monday's update. All 19,800 foreign workers housed at the two dorms would be quarantined in their rooms for the next 14 days, authorities announced on Sunday. "" Analysis : quarantine for 14 days ? This is NOT good enough. I bet Singapore will get worse. If this is the method we use. Study how S. Korea and Taiwan do it. They dont take chances. Look, you have 19800 foreign workers quarantined for 14 days. Day 1 : say detected 5. Day 2 : no symptoms. Day 3. No symptoms. Day 4: detected 25 infected. So these silent 25 could have carried the virus since day 2. So by day 14 : if you released all into public, there will bound to have some that are""silently"" infected with no symptoms that were affected by A from day 1 to B in day 2 then to C D E F in day 5 and XXXXX in day 13....etc. 19800 foreign workers ? Very very serious consequences. Correct way to do it ? Like what S. Korea did. Like what WHO said : Test Test Test. MOH have this chance to test all 19800 now that they are being quarantined. Just do it. For the safety of all locals. If you dont test and released them all after day 14, and say 5% are silent carriers (about 900 infected pax released into the public), I think it will be catastropic for Singapore. Dear Minister, you are working hard, no doubt about it. Aprreciate that. But please think twice about the current strategy MOH is deploying. Is really not good enough. Especially for these huge group of 19800 pax. Thank you. @leehsienloong@gankimyong@ongyekung @teocheehean @ng.chee.meng @khawboonwan Note : 19800 in 2 dorms ? Singapore hopefully can learn something from the Cruise Ships case studies / experiences. They were released after quarantine with NO symptoms. Afterwhich ? Many were found infected after released into the public. So answer / solution is : Test Test Test. Test all 19800. S. Korea and Taiwan really do a good job as what we seen so far.",2020-04-06T17:37:13.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-pCtBInl6I/,2020-04-06T13:35:10.000Z,"Visited Changi Airport with Minister @gankimyong last week to meet our frontline workers, from immigration to healthcare, security and transport.

7,beauty.admirer.lover,"Feedback to the Ministerial Taskforce : Remember this. Wuhan started with a few. Then a few hundred. Then a few thousand. Then tens of thousands. And a few hundred / a few thousands infected China nationals then went all over the world. And now ? More than 1.2 mil infected. UK, Italy, Spain, France, USA the same stories. It all started with a few, then a few hundred. And then ? Exploded. Out of Control. Like Italy. Like Spain and etc. Singapore started with a few. Now ? More than a thousand. There were ""many overlook"" Singapore Govt made. One of them : letting in tens of thousands of Malaysians before Malaysia borders lockdown. My feel is? Singapore Govt tried to balance $ making (aka economy) with virus crisis management. So a bit here . A bit there. Some good measures here. Some loopholes there. In the end ? We get to ""nowhere"". Is our economy intact by ""this balancing act"" ? No. Because is serious now, we have this ""circuit breaker"" (much like a lockdown). Our economy went from bad (in Jan) to worse (in Apr) . My frank assessment is this : what ""saved"" Singapore from ""explosion phase"" is : our very good healthcare systems. BUT bear in mind, once the community spread get out of control, from a thousand can easily shoot up to tens of thousands. Touchwood. Should that happen, not even Singapore World Class healthcare systems can save Singapore residents. Singapore would be like Italy. Spain. USA. I am sad, worried, very disappointed. Yes we have good Govt. But I feel our Govt was ""too complacent"". Initially our Govt countered it like SARS. Flashback (CNA 1 Feb) : Dr Brenda Ang : “We have a few SARS veterans here. One of the things I said at the first briefings (for the Wuhan coronavirus) was don’t worry, we have been through this before. We can handle it.”“I saw Singapore's first SARS case, I’m still alive and standing,” she said. On how widespread the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to be, Dr Ang said current literature suggests that even people who are exposed to the virus do not necessarily get infected.“It probably isn’t that infectious, (even though) people are wearing surgical masks all over the place.” (UNQUOTE). @leehsienloong@gankimyong@ongyekung",2020-04-06T18:33:31.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-pCtBInl6I/,2020-04-06T13:35:10.000Z,"Visited Changi Airport with Minister @gankimyong last week to meet our frontline workers, from immigration to healthcare, security and transport.

21,beauty.admirer.lover,"FEEDBACK/SHARING OF WORLD NEWS : latest news (CNN) : (QUOTE) Austria ""The wearing of face masks in supermarkets will become compulsory from Wednesday, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced.''As of the moment these masks are handed out in front of the supermarkets and it will become compulsory to wear them in supermarkets'', Kurz said, adding that ''the goal is in the medium term to not only wear these masks in supermarkets but also more generally wherever people have contact with each other'' "" . (UNQUOTE) It is our Govt's job to do it (ensuring enough masks for the people to wear in public e.g. in crowded mrts and buses). Whether is it buying from China or setting up a factory to produce masks, just do it. Wearing masks definitely is effective in the overall containment efforts. You cannot have 1 good measure in say foodcourts distancing control and then ""overlook or fail"" in another area : e.g. mrt , buses. If so, the overall containment efforts will not be as effective. @leehsienloong@lawrencewongst@khawboonwan @gankimyong @ongyekung @teocheehean So in my opinion, our Govt have done a good job in many areas but ""overlook, fail or loophole"" in other areas.

8,asl0309,"Dear minister Wong thanks for your hard work. But I must say it isn’t a good idea to have the Singaporean/resident returnees serve their SHN at home. I just saw a CNA clip - reporter was doing interview with a pair of sisters who HAD just returned from the UK at their home :(( This is a prime eg why a quarantine at home won’t work. Some people are just not going to abide by the rules to stay inside their rooms at all times (except to use shower/toilet) the moment they reach home from the airport. Members of the family are inevitably exposed who then go on to infect others in the public. We should follow HK , send returnees to govt facilities. We did that with our Wuhan returnees so why not for this group since Europe now is the new epicenter?",2020-03-20T13:18:34.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B98bp79nGph/,2020-03-20T05:47:22.000Z,"Today’s Straits Times has a good graphic to illustrate the underlying reasons for the recent rise in our infected cases.

9,beauty.admirer.lover,"LOA is not = Stay Home Notice. For those travel returnees on LOA, if they are infected and they go out to the public community, e.g. packed supermakets , packed hawker centres, packed mcdonald's, packed malls, there is a likelihood of an ""Uncontrollable BreakOut"" caused by these travel returnees on LOA who may be infected. If a hawker doing say popiah is being infected by the infected, and if she continues to roll her popiahs with some mild symptoms, and unaware consumers eat them, the chance of infection is there. If that happens, all these contact tracing apps will not be that relevant anymore. If Singapore becomes the next Italy, it will be ""too late"". Singapore will then be in a very disastrous situation. Economy will be 10X maybe 100X worse than the current bad situation. Bear in mind this : Singapore society is closely compact and one of the world's highest density population. Can you afford to close down all mrts and bus servicces like what China did. We must take a pre-emptive approach in anticipation of ""the worst possible scenario"" and instead of ""let's see how then react"" . The latter was what Italy , many European countries did. They waited to see how to react. When the crisis exploded suddenly and situation out of control, then they react. But, it was ""too late"" That is  fire fighting approach, not fire prevention. I worry a lot. For families, friends, fellow Singaporeans. Reason : Indonesia. I guess Indonesia will be the next Italy due to their ""reported behaviour e.g. attend large groupings even when their Govt bans them"" as well as ""their Govt citing high costs this high costs that even for Covid-19 testing for many of their potential patients"". Once Indonesia explodes like Italy, I dont think they can do containment as well as ""exploded Korea"". Singapore being its closest neighbor will be in a very very serious, dangerous and risky situation. Will our Govt take our feedback seriously ? We feedback not to curry favors (unlike many instagrammers), get likes attention and so forth.

12,asl0309,"Dear Minister Wong, I’m very glad to know that returnees from the UK and USA will have to serve SHN at designated hotels starting on Thursday (although it’d have been better to apply to everyone). Though it’s late, it’s the right move forward. Everyone should be treated as a suspect case and be tested upon arrival, and not just those who present symptoms at the border (which I believe is the protocol now). Mass testing has proven to be the tipping point for South Korea. We need to nip it in the bud - test, isolate, treat. Time is crucial, we can’t afford to wait for symptoms to show up then have patients present themselves at the hospital. If we can gift the Philippines with 3000 test kits surely we can do it for our fellow returnees? Also, at this point we should make it mandatory to wear mask. Wearing one is essential in the fight -  just look at China, Taiwan, SK, HK. “Wear one only when you’re sick” is not medically correct at this point in time. Experts in China have said people shed virus even before symptoms are present. Only by wearing a mask can we protect ourselves and people around us. I know there’s a shortage of masks in Singapore which makes it unfortunate but we can use cloth recyclable masks or any home made ones. When everyone wears one, it doesn’t matter if one’s quality is better than another. It really has helped those countries in containment. That’s certain. But to tell people that healthy people don’t need to wear one is just plain wrong, pardon me for saying. I’m writing as a concerned Singaporean - we must look at the above countries and learn from them. My next worry is when Malaysia ends her lockdown and thousands of people start to cross the causeway into Singapore... since it’s been proven with our recent imported cases that most don’t show symptoms at the border (meaning temperature can no longer be used as a gauge), how then? Thank you and the team once again for the hard work. We appreciate it and to the frontliners who are doing such a incredible job , it’s going to be a much tougher fight but together we shall overcome.",2020-03-24T13:00:27.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B98bp79nGph/,2020-03-20T05:47:22.000Z,"Today’s Straits Times has a good graphic to illustrate the underlying reasons for the recent rise in our infected cases.
