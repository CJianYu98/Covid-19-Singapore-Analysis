It’s holding a heart, which speaks to the culture of care that the school focuses on. Since last year, Bowen has put in place a school-wide buddy system where some students take on the role of peer support leaders (PSLs) to help support their fellow students. These PSLs undergo training and are themselves supported by teachers who help guide them and navigate issues that may be quite complex. Peer support and relationships are an important part of CCE 2021, to build a caring and enabling school environment.

It was good to hear from some of the PSLs, who shared their experiences with me. They told me there was some social awkwardness when school reopened after the Circuit Breaker. For some, there was a more long lasting impact. Sec 4 PSL Kai Bin noticed that a classmate was having trouble focusing in class, often falling asleep and not submitting work. He requested for his form teacher to seat him next to this classmate so he could help his classmate along. Kai Bin rounded off his sharing with some good insight – he said that while his classmate eventually did well for the end of year exams, more importantly, his classmate developed a more positive mindset about learning and coming to school. I couldn’t agree more. 

Glad to see students stepping forward to do their part for their school community and fellow students! #backtoschool"

Met some P5 and 6 students who shared their #CircuitBreaker experience with me. They didn’t like it and much preferred going to school. But they also learnt to make the most of the situation. Some picked up new skills, while others helped out with household chores. They spent more time with family members and learnt to appreciate the important things in life. They showed adaptability and resilience and these are the traits that will put them in good stead for the future. Very proud of our young ones!"

We’re doing more remote meetings with our colleagues and realising that we can be just as productive at home as we have been in the office. The circuit breaker has showed us that we can work effectively in different ways.
We must now embrace working from home as the new norm. So even as more Singaporeans return to work during Phase 1 of the reopening plans, we expect the majority of the workforce to continue to work from home. 
This is why we have imposed the following requirement on employers after 1 June: your staff should return to work only if they need specialised equipment and machinery that cannot be accessed from home, or if they need to fulfil legal requirements (eg to complete contracts or transactions). On that basis, we expect most employees working in an office setting to continue working from home as they are presently doing. 
Many employers and managers will need to adjust their mindsets to this new normal. It’s no longer about having all your staff physically present at work. Even if they have to be on site, consider if they really need to do so every day. You could have hybrid arrangements where your employees work from home several days a week. 
For those who absolutely need to be in the office, employers must ensure that the work environment is safe (eg maintain good ventilation and high hygiene standards, and have officers seated apart etc) and offer them staggered work hours. 
All these workplace measures are critical in our fight against Covid-19 - they will reduce the need for daily movement of people, and minimise the risks of the virus flaring up again."

17,kenkopite,"@lawrencewongst Mr Wong, I respect you the most out of all the ministers who make up the Covid taskforce, and am generally assured with you heading the team. However  the key question to ask here is - does it make sense to virtually lockdown the entire country for extended number of weeks, when we have seen clearly that the average number of community cases is only from single digits to the high teens for awhile now? Singaporeans and businesses alike have been on the receiving end of the strict measures put in place, through entirely no fault of theirs. While the foreign worker dormitories oversight is unfortunate, trying to overcompensate for an earlier mistake with excessively draconian measures is not the way to go. The risk and reward trade-offs here are clearly unbalanced.",2020-05-15T07:42:57.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAKvnP5nV4J/,2020-05-14T12:13:56.000Z,"We are making progress in controlling the outbreak.

That’s why we are stepping up our precautions at residential care homes serving the elderly. We are putting in place tighter infection controls and prevention practices. We are requiring all resident-facing staff to stay onsite or at designated hotels during the circuit breaker period. We are also testing all 30k residents and staff of these homes - not just once, but on a periodic basis every two weeks. 
At the same time, all of us can do our part to protect the seniors in our families. Remind them to stay home as much as possible and minimise contacts with others.

5,jazreel6,"Sir lawrence, you have always have my respect throughout this covid fight, and i and my family has been in this fight by doing all that is required of us dutifully in order not to weigh on our healthcare frontline. We are appreciative and grateful for all the great decisions so far. However, i am indeed shocked that in the last few days your team has said to protect the most vulnerable group in nursing homes as they will not be able to survive well if the virus hits them. Why then is MOH allowing covid patients to be housed in Renci community where there is so many levels of vulnerable residents and also patients who need to come for weekly kidney dialysis? These group has bodies that cannot take a second round of strike against them. Could you be kind and just and not remove this post and instead look into this matter, and give it serious considerations if its a right decision, and if this contradicts the stand to protect the most vulnerable ones among us? They have family who loves them till their last breath. This last breath is already a vulnerable last one and one wrong move will not be a just a number, it will be shattered family hearts. We sincerely hope you will look into this. We understand bed crunches issues, but please underdtand us, we the family of the vulnerable residents, need to seek ur help to protect the most vulnerable ones. A 1% outbreak might become their 99% death. To house covid newr healthy ones is acceptable, to house near critically vulnerable ones is a decision that is not wise at all.",2020-05-09T12:33:33.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_9a9seHtdg/,2020-05-09T08:03:22.000Z,"Seniors are significantly more at risk from Covid-19.

We must hunker down and push harder to break the transmission chain decisively. 
First, we call on everyone to minimise movement. Stay home as much as possible. If you need to go out to buy food or groceries, do so by yourself.  If you need to go out to exercise, do so by yourself and in your neighbourhood. This is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones.
Second, we will tighten access to popular areas where people are still gathering, like wet markets and supermarkets, so that safe distancing measures can be better implemented. For a start we will introduce a new control measure in selected popular wet markets to limit entry to alternate days.
Third we will close more work premises and tighten the list of essential services. The aim is to reduce the number of essential workers still out and about, so that we can minimise movement and interactions. Additional requirements will also be put in place to ensure that these workers and their employers uphold safe distancing measures at their workplaces. 
We will implement the above measures from now till 4 May. Beyond that we will have to extend the circuit breaker for another four weeks till 1 June. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and if we are able to bring down our community infection numbers decisively, then we can consider easing some of the measures gradually. 
I thank all Singaporeans and residents who have made tremendous efforts and sacrifices to observe the circuit breaker measures so far. We are asking more from everyone now.

First, we call on everyone to minimise movement. Stay home as much as possible. If you need to go out to buy food or groceries, do so by yourself.  If you need to go out to exercise, do so by yourself and in your neighbourhood. This is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones.
Second, we will tighten access to popular areas where people are still gathering, like wet markets and supermarkets, so that safe distancing measures can be better implemented. For a start we will introduce a new control measure in selected popular wet markets to limit entry to alternate days.
Third we will close more work premises and tighten the list of essential services. The aim is to reduce the number of essential workers still out and about, so that we can minimise movement and interactions. Additional requirements will also be put in place to ensure that these workers and their employers uphold safe distancing measures at their workplaces. 
We will implement the above measures from now till 4 May. Beyond that we will have to extend the circuit breaker for another four weeks till 1 June.

First, we call on everyone to minimise movement. Stay home as much as possible. If you need to go out to buy food or groceries, do so by yourself.  If you need to go out to exercise, do so by yourself and in your neighbourhood. This is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones.
Second, we will tighten access to popular areas where people are still gathering, like wet markets and supermarkets, so that safe distancing measures can be better implemented. For a start we will introduce a new control measure in selected popular wet markets to limit entry to alternate days.
Third we will close more work premises and tighten the list of essential services. The aim is to reduce the number of essential workers still out and about, so that we can minimise movement and interactions. Additional requirements will also be put in place to ensure that these workers and their employers uphold safe distancing measures at their workplaces. 
We will implement the above measures from now till 4 May. Beyond that we will have to extend the circuit breaker for another four weeks till 1 June. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and if we are able to bring down our community infection numbers decisively, then we can consider easing some of the measures gradually. 
I thank all Singaporeans and residents who have made tremendous efforts and sacrifices to observe the circuit breaker measures so far. We are asking more from everyone now. We are mindful of the impact, and the government will continue to help employers and workers through the extended circuit breaker period.

Second, we will tighten access to popular areas where people are still gathering, like wet markets and supermarkets, so that safe distancing measures can be better implemented. For a start we will introduce a new control measure in selected popular wet markets to limit entry to alternate days.
Third we will close more work premises and tighten the list of essential services. The aim is to reduce the number of essential workers still out and about, so that we can minimise movement and interactions. Additional requirements will also be put in place to ensure that these workers and their employers uphold safe distancing measures at their workplaces. 
We will implement the above measures from now till 4 May. Beyond that we will have to extend the circuit breaker for another four weeks till 1 June. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and if we are able to bring down our community infection numbers decisively, then we can consider easing some of the measures gradually. 
I thank all Singaporeans and residents who have made tremendous efforts and sacrifices to observe the circuit breaker measures so far. We are asking more from everyone now. We are mindful of the impact, and the government will continue to help employers and workers through the extended circuit breaker period. Ultimately this is a test of our unity, resilience and resolve. If we all do our part, we can stamp out the virus and overcome this together."

I continue to receive a lot of feedback on the measures. I try to read all of them although I am unable to reply to them personally. Some say that it’s only a partial lockdown and prefer a full lockdown, which they think will be more effective. Others say the current measures are already too restrictive and causing mental and social problems for themselves and their families. 
I understand that there are some who genuinely find it hard to adjust. We will do our best to support them. But this is a public health crisis, and we have to do what is right and necessary to protect Singaporeans. In theory, we could keep most places open, so long as safe distancing measures are strictly adhered to. But increasingly we see that this is hard to achieve. So tougher measures are necessary. Yesterday, we closed off selected areas in our parks and nature reserves. Today we will be closing all beaches in Singapore.
Remember the bottom line is that all of us must drastically reduce our contact with others for the circuit breaker to be effective.  And we have to sustain this effort not just for a few days but till the end of the month at least. So stay home as much as possible. If you absolutely must go out (eg for food or groceries), keep a safe distance from others, wear a mask, and go home once you are done.

An area you task team might wanna look at are the home based salons offering beauty related services - many are still openly touting April promotions on IG. (one of the earliest patients of covid 19 in Singapore was a home based hairdresser). Perhaps a hotline could be set up so citizens can report non-compliance behavior? Also regulate one per household to do grocery shopping (same person always). Still a common sight to see couple with young kids in tow or couple behaving like they are on a date at the supermarkets. If it’s just one person - shopping would be done in a jiffy for sure. Got to put a tighter rein on some F/Bs. eg. Bubble tea outlets (essential??) which tend to attract crowds just hanging around while waiting for their drinks.",2020-04-12T12:59:00.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-10Mw7n659/,2020-04-11T12:38:33.000Z,"It has been almost a week since the circuit breaker kicked in.

13,hendrysetiawan777,"Sir, it's been a chaos and severe week since the circuit breaker locked down with surges in COVID19 infections and quarantines  in foreign migrant workers dormitories in Singapore...? May I make  humble suggestion to let HDB rents out all their empty old HDB rental blocks islanwide to the construction companies to house foreign migrant workers after COVID19 is over...? (After all, all these HDB rental blocks were more than 40 years old and a lot of them are empty blocks like in Tanglin Halt, Beo Crescent, Boon Lay, Bedok & etc...) This is coz we knew very well all the dormitories are super crowded with 10-12 persons in one room (without toilet and kitchen inside the room) and likewise we knew very well most dormitories are super unhygienic in Singapore despite there are dormitories caretakers, management and securities to check on the dormitories...?",2020-04-14T08:12:58.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-10Mw7n659/,2020-04-11T12:38:33.000Z,"It has been almost a week since the circuit breaker kicked in.

But this is a public health crisis, and we have to do what is right and necessary to protect Singaporeans. In theory, we could keep most places open, so long as safe distancing measures are strictly adhered to. But increasingly we see that this is hard to achieve. So tougher measures are necessary. Yesterday, we closed off selected areas in our parks and nature reserves. Today we will be closing all beaches in Singapore.
Remember the bottom line is that all of us must drastically reduce our contact with others for the circuit breaker to be effective.  And we have to sustain this effort not just for a few days but till the end of the month at least. So stay home as much as possible. If you absolutely must go out (eg for food or groceries), keep a safe distance from others, wear a mask, and go home once you are done.

8,beauty.admirer.lover,"******IMPORTANT REMINDER*****: 14 Day Quarantine for 19800 Foreign  Workers Not Enough. Many infected have no/mild symptoms. Do Read this CNA news link https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-singapore-couple-uk-ncid-mild-symptoms-12606966 : (QUOTE)""“There was no fever, no flu, no anything,” she said. “He only had a cough … a kind of cough once in a couple of hours. For me, when I had my flu, I couldn’t smell and taste, so I thought that was normal for somebody who had just recovered from the flu.”While serving her Stay Home Notice after returning from the UK, what was perplexing for the wife was that her sense of taste and smell still had not returned.“It was frustrating because my body felt well, but I just couldn’t smell and taste,” she said. “At that point our bodies felt perfectly fine, but we didn’t know there was a virus inside of us.""(UNQUOTE) Our taskforce cannot be ""too complacent"". 19800 foreign workers quarantined in 2 dorms ? It is similar to those quarantined in cruise ships. Study those cruise ships cases.  If these 19800 workers are released into the public after 14 Days Quarantine, there may be many ""silent virus carriers"". This would be potentially catastropic. Singapore 1 month ""circuit breaker"" would then be fruitless. Learn from South Korea. They are doing a lot of testing. Think they tested more than 200,000 church members after the church ""widespread explosion"". So, do test these 19800 foreign workers and many more other dorms clusters . Your Approach should be : Take No Chances. Spare No Efforts. And dont be ""too cost calculative"" if say costs is your main concern to test more than 20000 workers. You saved $millions in costs but touchwood, if Singapore exploded like Italy because of ""these costs savings"", Singpore stand to lose $billons in the ""prolonged collapse of Singapore economy"". And Singaporeans and local residents lives and health are worth $trillions if you want to calculate that way. I hope The Elections is not our Govt 1st priorities right now. Not the time to spend too much time, energy, resources on The Election.

The Taskforce has decided to put in place a nation-wide circuit breaker starting for at least a month, starting 7 April, to slow the spread of the virus. 
Under these stringent measures, all workplace premises other than those providing essential services or operating as part of global supply chains will have to close. For these closed premises, the work activities can continue only if all their employees work from home. Schools and IHLs will also be closed and will shift to full home-based learning.

Supermarkets and F&B outlets will remain open. For all F&B outlets, including hawker centres and coffeeshops, dining in will not be allowed - so you can only order food for delivery or takeout.

Essentially, we must all abide by these basic rules:
- Stay at Home. Avoid interactions with anyone outside of your family members who are already living with you
- Go out only if you have to do essential things (like going to work, buying groceries, or doing your daily exercise)
- If you have to go out, and cannot avoid close contact with others, wear a mask.

9,goodnight.moon2020,"Dear Minister Wong, thank you and the team for your hard work. I’d like to add if I may - that is to make mask wearing mandatory when we are out. This is crucial especially in enclosed setting like buses, trains. It should not be a choice, left to the people to decide since the govt stand is - wear one if you can’t avoid crowds. There will always be  a group of people who don’t or refuses to wear one for their own reasons. Wearing one is protecting OTHERS  from one’s droplets from coughing, sneezing, talking. We should all and rightfully so, be concerned at the rise of local unlinked cases and the asymptomatic carriers lurking amongst us. We can’t afford to have a tiny chance that some of these people could be asymptomatic and unknowingly be spreading the virus. Now that every resident will get a reusable mask, there is no reason not to mask up when out. I hope people will change the selfish mindset - cloth mask ≠ ineffective (against virus) therefore I won’t wear.  When Malaysia ends her lockdown we will see an influx of people coming in. Temperature scanning can not longer be trusted as a gauge to weed out the infected ones. We need everyone to wear a mask, on top of social distancing measures to further boost containment. Anyone not wearing one should be refused entry to Singapore. This rule should also be applied to trains and buses and crowded places. The seniors, and the sick are the most vulnerable group of people - we must all do what we can as citizens to protect them and to safeguard our healthcare system. Have a restful Sunday with your family Sir. SG United.",2020-04-05T06:56:24.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-hTohdHrPv/,2020-04-03T13:29:11.000Z,"<Nation-wide Circuit Breaker>

The Taskforce has decided to put in place a nation-wide circuit breaker starting for at least a month, starting 7 April, to slow the spread of the virus. 
Under these stringent measures, all workplace premises other than those providing essential services or operating as part of global supply chains will have to close. For these closed premises, the work activities can continue only if all their employees work from home. Schools and IHLs will also be closed and will shift to full home-based learning.

Supermarkets and F&B outlets will remain open. For all F&B outlets, including hawker centres and coffeeshops, dining in will not be allowed - so you can only order food for delivery or takeout.

Essentially, we must all abide by these basic rules:
- Stay at Home. Avoid interactions with anyone outside of your family members who are already living with you
- Go out only if you have to do essential things (like going to work, buying groceries, or doing your daily exercise)
- If you have to go out, and cannot avoid close contact with others, wear a mask.

18,mightyaphrodite101,"While the circuit breaker is in place, we should also implement universal testing (a local lab has devised a 5min rest with a 95% accuracy rate) and round up all Covid infected persons to maximise the effectiveness of cutting off viral transmission within the community... then once the month is up, we should legally mandate (and strictly enforce) all noses and mouths to be covered in public (once u step outta your house for no matter how long and for no matter what purpose)... this will enable us to embrace both defensive (semi-lockdown) and offensive (testing) measures in tandem to combat Covid so we can resume a greater semblance of domestic economic normalcy as soon as possible... the living conditions of our FWs also need urgent and significant improvement bcoz we're only as strong as our weakest link, and right now the FW dorms are looking pretty dodgy...",2020-04-08T00:44:20.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-hTohdHrPv/,2020-04-03T13:29:11.000Z,"<Nation-wide Circuit Breaker>

Elderly is highly vulnerable to the virus and they should be protected. I am still seeing elderly working in hawker center and food venues.

I foresee tt supermarkets n wet markets ( narrow space n lots of interactions) will still be seeing some crowd there during this period. Maybe we shd be reinforced ppl to wear masks n also control the number of ppl by only allowing 1-2 persons in an household. Also food deliverers n travelers in public transport shd wear masks too.

The Taskforce has decided to put in place a nation-wide circuit breaker starting for at least a month, starting 7 April, to slow the spread of the virus. 
Under these stringent measures, all workplace premises other than those providing essential services or operating as part of global supply chains will have to close. For these closed premises, the work activities can continue only if all their employees work from home. Schools and IHLs will also be closed and will shift to full home-based learning.

Supermarkets and F&B outlets will remain open. For all F&B outlets, including hawker centres and coffeeshops, dining in will not be allowed - so you can only order food for delivery or takeout.

Essentially, we must all abide by these basic rules:
- Stay at Home. Avoid interactions with anyone outside of your family members who are already living with you
- Go out only if you have to do essential things (like going to work, buying groceries, or doing your daily exercise)
- If you have to go out, and cannot avoid close contact with others, wear a mask.

6,beauty.admirer.lover,"Dear Minister, I give my suggestion here as you are the Minister co-chair for the Covid-19 taskforce. It also shows I trust your capabilities (though I strongly diagree with your HDB policy which does not align with our great Lee Kuan Yew's promise to common Singaporeans that HDB will be our main appeciative asset. Fact is : it is most Singaporeans ""main asset"". Imho, your policy only benefits the upper class who holds private properties assets) Straight to the point. My suggestion : our Govt next move to tackle the Covid-19 crisis is to have better, stricter guidelines and checks on our food industries and imported food products (from Epi Centers such as Italy, China, Korea) and especially Malaysia. NEA should level up on this. NEA should deploy checks on big large scale central kitchens in Singapore to peridically check on the production staff. E.g. a central bakery employing hundreds of production workers doing cakes production if they are not highly regulated , guided, checked to be safe, any infected food production worker may become ""a super spreader"" through food distribution, sales, consumption. Imagine an infected worker coughed on a cake, cake is then eaten by a few. Would  that spread virus? It is NEA job to enhance food safety assurance. Thank you. *note : I care  that's why I spent time to feedback and to give some suggestions.

7,beauty.admirer.lover,"Dear Minister, thank you for your hard work as an active member of the Ministerial Task Force for the Covid-19 crisis. Appreciate that. Understand our Govt are taking some measures to curb foreigners knowing/suspecting they have Covid-19 but still intentionally ""dumped themselves into Singapore"" putting many locals (especially those working in airlines, airport, transportation and etc) at high exposure risks. Previously their main motivation in doing so was ""free medical"" Now MOH had changed this to charge them wef 7 Mar. But these infected Indonesians  are still coming and dump themselves into Singapore. Their motivation now? Perhaps is Singapore perceived world class healthcare. Perhaps is Indonesia counterpart ""simply do not care as much"" attitude. So are the Indonesian authorities enouraging the infected indonesians to come to Singapore for Covid-19 treatment? If so, it is easy job for them isnt it? Shift their responsibility to Singapore. Just look at this new case. Case 212: indonesian had pneumonia on Mar 9. Came to Singapore on Mar 13. Question : how many innocent people is he going to infect ? The air stewardess? the customs staff ? The airport staff ? The taxi driver ? The hotel staff ?

14,beauty.admirer.lover,"Dear Minister, good afternoon and thank you for the hard work in the tackling of the Covid-19 crisis. My feedback and suggestion : What Malaysia did was the correct move ~ the lockdown. This will help them to do containment to avoid becoming the next Italy. And Singapore ? Honestly, I am worried. If our Govt is to do things 'a bit here, a bit there"", Singapore may become the next Italy ? Will Singapore only act aggressively when that scenario happens ? Why I am worried ? Simple reason : Indonesia. Quote CNA news : ""Indonesians seek to get tested for COVID-19 as tally rises; govt says unnecessary to test everyone"" click the link for the full (""very scary"") story.  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-oronavirus-covid-19-tests-unnecessary-everyone-govt-12551074 1. Indonesia have a huge population 2. Indonesia is just next door neighbor. They can easily access to Singapore by ferry via Batam, Bintan and by plane. 3. But CNA news shows that Indonesia Govt ""had failed in many areas"" in their fight against Covid-19. Many Indonesians expressed disappointment in their Govt efforts. So when they have no confidence, where do they go to ? Singapore. They cannot go to Malaysia right now (lockdown). So Singapore. Even without Malaysia lockdown, their 1st choice would be ? Singapore.  What does that mean ? Singapore is in high risk and danger of becoming the next Italy. Now we know China aggressive, decisive, extreme measures : the lockdown in Jan were necessary and the correct move. We can compare situations now. Europe vs China. China is doing a better job in the containment efforts. As for Singapore, schools are going to reopen on 23 Mar. Singapore are still ""open doors"" for business. SIA  will manage to get that few $ business. Efficient ? If planes are not flying at full capacities ? Indonesians will try all their best to get into Singapore for their Covid-19 testings and treatments as their Govt seems to ""have disappointed them"". This is very worrisome.

Read : JAKARTA: Mr Fachri Muchtar developed a cough and had difficulty breathing after staying in a packed lodging in Jakarta’s Old Town for an event in early March.He visited a referral hospital for COVID-19 in Jakarta on Sunday (Mar 15) and was immediately taken to the emergency ward for a blood test and X-ray. The 21-year-old university student was then led to a decontamination room with five other people, who were all coughing.By evening, his test results came back and he was told that he was a COVID-19 suspect patient.“I was placed in another room with five other people. There were only three beds, so I had to sit in a wheelchair for the entire night.“I was only given a bed the next morning,” he told CNA. Mr Muchtar waited until the afternoon before he was tested for COVID-19. “A cotton bud-like device was inserted into my nose to take a sample of my mucus,” he explained.He was told to go home and self-quarantine before returning to the hospital again on Tuesday afternoon for the second swab test.Mr Muchtar was among the 1,592 people who were tested for COVID-19 in Indonesia as of Wednesday, according to statistics on the Health Ministry’s website.National spokesperson for COVID-19 Achmad Yurianto said on Tuesday that the government is equipped with 10,000 test kits.The number of laboratories to test COVID-19 will also be increased to at least 12 nationwide next week from the existing four, he added Just two weeks ago - when Indonesia reported its first COVID-19 cases - only one laboratory in Jakarta was allowed to conduct such tests for the entire country.As the number of cases rose - the current tally stood at 277 with 19 deaths - worried Indonesians showed up at the referral hospitals, hoping to get tested for COVID-19.Most have their symptoms checked and were turned away without taking the swab tests, leading to confusion and complaints ...(to be continued)",2020-03-19T08:49:23.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9mHajgncWf/,2020-03-11T13:47:13.000Z,Travel plans to Japan disrupted by COVID-19?

However, Mr Yurianto, the government spokesperson, explained on Tuesday that not everyone can get swabbed for COVID-19, and only doctors can recommend if a patient should be tested. Many patients have expressed frustration that they did not qualify for COVID-19 testing.Their worries were compounded by a perceived lack of transparency surrounding coronavirus cases in Indonesia.Ms Karoline Sinaga, 30, went to a hospital on Mar 3 when she developed a mild fever following her return from South Korea, one of the countries badly hit by the pandemic, in late February.She was offered a “COVID-19 package” consisting of a chest X-ray and a blood test, but not the COVID-19 swab.“I asked why I didn’t get the swab test and they replied saying that the COVID-19 package only has these tests,” she told CNA. A health expert from think tank ThinkWell Global said that it is reasonable for the government and hospitals to only conduct swab tests on potentially positive COVID-19 patients.Mr Hasbullah Thabrany told CNA that it is inefficient to test everyone.“The cost is expensive, and it may cause people who have a high chance of having the disease to not being able to get tested,” he said, adding that this is about managing limited resources.Mr Yurianto, the government’s spokesman for COVID-19, has urged people to self-isolate at home if they only display mild symptoms. (Unquote)Means ? Many Indonesians (suspecting or knowing they have Covid-19) will try ""all their means and ways"" to try to get into Singapore for tests and/or treaments. And we know anything ""is possible or do-able in Indonesia"" Are their health declarations ""100% fool-proof"" ? My guess is : most will go to Batam to get into Singapore by ferries.

18,beauty.admirer.lover,"Dear Minister, good afternoon. Feedback : Why are Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as Macau faring better than other cities in tackling against the Covid-19 Crisis ? My guess : M A S K S . That's right. Almost everyone is encouraged to wear masks. So what happens when they do that ? Those who are infected or unaware they are affected covered themselves with masks thus reducing the risks of transmission. And those not infected also wear masks makes it a "" double protection "". We cannot adopt a ""self-deceiving"" concept that asking everyone to wear masks will not help as much simply because we do not have enough masks or could not produce our own masks. Wearing masks does help. If not, why 1 minister said if we run out of masks, medical staff may not work? It simply means masks help the medical staff to protect themselves against the Covid-19. Or wearing masks is better than not wearing any. So after so much talk, main point ? Main Point : we study Macau Hong Kong Taiwan and we can gauge that encouraging everyong to wear masks help in the containment. Our Govt next task ? Quickly assemble a large scale production line that can produce our own masks at about 5 mil units per day rate. Any excess we can sell, export or donate to other countries who want them. By doing so, Singapore may also create some jobs for those who will work at the masks factory.

Over the last 24 hours, we have seen an accelerating trend of infection among the population of Chinese nationals from Hubei. That’s why we have decided to take additional measures today to limit the risks from Hubei travellers. 
We will quarantine recent travellers from Hubei who are still in Singapore, as well as returning residents/long-term pass holders with recent travel history to Hubei. We will also take actions to curb new visitors with recent travel history to Hubei or with PRC passports issued in Hubei. 
We have a comprehensive plan with contingencies for different scenarios. These measures are part of our plans. Given the accelerating trends and risk levels, we’ve decided to activate them now. 
We have to be mindful that the situation is fluid, with new information coming out from China every day, and with our risk assessments being updated constantly. So we will monitor closely and adjust our posture day by day. We are now taking stricter measure against Hubei travelers. If there is evidence of community spread in other Chinese cities or provinces, we will update our measures accordingly. 
There is so far no evidence of community spread in Singapore. So our actions are aimed at containment - to reduce the risk of such community spread. We will continue with our approach of vigilant monitoring and swift actions to protect Singaporeans."

14,benlawlah,"This is a unique crisis and unfortunately there are little experience that can be drawn upon. The virus spreads quickly and it would be too late if actions and decisions are taken when the evidence of local spread emerges. In the face of this challenge, I believe Singaporeans are not as bothered to take the helicopter view how draconian measures will impact the economy. On the contrary, these extreme but brave decisions will present to us Singaporeans the comfort that our leaders (and 4G leaders) are defending their citizens at all costs. We hope the government will err and over react in such instance. Singaporeans will be delighted. The virus runs ahead of decisions that are made post evidence.

Over the last 24 hours, we have seen an accelerating trend of infection among the population of Chinese nationals from Hubei. That’s why we have decided to take additional measures today to limit the risks from Hubei travellers. 
We will quarantine recent travellers from Hubei who are still in Singapore, as well as returning residents/long-term pass holders with recent travel history to Hubei. We will also take actions to curb new visitors with recent travel history to Hubei or with PRC passports issued in Hubei. 
We have a comprehensive plan with contingencies for different scenarios. These measures are part of our plans. Given the accelerating trends and risk levels, we’ve decided to activate them now. 
We have to be mindful that the situation is fluid, with new information coming out from China every day, and with our risk assessments being updated constantly. So we will monitor closely and adjust our posture day by day. We are now taking stricter measure against Hubei travelers. If there is evidence of community spread in other Chinese cities or provinces, we will update our measures accordingly. 
There is so far no evidence of community spread in Singapore. So our actions are aimed at containment - to reduce the risk of such community spread. We will continue with our approach of vigilant monitoring and swift actions to protect Singaporeans."
