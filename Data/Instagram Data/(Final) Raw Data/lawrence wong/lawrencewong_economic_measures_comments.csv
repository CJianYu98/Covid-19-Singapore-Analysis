Support schemes like the SGunited skills and SGUnited traineeships have helped in significant ways.

The overall budget deficit for FY2020 is the largest since Singapore‚Äôs independence, at $64.9 billion, or 13.9% of GDP. In FY2021, we will still run a deficit, albeit a smaller one, at 2.2% of GDP.

4,k.se.th,I agree with the need for prudence. It is wrong for taxpayers to be subsidising the SHN cost for some employers of domestic helpers. If they can afford to hire a domestic helper they should be able to afford the cost of the SHN. At most an installment scheme can be offered with interest. It's ludicrous that taxpayers are subsidising a portion of them.,2021-02-17T00:12:58.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLW65iSHQwY/,2021-02-16T15:28:46.000Z,"#SGBudget2021 will continue to provide immediate relief for Singaporeans, while setting out a clear strategy to tackle our broader challenges over the horizon.

9,beauty.admirer.lover,"Feedback : The 4 budgets amt to est. $100 bil are complex and not straight forward to the masses. If $100 bil are allocated to ALL adult Singaporeans, including the very poor, the middle income, the very rich, each can get about $50,000 Cash basis approx. 2 million adults. Right now, we dont see the very ""tangible benefits or assistance"". Most of the $100 bils seem try to help big corps and sme businesses in the hope that they can retain as many employees as possible. Is this workable ? I doubt so. If an extended family of adult pa, ma, bro, sis if you use the simplest method each getting $50,000 collectively they have $200,000. This $200,000 can help them for at least 5 years even if all of them are retrenched / laid-off. (Of course you can fine-tune it by giving those in landed houses lesser, and of the $100 bils, 20% as full cash support : each adult getting around $10,000 & etc) By having a super complex 4 combined budgets, ask around, look around, how many actually directly benefited from the est. $100 bils? Look at Hong Kong. Simple approach that all the people can feel the benefits. HK$10000 for every Hong Konger. This should be the way. Ours ?Skills training budget in times of social distancing ? Go Digital incentives when most F & B owners worry most are revenues 1st and not the mode of payment ? Note : I am Pro PAP but does not mean I am Pro PAP Policies. Would Mr Lee Kuan Yew have done differently ? @leehsienloong @hengsweekeat @teocheehean @khawboonwan Note : the theory of ""teaching someone to fish"" instead of ""giving him fishes"" has to be applied according to circumstances. When deep crisis calls for it, you have to be really wise to choose which to do so.

10,beauty.admirer.lover,"Feedback 2 : if your 4 budgets amt to say $5 bil, and each Singaporean adult gets $600 cash, then I think it is ""tangibly proportionate"". But if you have $100 bil budgeted, $10,000 cash assistance would be ""a better assistance, and more keenly felt"" by the masses. Why did I say earlier that tens of billions poured to help big corps and SMEs would not ""be workable"" ? 1. It is a good time actually for ""industry consolidation"" aka reset. The industry could have been overly saturated pre Covid-19 crisis. So, to save SIA is a wise choice as it is of such importance to Singapore economy as track records have shown.
