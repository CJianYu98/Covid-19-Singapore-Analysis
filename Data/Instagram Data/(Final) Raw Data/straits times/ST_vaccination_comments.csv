kenkopite,"Oh wow. Singapore just had the most shocking and blatant show of double standards on Covid-19 handling. Currently everyone who enters/returns to Singapore is required to serve a mandatory 14-days stay-home notice (SHN), even for those who have completed their vacinnation. Yet attendees for an upcoming forum to be held in Singapore are exempted from this mandatory SHN.

hairy.mp2,"the thing i dont understand. The government allow travellers to come in WITHOUT serving SHN. That's a very very bad idea (Yes, i see it as a way to improve the economy, but now isn't the time). The world isn't safe, so neither are we. Im not asking for it to happen, but one person can result in a super-spreader. It isn't fair for the frontliners that have fought so hard to reach where we are now to only see sudden spikes again",2020-11-04T14:13:07.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CHK2BYoJTh1/,2020-11-04T12:49:41.000Z,"Singapore could move into phase 3 by the end of the year if the coronavirus remains under control here, but it would not be a return to pre-Covid days.

They did it so that they can get salary and accommodations without actually doing their job. It's like a free extension of holiday to them. And the fact that the fatality rate of covid19 is low atm, it tempts FWs to just infect them and show minor symptoms to just get the accomdations.
