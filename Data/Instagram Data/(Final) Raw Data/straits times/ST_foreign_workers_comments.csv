show_mymind,Wonder y keep having ppl asking why mention foreigner Singaporean or PR... since I’m so free I use a little bit of brain and... no tourist infected so no mention of tourist/ local and PR meaning how many unlink case or ppl roaming ard within SGP/ foreign workers who live in the dorms are under quarantine (with gov doing their best). So we who read the news will Understand the situation in SGP. Prevent panic or rushing to supermarket. It’s just a news and reports... dun always look at things or pinpoint over small matters... life would be happier. Stay safe and healthy everyone!,2020-04-26T23:47:17.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_b08GdBKDP/,2020-04-26T06:56:10.000Z,"Most of the new cases involve foreign worker dormitory residents. 15 patients are Singaporeans and PRs. ⁣

sharonsohx1029x,"Hope govt and employers will have a good review on living conditions inside the dorms. Cannot just push the responsibility to the workers living there. With proper facilities, education and respect we can definitely learn from this and do better. I always believe if the environment was properly managed or maintained, people will also do so. Someone needs to hear from the workers themselves their real conditions without fear of being fired  etc, gotta rethink how these are run and managed.",2020-04-20T10:55:57.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_McqUJg26n/,2020-04-20T07:35:24.000Z,"Singapore reports 1,426 new cases in the biggest daily spike.

As this circuit breaker we are all going through, taught us a great lesson like confining ourselves staying at home for so many days and little children not allowed to play at the playground really drives us all nuts.Singapore our homeland is one of the freest country in the world. And now we find ourselves with so much restriction even simple thing like having  fresh air in the sun and taking a stroll.We may even get a fine from doing so.A feeling like we are all put in ""imprisonment"" for something that is not even a crime and it is about freedom we ask for.This Covid-19  had really taken a toll on us.And no matter how bad it is, i know together we were win this war.🙏🙏🙏",2020-04-20T10:30:18.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_McqUJg26n/,2020-04-20T07:35:24.000Z,"Singapore reports 1,426 new cases in the biggest daily spike.

aliciatan4,"If the world continues to be in the lockdown mode then a great depression is inevitable! Please consider Jessica Seah's nontoxic method. I posted concrete proofs including a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication, no expensive ventilator is required. Jessica Seah's treatment method is cheap, simple and very effective. Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, diseases, pathogens, free radicals and cancer cells. I hope the world will not keep repeating the history of having to deal with new strains of superbugs caused by the man-made chemicals like medicines , vaccines, disininfectants, hand sanitizers, etc. The more such toxins are used, the more vulnerable will be the population will be to infections and diseases! Toxic man-made chemicals will not be part of having a healthy society. If people keep adding poison to our environment, the voiceless unborn foetuses will have birth defects and it will affect the quality of the future generations. Life is like playing chess, one wrong move will have a horrendous Domino's effects!🇸🇬",2020-04-07T20:47:42.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-r1vcyl_t2/,2020-04-07T15:39:37.000Z,"Among the local cases, links to existing clusters have been established for 52 cases, of which 39 are linked to clusters at foreign worker dormitories.
