davidltwai,"As 1 country it is easy to say what needs to get done and everyone toe the line. This takes some leadership foresight and a public who's generally willing to cooperate. Opening up a country to another? Unless both countries have the common same detection, tracing, control methods and direction (just like 1 country) setting measurements to determine when to pull the plug is not enough. Are the countries in a travel bubble willing to adapt and adjust to each other for a common way forward- just like a single country's response, containment and treatment methods? Are the people of both countries trusting enough of the other? If not, then travel bubbles anywhere would be some way off.",2020-12-01T06:33:45.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIPnQnUrv2Y/,2020-12-01T05:48:17.000Z,"Update: Singapore and Hong Kong have decided to defer the start of the air travel bubble to beyond this month given that the number of local unlinked cases in Hong Kong is still high, says CAAS.

The exact start date of the arrangement will be reviewed late this month.
The move comes as Hong Kong hunkers down under harsher social distancing measures in anticipation of what health authorities have warned could be the worst Covid-19 wave so far.
Hong Kong's daily new infections have crossed 70 for more than a week.
The spike was led initially by a growing dance club cluster of more than 500, most of whom are tai tais and their young dancing instructors.

motivational._.quotes101,"HEYYO THANK YOU CHINA FOR THE MASK🥺💗! To everyone who is blaming me them cause they started the virus,do you think it was intentional? Yes it could be controlled but they were just doing what they had always been. No one is gonna be like oh I want something that can kill people and I won't be sued or smt like that right even if there is this virus surely isn't it cause what about their families what about the people they care for? What would happen to them? So the thing is nobody wanted this virus to start, not you,not me. Yes I understand that none of us like that this virus is on going,that many lifes have been impacted indirectly or directly in a way. I understand that this (may) have caused negative changes but everyone makes mistakes. Think back to the time you did something you regretted,what did you want? You didn't want it to even happen in the first place,you wanted people to understand and forgive you.This is basically the same situation China is in so I hope everyone is able to understand may not be immediately but gradually!

robin.worldtour,"First you work on biological warfare in a dodgy lab in Wuhan.  Then you lose control over the virus you were manipulated. Then you, the Chinese Government silenced (in jail or killed) the whistleblowers who highlighted early on the start of this vital pendemia. Then you, Chinese Government, lobbied the WHO  to minimize inspection/incrimination/communication around your virus topic. You extradited foreign journalists.  You, Chinese Government, let your people continue to travel the world, knowingly that there was a very serious virus issue. You, the Chinese Communist Government is responsible for the deaths and the economic chaos that followed all around the world.  We Singaporeans do not say thank you at all and we demand reparations not donations/ridiculous charity and PR work.",2020-05-05T07:20:13.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_y_TjcltJS/,2020-05-05T06:49:16.000Z,"""Work in solidarity to conquer this adversity.""

shaynephua,"The moment it is announced that these non essential bubble tea shops will be closed, it should take immediate effect. I don’t see how we should give in to any form of excuses at this point of time. There are excuses from people who say that they did not foresee such event happening to this extent. There are people blaming the grab-drivers for not cancelling the orders when they witness the situation. There are excuses from people saying that there’ll be left over ingredients. Can we not use up the left over ingredients as gifts for our front-liners? Can we not give them as gifts for people volunteered to help those in needs? Why did authorities and shop owners as well, allow such atrocities to happen? Why do we kept saying we didn’t foresee? Does it not mean that we’ve been only focusing on our own pursuit of happiness? Did we spare a thought for our Drivers who have to gather in crowd to pick up your from the start a non-essential privilege product?",2020-04-22T06:28:43.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_PzEbFJIlR/,2020-04-21T14:48:56.000Z,"Getting the usual late night bubble tea fix?
