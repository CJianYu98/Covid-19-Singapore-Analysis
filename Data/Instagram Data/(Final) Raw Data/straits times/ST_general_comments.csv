astridchennn,"When a Chinese tourist returns China, she/he will take 14 days hotel quarantine in the same city where she/he enters China. Literally, she/he would be sent to hotel right after passing immigration. During and after the strict quarantine, that person will have at least 5 rounds of swab testing. I don‚Äôt think the Chinese tourists would like to sacrifice their time to go though all these procedures just to travel to Singapore and spend money here .

The usual prayer assembly at Masjid Sultan used to attract at least 5,000 worshippers, but this year it was split into 2 sessions of just 50 people each.
Most mosques held 3 sessions with no more than 50 worshippers - who had to book slots online - each time.
The Straits Times would like to wish all our readers Selamat Hari Raya Haji. Stay safe!

jerryllk_,"Looks like what ST and Nea has reported is proving to be accurate and that there is no such disinfectant that can last six months or can continue to kill Covid 19 for three to six months. Most disinfectant available can kill some bacteria and germs and not Covid 19. Here it shows Covid19 is highly resistant and contagious. False hope is dangerous and very worrisome. We live to suffer when claims of disinfectant efficacy are not certified nor properly tested. Don‚Äôt put peoples life to any risk, it is so irresponsible. Don‚Äôt lower our guard check what works and what don‚Äôt and protect ourselves and protect our people. All those claims of self disinfect that can last six months is terrible and here is a case where we live to suffer. We need to be alert and protect ourselves.

caprinic,"‚ÄúIn guidance released by WHO Monday (May 29), the United Nations public Health Agency said ‚Äúthere is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (what her medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking, can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses, including covid19‚Äù. WHO said another concern is people may contaminate themselves by touching their faces more frequently when they adjust, remove and dispose of their masks. The agency said masks should be reserved for those who are infected with the virus or in close contact with infected patients.SO, when are you, Straits Times, going to report on this and question the government‚Äôs current stance on masks.",2020-06-06T06:56:59.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CA5DdywpF-s/,2020-06-01T11:52:28.000Z,"The task force combating the Covid-19 outbreak said that face shields are not as effective as masks in reducing the risk of transmission.

radendwarawati,"I‚Äôm very delighted with this news and would like to express my pride and appreciation to my fellow residents for playing their part in maintaining the community cases low. Having said this, I can‚Äôt help but to wonder if this is achieved due to the constant and responsible personal hygiene practices from the community as a whole or/and the compliance to the restrictions and measures that have been put in place or/and. Regretfully, if only the latter is exercised, my personal view is that Singapore may be at risk of incurring higher community cases once the restrictions are loosen or released completely. My hope is that all residents will continue to exercise good hygiene practices when the restrictions are lifted or even when this global pandemic is over. ‚Äú(Singapore) has long had an obsession with hygiene and cleanliness‚Äù (McDonald/BBC, 2018) which I believe is not without reasonable cause. Hence, let‚Äôs continue to do our part! #aremindertoselfandothers",2020-06-01T09:31:35.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CA4r5w3FLCm/,2020-06-01T08:26:34.000Z,"The last time when there were no community infections in Singapore was on Feb 23.

manapergi,Our public transport is commonly used by migrant workers as well as the majority of Singaporean who cannot afford a private car. And the migrant workers form a large percentage of CoVid 19-infected population. So it imperative to ensure all migrant workers  are tested and treated for CoVid 19 before being allowed to move freely in Singapore.

thomas.tyrone.beiron.tay,"The fact that local clusters are still occurring with about 15-20 cases being diagnosed daily does mean continued lapses by people, and we haven't achieved full conscientious practice of personal hygiene, although expecting 100% seems absurd.

Again, this means someone among the vendors or caregivers at the home has introduced the virus there.",2020-04-28T20:25:40.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_fYgYBJL4c/,2020-04-27T16:04:40.000Z,"The 2 Covid-19 patients who died are both Singaporean men, aged 82 and 81.

william_jw_teo,"While many have blamed/criticized the Govt for the upsurge in Covid-19 infections, my views are as follows: 1. There were far too many unknowns. 2. Who would know that the thousands of FWs, who have been living in the doms peacefully for years, would be affected by Covid-19? 3. What is MOST IMPORTANT, is that the Govt took prompt, very prompt (creative) actions to provide the FWs with alternative accommodations, instead of wasting time to point fingers. This has brought the spread to within control. (4) In every major projects, mistakes are bound to be made....this should not hinder us to undertake projects, ""beyond our size""  for fear of failure; (5) The price for success is not cheap!  Unless we grow/excel Singapore will be stagnated.",2020-05-01T09:36:04.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_b68cAg1Zr/,2020-04-26T07:48:45.000Z,"WATCH: Changi Exhibition Centre being converted into a community isolation facility for Covid-19 patients.

shaynephua,"The moment it is announced that these non essential bubble tea shops will be closed, it should take immediate effect. I don‚Äôt see how we should give in to any form of excuses at this point of time. There are excuses from people who say that they did not foresee such event happening to this extent. There are people blaming the grab-drivers for not cancelling the orders when they witness the situation. There are excuses from people saying that there‚Äôll be left over ingredients. Can we not use up the left over ingredients as gifts for our front-liners? Can we not give them as gifts for people volunteered to help those in needs? Why did authorities and shop owners as well, allow such atrocities to happen? Why do we kept saying we didn‚Äôt foresee? Does it not mean that we‚Äôve been only focusing on our own pursuit of happiness? Did we spare a thought for our Drivers who have to gather in crowd to pick up your from the start a non-essential privilege product?",2020-04-22T06:28:43.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_PzEbFJIlR/,2020-04-21T14:48:56.000Z,"Getting the usual late night bubble tea fix?

With proper facilities, education and respect we can definitely learn from this and do better. I always believe if the environment was properly managed or maintained, people will also do so.

leetengnguan50,I am just thinking to myself that the suspension of McDonald's has nothing to do with the foreign workers who are staying in the dormitory. I also heard from the news recently that locals infection rate is decreasing. In my personal opinion there is no need to suspend McDonald's in Singapore.,2020-04-19T09:42:02.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_JLGdPARc-/,2020-04-19T01:04:14.000Z,"Delivery and drive-thru services are suspended too.

vanessasaaron,Hopefully the good that will come out of this is that the government regulates foreign workers housing conditions. As they are really appalling and unhygienic. This is the hidden Singapore that not many people are privy too. The forgotten members of society. Yet without them how would we develop and progress. They are the bricks Nf mortar to all our skyscrapers. Yet employers cramp them in uninhabitable conditions,2020-04-16T22:51:09.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_DAzaHFRRE/,2020-04-16T15:38:49.000Z,"Singapore has confirmed 728 new cases in the biggest daily spike.‚Å£‚Å£

evenly_,"Guys please be reasonable. The government is quickly adapting approaches based on the situation! Things have changed alot in 6 weeks. They know masks helps, but 6 weeks ago, number of healthy people is higher, probability of spread is low, but irrational fear (selfishness, panic hoarding) was high so that was the recommended approach. But today, there's a higher spread in community over time, but higher trust in government to act (e.g. society observed how they quickly planning resources and manpower to create and give out hand sanitizers and now reusable masks), so the approach changed. It's about adapting quickly based on factors e.g. society, resources needed, time available, probability of virus spread. Not about staunchly sticking to 1 way just because you don't want people to criticise.",2020-04-11T10:00:18.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-1bm6SFU9-/,2020-04-11T09:03:40.000Z,"""We will make mask-wearing compulsory for public transport.

luvthisluvthat,"Droplets of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, can be spread and live in the air for up to 3 hours, and be disseminated to hard surface areas where they can live up to 3 to 4 days. That is quite concerning when you consider that flushing a toilet can create an aerosolized plume of these viral particles, which can then spread elsewhere within proximity. We know that toothbrushes left in proximity to the toilet gain viral spread quite rapidly, mirroring levels observed in the toilet itself. That same thing can occur for cell phones, which many people take with them into the bathroom. However, this mode of transmission has not been well studied as it relates to COVID-19.",2020-04-10T23:46:31.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-zYy8gFxpX/,2020-04-10T14:00:37.000Z,"The number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore has crossed the 2,000 mark, as the current total stands at 2,108.

luvthisluvthat,"Certainly, hospitals caring for these patients need to pay close attention to toilet cleansing and determine whether there are venting systems that expel air from the toilet via a negative pressure effect (exhaust). It also raises questions about the use of toilets in the public domain. Six-feet social distancing means I can see you, you can see me, and we can stay apart. But if I use a toilet, there's no way of knowing whether it was used prior by a symptomatic or asymptomatic viral carrier or shedder.The aerosolization effect that can occur in toilets, leading to microdroplets that can be inhaled or persist on surface areas, raises some real concerns regarding epidemiologic spread. It may also be helpful in understanding why this rapid spread can occur when not linked to known contact with those positive for COVID-19.Turning our attention to the toilets is something we need to do.",2020-04-10T23:47:25.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-zYy8gFxpX/,2020-04-10T14:00:37.000Z,"The number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore has crossed the 2,000 mark, as the current total stands at 2,108.

annlito2002,If project owners be willing to extend completion date in lieu of the need for workers to circuit break also this would not have happened. CAAS during the SARS outbreak was will to extend completion date by 6 months. This relieved construction firms from full work force during those time and it helped. Construction at this time can learn from that. Project owners must also do their part. As of now all projects are still on going with threats of liquidated damages for delays.

itzmoiyj,":( I didn't do as well as I wanted for CA1. The Teacher Told Us To Work Hard For MYE and now it's down the drain T_T I like staying at home to do HBL however, sometimes it's a little tiring as you sit in one corner for 6 hours starting at a screen or doing work. Like a lot of ownership for your learning it's involved. I little stressful. But still can I guess.. It's really difficult because the environment at home isn't as spacious as school. So it feels like you are being suffocated. A lot of distractions too. Nonetheless guys, it's only until this virus is over.

itzmoiyj,"Also those who have national exams you guys keep freaking out but I know I'm in no position to say this, they said they would remove some topics. Instead of freaking out maybe you should take this month to revise instead of telling yourself pass away alr. I'm pretty sure you can do it one la. Jiayous ok.  To PSLE students, Your Psle Oral In Aug, Papers In Sept to Oct. You are literally 4 to 5 months away. This one month won't really affect you unless you do nothing and just give up. If you don't know just ask the teacher, friends, relatives. Text them or call them. When you tchers are having zoom sessions you can raise any questions that you need clarification. I'm pretty sure if u ask at the right time they will be more than happy to help. There are people around you that can help you :) I hope you guys do well ok:) Dun Give Up so Easily! Same goes to everyone including myself:)",2020-04-03T18:03:38.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-gwSlvFSI_/,2020-04-03T08:20:21.000Z,"@moesingapore will work with schools to implement this, PM @leehsienloong said in a speech announcing new measures to curtail the spread of Covid-19.

I'll tell you the dilemmas..firstly there are areas in HBL that we definitely need the subject teacher to teach the concept/formula/language etc.Not alot of parents are able to.They can assist with a few questions here and there based on what they learnt back in the days.Secondly pre-sch is Under ECDA,and for now it's pending as to whether it will enforce all pre-school s to be closed bear in mind Private Childcare. Thirdly there are still parents required to work, it's essential so how are we to find alternative childcare...I'm not at all in favour of sch closure...@moesingapore",2020-04-04T02:37:03.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-gwSlvFSI_/,2020-04-03T08:20:21.000Z,"@moesingapore will work with schools to implement this, PM @leehsienloong said in a speech announcing new measures to curtail the spread of Covid-19.

nabisah18,School cannot close so just let the virus spread. Important who going to take care of the kids if school close. Wonder what happened to the kids whose schools were closed. So the option is... close the school only when there is virus Attack. Then parents has no choice but find a solution. So just hope no  infection in another school.,2020-03-25T18:27:30.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-KUYA4H_4s/,2020-03-25T15:13:08.000Z,"The new clusters are a PCF Sparkletots Preschool centre in Fengshan, which is linked to 18 cases, and Dover Court International School, which is linked to 3 cases.

howezlegend,"Wah tak boleh tahan all these senseless people calling for school closure, I thought aiya Mothership is oriented towards youths so confirm kids will complain about school not closing. Then come here see ST still like that, supposed to be adults already but still cannot think, MOE should hold ""critical thinking in politics"" modules for kids in future. To those who still don't understand why schools haven't been closed: 1) If close schools then what about the kids who are not old enough to take care of themselves? Expect all parents to miraculously be allowed to work from home, get LOA or take leave everyday meh? You all think leave is free ah can anyhow take ah? 2) On one hand praise frontliners who work 24/7 to safeguard us and keep the virus at bay, such as healthcare workers, emergency services, cleaners, administrative staff, transport staff, etc and then next moment tell them their kids have no school. Then you want them to take leave/quit jobs to take care of kids is it? Bad enough to be ungrateful, worse to be hypocritical as well. 3) You think all kids will so guai stay at home all the time meh? Kids not bored ah? Confirm will have some who still go out what, just see those cuckoo go take part in those last-day-club promotion events. 4) If all students can study so effectively with online learning then why we still need schools? Might as well tell everyone study from home, provide Khan Academy links and give out digital certs lah. Teachers unnecessary also, all we need is for them to give lecture, that one AI also can do mah. Tuition centre should also close down, schools also can online liao lagi no need physical tuition centres, just purchase my tuition package online for $99.99 a month, comes with free shipping confirm your child all A. 5) How you want to hold effective online exams? All MCQ? Open book online SAQ and essays? Webcam oral tests and listening comprehension? Pray hard your wifi no lag or else no need graduate liao? Allow students to S/U all mods every year? 6) I haven't even include the scientific research quoted by minister Ong Ye Kung or the statistics presented, I not official source so I don't want to anyhow make claims.",2020-03-25T16:37:49.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-KUYA4H_4s/,2020-03-25T15:13:08.000Z,"The new clusters are a PCF Sparkletots Preschool centre in Fengshan, which is linked to 18 cases, and Dover Court International School, which is linked to 3 cases.

wilbur_chri._.shu,"To be honest, schools are already the safest place to be with all the measures implemented within school. Overall, I think it has increased our awareness on how ""real"" the situation really is. Closing schools cannot prevent large gatherings outside of school anyway, in an even more unguarded environment. Public transport is also getting slightly less crowded lately with more people working from home. Being socially responsible, maintaining good hygiene and taking care of yourself is the best way to protect yourself and others for now! üí™",2020-03-25T10:25:10.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-IvX8GHc3P/,2020-03-25T00:30:34.000Z,"Singapore announced tighter measures as part of the fight against Covid-19.

catherine_the_awesomest,"I think we should move fast and restructure our economy (even partially will be good) so that we have a headstart in the next world economy. Human contact will be diminished by either choice or law, and we will constantly be indoors. This has an enormous impact to the retail and services sector, which is a big deal in SG. Then we must also look as ways we can produce and not stockpile an essential amount of food, water and medicine as part of national defence. This has to be in tandem with population growth. But I'm sure that appropriate consideration is already given to these matters, and that I'm only stating the obvious. Let's see this episode a a brand new start for Singapore, and forge a new future out of the calamity.",2020-03-25T09:59:27.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-G7iT7pLNd/,2020-03-24T07:38:22.000Z,"Changi Airport is almost empty, after Singapore shut its borders to short-term visitors in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus.‚Å£

They need to hold the handles of the train to Ensure that they don‚Äôt fall down when the train moves .After they get down , there is no time at all to go to toilet and wash their hand , they have to immediately go to school as they would be rushing. Even the though it‚Äôs advised to keep a high level of hygiene , it can‚Äôt be followed all the time. There are more and more cases in Singapore over the few days .

bendover152,"This is a very dangerous decision that Singapore is taking. The MOE and MOH should look into this. Education should never be put before health. Closing schools for 2 weeks is not going to ruin your education! If the cases continuously rise like they have been for the past week and a half, keeping schools and offices open is the most dangerous thing that could be done. All other countries in the world have closed schools, Singapore is the only one left. People are anyways not coming to school because they are scared for their health. What is the goddamn problem Singapore??? Online school is still there!!!!!! UWCSEA, SAS, TTS have moved their spring break forward already! These schools are taking wise decisions as at this rate of growing cases, it is best to keep kids and adults at home. I don't think Singapore understands that this is a global pandemic. Schools, offices and everything SHOULD be closed. Increasing measures is never going to help stop the cases. It seems like all Singapore is ever doing during this global pandemic is ""taking measures"". Singapore is not making a wise decision by putting education over health, in fact it is possibly the dumbest thing they could do. Govt. please take into consideration other peoples lives. All of you are protected in your mansions etc, cancelling a garden party is not going to do anything. So PLEASE for god sakes do something instead of ""taking measures""",2020-03-19T05:32:46.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B95jp-DlnuN/,2020-03-19T02:59:34.000Z,"Despite the record number of 47 new coronavirus cases announced on Wednesday (March 18), schools and kindergartens will reopen next Monday as planned with stricter measures, said MOE.

topskywind,"Notably, fever occurred in only 43.8% of patients on initial presentation and developed in 87.9% following hospitalization. Absence of fever in 2019-nCoV ARD is more frequent than in SARS-CoV (1%) and MERS-CoV infection (2%) [19] and such patients may be missed if the surveillance case definition focused heavily on fever detection [14]. Consistent with two recent reports [1,12], lymphopenia was common and, in some cases, severe. However, based on a larger sample size and cases recruited throughout China, we found a markedly lower case fatality rate (1.4%) as compared with that reportedly recently [1,12]. The fatality rate was lower (0.88%) when incorporating additional pilot data from Guangdong province (N=603) where effective prevention has been undertaken (unpublished data). Our findings were consistent with the national official statistics, reporting the mortality of 2.01% in China out of 28,018 cases as of February 6th, 2020 [11,23]. Early isolation, early diagnosis and early management might have collectively contributed to the marked reduction in mortality in Guangdong. Furthermore, dilution of health workforce as a result of central management (i.e., Wuhan JinYinTan Hospital) might have led to increased mortality rate. These findings will inform the mass public, clinicians and policy makers the true transmissability of 2019-nCoV which has resulted in a major social panic.",2020-02-10T11:06:48.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8YJ-3on-nE/,2020-02-10T07:08:54.000Z,"Snaking queues of office workers at Suntec City waiting to have their temperature taken, on the first day of temperature screening as part of measures to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.‚Å£
