tr2ica,"why are y'all pressed??? if you didn't get the opportunity to collect the token, just use your phone to download the application. the tokens are for people who may not have access to technology (seniors, foreign workers) or people who just find it more convenient to carry a token around. I know so many people who get lazy to scan Safe Entry to places (causing a higher risk cause no one can trace you if you happen to be in close proximity with someone with COVID-19) and the government is just ensuring that people would have a platform to do so. stop whining, it's troublesome but it's a hecking pandemic.",2020-12-07T21:20:25.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIewkhRJ9NJ/,2020-12-07T02:58:15.000Z,"Have you started using TraceTogether?

mathildachoo,"I just feel that because the other time too many people rushed to collect the token, it makes it dangerous for all of us because it can easily become a cluster, therefore they did not make the token collection as islandwide and instead give the token 1 constituency at a time. So we should actually give priority to the elderly and maybe start using the app instead. No point complaining, because we can’t have everything we want but to sacrifice something for the greater good. We should also set good role models for the young in Singapore, because the future depends on them.

anteledaisy,"70% is still a lenient mark I feel. Should increase to at least 85% - 90% instead. I have been seeing many people breaking the rules of not wearing masks & practising social distancing. I don’t feel the fear in people in Singapore. To them, they feel that they will never get infected. And they are not socially responsible. @moh_singapore @straits_times",2020-12-07T03:12:40.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIewkhRJ9NJ/,2020-12-07T02:58:15.000Z,"Have you started using TraceTogether?
