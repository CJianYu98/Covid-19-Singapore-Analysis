spac3walk3r,My friend who works SDA also got complain said alot still do not follow the rules and yet tried to bully him whenever he is working and had no choice sometimes has to enforce the law. If everyone cooperate would  be better. Obey the rules and do not let Government give them the chance to fine you on the spot and take away your money cos it's not worth it. Overall SDA in here are doing their job. They also human like us trying to meet ends meet,2021-02-21T05:49:59.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLivtV4h5nU/,2021-02-21T05:41:52.000Z,"As a safe distancing ambassador, Mr Adrian Goh takes on a role similar to that of school prefects - to remind people that their behaviour is being monitored and they cannot flout Covid-19 rules with impunity.

Put up thermo scanners monitors at MRT Entry/ Exit points. Run notices of social distancing ads in MRT, run public address announcement of social distancing in MRT.

They  shouted across people for orders, chit chat with customers  while preparing food. Omg! I saw their saliva splashing everywhere and on our food. Handled our food with bare hands and collected money using the same hands. I looked around and saw so many elderly and young kids there too.

aliciatan4,"If the world continues to disinfect, sanitise using cancer causing agents,or wash with the toxic soap, the population will be more vulnerable to COVID 19 and diseases! Use your common sense, the toxic chemicals will impair the immune system, our first line of defence and damage the organs. We need the unharmed immune system to fight and subdue COVID 19! Thiese wrong recommendations by WHO have proven ineffective as more people despite following the using instructions get infected. I do not follow and do not wear the mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide another cancer causing agent. When the commuters coughed very badly I did not fall sick! I keep seeing the public areas are disinfect! You are making the population inhale poison! Before you can solve COVID 19, you are creating more health problems! Such stupidity will cause astronomical increase in chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases! This is the fallacy of science that always embrace man-made chemicals! Science created the superbugs, the mutated viruses without realising it and fail to subdue. The next foolish move will be to develop another vaccine. History always repeats itself!

peacemaker_in_action_,I guess they should see the crowd in liquor selling shops it's even more worst...they are closer than usual and larger than regular in beverage cheers but worship places are absolutely pin drop silent less crowd and empty due to the prevailing law.Shocking the fact that entertainment joints have no restriction in numbers and time but gods home.I speak for all religion all gods.It's the contemporary situation after June 19.We are not against Unleashed restricttion joints but definitely unhappy that restriction like circuit breaker to go gods home 👈,2020-09-09T15:30:47.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CE6gCz0lF5C/,2020-09-09T11:27:00.000Z,"ðŸ”¸ No more warnings ðŸ”¸
