10,t1_kang_jie,"@vino.16 The direct answer he gave was that there was no benefit, and rightly so, for Singaporeans or anyone else to know about the reserves’ total sum. There is a lot to be disappointed about. Rather than ask what the most important part of tapping into the reserves were, Pritam asked for its total amount. Priorities? Being transparent is one thing. Few people think about the consequences of having the reserves made known. What’s kiddy stuff for you, is adult stuff for me. Do not underestimate the skill of debating, as in good governance the debates are very important, particularly when it comes to policies. I’m interested in who has his priorities right, and focuses on them during difficult times. Thank you for your 2 cents worth, and also, have a nice day.
