I moved back to Singapore from Europe and I can safely say Europe‚Äôs way of handling the Covid-19 pandemic is pre-historic compared to Singapore‚Äôs. Another factor is that Singaporeans are compliant and adhere to the law passed down by the govt, while Europe‚Äôs people are in a mess, and their left and right wings are tearing apart further amidst the pandemic. After being back here, I never felt more lucky and grateful to be Singaporean.",2021-02-02T18:02:58.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CKyf841A4xO/,2021-02-02T12:01:47.000Z,"""We acknowledge our error in not stating that data from TraceTogether is not exempt from the Criminal Procedure Code.
