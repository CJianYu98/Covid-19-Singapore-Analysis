8,awd_2021,"Hi Mothership and netizens! Sharing something not related to the above news post. We have grown stronger as a nation throughout COVID19. As we enter 2021, I would like to highlight an incident that we have gone through as a nation. In 2019, an ex-employee of Fei Yue Family Service Centre (a government agency), Guichan Ng Ks (a married woman in her late 40s), committed adultery by procuring the services of male prostitutes. The browsing traffic of her internet service was examined. It was subsequently found that she met up with male prostitutes several times, engaging in sexual acts and copulation, and also discussed them over messaging apps. In examining her internet files, hundreds of hours of bestiality selfie video was also discovered, recording her having sexual intercourse with her pet dog. The details shall not be elaborated here. If you have questions regarding the incident itself, you may contact Speaker of Parliament, Tan Chuan Jin, who is very involved in the community.In September 2019, Guichan was fired from her job in Fei Yue FSC, due to her defiance and refusal to comply with the Singapore government. In particular, she defamed and harrassed her friends without provocation. Although the matter was not pursued legally, she was fired from her job in Fei Yue to prevent her from further abusing her role as a social worker. Her current marital and job status is unknown as she does not have any prior company employment before her job in Fei Yue. If you have concerns or questions regarding Guichan in Fei Yue, you may enquire with Tony Ong Kie Wee, one of her superiors. In regards to the prosecution of Guichan Ng Ks' bestial acts and possession of zoophilic videos, you may contact S Iswaran, Minister of Communication and Information or Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs and Law, or any Member of Parliament. Mothership has been a great source of news, useful stories and anecdotes. We hope this platform continues to serve many more generations of Singaporeans.As we welcome 2021, we can be confident of winning the challenges in life as one Singapore.Regards and thanks,A friend of the authorities.",2021-01-08T19:55:12.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CJx9m28ni2O/,2021-01-08T10:29:08.000Z,"This brings the total number of cases to 58,836. #linkinbio

9,darrenksa2709,I have one question for MOH. How is someone infected COVID19 when there is no local case reported for the past few days? And if so why only 1 case? Since Govt claimed there is no local community spread and imported are all quarantine when they entered Singapore? And since the poor soul was infected why it was not spreading to others when the 12 dine in together? And why is there a Tekka case which there is no other case reported? Is the news reported in depth or just for browsing only ????,2020-11-30T14:58:10.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CINUXvBHPT4/,2020-11-30T08:24:45.000Z,"This brings the total number of cases to 58,218. #linkinbio

5,sharnster73,Are your ‘imported’ from returning citizens? And are they in isolation somewhere? Just curious as in Australia we are letting in small numbers of returning citizens continuously and they get isolated in hotels (locked down) for two weeks.

7,retards_prosecutor,"According to zaobao frm GKY, there is a still a distance to approach phase 3, and the Govt will consider further easing bef the start of Jan. If yes, we may be in phase 3 by Jan. If no, den we may be in phase 2 until a vaccine is found. Yes, nightlife will definitely be gone, but the Govt will help them find new jobs. If a vaccine frm China is given to us by Nov, maybe phase 3 will happen. To those who are worried abt side effect or whatsoever, relax, it will be checked by HSA bef selling it to us. However, being vaccinated does not mark the end of covid. WHO have said, no country is safe unless all are safe. Life will definitely cannot return to the pre covid 19 life, we still have to take precautions when we head out. The ways of socialising with others will be very different as well. Safe distancing will definitely be the norm forever. As wat LHL have said, we have to be mentally prepared for Disease X. It may be here anytime soon, and mutate quickly to infect more. But we can prepare ourselves for it by stop thinking dat life will go back to pre covid 19 if we are vaccinated, and live in dis new normal. But if covid 19 has no vaccine, dis is definitely the start of a new normal life for all of us ard the globe.",2020-09-16T12:16:48.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFMLCQ_nALQ/,2020-09-16T08:09:45.000Z,"There are 2 new cases in the community, both are Work Pass Holders. #linkinbio

2,retards_prosecutor,"I realised there have been some comments abt imported cases and community cases, and I wld like to clarify so doubts abt it. 1st, the dorm cases are workers dat are still serving their QO in their dorms or those under RRT. MOH have alr said dat numbers may continue to be high bef tapering down continuously, but dat doesn't mean dat the community is covid free, or yall start to get Complacent seeing low community numbers and go out more often as if covid is over. Cmon, the war is still very very far frm over. A vaccine may not conclude the end of covid, it may be here for up to 2 yrs, or maybe forever, just like seasonal flu, influenza and dengue. To those who are saying dat if u are vaccinated, u can start to be Complacent, by all means, do it urself. Don't drag ur friends or family to be Complacent with u, thinking dat u are totally immuned with covid. Wat if vaccine is not effective? And u start socialising with ppl dat may still be infected after being vaccinated? Cmon, its not the way to do things. WHO have said, dat covid may be here forever w/o a vaccine, and a vaccine is not a straight end to covid. Who knows swine flu is the nxt pandemic? If u think u can start going out more often like pre covid days and socialise as much as u want, then, the ICU ward for covid is reserved for u soon with a ventilator. Sep hols is cming, I wld not xpect crowds do be forming everywhere and ppl are starting to get Complacent. Just on 9 Aug, there was a hell lot of crowd queueing outside tamp mall to scan the safe entry and enter tamp mall. My question to them: has covid ended? Why is complacency stepping in so quick? Just because it national day, covid has hit taken a break yet. And yes true enuf, it was reported as a covid 19 place  due to major Complacency frm the public, thinking dat weekends and holidays its time to go crowded places. Ffs, u are still to stay home!  3rd, imported cases. Imported cases were given SHN, and were tested bef the end of their 14 day quarrantine to prevent spreading to the wider community. The war with covid is gnna last for very long, so do pls stay home more often, so dat u won't be in a ICU covid ward with a ventilator",2020-08-31T11:07:44.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CEjQQdkHZn3/,2020-08-31T10:46:31.000Z,"This brings the total number of cases to 56,812.

6,xkdbaobeiii,"Its very easy for people to speak with the benefit of hindsight. But a lot of people dont seem to understand that the government functions in a different way compared to individuals. In fact every government needs to look at the bigger picture rather than the small nitty gritty needs of every single person in the country. Any society that functions on the latter will simply see a collapse in the running of daily life. A lot of demands and questions are being raised but a lot of it can and should be dismissed because context is not being taken into account. A lot of ‘WHY NOW ISNT IT TOO LATE’ can be answered with one word - context. This pandemic is inherently volatile - nothing can be predicted. And thats why in the initial stages it is close to impossible to not do anything about it or completely go into a full panic mode. Why measures were implemented progressively prior to this circuit breaker is to ease people into this transition while keeping the situation relatively under control. If drastic measures are imposed, we will end up like countries such as Italy or India, where the entire country will be thrown into a frenzy and its impacts will simply be expanded and prolonged. Look, even a slight step up in measures imposed can trigger huge waves of panic buying, what gives the government confidence to announce complete shutdowns in the early stages (considering also that there wasnt such a necessity)? There is a natural tendency to oversimplify things in the comments section so for once, just sit down and THINK.",2020-04-04T17:41:40.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-hKVVYHBeQ/,2020-04-03T12:07:55.000Z,"👉🏼 For the list of essential services.

8,rtychia,Kinda sad that the old folks are deprived from visitors in the midst of this outbreak at the nursing home. Not pick pointing any body fault but is every staff & visitors social responsibility to refrain close contact with the residents if they are unwell or recent travel to overseas.

Do you want to know during school holidays how many kids i see in the northpoint mall? Sitting on the floor eating chatting at malls and bus terminal . I had to politely request them to either find a place to sit or to go home. Do you all want to know hw much virus are in our shoes? So the floor we stepped on are dirty! And under hdb block kids playing soccer (which is not allowed) without parents guiding them! Imagine if you close school no teacher will educate this yp what to do and what nt to do. Then they will go haywire coz parents are too busy at work or are not possible to control them(some.of them are rebel) . I feel that they should be practicing not to go out not to meet friends not to stand in one crowd. If they are well behave , clean and wash hands i believe no virus will atk them. 😁",2020-03-30T14:42:56.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-W8ntIHvme/,2020-03-30T12:55:41.000Z,"[BREAKING] Singapore's total number of Covid-19 cases now stand at 879, after 35 new cases were reported. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

6,agathacyf,"Frightening fact on COVID 19 infection:Make no mistake. When loved ones are removed from your home by ambulance because the virus has hit them hard, you are not going to be able to follow them there, sit by their hospital bed and hold their hand. You are not going to be able to pop in at 7.00 pm for visiting hours. They are going to have no one other than exhausted and brave hospital staff to see them through days or weeks of barely breathing through a ventilator until they either die or recover. They are not going to be well enough to text you.You are not going to be able to phone the ward to check in on them regularly (staff will be too busy for that). During that time, they will be completely alone, while you sit at home waiting to hear whether they have made it through.Imagine that person is someone you love dearly. Because it's going to be a reality for many in the coming weeks.And if that person in hospital happens to be you, going through that ordeal completely alone, it would be nothing less than terrifying.Please stay home and only go out if absolutely necessary.

2,devils_advocator,"Guys chill out. All our past increased of cases are because of imported cases. If we remove the counts of imported cases, there are only 5 local cases today and 8 local cases yesterday. These local cases are usually old cases that have been quarantined by contact tracing. Singapore is doing better as ever still.  In fact, i  think our local cases have been decreasing by a bit. If you looked at our graph, we are a straightline in terms of cases per day. Unlike an exponential curve, this means that we do not have any clusters or mass spreading. We do not require a lockdown or school closure.",2020-03-22T17:49:15.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-CcsIIn3nW/,2020-03-22T13:51:51.000Z,"All except one of the imported cases were returning residents and Long Term Pass holders.

5,stroopwaffle.nl,"Just wondering why y'all put so much attention of Indonesia has zero number of cases while Myanmar (one of the example), a country which located really close to China also still got 0 cases up to now. Lol. No offense, I'm personally totally understand why you guys wondering about Indonesia still not infected with this virus, but please don't judge the government or being so mean for hoping other countries including Indonesia or any other countries who has zero cases should've got infected by now or sooner, this shit ain't a competition. One thing for sure, people should hope that this virus cases will quickly disappear and all people that infected by the virus can be cured. But why do many people expect this virus to spread even more, put hopes on countries that still has zero cases should've infected soon? Shouldn't we support each other and hope for the best?

10,husky_79,"Captain here. For all the confused souls. In the past, because the diagnostic test is not commonly available, we only test cases that were deemed to be ""high risk"". Case 91 was deemed to be low risk as she did not have any respiratory symptoms. Also, the older test works by testing for the presence of the virus itself. After some investigation work, case 91 was suspected to be a missing link between the clusters and was sent for a NEWer type of test, which tests for presence of antibodies (not virus anymore). These antibodies remain present even after the person recovers.

1,drkelchua,"👏👏👏It’s about time the government step up and be tougher in the control of the outbreak. I just don’t understand why they are using the standard protocol as SARS when they know this disease have a long incubation period and can spread a lot faster as seen in China. They should have acted faster and STRICTER way earlier. And that will also include stopping mass gathering and congregation unless it’s absolutely necessary. Also should be strict in swooping down on people peddling mask at many times the original price. Thousands of boxes have be bought and kept by some unscrupulous business people so that they can sell it later at many times higher. If the government reinforces strict rules on gatherings for the good of the people, I am sure we Singaporeans will support fully. So stop worrying about public opinions and start getting tough!",2020-02-17T16:31:23.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8qz5KvH8W4/,2020-02-17T13:01:27.000Z,The Singapore Government will no longer be issuing any more new Leave-of-absences (LOA) to returnees with recent travel history to mainland China (outside Hubei).

11,alternativedatasources,"Just chatted with a friend in Wuhan. I asked if some things were coming back to normal. The answer: “Not yet. At least for one more month. Now, in Hubei province, no one is allowed to go out. Every family can go to the supermarket in town every three days to buy groceries.” Experts think the Covid-19 virus will be around into next year, and could disrupt health systems and economies, and seem concerned about the effect on South Asia and Africa, if it starts spreading there. Recent data (below) suggests an unprecedented (!) slowdown. The markets keep moving up while key driver of the global economy has lost its drive. It is nuts! Capital markets don’t care, because stimulus has remained the key driver for capital markets for a very long time. The Chinese markets almost collapsed as a reaction to the outbreak, but the 10 percent drop was remedied with tight restrictions on sell orders and some massive liquidity injections (the ""Yi Gang put""). The DAX just hit all-time-high today at the same time as China and the Global Economy grinds to a halt. The markets actually look much worse now than in March 2000 or in October 2008. And the pattern with a constant clamour for eternal cheap credit, negative rates, and rising asset prices - is just about to break.  https://www.facebook.com/109691020613665/posts/117432933172807/?d=n",2020-02-17T16:20:09.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8oaU8QHqHw/,2020-02-16T14:39:34.000Z,"Prior to hospital admission, Case 73 had attended church service at Grace Assembly of God in Tanglin.

11,asteria.88,"@leehsienloong sir, hope you can also educate people how to dispose / discard their used masks. Today itself I have witnessed two PRC putting their used masks on the seats of public food court & west coast park Mcdonald seats !! Just like Used tissues, they should be discarded immediately after use, otherwise germs and virus would spread, don’t you agree? However a lot of people doesn’t seem to have this habit / knowledge, they know how to wear when to wear but don’t know how to throw when to throw. This is worrying because the virus would simply spread to the next person who sat down on the seat, esp if it’s food court / Mcdonald of high customer turnover !",2020-02-09T13:35:37.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8TmVvZnLnk/,2020-02-08T12:41:03.000Z,PM @leehsienloong on how to protect yourself from the coronavirus.

Cos need to make sure you never kena, other people infected but no mask then end up spreading to others is not your problem, everyone else can die except you. 2) Stockpile everything at home. Toilet paper and maggi mee are essentials. Never eat maggi mee will die. No toilet paper don't know how to wash butt will die. 3) Don't travel overseas. Actually don't travel anywhere. Just stay at home 24/7. Maybe you want to close window also so virus cannot enter. When order online must wear hazmat suit to collect delivery then do full decon outside house first. 4) Cut off all ties from all China people. Might as well cut off all ties from your Chinese heritage as well. 5) When new rumour comes out, must share on every chat group you have. Make sure the people you send to also forward the rumour. Make chain messages great again! Sounds pretty ridiculous right? But that's exactly what is happening now. Seriously ppl wake up your bloody idea lah, can use brain and think whether what you doing is logical anot? Instead of flexing your cash and going on irrational stockpiling, how about flexing that brain to think on a wider level?",2020-02-09T02:24:39.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8TZbX7HKJi/,2020-02-08T10:47:39.000Z,"The coronavirus outbreak is test of S’pore’s social cohesion and psychological resilience, says PM Lee in a speech on Feb. 8.

As I am a teacher at an enrichment centre, parents are quite kiasu - as in, they will still try to ‘slip in’ their kid into the class, EVEN THOUGH the kid is coughing or sneezing or not feeling very well!! Nowadays, we are quite stringent - as in, if any kid is coughing / sneezing / boogering - they NEED TO GO HOME!!

Guess how many wuhan people got out of the city that same day they announced the city borders will close in a few hours time?

11,mu332ilh4n,Why not make them all singaporean fly to a particular airport in China n fly them back in one plane. Then ask tht plane to park at a remote stand at changi airport. Then make them go thru some kind of rigorous test before letting them go(this includes flight crew and cabin crew). And also disinfect the whole goddamn plane. Like every square inch of it. If u think its not possible an a380 can easily fit 868 passenger in a single class configuration.,2020-01-27T11:43:50.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B7uhmKzHq0t/,2020-01-25T03:07:08.000Z,"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also advised Singaporeans to regularly check the Ministry of Health's website for the latest updates on their Public Health Travel Advisory on the novel coronavirus in China.
