Countries like the UK are seeing the spike in cases from Christmas gatherings now, and the grief and suffering is not worth it. Putting your frustrations aside, it’s better to be safe than sorry and our country has fought hard for us to have this level of freedom where we can still go out and see loved ones instead of being locked down a second time for the foreseeable future. 🙌",2021-01-23T20:28:30.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CKYGzfkoA3h/,2021-01-23T06:02:02.000Z,"At a press conference on Jan. 22, Minister Lawrence Wong provided clarifications on the ""maximum of 8 visitors per household per day"" rule, and addressed the media's questions on how it will be enforced."

3,kenkopite,"@lawrencewongst It is a shame that lessons have not been learnt from the dormitory outbreak that brought the entire Singapore to a halt unnecessarily. Back then, you had said that the government did not have the benefit of HINDSIGHT. And now when Singaporeans are helping the government to have the FORESIGHT to identify potential cluster outbreak events like the GE, you dismiss it off as not jumping to conclusions and waiting to see if it really happens. The GE timeline was not due until next year, so was it really 'essential' for it to be called at this point in time with the risks of further outbreaks it may clearly cause? I struggle to reconcile this with what you and other Ministers keep preaching about minimising the risks of transmission.",2020-07-17T16:04:33.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CCvkRkxpnAy/,2020-07-17T12:29:59.000Z,"""So I think let's not jump to the conclusion just because we see queues forming, queues form everywhere and not just when people go and cast the vote, queues form in FNB outlets, queues form in hawker centers and markets, so there are queues everywhere.""

When the gates are opened, it’s gonna be mayhem (proven at midnight of 19june where people rushed in at 12) there’s gonna he a spike in the cases because most peoples mindset is “the rules are lifted and the government says it’s ok, so we won’t catch covid-19”, without actually realising that the problem is still there, just that we are trying to work around it. To be fair I feel like it’s too early if a response from the government because we have just barely gotten control over the situation and i doubt we will be able to hold it. But really, this CAN be a good decision if we still take the measures seriously, safe distancing and wearing masks, because the rules may be gone but the virus isn’t.

4,snowbreeeze,Why delete your thread if you did nothing wrong? Singaporeans must be mindful of the different attitudes foreigners have now while they are here.  We extend our hospitality and give them PR. But they should learn to assimilate and also respect our laws.

11,agathacyf,"Frightening fact on COVID 19 infection:Make no mistake. When loved ones are removed from your home by ambulance because the virus has hit them hard, you are not going to be able to follow them there, sit by their hospital bed and hold their hand. You are not going to be able to pop in at 7.00 pm for visiting hours. They are going to have no one other than exhausted and brave hospital staff to see them through days or weeks of barely breathing through a ventilator until they either die or recover. They are not going to be well enough to text you.You are not going to be able to phone the ward to check in on them regularly (staff will be too busy for that). During that time, they will be completely alone, while you sit at home waiting to hear whether they have made it through.Imagine that person is someone you love dearly. Because it's going to be a reality for many in the coming weeks.And if that person in hospital happens to be you, going through that ordeal completely alone, it would be nothing less than terrifying.Please stay home and only go out if absolutely necessary.
