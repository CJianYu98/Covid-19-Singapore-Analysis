6,ayunihh,It makes me sick reading the amount of people complaining. If yall so clever then why not join the policy makers. Keep asking for lockdown but dont even realise how detrimental that is to our economy. They've couldve implement it right from the begininng but you wouldve seen so much job losses because of economic downturn. Therefore it should only be a last resort. In countries like malaysia and even UK so many people are struggling to put food on the table due to lost income. Just stay at home la and let govt deal with the others. And why not plan joining the next general election since yall think u cn do better than govt...,2020-04-10T00:37:53.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-wvNFDHZop/,2020-04-09T13:18:42.000Z,"More monitoring, policies to be reviewed and possibly tightened in the coming days.

If schools were to close, it affects your studies so much, people are already complaining about tuition centres closing and they need the help from tuition teachers, what more if schools were to close? You can't even study or consult your teachers. Furthermore, with all the extra time on your hands how many of you will really stay home 24/7? u're gonna go running about void decks and shopping malls mixing and increasing your risk.What if schools were to remain open? Yes there is a risk u'll get infected but we're 2 months into this shit, how many of our students are infected? not even a quarter of our confirmed cases are students, if you were to practice social distancing and personal hygiene, head home immediately after school and stay home at all times, the risk lowers by a lot, you are able to prevent getting infected even if schools were to remain open, i'm pretty sure u're allowed to wear masks in school as well, so cmon little boys and girls, stop complaining for once",2020-03-24T12:39:55.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-EbVDPHWbf/,2020-03-23T08:18:27.000Z,"For those of you who keep complaining about why schools aren‚Äôt closed, Singapore‚Äôs Education Minister just wrote a whole Facebook post on it.

6,howezlegend,"Honestly, if the government cannot control the amount that people buy, just decrease the supply of these products made available to consumers while jacking up the price. No doubt all consumers, selfish or not, will suffer from the lack of supplies and increased cost, but the ones hit the hardest will be the selfish stockpiling ppl. One can argue that money makes the world go round, the rich don't mind throwing cash around, but if the money earned from raising prices is channelled to fund increased donations of essentials to poor families then the government would have managed to control the rapid reductions in stocks for essentials while not hurting the poor.",2020-02-09T01:55:48.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8TL6tfHBnf/,2020-02-08T08:49:36.000Z,"FairPrice added that they have steady supplies of essentials.
