Let's all get on board, so we can resume more activities with greater confidence.

If we all have TraceTogether, contact tracing will be much faster. Let’s say, you have been in close contact for an extended period with a person infected with COVID-19. You can be identified and notified quickly, and immediate action can be taken to protect you and your loved ones.

TraceTogether doesn’t collect or use your location data. It only records who you might have been close to for an extended period. Only you can access and upload encrypted Bluetooth exchanges from your TraceTogether App or Token in the event of a possible infection, and when requested by the authorities for contact tracing purposes. After 25 days, the information will be automatically deleted from your App or Token.

Rest assured that TraceTogether is not about tracing you. It’s really about tracking down those who have been exposed to COVID-19, getting them the appropriate care in the fastest possible time and limiting further spread. Download and use the TraceTogether App or collect your Token now. For details, visit www.tracetogether.gov.sg."
