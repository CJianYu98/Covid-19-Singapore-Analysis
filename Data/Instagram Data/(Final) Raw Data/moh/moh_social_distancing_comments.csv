When you are further apart, the risk of droplet exposure decreases.

Avoiding crowded places also allows you to stay further apart from the next person. Less crowded places allow for better ventilation and air circulation.

You can break the chain of transmission by always maintaining a safe distance of at least 1 metre in public places."

0,littlewokeeeee,You have an immune system for a reason.

It keeps you safe from COVID-19 transmission by reducing your exposure to droplets.

0,jacqypeh,Not all Singaporeans are stupid. Stop feeding us with the rubbish toxic narrative from the useless WHO.,2020-11-17T10:37:49.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CHrP1zrnkDz/,2020-11-17T02:50:59.000Z,"Some people only wear their masks when a safe distancing ambassador is nearby. It's worrying that some are still not wearing their masks properly, and not putting their masks back on immediately after eating, drinking or exercising.

COVID-19 is spread predominantly through droplets that are expelled when coughing, sneezing, shouting or talking. Talking softly reduces the amount of droplets expelled. Wearing a mask blocks the expulsion of these droplets and protects the people around you. 

A mask can effectively block the droplets only if it covers your nose and mouth, with no gaps between the mask and your face.

When out and about, we touch a lot of things that may be potentially contaminated. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to avoid touching your mask - to prevent contamination. If you need to touch it, wash or sanitise your hands before and after doing so. Used masks should not be left lying around as they could contribute to the spread of diseases. Used disposable masks should be thrown into rubbish bins."

3,android.cpl,Face Mask wearing is strongly encouraged but making it punishable by law may not be a good idea.Also there is the question of pollution as it stands millions upon millions of mask are thrown away everyday and the world is polluted enough as it is.Free will is not something to trifle with because good will is destroyed by force.If there is less good will then the chances of success in combating this pandemic will be compromised as well.,2020-11-22T23:43:31.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CHrP1zrnkDz/,2020-11-17T02:50:59.000Z,"Some people only wear their masks when a safe distancing ambassador is nearby.

4,andersencxz,Moh you are still not understanding. People voted for no is because if a safe distancing ambassador is nearby and u saw them u quickly wear ur mask properly means that before u saw them u did not wear your mask properly facts,2020-11-27T07:25:49.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CHrP1zrnkDz/,2020-11-17T02:50:59.000Z,"Some people only wear their masks when a safe distancing ambassador is nearby.
