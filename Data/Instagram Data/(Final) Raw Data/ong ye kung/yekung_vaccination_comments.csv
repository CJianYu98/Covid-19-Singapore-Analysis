The attached graph shows the progress made in the maritime sector. 

The top horizontal line shows the number of frontline workers eligible - 18k. 

The first line bordering the blue area shows the number that got their first dose over the last 1.5 months. The number now stands at 17.6k, or 98% of eligible frontline maritime personnel. 

The second line bordering the green area shows the number who have received the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 16.7k have, and in the coming days, almost all would have. 

This means that substantially all frontline maritime workers will be vaccinated, and this is a major step in securing our borders and minimising import cases infiltrating our community, and strengthening international confidence in our maritime hub.

Dr Lim Wee Kiak called for the rebate package for taxi and private hire drivers to be brought forward, which Government has followed up on.

Ms Mariam explained why when evaluating Singapore√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s carbon emission, we need to take into account of the fact that Singapore is a city state which provides aviation, maritime and chemical processing services to the rest of the world.

alexander_melchers,Singapore - because of smart policies and high discipline ! - has the luxury that we don‚Äôt have the Virus here and that people don‚Äôt die ! Therefore in Singapore it is possible that front line workers like in aviation and maritime can get vaccinated first! That is a hard earned privilege for the whole country to focus now on economic recovery! Most other (often Western) countries don‚Äôt have this choice ! Well done Singapore ! üá∏üá¨,2021-01-20T06:56:40.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CKOf-yajz6o/,2021-01-19T12:28:58.000Z,"I was at the launch of our Sea-Air Vaccination Exercise yesterday, during which I delivered a 10 min speech to explain why it is so important for our aviation and maritime workers to get vaccinated.

Changi air hub ecosystem has been working out the processes for months, with a specially set up Taskforce. One of the challenges they identified was to ensure sufficient supply of dry ice. So #SATS is now producing 4 tonnes of dry ice per day, on its own facility!

COVID-19 test results, and soon, your vaccination status, may become very relevant information at the check-in and immigration counters for cross border travel. But they will need to be easily verifiable.

Airlines are foreseeing this. So @singaporeair is working with International Air Transport Association (#IATA), and #Affinidi, a local technology company founded by @temasekseen, to start a trial on digital verification for COVID-19 tests and soon, vaccinations.

Accredited labs will issue a health certificate - a QR code on mobile or printed on paper - to passengers, to be scanned and verified easily and securely by airlines and immigration officers using an app.

Hopefully, with the support of IATA, various airlines and authorities around the world, this can become the norm, and replace the yellow book.

tex_manifould,Is the answer to every problem now an app?? Why not carry your yellow vaccination card with your passport? It‚Äôs worked for decades!,2020-12-23T11:51:27.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CJIIABsMiEi/,2020-12-23T04:31:51.000Z,"This is the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhealth certificate√¢‚Ç¨¬ù that may come in handy when you travel next time.

COVID-19 test results, and soon, your vaccination status, may become very relevant information at the check-in and immigration counters for cross border travel. But they will need to be easily verifiable.

Airlines are foreseeing this. So @singaporeair is working with International Air Transport Association (#IATA), and #Affinidi, a local technology company founded by @temasekseen, to start a trial on digital verification for COVID-19 tests and soon, vaccinations.

Accredited labs will issue a health certificate - a QR code on mobile or printed on paper - to passengers, to be scanned and verified easily and securely by airlines and immigration officers using an app.

Hopefully, with the support of IATA, various airlines and authorities around the world, this can become the norm, and replace the yellow book.

I applaud the industry√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s initiative. @motsingapore and #CAAS will support this as much as we can, to make this a regional or international practice. We are #OneAviation team.

Zoom cannot replace some face-to-face business meetings, e.g. signing agreements, or discussing with key teams, getting to know key partners in person.

Connect@Changi, will provide the first of its kind facility to enable such meetings to be carried out safely.

This is a national resilience project, led by @temasekseen, @surbanajurong, @changiairport, Ascott and SingEx.

This video explains how it is done."
