The attached graph shows the progress made in the maritime sector. 

The top horizontal line shows the number of frontline workers eligible - 18k. 

The first line bordering the blue area shows the number that got their first dose over the last 1.5 months. The number now stands at 17.6k, or 98% of eligible frontline maritime personnel. 

The second line bordering the green area shows the number who have received the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 16.7k have, and in the coming days, almost all would have. 

This means that substantially all frontline maritime workers will be vaccinated, and this is a major step in securing our borders and minimising import cases infiltrating our community, and strengthening international confidence in our maritime hub. 

I thank the various stakeholders - @maritime_sg, EDB, EnterpriseSG, SMOU, SOS, SSA, ASMI, @moh_singapore, Fullerton Health, maritime companies, and also workers and their families, for their tremendous support.

Dr Lim Wee Kiak called for the rebate package for taxi and private hire drivers to be brought forward, which Government has followed up on.

Ms Mariam explained why when evaluating Singaporeâ€™s carbon emission, we need to take into account of the fact that Singapore is a city state which provides aviation, maritime and chemical processing services to the rest of the world.

Ms Poh Li San spoke about how Singapore, despite its limitations, has set a good international example on sustainability and conservation.

Mr Vikram Nair had useful suggestions on how to encourage more people to receive Covid-19 vaccinations.

p_tsl,"I strongly disagree that we use “incentives “ in whatever form to encourage people to vaccinate. Vaccination is to protect oneself, our loved ones, friends, our community and ultimately out country. These itself is an incentive ! Otherwise it’s pure selfish behavior.

Citizens must learn to behave responsibly.",2021-02-27T10:13:37.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLypkdUstCH/,2021-02-27T09:56:04.000Z,"My fellow Sembawang GRC MPs spoke in Parliament during the Budget Debate over the last two days.

alexander_melchers,Singapore - because of smart policies and high discipline ! - has the luxury that we don’t have the Virus here and that people don’t die ! Therefore in Singapore it is possible that front line workers like in aviation and maritime can get vaccinated first! That is a hard earned privilege for the whole country to focus now on economic recovery! Most other (often Western) countries don’t have this choice ! Well done Singapore ! 🇸🇬,2021-01-20T06:56:40.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CKOf-yajz6o/,2021-01-19T12:28:58.000Z,"I was at the launch of our Sea-Air Vaccination Exercise yesterday, during which I delivered a 10 min speech to explain why it is so important for our aviation and maritime workers to get vaccinated.

They are our airplane and port pilots, cabin crew, cargo handlers, transit lounge workers, local seafarers, ship and plane repair technicians etc. 

Some 13,000 of them have registered to be vaccinated this week, and hopefully more will do so in the coming weeks as we step up the capacity of the two vaccination centres at @changiairport T4 and Raffles City to 8,000 a day. 

We aim to substantially complete the exercise within two months. 

These 37,000 workers come into contact with people and cargo from outside #Singapore. When vaccinated, they will not just protect themselves and their families, but they would have taken a big step to secure the borders of Singapore and keep us safe from COVID-19.

It reached our tarmac from Brussels this evening, on a @singaporeair cargo plane. From flight to delivery, a lot of preparation has gone into making this as smooth as possible, including a trial flight by #SIA.

Changi air hub ecosystem has been working out the processes for months, with a specially set up Taskforce. One of the challenges they identified was to ensure sufficient supply of dry ice. So #SATS is now producing 4 tonnes of dry ice per day, on its own facility!

It reached our tarmac from Brussels this evening, on a @singaporeair cargo plane. From flight to delivery, a lot of preparation has gone into making this as smooth as possible, including a trial flight by #SIA.

Changi air hub ecosystem has been working out the processes for months, with a specially set up Taskforce. One of the challenges they identified was to ensure sufficient supply of dry ice. So #SATS is now producing 4 tonnes of dry ice per day, on its own facility!

The real work starts now."

COVID-19 test results, and soon, your vaccination status, may become very relevant information at the check-in and immigration counters for cross border travel. But they will need to be easily verifiable.

Airlines are foreseeing this. So @singaporeair is working with International Air Transport Association (#IATA), and #Affinidi, a local technology company founded by @temasekseen, to start a trial on digital verification for COVID-19 tests and soon, vaccinations.

Accredited labs will issue a health certificate - a QR code on mobile or printed on paper - to passengers, to be scanned and verified easily and securely by airlines and immigration officers using an app.

Hopefully, with the support of IATA, various airlines and authorities around the world, this can become the norm, and replace the yellow book.

I applaud the industryâ€™s initiative. @motsingapore and #CAAS will support this as much as we can, to make this a regional or international practice. We are #OneAviation team.
