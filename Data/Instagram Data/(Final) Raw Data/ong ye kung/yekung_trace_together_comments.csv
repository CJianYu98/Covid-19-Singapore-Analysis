0,the_ceo_of_dawn_winery_45,But I need the token cos I am a student,2020-11-25T12:35:22.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIAkhRMM0vn/,2020-11-25T09:35:44.000Z,"The Community Clubs in #Sembawang GRC will begin the #TraceTogether token collection on Thursday, 26 November 2020 and Friday, 27 November 2020.

Remember: if we have downloaded the TraceTogether App, we actually don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need the tokens.

Try let those who don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use the TraceTogether App to collect the tokens first - such as the elderly and those without handphones. 

The collection will go on for at least two weeks, so there's plenty of time.

We have made arrangements such that you can go to your nearest CC to collect the tokens, even if the CC is in another Division served by a different MP. 

So if you live in block 301 and is part of Sembawang Central Division under me, you can collect the tokens at Canberra CC near your home, even though the CC is in Canberra Division under Dr @limweekiak.

Check out the schedule of collection here."

3,vivianng72,The collection timing ceased at 5.15pm. Very misleading. We thought it closed at 6pm as indicated. Wasted our trip there.
