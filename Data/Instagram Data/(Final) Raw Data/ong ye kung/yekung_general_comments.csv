mabelyje,Please put up more signs especially in the bus to ask people not to chit chat in the bus.🙏,2021-02-25T03:38:12.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLssQ_mD6Yk/,2021-02-25T02:25:07.000Z,"Without masks, droplets from a cough or sneeze on a moving train can spread to as far as 6 people away. 

With masks and other safe management measures, we can continue to travel safely on public transport. 

Watch this short video to find out more about the study done by @astarsg and @ltasg.

This study is part of a wider initiative by A*STAR and @temasekfoundation to study how transmission occurs in different settings, and thus improve our measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19."
melwu5057,I know that people tend to remove their shoes put their feet on the edge of the bus seat which can be unhygienic for the next person who came aboard the bus to find a seat to sit down,2021-02-25T06:36:02.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLssQ_mD6Yk/,2021-02-25T02:25:07.000Z,"Without masks, droplets from a cough or sneeze on a moving train can spread to as far as 6 people away.

So the hotel closed, and worked with @moh_singapore and CAAS to implement tighter procedures to keep the staff and guests safe. 

@cpchangiairport recently opened again. I visited them to see the changes. 

The hotel is now only open to foreign air crew, no staycations. 

It is divided into Green and Amber zones, depending on potential exposure to the virus. 

More measures were taken to ensure foreign air crew stay in their rooms, with contactless laundry and food delivery. 

Much care is taken to ensure staff working in the Amber zone wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and are properly trained. 

Some 180 staff have also gone for vaccination. 

What left me the strongest impression was the kitchen and restaurant. It is a Green zone, where staff prepares the food and packs them. Across the demarcation of the restaurant is an Amber zone, where staff in full PPE collect the food to be delivered to the rooms. 

I met the kitchen staff, Ms Thulasi, who just returned to work after being infected with COVID-19. She said her symptoms were fortunately mild, and she was in very good spirits and just got her vaccination. When she was down, all her colleagues were quarantined, and all the management staff chipped in to help cook and clean the kitchen. 

There was a lot of positive spirit in this hotel despite what happened. I think thatâ€™s why it has been voted the best airport hotel in the world."

A second evacuation flight followed a week later, with 174 returning home. 

In the year since, together with @singaporeair Group, we have brought home thousands of Singaporeans from all corners of the world. 

At the same time, we worked with our international partners so that foreign nationals could make their trips back. 

These operations required meticulous planning and close co-ordination, within and outside of Singapore. We are grateful for their support. 

It shows the unique Singapore spirit. We never leave our own out in the lurch. 

Today, many commercial flights are restored, and people can make their way home, go overseas to study or work. The situation is much better, and we have to continue to strive to restore our connectivity to the world."

In the year since, together with @singaporeair Group, we have brought home thousands of Singaporeans from all corners of the world. 

At the same time, we worked with our international partners so that foreign nationals could make their trips back. 

These operations required meticulous planning and close co-ordination, within and outside of Singapore. We are grateful for their support.

Given the evolving situation in Hong Kong, Secretary Edward Yau and I discussed further this afternoon, and decided that it would be better to defer the launch of the ATB, by two weeks. We will review within two weeks on the new launch date and update again. 

I can fully understand the disappointment and frustration of travellers who have planned their trips. But we think it is better to defer from a public health standpoint. The airlines will be contacting the travellers individually.

This is a sober reminder that the COVID-19 virus is still with us, and even as we fight to regain our normal lives, the journey will be full of ups and downs. But we will press on and look forward to when we can safely launch the ATB."

This is a sober reminder that the COVID-19 virus is still with us, and even as we fight to regain our normal lives, the journey will be full of ups and downs. But we will press on and look forward to when we can safely launch the ATB."

The latest additions join the list of places we announced earlier - rest of Australia, Brunei, New Zealand and Vietnam.

These are countries which have low COVID-19 incidence rates and strong surveillance programmes, with risk profiles similar to Singapore.

The number of visitors coming from these places are not large - 602 so far, and all have tested negative.

And we are discussing an Air Travel Bubble with Hong Kong. This is a first of its kind arrangement in the world, between two aviation hubs, for all travellers and replacing quarantine with testing. We expect it to start in Nov 2020.

All these are important moves to ready ourselves, so that when the world is ready to travel again, @changiairport will thrive and @singaporeair will soar again."

Notwithstanding the mistake, I have been very comforted that school attendance rates at Jurong West have maintained at over 90%. Students, parents and teachers have adapted well to all our precautionary measures â€“ calmly and with resolve to minimise disruptions to learning. 
 
We will not let up. Schools will take all necessary measures to keep schools safe, and allow learning to go on as much as possible. We are still in the process of adjusting to a stable new normal. Thanks to all parents, students and teachers for their understanding and effort.

It is a significant step. Most activities will resume, except certain larger scale ones with close interaction activities, that have potential to be mass spreading events. Social gatherings should have a maximum of five people. 
All the things we miss - sitting in coffeeshops or restaurants, bubble tea, tuition and enrichment classes, meeting up with boyfriends or girlfriends, can all resume. 
It took us a lot of sacrifice to get here, after a fairly long circuit breaker period, and a careful Phase 1 opening. But during this time, all of us co-operated, and we suppressed the virus transmission. 
From here, it is up to us again. We will all take care of our personal hygiene, adopt necessary precautionary measures, look out for one another. That way, we keep the virus under control in Phase 2. While we are all eager to meet up with friends and socialise, we will do so safely. No need to all rush out on Friday - everywhere will be full. Can take our time a bit, and ease into our social activities again. My daughter already told me I must wait for my Fatherâ€™s Day dinner. 
Schools will continue with our weekly rotation plan, and comprehensive safe management measures. We will bring all students back daily from 29 June. MOE will give more details soon.

gud_tama,"Really hope one day our country won't be a ""tuition"" country.  Students won't chase after grades and students won't have the burden of learning in school and having enrichment/tuition. Just like the story book, Toto Chan, students are allowed to study the subjects they like . Art, D&T, FCE be phased out and replaced by digital media, comics, anime and cooking workshops . Often than not, some teachers expect students to go into something new as though they have been cooking at home, like students already know they need to add less of what, more of what for a dish.",2020-06-15T15:46:34.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CBdWF3YnIr0/,2020-06-15T14:07:53.000Z,"You all heard the news: Phase 2 of re-opening starts this Friday, 19 June.

But the first step, on 2 Jun, should be a cautious one, to re-open schools safely. We will progressively bring back students to schools and Institutes of Higher Learning. 
How?

First, we will prioritise the return of those who need a higher level of care, like students in Special Education schools, as well as graduating cohorts who needs to prepare for national exams. 
Second, for students not in graduating cohorts, we will have a weekly rotation system so that different levels of students take turns to come to school and to do HBL. So for primary school, it will be P4 and P5 coming back to school and P1, P2, P3 doing HBL in week 1, and the reverse in Week 2. P6s will come back every day.

We aim to gradually have all students fully back in school after two cycles of weekly rotation, or four weeks.

We will also continue to support high needs students and children of parents who need to work and cannot find alternate childcare arrangement, and allow them to come to school on their HBL week. 
Many students will be excited to return to school. Parents may be looking forward to school opening too, especially if they have to return to work. But I am sure parents are also worried about their childrenâ€™s safety. Rest assured that we will take whatever precautions we can to ensure the well-being of all students and staff. 
Third, we will implement a stringent safe management system, including screening of anyone that comes into schools, good hygiene habits, group separation to prevent inter-mingling of students from different classes, and safe distancing which include the wearing masks/face shields by teachers and students.

But the first step, on 2 Jun, should be a cautious one, to re-open schools safely. We will progressively bring back students to schools and Institutes of Higher Learning. 
How?

First, we will prioritise the return of those who need a higher level of care, like students in Special Education schools, as well as graduating cohorts who needs to prepare for national exams. 
Second, for students not in graduating cohorts, we will have a weekly rotation system so that different levels of students take turns to come to school and to do HBL. So for primary school, it will be P4 and P5 coming back to school and P1, P2, P3 doing HBL in week 1, and the reverse in Week 2. P6s will come back every day.

We aim to gradually have all students fully back in school after two cycles of weekly rotation, or four weeks.

We will also continue to support high needs students and children of parents who need to work and cannot find alternate childcare arrangement, and allow them to come to school on their HBL week. 
Many students will be excited to return to school. Parents may be looking forward to school opening too, especially if they have to return to work. But I am sure parents are also worried about their childrenâ€™s safety. Rest assured that we will take whatever precautions we can to ensure the well-being of all students and staff. 
Third, we will implement a stringent safe management system, including screening of anyone that comes into schools, good hygiene habits, group separation to prevent inter-mingling of students from different classes, and safe distancing which include the wearing masks/face shields by teachers and students.

Second, for students not in graduating cohorts, we will have a weekly rotation system so that different levels of students take turns to come to school and to do HBL. So for primary school, it will be P4 and P5 coming back to school and P1, P2, P3 doing HBL in week 1, and the reverse in Week 2. P6s will come back every day.

We aim to gradually have all students fully back in school after two cycles of weekly rotation, or four weeks.

We will also continue to support high needs students and children of parents who need to work and cannot find alternate childcare arrangement, and allow them to come to school on their HBL week. 
Many students will be excited to return to school. Parents may be looking forward to school opening too, especially if they have to return to work. But I am sure parents are also worried about their childrenâ€™s safety. Rest assured that we will take whatever precautions we can to ensure the well-being of all students and staff. 
Third, we will implement a stringent safe management system, including screening of anyone that comes into schools, good hygiene habits, group separation to prevent inter-mingling of students from different classes, and safe distancing which include the wearing masks/face shields by teachers and students. 
COVID-19 will be with us for some time. Let us take the necessary steps and precautions, to regain our lives as much as possible."

raini222,"Hi Minister Ong @ongyekung , Can I please suggest for another review on whether all other kids not in graduating cohorts Not go back to school & continue HBL.. If not, it could be another blown up case again like the foreign workers cases.. as kids might not show much symptoms then pass it to their family, then on to others in the community and so on..!! It is a very scary thought.. & the poor kids.. and hospitals will just be utterly overwhelmed. We still have quite a few community cases & isn’t it better to be safe than sorry?

I can fully understand. This is an important milestone for you and your parents. But unfortunately, it is currently not safe to hold ceremonies. We donâ€™t want to trigger a cluster of infections. Then a happy occasion will become a tragedy. 
I never attended any of my graduation ceremonies. I was lucky to receive overseas scholarships for my Bachelorâ€™s and later my Masterâ€™s degrees. When I finished my undergraduate studies, I was immediately summoned to return to Singapore to serve my bond. Years later, when I finished my Masterâ€™s, I rushed back because our first baby was going to pop anytime. So again I missed my graduation. 
The first time I donned a graduation gown was in 2015, after I became Minister for Education, and attended NUSâ€™ Commencement ceremony as guest-of-honour. 
Today, I am just glad I had a good education and can put what I have learned to good use.  I have never lamented not having attended my graduation ceremonies. I missed them for reasons more important than attending them. 
In a similar vein, after 23 years of marriage, my wife and I hardly remember our wedding dinner or ceremony, but we remember the times we spent together and bringing up our children.

If you are in your final year, trust me, years from now, you will not miss the graduation ceremony. You will remember that you graduated in an extraordinary year in history, where the human spirit was put to the most stringent of tests, and kindness and love in our communities helped us pull through. 
But do mark the occasion at home with your loved ones. Take a nice picture and have a nice meal with your family. But I am sure you can come up with much better ideas to celebrate the occasion than mine.

You will remember that you graduated in an extraordinary year in history, where the human spirit was put to the most stringent of tests, and kindness and love in our communities helped us pull through. 
But do mark the occasion at home with your loved ones. Take a nice picture and have a nice meal with your family. But I am sure you can come up with much better ideas to celebrate the occasion than mine.

izehar,"the fact that many people are applauding you for posting this, is disappointing. You are a minister and your lack of empathy towards Poly and ITE students is really shown with this post. You say you can “fully understand” but you also say you’ve never attended any of your graduation ceremonies? You understand that that’s a contradiction right? What’s the point of bragging to us about your achievements? Just to tell us you’re above us and whatever you say is correct? Since we as students will probably not be heard, I urge other ministers or adults with feelings of empathy and compassion towards us to help us voice out. If this minister can post whatever he wants so can I, right? @ongyekung i have lost 100% of my respect towards you.

mooncrest.survivals,"As a graduating student myself, I fully understand your stand and agree that it would be for the best that ceremonies are not held. I think students need a reason to celebrate and showcase their achievements, so maybe we can explore more ways to give them the fame they need. Personally, I have no problem with the cancellation of the graduation ceremony, because I strongly believe that the friends I’ve gained, the lessons i’ve learnt and the knowledge and experiences I’ve equipped myself with through school, are my greatest takeaways.

jaedonlum,"hi mr ong, ur post is really well said. however, u cant assume all graduates are just like u. i think we are all different enough to find different values in everything. some of us might think that the ceremony is an important milestone and memory to have at this age. i dont think its very good to assume and have people to trust u, that years from now they will not miss the ceremony... like u said, u didnt attend the ceremony, maybe we could consider it as a factor to why this is of minimal sentiment value to u.all in all, i do get ur intention of this post which is to raise awareness to graduates by giving them an explanation to the cancellation and providing them a fresh point of view from ur side. however, i think the graduates all know by now the reason for the cancellation and they do not need another announcement and reminder that the virus is still out there. it is just the matter of a decision to be made for a postponement instead.nonetheless, we are all grateful for u to serve as our minister of education and i really do appreciate ur concern for graduates through this post! do keep urself safe from the virus as well! :)",2020-04-12T13:40:00.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-3DuUkHT2Y/,2020-04-12T00:13:27.000Z,"Several final year poly students have expressed to me their disappointment that there will be no graduating ceremonies because of COVID-19. 
I can fully understand. This is an important milestone for you and your parents. But unfortunately, it is currently not safe to hold ceremonies. We donâ€™t want to trigger a cluster of infections. Then a happy occasion will become a tragedy. 
I never attended any of my graduation ceremonies. I was lucky to receive overseas scholarships for my Bachelorâ€™s and later my Masterâ€™s degrees. When I finished my undergraduate studies, I was immediately summoned to return to Singapore to serve my bond.

The first time I donned a graduation gown was in 2015, after I became Minister for Education, and attended NUSâ€™ Commencement ceremony as guest-of-honour. 
Today, I am just glad I had a good education and can put what I have learned to good use.  I have never lamented not having attended my graduation ceremonies. I missed them for reasons more important than attending them. 
In a similar vein, after 23 years of marriage, my wife and I hardly remember our wedding dinner or ceremony, but we remember the times we spent together and bringing up our children.

If you are in your final year, trust me, years from now, you will not miss the graduation ceremony. You will remember that you graduated in an extraordinary year in history, where the human spirit was put to the most stringent of tests, and kindness and love in our communities helped us pull through. 
But do mark the occasion at home with your loved ones. Take a nice picture and have a nice meal with your family. But I am sure you can come up with much better ideas to celebrate the occasion than mine.

whatevanc_,"Mr Ong, on my first day of Poly, i remember walking into school, and saw the sign pointing to the graduation Ceremonies. I saw all my graduating seniors in robes with flowers and i thought to myself, hey that could absolutely be me one day. This thought was triggered again when I received my Freshmen Scholarship at the same ceremony as one of the diplomas. Hence when it was announced that graduation Ceremonies would be cancelled, it severely guttered many of us. We worked our butts off to get to this point.

haziqra,"Nah man, I will miss not having a graduation ceremony. I worked so hard just to get to where I am. I took the long way. From ITE to Poly. My friends are in the same boat, and we got through this storm together.For some, graduation means nothing, that it’s just for “for the ‘gram”. For others, it is a day where we can proudly shout and scream, “WE DID IT!” With our friends and family, who have supported us throughout.So I would suggest to postpone it to maybe end of the year.

The first time I donned a graduation gown was in 2015, after I became Minister for Education, and attended NUSâ€™ Commencement ceremony as guest-of-honour. 
Today, I am just glad I had a good education and can put what I have learned to good use.  I have never lamented not having attended my graduation ceremonies. I missed them for reasons more important than attending them. 
In a similar vein, after 23 years of marriage, my wife and I hardly remember our wedding dinner or ceremony, but we remember the times we spent together and bringing up our children.

If you are in your final year, trust me, years from now, you will not miss the graduation ceremony. You will remember that you graduated in an extraordinary year in history, where the human spirit was put to the most stringent of tests, and kindness and love in our communities helped us pull through. 
But do mark the occasion at home with your loved ones. Take a nice picture and have a nice meal with your family. But I am sure you can come up with much better ideas to celebrate the occasion than mine. 
Congratulations! #sgunited #stayhomeforsg"

kimfallingagain,"Im sorry Minister Ong, but I disagree. Many people find graduation a very important ceremony. For one to voluntarily not have graduation is different from 36 THOUSAND Students forced to not have a graduation. As a graduate if 2020, I think you have the wrong mindset. We have been asking to POSTPONE graduation because we know and understand AND are concerned about the safety of Singaporeans during this period. And we understand the measures are necessary to keep Singaporeans Safe. If you read the petition, you will see that. We are not a bunch of graduates WHINING about not having our graduation. But we are asking for your support to help us to POSTPONE graduation. Put yourself in the positions of graduates, their parents and the lecturers who have taught us over 3-4 years. The accomplishments. And the rest of Singaporeans, look, put yourselves in our position. If you were to have your graduation cancelled how would you feel as a parent or even as a student? Dont misunderstand us. We are not looking to have it DURING covid-19. But AFTER covid-19. To many of us, it really does not matter when we have it. Just as long as we have it when it is safe to celebrate with the nation. That is all, stay safe Minister Ong and all Singaporeans.",2020-04-12T04:55:01.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-3DuUkHT2Y/,2020-04-12T00:13:27.000Z,"Several final year poly students have expressed to me their disappointment that there will be no graduating ceremonies because of COVID-19.

I can fully understand. This is an important milestone for you and your parents. But unfortunately, it is currently not safe to hold ceremonies. We donâ€™t want to trigger a cluster of infections. Then a happy occasion will become a tragedy. 
I never attended any of my graduation ceremonies. I was lucky to receive overseas scholarships for my Bachelorâ€™s and later my Masterâ€™s degrees. When I finished my undergraduate studies, I was immediately summoned to return to Singapore to serve my bond. Years later, when I finished my Masterâ€™s, I rushed back because our first baby was going to pop anytime. So again I missed my graduation. 
The first time I donned a graduation gown was in 2015, after I became Minister for Education, and attended NUSâ€™ Commencement ceremony as guest-of-honour. 
Today, I am just glad I had a good education and can put what I have learned to good use.  I have never lamented not having attended my graduation ceremonies. I missed them for reasons more important than attending them.

triggerhappymui,"Hi Minister Ong,Please do reconsider giving parents the option to keep kids at home.  It really doesn’t make sense to on one hand,  call for draconian safe distancing measures and ironically, at the same time allow school to continue to run as normal albeit with measures and precaution.  It’s the biggest mass gathering in sgp right now.  Truth is, classes itself have at least 30/40 pax, and 300 at the cohort level.  It is almost impossible to maintain measures at all times.  Just drop by any school at any given day and have look at the lack of safe distancing at drop -offs and pick-ups as a case in point.  Kids may be less susceptible to the virus but are not entirely immune too.  They may also he asymptomatic carriers that go on to pass these to family members or others within their community.  Yes, it may not be inconvenient for working parents or parents of lower income brackets to miss work.  So pls make it optional.  Having schools open (even with caution) lends  little credibility to your argument.  There are always ways to tweak around a situation.  Pls look into it.  Thank you!",2020-03-31T13:04:00.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-RHQh1nDHO/,2020-03-28T06:33:12.000Z,Safe distancing with our volunteers.

COVID-19 test results, and soon, your vaccination status, may become very relevant information at the check-in and immigration counters for cross border travel. But they will need to be easily verifiable.

Airlines are foreseeing this. So @singaporeair is working with International Air Transport Association (#IATA), and #Affinidi, a local technology company founded by @temasekseen, to start a trial on digital verification for COVID-19 tests and soon, vaccinations.

Accredited labs will issue a health certificate - a QR code on mobile or printed on paper - to passengers, to be scanned and verified easily and securely by airlines and immigration officers using an app.

Hopefully, with the support of IATA, various airlines and authorities around the world, this can become the norm, and replace the yellow book.
