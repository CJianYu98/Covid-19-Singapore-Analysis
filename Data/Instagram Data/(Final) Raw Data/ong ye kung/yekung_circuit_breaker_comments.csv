For MOE, we will enter the four-week mid-year school holidays in May. The first two weeks will be protected time for teachers. This is something we always do, to allow teachers some time to rest and recharge, although we know many of them use the time to plan lessons and stay in touch with students. 
As for the following two weeks, √¢‚Ç¨¬™starting 19 May√¢‚Ç¨¬¨, schools will bring back students from graduating cohorts, i.e. Pri 6, Sec 4 and 5, JC2 and Pre-U 3.  We know that these students have been anxious about the preparation for their national exams, and that home-based learning cannot fully substitute face to face coaching and lessons. 
Their return to school will be done in a careful and calibrated manner, with ample safe distancing. They will come back in small groups, on selected days in a week, throughout the day, and will be spaced out within the school compound. They will meet teachers one-to-one, or in small groups.  Masks are compulsory. 
We will give priority to students requiring school facilities for coursework and practical sessions, as well as those who need additional support and remediation. 
Throughout the holidays, schools will also continue to engage students with greater needs and provide care for those whose parents work in essential services and are unable to secure alternative care arrangements.

keithtan_czh,"Sir, may I ask if MOE related internships will be moved to June as well. As I have a scheduled internship at HQ CPDD in May.",2020-04-21T14:12:53.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_Pn9zAHPne/,2020-04-21T13:11:54.000Z,"The Government has announced tighter measures during the circuit breaker period and extended it √¢‚Ç¨¬™from 4 May 2020 to 1 Jun 2020√¢‚Ç¨¬¨.
This will have implications on education. Do we extend HBL by another four weeks?
Our teachers, students and parents have been working hard to make HBL work. It hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been easy. The learning curve is steep for everyone. I thank everyone for your hard work, perseverance, patience and positivity.&nbsp;
HBL is a fall back when schools are suspended; it cannot be a prolonged substitute for school. It is better to let everyone have a break from this intense period.&nbsp;
MOE will therefore bring forward the June holidays to start √¢‚Ç¨¬™from 5 May until 1 Jun 2020√¢‚Ç¨¬¨. By √¢‚Ç¨¬™1 Jun 2020√¢‚Ç¨¬¨, hopefully the situation will be much better, and we can look forward to a safe and orderly opening of schools.
This would mean that Term 3 will be very long.&nbsp;So we will factor in an additional one week, mid-term break √¢‚Ç¨¬™from 20-26 July√¢‚Ç¨¬¨. The additional break of one week will reduce curriculum teaching time.&nbsp;We will therefore also make certain&nbsp;topics commonly taught by all schools at the end of the academic year be non-examinable. This will reduce the curriculum load and ease the pressure off teachers and students in catching up with the curriculum.
We will do two other things during the brought forward mid-year holidays:
First, our graduating cohorts need support so as to prepare for their national exams. For this coming mid-year holidays, our schools will continue to have them come back to school for face-to-face consultation and coaching when the national situation improves √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú which we are confident will be the case.√¢‚Ç¨¬®Second, there is also another group that needs support √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú children of essential workers and vulnerable students. They have been coming back to school during the circuit breaker period.&nbsp; Our schools will remain open for them throughout the mid-year&nbsp;holidays, to support them and their families.
It has been a topsy-turvy few months as the health situation has been very fluid and uncertain.&nbsp;I thank everyone for your hard work and co-operation.&nbsp; We shall overcome the virus.
And to all our students, I am very sorry bubble tea shops will be closed."

marjomik,Thank you Mr Ong and team for all the hours and effort in putting things in place for students and teachers....üëè also a big thank you to all teachers,2020-04-21T13:37:39.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_Pn9zAHPne/,2020-04-21T13:11:54.000Z,"The Government has announced tighter measures during the circuit breaker period and extended it √¢‚Ç¨¬™from 4 May 2020 to 1 Jun 2020√¢‚Ç¨¬¨.
This will have implications on education. Do we extend HBL by another four weeks?
Our teachers, students and parents have been working hard to make HBL work. It hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been easy. The learning curve is steep for everyone. I thank everyone for your hard work, perseverance, patience and positivity.&nbsp;
HBL is a fall back when schools are suspended; it cannot be a prolonged substitute for school. It is better to let everyone have a break from this intense period.&nbsp;
MOE will therefore bring forward the June holidays to start √¢‚Ç¨¬™from 5 May until 1 Jun 2020√¢‚Ç¨¬¨. By √¢‚Ç¨¬™1 Jun 2020√¢‚Ç¨¬¨, hopefully the situation will be much better, and we can look forward to a safe and orderly opening of schools.
This would mean that Term 3 will be very long.&nbsp;So we will factor in an additional one week, mid-term break √¢‚Ç¨¬™from 20-26 July√¢‚Ç¨¬¨. The additional break of one week will reduce curriculum teaching time.&nbsp;We will therefore also make certain&nbsp;topics commonly taught by all schools at the end of the academic year be non-examinable. This will reduce the curriculum load and ease the pressure off teachers and students in catching up with the curriculum.
We will do two other things during the brought forward mid-year holidays:
First, our graduating cohorts need support so as to prepare for their national exams. For this coming mid-year holidays, our schools will continue to have them come back to school for face-to-face consultation and coaching when the national situation improves √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú which we are confident will be the case.√¢‚Ç¨¬®Second, there is also another group that needs support √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú children of essential workers and vulnerable students.

We will do two other things during the brought forward mid-year holidays:
First, our graduating cohorts need support so as to prepare for their national exams. For this coming mid-year holidays, our schools will continue to have them come back to school for face-to-face consultation and coaching when the national situation improves √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú which we are confident will be the case.√¢‚Ç¨¬®Second, there is also another group that needs support √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú children of essential workers and vulnerable students.

This will have implications on education. Do we extend HBL by another four weeks?
Our teachers, students and parents have been working hard to make HBL work. It hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been easy. The learning curve is steep for everyone. I thank everyone for your hard work, perseverance, patience and positivity.&nbsp;
HBL is a fall back when schools are suspended; it cannot be a prolonged substitute for school. It is better to let everyone have a break from this intense period.&nbsp;
MOE will therefore bring forward the June holidays to start √¢‚Ç¨¬™from 5 May until 1 Jun 2020√¢‚Ç¨¬¨. By √¢‚Ç¨¬™1 Jun 2020√¢‚Ç¨¬¨, hopefully the situation will be much better, and we can look forward to a safe and orderly opening of schools.
This would mean that Term 3 will be very long.&nbsp;So we will factor in an additional one week, mid-term break √¢‚Ç¨¬™from 20-26 July√¢‚Ç¨¬¨. The additional break of one week will reduce curriculum teaching time.&nbsp;We will therefore also make certain&nbsp;topics commonly taught by all schools at the end of the academic year be non-examinable. This will reduce the curriculum load and ease the pressure off teachers and students in catching up with the curriculum.
We will do two other things during the brought forward mid-year holidays:
First, our graduating cohorts need support so as to prepare for their national exams. For this coming mid-year holidays, our schools will continue to have them come back to school for face-to-face consultation and coaching when the national situation improves √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú which we are confident will be the case.√¢‚Ç¨¬®Second, there is also another group that needs support √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú children of essential workers and vulnerable students. They have been coming back to school during the circuit breaker period.&nbsp; Our schools will remain open for them throughout the mid-year&nbsp;holidays, to support them and their families.
It has been a topsy-turvy few months as the health situation has been very fluid and uncertain.&nbsp;I thank everyone for your hard work and co-operation.&nbsp; We shall overcome the virus.
And to all our students, I am very sorry bubble tea shops will be closed."
