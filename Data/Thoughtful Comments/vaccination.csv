44,"Covid 19 no long term side effects? On the contrary, the long term side effects are clear at a personal and country level. Even if you are young and at a lower personal risk, you could still cause asymptomatic spread to your family, colleagues, etc. 

Then there is the side effect on society and the economy. The pandemic continuing until 2022 or whoever enough people are infected or vaccinated to achieve herd immunity is going to prolong the economic pain. I wouldn't expect the government to keep the stimulus taps open for another 2-3 years. 

The concerns about ""long-term risk"" do not factor these big picture considerations. Its not only about your personal risk. To have a full understanding of long-term risk requires a long term study. So ultimately its a risk tradeoff. Do I accept an unknown long-term risk, but one which isn't significant to the best of our knowledge, or should I be kiasee and wait for others to do first, so that they can do their part towards singapore achieving herd immunity. Meanwhile, I hope others will take the risk, since if enough others take the risk, I can benefit without taking it myself.

63,"> And there has been no evidence nor reasons to think that there are no side effects. Heard of asbestos? Fireproof material used for decades, until it was found it causes lung disease. And by the time people realized the link, millions of people had been exposed to it. Sometimes diseases and side effects can occur years down the line. 

Sure, I understand that. But I feel that these are risks we already take on a daily basis. It's simply not feasible to wait for years of testing before approving the usage of every single new technology. For every case of asbestos, how many other new technologies were rolled out to the public without years or testing and had no side-effects? Are you proposing that we conduct years of testing for every single new technology before implementation?

To be completely clear, I do understand the need to be cautious of new technology, especially those that are directly injected / consumed by humans. However I also do think that given the pandemic we're in, it makes sense to encourage vaccine adoption given that the phase 3 trial studies have concluded that it's safe for use. You might think that Singapore is currently under control, but in reality we are sacrificing a huge amount of resources and our economy to maintain this ""control"" without a vaccine.

80,"Medical professionals does not equal to virology experts or vaccine experts. Doctors get their information from scientist and other experts. 

The data is as sufficient as possible because they tested on a larger group of people. The reason they cut short the testing is because it became a matter of ethics to let the control group not have the vaccine during this pandemic as the control group was slowly increasing with the amount of infected people. 

Other type of vaccines has small pool of data hence they took longer. 

Phase 1 of the vaccine was to prove that it is safe. Phase 2 is to prove that it is effective in protecting against the virus. Phase 3 is to see that the virus has no long term side effects. As it is an emergency phase 3 cannot be completed. But phase 1 proves that the vaccine is safe for use.

And even if the vaccine is bad for some people. The rule of thumb for such things is the good of the many outweighs the good of one.

So going by reasoning: It would be more practical for GPs to stock SinoVac's CoronaVac, cos of the reduced likelihood of Vaccines going bad and not needing new equipment.

Not much study on that for now. 

And currently Pfizers phase 3 data was collected over a period of 2 months. Safety and efficacy cannot be established beyond that period of time but we generally assume it to be safe. 

If future doses are required to maintain immunity, will compounded doses result in a different safety profile? 

There is a reason why hcws may want to shy away from the mrna vaccine for now because they actually read medical journals and not pro vaccine messages from the mass media. 

Attenuated virus vaccines have been well studied. And we do know that the attenuated virus retains the trophism of the target virus (in this case, sars cov2).

So maybe don‚Äôt take immediately, wait and see. And yet somehow the doctor who says this is wrong in your world view because he should keep that opinion to himself? 

I mean all your responses have been saying that doctors shouldn‚Äôt be saying anything contrary about the vaccine even though they should be doing risk assessments. Risk assessment isn‚Äôt just about the immediacy of COVID, it‚Äôs also about the future. As an example, doing knee replacement. It improves quality of life now but it has to be replaced. That‚Äôs why doctors have to explain the risks to their older patients because if they outlive the replacement, they then have to be on wheelchair or undergo another surgery which is highly risky at an even older age. 

And couple that with the fact that Singapore has very low number of community cases now. Why is there surprise people are a lot more cautious about putting something into their bodies?",1,vaccination

468,Is this actually the reason Australia are waiting until March? I'm deeply sceptical of this because 3 months is almost nothing considering that these vaccines have been in trials for longer than that. To hesitate is not necessarily a reasonable response. The proportion of people that are going to have long-term health effects from covid (even young and healthy people) is going to be far greater than from the approved vaccine. So anyone seriously worried about side effects should probably be staying at home at all times to prevent themselves getting covid.,1,vaccination

473,"Long term side effects usually comes from long term use of a medication. It happens because the way modern medicine works. 

The body has lots of natural processes going on. Some of this processes, when out of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, can lead to disease. Drugs target aspects of such biological processes to bring it back to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, sometimes by blocking it, sometimes by enhancing it. 

Drugs are *small* molecules. The body doesn‚Äôt care about the atoms making up the molecule, the body cares about the *shape*. These specially designed drug molecules go into the protein (or other molecules) and do its ‚Äúmagic‚Äù, affecting the natural biological processes and bring it into balance.

One problem with this is that the body sometimes likes to reuse the same protein (or family of similar proteins) in different places to control different processes. A drug may unintentionally affect an otherwise unintended process(es) and cause long term unforseen problems.

Another problem is that a drug can target some completely unexpected target. As I said earlier, the shape is important. While a drug can be designed to fit a certain protein, there is chance that by coincidence, it can also hit some unrelated protein elsewhere and affect other processes and cause problems in the long term.

Also, ultimately, all drugs are poison and the only thing that differentiate medicine from poison is the dosage. Too much of an effect can be bad. There are drugs that can cause damage to organs at higher dosages, for example. 

Sometimes, the drug molecule itself can be chemically reactive, and can cause damage. Keep using it and you get long term damage. Rarely, if such chemically reactive drug damage the DNA enough over the years, people can even get cancer. Fortunately, people know some of the common reactive features and avoid those.

To complicate things, the body tends to do things to a drug molecule to make it easier to get rid of it. That thing can be inherently toxic (such as one of paracetamol/panadol‚Äôs metabolite), or it can have effects of its own.

There are a lot of ways for a drug to cause long term problems and side effects. However, does this mean mRNA vaccines can do so too? There are differences between mRNA and drug molecules and that makes things different.

Ultimately, mRNA is a naturally occuring information carrying molecule. You have it in your body and it comes in many different lengths. The mRNA in the vaccine is not going to be any more reactive than those you already have!

Compared to drug molecules, mRNA are huge. Things bind to sites on the mRNA, not really the other way around. It‚Äôs not very likely to trigger things you wouldn‚Äôt expect a normal mRNA to trigger.

Inherently, mRNA are not toxic, so that is one safe part.

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the viral product it encode for can target unwanted processes and cause effects, it isn‚Äôt something very likely. Given that mRNA is not very stable, it doesn‚Äôt stay for long and you are only exposed to the amounts injected. Even if the product is not harmless, it is transient and shouldn‚Äôt cause too much of an effect, and unlikely to cause a long-term one. Your body can take a bit of damage. You go out under the sun? Damage. Eat or touch stuff too hot? Damage. Etc etc.

It would be *far worse* to get the real deal, since the actual virus can replicate and make much much more potentially harmful viral proteins that a mRNA vaccine can cause your body to produce, on top of other problems associated with the actual covid virus.

To be honest, the most likely reactions are immune related ones and those most side effects are short term and not likely to be very harmful.

If you react very negatively to the mRNA in the vaccine and the protein it produces, I don‚Äôt think you would fare any better with the real virus.

The chances of the vaccine working as intended safely is high, probably better odds with that then the odds between mild and serious covid.",1,vaccination
