9,"That's a good qn. I can't really give a comprehensive answer to that, but I'll say it's definitely within the realm of plausibility. Lower traffic during peak hours due to WFH schemes and not running certain bus lines allows redirection of manpower and buses to other lanes. Trains would be the one seeing the bottleneck, although that's presuming that 3min frequency is optimum give and take, and we want higher frequency to translate to similar travel time. We can have more trains on hold in between lanes, but that will be on the expense of time to take a more preventive measure. 

I think we shouldn't translate higher frequency to being faster too. It's just spreading the people to break them apart from crowding spots such as bus stops and train stations. Perhaps then it may disincentive certain employers to call people back to workplaces if it's so troublesome to move around.",1,safe distancing

325,"And maybe the repercussions to our economy and rest of society will be much more than whatever Wuhan experienced. Unlike Wuhan, we don't have other provinces to channel supplies to us. Already other countries like Thailand are slowly turning off the tap on essentials like food. If we ""lockdown"" in the manner you suggest, how are we going to pay, and what can we offer in return? And if we *do* run out of these supplies we're gonna be in a *much* more sticky situation than with the virus alone. It's not trendy these days to mention this, but *thrashing the economy also results in loss of life*.

Then theres the issue of what a lockdown actually means. Its easy to say ""well, lets just give exceptions for essential services, like healthcare workers, people working in critical industries like water, telecoms etc"". But the devil is in the details: where do you draw the line? Obviously, clubs and pubs aren't essential. But what about hotels where you house the people in SHN: these need to be somewhat staffed as well, right? What about our military --- is that essential? And then you come to hawkers and restaurants: our frontline workers need to eat too, right? Even if you allow only for takeouts, the eateries still have to be open. Or our ports: we've got to ship in food and supplies from *somewhere*. Once you think about it further, you'd realize that after provisioning for these exemptions, you get something that is not too different from what we already have (and most certainly something that we're heading to).

And don't even get me started on the chaos which would ensue if this is declared immediately. If DORSCON orange already led to panic, what would a lockdown lead to? How do you enforce the lockdown against a tide of panicked people? Send the police and army? Will that make things better? This is one big reason why the G has been gradually ramping up measures (that is, increasing the shade of red in the orange).",1,safe distancing

499,"My unpopular opinion is that all these new rules were not properly thought through and hard to enforce. For example eating places need to maintain social distance but what about public transport? The reasoning I heard is that public transport is considered ""transient"". But from what I know, people finish their workday lunch in 15-20 mins and leave while a bus ride is easily 30 mins +. 

That's why I think we might as well bite the bullet and lock down. The Covid situation is fluid and we must adapt, just like how one moment we were told to support local attractions and the next moment to stay at home. Our infection graph was quite nice in Feb but started to spike once the overseas Singaporeans returned.

Singapore is a small country and our enforcement is good. From the generous budget, we know the govt can afford to pay full wages up to median salary for more than 2 mths (ie 25% salary over 3 quarters). With the borders as good as closed, just focus on clearing the virus from SG. Even if our curve has a long tail, I'll bet my last penny it will be shorter than the messy Europeans / Americans and our even messier neighbours.

With things under control, at least life can get back to some normalcy. Everyone will still have to scrape by, some are still screwed but at least we are not in this not-here-not-there limbo. During this time, the govt can also take the time to ponder how we ""leap ahead"" once the virus is over world wide.

Note: If you disagree with my opinion, that's ok. But rebut with thought out opinions and not just personal insults.",1,safe distancing
