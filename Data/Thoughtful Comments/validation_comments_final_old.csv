Rather than try to stop it, maybe the government could try for herd immunity at this stage.

385,"For those worrying about the safety, here's the Pfizer press-release,

>To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination.

And here's the Moderna one:

>The interim analysis included a concurrent review of the available Phase 3 COVE study safety data by the DSMB, which did not report any significant safety concerns. A review of solicited adverse events indicated that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Grade 3 (severe) events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first dose included injection site pain (2.7%), and after the second dose included fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), headache (4.5%), pain (4.1%) and erythema/redness at the injection site (2.0%). These solicited adverse events were generally short-lived. These data are subject to change based on ongoing analysis of further Phase 3 COVE study data and final analysis.

You usually expect any safety signals to manifest themselves with 7-21 days from the last dose received and from a safety perspective, they appear to be well tolerated.

The only thing time will tell is how long the efficacy lasts. The effectiveness of most vaccines wane over a period of time and that is where, in my opinion, data is lacking.",Vaccination,1,1,1,1,328,4,-11.830283021552757,48,10,1,0.5128960762641847,0

If every person in Singapore was vaccinated tomorrow and there was, say, a 70% efficacy rate, you would be left with 30% of the population who could potentially get infected. However herd immunity would make infection unlikely. Even if they were to get infected, the majority would not require hospitalisation. For those that did, and we‚Äôre down to small numbers now, there would be huge capacity at hospitals. If Singapore takes your ‚Äòzero risk‚Äô approach it will be left behind the majority of the world, who definitely will open up once there is an acceptably Low risk level.

>You yourself have said it‚Äôs about risk assessment. A doctor can give their risk assessment of whether a vaccine should be taken based on their informed opinions. What you‚Äôre really asking for is that all doctors should push the vaccination, which then means there is no proper risk assessment done.

I am not a doctor yet but I'll give you an example of doing an unbiased risk assessment without giving my opinions. At the end of this test you will find that ultimately I have not influenced you in anyway.

With regards to the Pfizer Vaccine, it is a new technology. Unlike previous vaccines where they introduce a inactivated virus into your body which would activate your immunity system to fight against this Covid virus. Instead of inject a virus, they inject a protein into your body. It is supposedly safer because you are not injecting a virus into your body. There is a fear (not a risk) that this protein may cause some autoimmune issues, this is an opinion of some people there is no data of this happening. The technology has been studied for decades but they have not pushed this to the markets. The reason is that this technology is an expensive solution to the traditional solution (they ultimately do the same thing) but from a market perspective it is largely unproven. Whether it is safe or not, nobody has enough data to conclusively tell you whether it is safe to take or not. You have to decide on your own. Known side effects for the vaccines are also common there may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site. Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination. These normal vaccine reactions are usually mild and subside after a few days.

Ultimately, you should decide to take an unproven vaccine vs trying to return to a time where there is no fear of getting Covid.",Vaccination,1,1,1,1,339,4,-10.673222169307055,66,13,14,0.3001126302713053,0

Thalidomide was a new drug a few decades ago and was recommended as a drug for hyperemesis gravidarium. Turns out it took them a few months to realise it actually caused birth defects. 

In recent history the dengue vaccine from Sanofi actually was associated with the deaths of over 600 phillippine children despite having been trialled extensively. It is believed that the mechanism was due to antibody dependent enhancement, or an overly exuberant immune reaction to the dengue virus if u will.

Mrna vaccines don't have that tried and tested safety record unlike inactivated virus vaccines.

There are concerns that the lipid nano particles used to encase the mrna can end up in unintended places and trigger off unhelpful inflammatory responses in certain organs.

As a side note, the phase 3 trial data from Pfizer was obtained only for 2 months! The safety and efficacy of the vaccine beyond 2 months cannot be established (not I say one. New England journal of medicine say one)

Sinovac vaccine may be from China. ASSUMING the data from them is reliable and trustworthy, I'd choose the inactivated vaccine for the time being. A known devil is better than an unknown angel, or something like that.

Of course, no one said otherwise. You can add in doctors arent nurses, if you want to make the point further

>	The data is as sufficient as possible because they tested on a larger group of people. The reason they cut short the testing is because it became a matter of ethics to let the control group not have the vaccine during this pandemic as the control group was slowly increasing with the amount of infected people.

Just because the situation didnt let them test for long term effects doesnt mean they dont exist, however. A wider sample is good, but doesnt cover that aspect
