120,"> For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April.

I think this is a global issue, not unique to Singapore, though I'd say it's a problem too. Wuhan had that two massive temporary hospitals. UK has NHS Nightingale (their equivalent of ""Expo hospital""). The world realised we are woefully unprepared/underprepared for a contagious pandemic.

> Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

The shelters thing might sound good, but even with a centralised location, we seem to have a manpower crunch in Expo (as seen by the article of a person who got sent there). What more if we start to decentralize quarantine facilities, you need to duplicate the manpower across Singapore and monitor more staff for unwanted spread (e.g. what if Kallang's quarantine center has an outbreak within their staff?). The more places you have, the more likely you could ""screw up"" the handling and accidentally spread it somewhere else.

I'd say that having Expo/Suntec/whatever equipped to be converted to quarantine facilities in a day/two should be our goal. Make it so that the fixed facilities/infrastructure (e.g. HVAC) is rated for quarantine use. I believe MOH has done this with things like the Community Quarantine Facilities (which is why quarantine was set up super fast).",1,circuit breaker

254,"\[Opinion\] Covid-19 exposes several problems/ weaknesses of every country. For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April. We converted places like [exhibition halls](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-more-than-18-000-bed-spaces-for-isolation-and-care-12683558) (Expo/ Changi Exhibition Centre) and army camps to cater to such needs.

Based on Covid-19's experience, we could expect new waves of it, or possibility of new diseases that might be equally or more contagious in the future (/slap wood). 

Thus, I was thinking that SG should consider building a fixed number of ""quarantine facilities"" in every town, like playgrounds/ parks etc in future towns (or added on to existing towns). It is similar to the idea of disaster shelters. Of course, in unused times, they could be used for other purposes, like those [shelters](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/home/civil-defence-shelter/types-of-shelter) in void decks.

Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

as the new york mayor put it: nothing is more serious than death. not even mental illness. if everyone feels like he/she cannot tahan, go out socialise or do whatever they want because they feel like they are going crazy, they are more likely to catch the virus and pass it on to people who actually do their part to safeguard the community.",0,circuit breaker

One thing that I find is a silver lining in all these, is that the government has finally recognized the importance of mental health, and places the official hotlines and resources quite prominently in their messaging. I work in an industry where it's not civil service but on the periphery, and I can see that the government messaging is taken seriously and my managers are all imploring us to take wfh seriously but at the same time lightly, take care of our own needs, use available resources if we feel our mental health is suffering. 

I'm not sure how many of the isolated migrant workers have access to a counsellor or therapist, but I'd place that as quite a high priority to address after their lodging, food, healthcare and other basic logistics are settled. Anyone has any information if such resources are provided for them? They are particularly vulnerable if they can't speak english and thus tap onto official government resources so I think it's a valid concern. 

Beyond that, I feel that allowing interaction is super important, for people who don't live within the same household. Beyond the immediate family situation that is addressed by phase 1, one thing that could have helped is for dating couples to be allowed to visit each other. The risk is marginal; the spread will be within 2 households even if theres a positive contact, the contact is easily traced (tracetogether, or log the visit to a special portal etc). With data analytics it's not impossible to quickly capture the source/destination, spatial and time dimension and mitigate the risk of an untraceable outbreak because the virus spread between households like STDs in a college campus.",1,circuit breaker
