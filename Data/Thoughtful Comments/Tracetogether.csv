[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing\_to\_hide\_argument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument)

Such topics will always get divided opinions. There will be people that trust the gov with handling of their TT data. There will also be people expressing doubts about security of their data or having privacy concerns.

In my opinion it's the gov's job to assure the latter group of people and gain their trust.

30,"The thing I've realized since my last post is that there are some people who will persist in posting misinformation or misrepresentations of what the app is, isn't and what your argument is and isn't. I would like to clear the air and make sure that the narrative here is one of constructive criticism rather than picking at useless minutiae of potential risk and 'principles' which are irrelevant to the topic at hand: To what extent should we be concerned about this app, and how beneficial can it be?

I AM NOT SPONSORED, OR A GOVERNMENT SHILL, as much as you'd love for that to be true. I am just excited that an app can potentially save thousands of lives, even millions, if we can prove it works and export this model abroad. I am convinced of its value and safety. 

They've claimed I am a shill/spy/whatever it is, they've claimed I don't know what I am talking about, they've claimed I am being defensive, etc, etc. I would like to take this moment to encourage everyone who is reading this and the post above to consider the following facts. 

This app was developed by a stat board. It is not made by the PAP, or indeed any political agency. They are staffed by people with very difficult-to-obtain degrees in IS, IT, and Comp-sci. If you fundamentally want to question their motives, that's fine. But the technology is sound and proven. 

**Safe anot?**

Encryption is a well understood topic. You use it daily for internet banking, logging in to reddit, surfing the web. Its nothing new to encrypt your information. It is very hard to steal information from your phone in ANY form, even so-called 'bluetooth snarfing'. The cost of attacking you is prohibitive in terms of time, exposure and potential reward gained. 99.999% of all people who will use this app have nothing valuable to steal from their phones. I agree there is a risk of such a thing happening, but in all likelihood? It will not happen. It is like being afraid of being struck by lightning. Can it happen? Yes. Will it happen? Extremely unlikely. 

**Why no open source?**

The government being the slow cumbersome beast it is are often staffed by people who know less than they should and yet are in higher levels of authority than other people who might have made better decisions. They may believe that not releasing the code is somehow more secure. There may also be proprietary/sensitive code involved in making this app. That is not to say that it is suspicious or is out to make money from you. It is just to indemnify themselves from potential risks. They have also stated that moving towards open source is something they want to do after this initial period. 

**Will it see if I go to geylang?**

No. It doesn't. Unless the Government pulls an MIB move with thousands of 'relay bluetooth stations' which is a fantastical idea at best, and absolute nonsense at worst. This was heavily upvoted in the other thread. I need to stress that while theoretically possible, if they actually do want to track everyone, there are less obvious and expensive ways to do so than that. This app specifically with regards to your movement does not enable the government to track you.

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360043224874-Can-TraceTogether-track-the-location-of-all-phones-installed-with-TraceTogether-

**I dont trust it, why should I install?**

This is more a philosophical debate than anything actually pertinent to the app, but allow me to default to a utilitarian argument: What number of infected cases would there need to be before you felt that this app was necessary? 100? 1000? 10000? What proportion of the population needs to be infected before you feel personally threatened enough to use the app for the sake, not only of yourself, but the old and those with pre-existing conditions around you? 5% of the population? 10%? 

I understand that before it becomes a problem you are wont to download this app and you'd rather have your privacy. Allow me to stress once again. It is safe, unless a state sponsored actor or billionaire playboy philanthropist comes in to try and track everyone. If you cannot understand the technology and have this fear, please read the FAQ below. I hope it can assure you of the good intentions and practices behind this app.

**Where can I read the declared intent and scope of the app and all relevant questions?**

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg

**Why are you so supportive of this app? You paid is it?**

I am actually very fearful personally of getting this virus, and I am fearful for loved ones getting the virus. Perhaps that is driving a deep sense of duty within me to control what I can. I have been sleeping much less for the last few days since the situation deteriorated My insecurities are probably one of the things which are fuelling this enthusiasm for advocating for a solution. 

I have seen few other solutions to this virus which are as simple and effective as this one. Do not mistake my enthusiasm for malice. I truly believe that if this app works the way it should, then we have a solution to COVID19 spread which helps ensure life continues to go on, without any lock down, and that we can contain the spread.",1,Tracetogether

58,"After reading the whole thread and OP's replies, I've found that OP has some skewed conceptions about the security aspects and concerns about this whole thing.

Firstly,

>A. Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. ""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.

Lmao. For someone who sounds so technologically informed, I was surprised when I realised what OP wrote when I read this for the second time. Sounds like OP is confusing the difference between hash and encryption, which should be a basic concept in the field of IT/Cybersecurity.

Furthermore, phone numbers in Singapore are 8 digits, and either starts with 8xxx xxxx or 9xxx xxxx. Brute forcing the combination with a self-made list containing all the possible phone numbers isn't really that hard to do, and won't take up a lot of time, considering the computing and processing power that computers have these days.

OP also replied to one of the comments by saying "" There isn't anything inherently scary about bluetooth"". Well, let me introduce you to [Bluejacking](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5045/bluejacking), [Bluebugging](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5044/bluebugging) & [Bluesnarfing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5046/bluesnarfing).

Building on what I've said earlier about Bluetooth, if some siaokia really wants to, he can build a malicious version of the app, and use it to extract the supposedly anonymous information, or modify the payload and send malware into other devices using Bluetooth.

OP subsequently said the following in another of his replies:

>And do you think in this time of a pandemic that cybercriminals are roaming about with massive bluetooth hijacking setups in order to walk next to what is potentially another virus carrier? You have to be within bluetooth range and you have to handshake with the right authentication or permission for bluetooth access. I would take my chances with that over the possible spread of COVID19, which is a clear, imminent danger and proven threat.

You'd be surprised. The value of the information may outweigh the risk of contracting of the virus to some, and some hackers would still take the risk of getting into a crowded idea just to hijack other devices. If they are that scared of the virus, they can easily minimise the risk by driving around in a car, carrying out a [wardriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving) bluetooth attack.

OP is also operating under the presumption that hackers won't want to go out and gather all that information/deliver malware during this period. That's like saying ""Oh I shouldn't leave my housedoor locked, it's too much of a hassle. It's COVID period now. who would want to break into my house, right?""

OP keeps insisting that he isn't some government employee, and that he isn't paid to do this. But with how much of a tryhard he is in this thread, I honestly doubt so.

I'm not here to discourage people from downloading the app, but I'm here to inform people of the potential risks that they're getting into by downloading this app/prolonging their use of bluetooth, and to point out OP's flaw in logic/misconception as well.

At the end of the day, the code is not open-sourced, so we can only speculate for sure.",1,Tracetogether

2. That said, MOH having the key doesn't make me feel any safer. MOH has had numerous breaches over the last few years putting their security measures and vigilance into question.
3. Further, in a nanny-like state in Singapore, it is not unfathomable that some guy in the investigative services decide that hey let's try to use this to check if some suspect us associated with XYZ. 
4. As much as I hate using this word, big data is actually a thing. While the app may not call home, knowing the location of just a few users it will be able to create what is effectively the geolocation of your phone.

For something a bit more immediate - everyone makes mistakes and police are no exception. What if because of TT you get wrongly dragged into an investigation? What if police make a mistake, or want to close case and use it to pin the blame on you? I would rather turn off Bluetooth than risk that.

In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods.

It seems like they're intent on forcing this SE+TT combo into everything down the line.


The review by the opensource reviewers also leaves much to be desired since the one I read basically said that a large portion of what goes in was not available for review, and their conclusion was that it may be necessary due to time constraints but should be subject to further review and a potential hackathon and then we hear nothing about it since. They also reviewed a first gen TT device, who knows what changes it has undergone in the last 3 months? 


If anything, the data seems to suggest that the community cases are decreasing and that it is no longer a matter of utmost emergency to implement TT that we cannot waste any time to review it for privacy concerns before rolling it out.

The token would reduce manpower demand for SafeEntry. Just show the token, may not need two people per entrance. Existing personnel could be redeployed to other closed entrances, reducing fire risks and improving footfall, or take up (tougher) jobs as SDA/digital ambassador. (Edit: this scenario is not in the cards for now as check in with the token will be facilitated with [the QR code at the back](https://support.safeentry.gov.sg/hc/en-us/articles/900002439963-How-to-check-in-with-TraceTogether-Token-). Only if businesses would be able to get some TraceTogether Bluetooth beacon could manpower decrease.)

A [growing consensus](https://ipvm.com/reports/temp-screening-effect) among Western health leaders of temperature screening being [ineffective security theatre](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/paging-dr-hamblin-temperature-checks-coronavirus/615190/) may mean an upcoming elimination of this requirement. This would cement the reduction in manpower for SafeEntry. 

We are currently not in the position of being pressured to increase mandatory SafeEntry to more stores or even public transport. Edit: SafeEntry is also ineffective for large venues where visitors spend extended durations, like malls, department stores, libraries, even some supermarkets. Asking everyone in the area during a certain time to track their symptoms for 14 results in a lot of anxiety in aggregate, especially in situations like the NTU failure. 

Fundamentally, TraceTogether information is accessed only if you ping long (and close?) enough to a confirmed case. If TraceTogether becomes mandatory for entry to facilities by private companies or law, minimising trips outside *which you are still supposed to do* would reduce the risk of you having your data accessed.

Contact tracing is best done without excessive interaction, and less reliance on faulty human memory. Bluetooth Low Energy was built for this.

I'm also heartened by the approach of storing the data as a local blob which never leaves your phone unless the user AND MOH both validate.

This is important to prevent false positives (DOS/spam attack vector) from pranksters by requiring MOH validation, and address concerns of Orwellian state sponsored surveillance by requiring user opt-in. If people have unaddressed security concerns, they won't install and we fail to get the critical mass needed for this to work.

In the Straits Times article
""When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.""

This stance just discourages people from installing, they can't be charged for not allowing release of information they don't have. 

Using this stick approach narrows the user acquisition funnel, for marginal enforcement gain at best. 
If a user has already installed the app, at the cost of battery life, system resources and privacy, they've already committed at some level, threatening prosecution to secure permission they've already implied at point of install, comes at the cost of turning many potential users off with draconian enforcement. 

That said, it's not stated on the CNA article, so that may not be the official policy stance. If that's the case, the Straits Times article should be corrected so it doesn't discourage installs due to fear of recrimination. 

In my opinion, it's better to set incentives by giving privileged access to critical and scarce services to people who use the app.
Eg: higher queue preference for testing and ICU given to people based on length of days running the app.

I understand these are in the plans (based on the lead's Facebook comments) , which would be great because the more eyes we have on the code, with adequate responsible disclosure, the global infosec community can help this improve, and reduce unforeseen bugs or exploits which leak or compromise user data and result in loss of confidence in the system.

Also, it allows other countries with less sophisticated contact tracing infrastructure & manpower to leverage on this work to secure their populations. Safer neighbours means less imported cases and helping them helps us eventually.

Leveraging TT data improves security (in the form of more effective investigations, I guess) yes, but it comes at the cost of sacrificing privacy, and more worryingly exposes you to abuse of power.

(a) what TT data is there that it is useful for such purposes? Handshake data alone cannot possibly be sufficient. If the crime happened in the unit next to mine and I was in handshake range 

(b) Is there a difference between TT data from app vs token? If token has no GPS functionality or any other data functionality then the only way more useful data can be extracted is from TT app. Our phones have GPS etc.

***To limit tracking, it's possible that uninstalling TT app and using the TT token would be best.***

Let's note the specific language Viv uses

""Dr Balakrishnan also said that once the Covid-19 pandemic is over and when TraceTogether is no longer needed, the Government will ""most happily and cheerfully"" stand down the programme.""

Combination of 2 very hard to foresee conditions. Pandemic over and combined with the very subjective ""no longer needed"". 

Is there any commitment to end the TT programme? No. In fact the term used is ""stand down"". Where there is opportunity to use simple language - e.g. We will end the programme - but choose not to, worries me.

476,"And how is this ""total surveillance""?

Real totalitarian states don't need everyone to carry hardware. Advances in AI, facial recognition, and other such technologies have already enabled mass surveillance techniques far more easy than having everyone carry a microchip. If I want to catch the next Jolovan Wham, why not just hook up the many government CCTV feeds islandwide to such a system that immediately flags suspicious people and meetings? Plenty of companies selling this stuff, we can just buy it off the shelf, and all can be done quietly in the background long before this crisis and with the few involved personnel sworn to OSA.

""Why give them one more tool?"" Because that isn't actually useful for repression? I don't see how you're ""giving up information more readily than you need to"" when your mere presence in a place can be used as information against you without needing you to trade in a token or something. It's the kind of clumsy solution some bureaucrat would dream up if they didn't know just what the government's real capabilities were.",1,Tracetogether

479,">If somehow, lets say you have no known prior community spreads, and you possibly sat next to an infected person. 

That's the contradiction I pointed out in my OP. If I sat next to an infected person, it is unlikely that they have the app and that they are aware that they are infected in the first place.

If they had the app, they are unlikely to leave their quarantined premises. Why?

Putting the idea of ""I will be caught leaving my house if I use this app"" aside, we need to keep in mind that this person downloaded this app with the reason to reduce the spread of the virus. Hence my assumption.

It doesn't make sense that someone would download this app *and* leave their quarantine zone. Otherwise, my question of ""Had there been many cases where someone was caught breaking quarantine? "" is still valid.

If ""time"" is your point here, there is a 14 day incubation period [or more](https://www.businessinsider.sg/wuhan-coronavirus-symptoms-24-days-after-infection-2020-2?op=1&r=US&IR=T) for someone to be infected without major symptoms. This doesn't help with time.

Other than that, it does make sense that this app is to reduce the time to locate those who were contacted by the infected.

Your point of making it easy for contacts to be found as well as my idea of notifying contacted people to visit the doctor could definitely be made clear on the website to increase the probability of downloads.",1,Tracetogether

493,"Say a crime was committed.

You are innocent and were not involved.

You get questioned about your whereabouts on X particular day but deny being at the scene of the crime because you forgot you passed through it that day. You may also want to conceal your location that day, maybe you were meeting your mistress and you don‚Äôt want it to come out to your wife you were meeting her there.

For whatever reason, whether to lie intentionally or just because you can‚Äôt remember, you say you were not at the scene of the crime.

Police now check your tracetogether data and found you were indeed there.

They previously had nothing much to go on and if you had declared your location honestly but otherwise no motive etc they might have passed on you.

But now you have lied to a police officer about your location of the crime! Everything can and will be used against you in a court of law!!

In an attempt to explain yourself you admit in court you hid it because you wanted to hide your whereabouts with your mistress from your wife. Now it comes out in the news and boom your marriage is over. You also lose your job.
