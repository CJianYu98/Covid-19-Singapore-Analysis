120,"> For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April.
 
 I think this is a global issue, not unique to Singapore, though I'd say it's a problem too. Wuhan had that two massive temporary hospitals. UK has NHS Nightingale (their equivalent of ""Expo hospital""). The world realised we are woefully unprepared/underprepared for a contagious pandemic.
 
 > Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".
 
 The shelters thing might sound good, but even with a centralised location, we seem to have a manpower crunch in Expo (as seen by the article of a person who got sent there). What more if we start to decentralize quarantine facilities, you need to duplicate the manpower across Singapore and monitor more staff for unwanted spread (e.g. what if Kallang's quarantine center has an outbreak within their staff?). The more places you have, the more likely you could ""screw up"" the handling and accidentally spread it somewhere else.
 
 I'd say that having Expo/Suntec/whatever equipped to be converted to quarantine facilities in a day/two should be our goal. Make it so that the fixed facilities/infrastructure (e.g. HVAC) is rated for quarantine use. I believe MOH has done this with things like the Community Quarantine Facilities (which is why quarantine was set up super fast).",Circuit Breaker,1,1,0.0,1,268,4,-11.278340418343879,56,8,8,1.270501646079257,0

254,"\[Opinion\] Covid-19 exposes several problems/ weaknesses of every country. For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April. We converted places like [exhibition halls](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-more-than-18-000-bed-spaces-for-isolation-and-care-12683558) (Expo/ Changi Exhibition Centre) and army camps to cater to such needs.
 
 Based on Covid-19's experience, we could expect new waves of it, or possibility of new diseases that might be equally or more contagious in the future (/slap wood). 
 
 Thus, I was thinking that SG should consider building a fixed number of ""quarantine facilities"" in every town, like playgrounds/ parks etc in future towns (or added on to existing towns). It is similar to the idea of disaster shelters. Of course, in unused times, they could be used for other purposes, like those [shelters](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/home/civil-defence-shelter/types-of-shelter) in void decks.
 
 Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

 One thing that I find is a silver lining in all these, is that the government has finally recognized the importance of mental health, and places the official hotlines and resources quite prominently in their messaging. I work in an industry where it's not civil service but on the periphery, and I can see that the government messaging is taken seriously and my managers are all imploring us to take wfh seriously but at the same time lightly, take care of our own needs, use available resources if we feel our mental health is suffering. 
 
 I'm not sure how many of the isolated migrant workers have access to a counsellor or therapist, but I'd place that as quite a high priority to address after their lodging, food, healthcare and other basic logistics are settled. Anyone has any information if such resources are provided for them? They are particularly vulnerable if they can't speak english and thus tap onto official government resources so I think it's a valid concern. 
 
 Beyond that, I feel that allowing interaction is super important, for people who don't live within the same household. Beyond the immediate family situation that is addressed by phase 1, one thing that could have helped is for dating couples to be allowed to visit each other. The risk is marginal; the spread will be within 2 households even if theres a positive contact, the contact is easily traced (tracetogether, or log the visit to a special portal etc). With data analytics it's not impossible to quickly capture the source/destination, spatial and time dimension and mitigate the risk of an untraceable outbreak because the virus spread between households like STDs in a college campus.",Circuit Breaker,1,1,1.0,1,312,4,-11.028439242553755,58,16,8,0.8919460844354814,0

871,"To add on to your point, even if the government was deliberately lying because they knew they didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have enough masks for everyone, the problem is basically that of the boy who cried wolf. You have public organisations like schools who take guidance from the government when it comes to this sort of thing. If they say no masks, then the schools are not going to enforce the wearing of them. You may also have teachers who end up reinforcing the same wrong messaging to the students, or who want to wear masks but are concerned it may lead to send the wrong messaging to others. 

So we have situations where teachers and students are facing each other the entire day, without face masks, because we trusted the government. It just didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t help their (and our) credibility. 

Second, as a teacher, I will say that the best time to close schools and implement a CB would have been right at the start of the March holidays. To me, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not even hindsight, just plain common sense. You give everyone a grace period of a week to get ready what they need to prepare (eg: childcare arrangements for parents, teachers get time to prepare for HBL). Instead, the most moronic thing that could happen was that people continued to travel overseas (because what else would they do during the holidays?), despite knowing that we were in the midst of a pandemic, and the government said or did nothing! 

It was only after the holidays were almost over, that the govt slap a retroactive 2-week SHN notice on everyone who had left the country. But schools still remained open, so schools were taxed because you had staff who couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t show up for work, teachers were taxed because they had to prepare online lessons for students who didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t show up for school, on top of conducting their normal classes. 

The situation was just messy and chaotic and it was clear the various ministries were not coordinating with one another. 

It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s easy to say that the government only did one or two things wrong, but these have ripple effects that affect a lot of other organisations and people, and us on the ground bore the brunt of the fallout.

> SAVING BUSINESSES AND JOBS

> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Thursday said in Parliament that with the scale of the COVID-19 crisis, the Government may not be able to save every business and job, but it will continue to support every worker.

> As some jobs ‚Äö√Ñ√∫may never return‚Äö√Ñ√π, Mr Heng urged mid-career professionals to consider changing industry and taking pay cuts to put themselves ‚Äö√Ñ√∫in a better footing‚Äö√Ñ√π after the crisis.

> He also called on companies to be ‚Äö√Ñ√∫receptive‚Äö√Ñ√π to hiring mid-career workers, who come with their ‚Äö√Ñ√∫wealth of experience‚Äö√Ñ√π.

> The COVID-19 pandemic has dragged Singapore‚Äö√Ñ√¥s economy into its most severe downturn since independence, as the Ministry of Manpower recorded 11,350 retrenchments in the first half of the year.

> According to the ministry, this is higher than the 10,120 recorded during the SARS period, but still lower than other recessionary peaks.

> On Thursday, the Transport Ministry also announced that Singapore and Hong Kong have reached an in-principle agreement to establish a bilateral air travel bubble.

> This means that those travelling under the bubble will have no restrictions on their travel purpose and will not need to have a controlled itinerary. Travellers will also not be subject to quarantine or stay-home notice requirements.‚Äö√Ñ√£‚Äö√Ñ√£‚Äö√Ñ√£‚Äö√Ñ√£‚Äö√Ñ√£‚Äö√Ñ√£‚Äö√Ñ√£

> However, travellers will need to test negative on mutually recognised COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. They will also be required to go on flights dedicated for those travelling under the bubble.

> Dr Leong, Prof Hsu and Prof Tambyah all cited Prof Dale Fisher, chair of infection control at the National University Hospital, who spoke about a shift in diagnostic criteria at the dormitories during a CNA interview on Saturday.

>""The numbers are not really coming down. It's a function of the tests. In some of the dormitories, the infection rate or the positivity rate of the tests is so high, you get to the point where you don't need to test anymore,"" said Prof Fisher.

> He added that instead, those with clinical respiratory illness in such sites are almost certain to have Covid-19, and are placed into isolation straightaway.

>ST has contacted the MOH for more information.

>**Agreeing with Prof Fisher, Dr Leong said the strategy will ""save lives and save resources"", but also artificially suppress numbers.**

Don't forgot that if you actually read the regulations, you will see that it is mandated by law for every dorm to have common areas for recreation; rooms to hang their clothes; sick bays and even wifi.

> SINGAPORE: A resident of a migrant worker dormitory has become Singapore‚Äö√Ñ√¥s first likely case of COVID-19 re-infection, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday (Feb 6).

> 

> The case is a 28-year-old Bangladeshi work permit holder who lives in a dormitory at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Apr 12 last year, and on Jan 25 this year, he tested positive again.

> ""He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH‚Äö√Ñ√¥s surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their postinfection immunity,"" said the ministry.

> When the man was confirmed to have had COVID-19 last year, he was identified as Case 2513 and was part of the cluster of infections at Tech Park Crescent dormitory, which is located at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> He recovered from that infection and tested negative for COVID-19 from last June onwards.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> However, the man tested positive for COVID-19 once again on Jan 25 this year and he was isolated. ""Numerous repeat tests conducted subsequently were also positive for the virus,"" said MOH on Saturday.

> 

> The man's new infection was not previously stated in the ministry's situation reports. CNA has sought further information from MOH.

> 

> In its press release on Saturday, MOH said the man reported feeling unwell on Jan 22 and 23, but was otherwise asymptomatic.

> Advertisement

> He is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and all his identified close contacts have been isolated and quarantined. None have tested positive for COVID-19 so far.

> 

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫While re-infection is rare, the expert panel, which comprises infectious diseases and microbiology experts from NCID, Singapore General Hospital and the National Public Health Laboratory, has assessed that the clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that this is a likely case of re-infection,‚Äö√Ñ√π MOH said.

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫In addition to his positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results, there was a corresponding marked increase in antibody titres compared to the period prior to the likely re-infection, suggesting that he was exposed to a new infection which boosted his antibody levels.

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The virus detected in his samples taken in January 2021 is also genetically distinct from that associated with the dormitories outbreak in 2020, suggesting that this is likely a different and new infection.‚Äö√Ñ√π

> 

> MOH said it will continue to monitor recovered COVID-19 cases to determine their post-infection immunity. No significant loss of post-infection immunity has been detected among recovered workers in dormitories so far.

> ""Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of the benefit of hindsight.""

> In a press conference on Apr. 9, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that if he had known about how cases in foreign worker dormitories would later ""explode"" into big clusters, he would have done things differently.

> Wong was responding to a question asking if there anything that could have been done to avoid having to quarantine thousands of migrant workers.

> Cases in dormitories becoming large clusters

> ""The virus is moving so quickly. If I'd known, I would have done things differently. But no one can tell the next step.""

> Wong said that it was a very ""unpredictable"" situation where the virus spreads very quickly.

> He pointed out that previously, there have been cases in foreign worker dormitories. However, they ""never exploded into big clusters.""

> ""But this time it happened,"" he said.

> Wong also explained that a single lapse by an individual who continues to go to work, and interact with others, can easily end up spreading the virus to many others.

> He emphasised a need for a proper system to screen these foreign workers, and separate the sick from the healthy.

> To contain the spread of the virus across the dormitories, Wong said that they have to put in all the resources they can muster.

> Covid-19 update on Apr. 9

> On Apr. 9, the Ministry of Health announced a record 287 new cases of Covid-19 infections in Singapore. This is the highest daily jump to date.

> Over 200 of the new cases are linked to foreign workers residing in dormitories.

> At a press conference on Apr. 9, Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak also announced that they have established preliminary links between the Mustafa cluster, the Project Glory construction site, and five foreign worker dormitories (including S11 Dormitory).

> The total number of cases in Singapore stands at 1,910, as of 12pm on Apr. 9.

1153,"""Now with quick mental math that death rate comes out to around 1% which is several orders of magnitude higher than singapores""

Several orders of magnitude? Are you sure?

Singapore had 59732 cases and 29 deaths, a death rate of 0.048%

New Zealand had 2324 cases and 25 deaths, a death rate of 1.07%

1.07 / 0.048 = 22.3

New Zealand's death rate appears to be about 22 times higher.

Some estimates put the death rate for 20-40 year olds around 0.1%, and given the overwhelming majority of cases in Singapore fall into this age group that can probably explain a 10 fold difference between Singapore and New Zealand. I don't see why differences in healthcare, testing and a myriad of other variables we aren't aware of can't explain the remaining two fold difference.

1259,"The workers were unemployed during the CB period because local businesses were not allowed to operate. That's what led to our local economic crisis. Not a closure of borders, but because shops were not open for people to spend money.

I mean, look at the current situation. Our borders are still closed (more or less), but many businesses are still able to operate (shopping malls are packed), people are still able to WFH and connect with foreign businesses via Zoom or Webex, and life goes on.

Here's what I believe would have happened had we closed our borders earlier like what Taiwan did. It's like when a company recalls all their products because a small batch may be faulty. It's extreme, but you know that you won't have any more cases because of it. You can then focus on managing the issue internally, without having to worry about what's happening beyond your shores.

Yes, there would be companies that would suffer like SIA and tour agencies, but the amount of money that would need to be channeled towards propping them up would be a drop in the bucket compared to the 92 billion spent in total. Or just let them close, like what happened with Robinsons.

So people can't come in and out of Singapore (at least not easily). We can still import food and other necessities. The government would be able to focus all their energies on managing the dormitory situation because their attention is not split between 2 battles on two different fronts. We may not even have needed a CB in the first place if the cases were coming mostly from the foreign workers (whom the government continued to confine in the same places anyways).

Sometimes, all it takes is one wrong decision to have a domino effect. This may have been it. The decision to take China and the WHO at their word. And we have been paying for that mistake ever since.

Isn't this a convoluted reasoning? You are looking at it specifically from a time frame whereby it augments your statement.

ie There is community spread. The community spread has ALREADY reach the dormitory. Therefore an earlier lockdown, regardless, will still spread among the dormitory resulting in huge case numbers because of the conditions. Basically the only way for your statement to be true, you need a first spark to start the fire.

However, when ppl are talking about earlier lockdown, ppl meant it as a whole, to even prevent community spread(dormitory being an ideal hotspot does not equate to the virus will travel there by themselves) .

> SINGAPORE: Foreign domestic workers (FDWs) should avoid congregating in large groups on their rest days as Singapore moves into Phase 2 of its reopening, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday (Jun 17).

> 

> Previously, such workers had been advised by the ministry to stay at home during their rest days in the first phase of Singapore's post-""circuit breaker"" reopening.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> In its advisory to employers on Wednesday, MOM outlined ""appropriate arrangements"" for foreign domestic workers during the next phase of reopening, adding that the advisory would ""remain in force until withdrawn"".

> These arrangements include seeking the consent of employers for taking rest days on a weekday, maintaining safe distancing measures and downloading the TraceTogether app.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""FDWs who wish to spend their rest days outside should seek the consent of their employers to do so on a weekday when public spaces are less crowded,"" said MOM.

> They should also inform their employers of their whereabouts, said the ministry, adding that workers are also strongly encouraged to download and activate the TraceTogether app to facilitate contact tracing.

> While out on their rest day, foreign domestic workers are also advised to continue adhering to safe distancing measures, said MOM. These include:

> 

> Wearing a mask and maintaining a safe distance from one another

> Observing good personal hygiene and avoiding sharing food, drinks and other personal items

> Reducing their time spent outside and limiting the number of contacts that they meet

> Complying with safe distancing measures at malls and public places and not gathering in groups of more than five

> The ministry also advised workers not to ""gather or loiter in public spaces"" or visit crowded places such as City Plaza, Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza.

> For those who want to remit money at these places, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has already advised remittance agents that they should schedule appointments with clients, said the ministry.

> Alternatively, foreign domestic workers are encouraged to conduct remittance via electronic platforms.

> MOM said it would be carrying out inspections on the ground, and would disperse large groups and outdoor gatherings.

> Those who do not cooperate risk being fined and having their work passes revoked.

> ""As we all adapt to the new normal, it is important to maintain open communication with your FDW and help your FDW understand the above guidelines and requirements,"" said MOM.

> ""Our community needs to stay disciplined and vigilant ... so that all our efforts so far to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are not wasted.""

> On Monday, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force announced Phase 2 of Singapore's reopening, after the country exited a two-month-long circuit breaker designed to limit the spread of COVID-19.

> Phase 2 will involve the resumption of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫most activities‚Äö√Ñ√π, subject to safe distancing principles.

> 

> Small gatherings of up to five people will be allowed to resume, along with dining in at food and beverage outlets. Retail businesses may also reopen their physical outlets.

> 

> By Phase 3, social, cultural, religious and business gatherings or events should be able to resume, although gathering sizes will still have to be limited in order to prevent large clusters.

Places like the US where a very large portion of the population is deficient in vitamin d would explain one of many reasons why the death rate is higher per 110,000 people  than places like singapore.



Then add the fact people are working from home and not going outside (sunlight = vitamin D) as much because of lock downs which will only make some people even more deficient in vitamin d.



 Then add obesity rates, high cholesterol, diabetes and a host of other issues as well.

1451,"Again, this is capitalism. If  the govt is doing the work in coming up with ideas and solutions to keep construction companies profitable, then is it really capitalism? Might as well keep the profits for ourselves then. The solution on our end is just set the minimum requirements, then let the market decide for themselves how they want to work things out. Its the same with other forms of regulations we have. Take the example of internet banking that is happening right now. Govt sets the minimum requirements and the private sector competes with each other for the license and figures it out for themselves how to get it done. We dont have to go into detail to tell them how to do it. You want government to provide them with programmers and coders and customer support staff? No. You set the floor, and let the companies do the work. That's the point of capitalism.

And if it ends up making things harder for the FW, then we adjust and try again. Policy is always open-ended in that sense.

Edit: Speaking of economics, the pertinent problem here is that  these companies are causing a negative externality in the form of higher spread of disease.

1473,"I truly believe this is a cumulation of public infrastructure bidding practices, demand for lower cost projects by all parties, high land cost, and lack of innovation in the construction industry both in Singapore and as a whole.

The government is the biggest developer in singapore due to infrastructural contracts. They also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure. Some news reports here: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116)

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins. [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/govt-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/govt-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders)

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

1493,"One possible way is to reduce the reliance on foreign workers. Of course the counter argument is that it is easier said than done. I agree that certain field like the construction field require more manual labour etc and yes we definitely need foreign workers to contribute to our economy. However, do we need such a huge amount of them ? Or are they here because corporations want them here to maximise their profits ?  When we were in the early 2000s they were here mainly for construction and S&CC services. However, more and more came to roles such as building maintenance and marine services. I believe some Singaporeans would be willing to take on such roles if not for the otherwise poor salary given as corporations wants to keep their expenses low to maximise profits and the easier option is to choose the foreign worker option.

In the view of improving living conditions, it might be necessary to build more dormitories but they could still be built at areas where the population doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t resides. If we have to settle them at offshore facilities or floating dormitories then so be it. Also, cleanliness of shared areas could be enforced. I wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t dare to make the assumption that their living spaces is same as what the SAF provides but I would dare to say that it is at least comparable. Why are shared areas and living spaces in bunks way better than what the FWs are living in ? I think it boils down to discipline. Some SAF bunks have 8 double decker beds in a single room and yet the area is still clean af. The question is, are they committed to clean up after their own?

1520,"> # Measures to tackle COVID-19 cases in dorms early on were 'insufficient': Teo Chee Hean

> SINGAPORE ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore‚Äö√Ñ√¥s migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures ‚Äö√Ñ√∫turned out to be insufficient‚Äö√Ñ√π, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

> During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.

> In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date. Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫On 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,‚Äö√Ñ√π said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫However, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.‚Äö√Ñ√π

> While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫no two crises are the same‚Äö√Ñ√π, Teo said. The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is ‚Äö√Ñ√∫a major challenge‚Äö√Ñ√π, he added.

> On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫But they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines‚Äö√Ñ√π, he noted.

> The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH‚Äö√Ñ√¥s overall medical support plan.

> Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak. About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,‚Äö√Ñ√π he added.

> Teo‚Äö√Ñ√¥s delivery is the third in a¬¨‚Ä†series of national speeches¬¨‚Ä†by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister¬¨‚Ä†Lee Hsien Loong¬¨‚Ä†last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday. Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing is scheduled next to deliver his speech on Sunday.

> In his speech on ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Resilience in a changing external environment‚Äö√Ñ√π,¬¨‚Ä†Teo also spoke at length about Singapore‚Äö√Ñ√¥s efforts in providing community care facilities for patients who have mild or no symptoms.

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫We had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and had started to build them. We accelerated these plans and scaled them up, adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April,‚Äö√Ñ√π he said.

> At the peak on 12 May, some 20,000 patients were being cared for at community care and similar facilities, with as many as 1,000 are admitted daily, Teo said.

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫This is more than the total number of beds in all our public acute hospitals. We mobilised resources from across our public service, government-linked companies, and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities. Healthcare volunteers stepped forward to help man them,‚Äö√Ñ√π he stressed.

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫This is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our healthcare system and putting lives at risk.‚Äö√Ñ√π

> The clear lesson learned during the COVID-19 outbreak is that Singapore needs to plan in peace-time ‚Äö√Ñ√∫on facing the unknown, and build deep reserves of people and capabilities, so that when we face a crisis, we can act decisively, and respond flexibly and rapidly‚Äö√Ñ√π.

> He referred to past challenges in Singapore‚Äö√Ñ√¥s history such as in 1967 when the British announced the withdrawal of their troops from the city-state. With the move, Singapore was poised to lose 20 per cent of its gross domestic product and 70,000 jobs at a time when the population was half of what it is today, Teo said.

> ‚Äö√Ñ√∫We are far more resilient today than in 1967, and better positioned to create new markets, businesses, and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.‚Äö√Ñ√π

> Singapore also rode out the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Asian and global financial crises. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫COVID-19 is an even bigger test,‚Äö√Ñ√π he added.

> The outbreak is the first major crisis for many of the new generation of ministers and civil servants taking the lead in efforts to tackle the situation.

> The ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of their older Cabinet colleagues as well as consulted widely within and outside the government, Teo said.

> He added, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Over the past few months, I have worked very closely with them. We speak daily and exchange views freely. They have stepped up to the task, worked together as a team, and led from the front. This is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore.‚Äö√Ñ√π

but if got bad news its somehow its the collective responsibility of all singaporeans. like millions of ppl petitioned manpower ministry to ignore their cramped overcrowded conditions for decades. or if got referendum where ppl voted that josephine teo should listen to dorm/biz owners and just leave rules up to dorm owners. who told govt to dismiss ngo's concerns for dorm conditions for years. 

some human decency should say that give these ppl a decent accommodations. at least army standard bunks with space and furnishing.

I understand you don't care if people die as long as you can do what you want. Your freedom is worth the price of half a million deaths and counting, if you are from America. 

We kept our people safe while under lockdown. We gave them a good living allowance if they couldn't work. We gave businesses subsidies to help them continue to employ people.

And it was a sound economic decision. In my industry, businesses are moving their business from overseas back to Australia because we are seen as stable and safe. A brief hard lockdown helped us get ourselves back to normal quickly.

1608,"That's a good qn. I can't really give a comprehensive answer to that, but I'll say it's definitely within the realm of plausibility. Lower traffic during peak hours due to WFH schemes and not running certain bus lines allows redirection of manpower and buses to other lanes. Trains would be the one seeing the bottleneck, although that's presuming that 3min frequency is optimum give and take, and we want higher frequency to translate to similar travel time.

1924,"And maybe the repercussions to our economy and rest of society will be much more than whatever Wuhan experienced. Unlike Wuhan, we don't have other provinces to channel supplies to us. Already other countries like Thailand are slowly turning off the tap on essentials like food. If we ""lockdown"" in the manner you suggest, how are we going to pay, and what can we offer in return? And if we *do* run out of these supplies we're gonna be in a *much* more sticky situation than with the virus alone. It's not trendy these days to mention this, but *thrashing the economy also results in loss of life*.
 
 Then theres the issue of what a lockdown actually means. Its easy to say ""well, lets just give exceptions for essential services, like healthcare workers, people working in critical industries like water, telecoms etc"". But the devil is in the details: where do you draw the line? Obviously, clubs and pubs aren't essential. But what about hotels where you house the people in SHN: these need to be somewhat staffed as well, right? What about our military --- is that essential? And then you come to hawkers and restaurants: our frontline workers need to eat too, right? Even if you allow only for takeouts, the eateries still have to be open. Or our ports: we've got to ship in food and supplies from *somewhere*. Once you think about it further, you'd realize that after provisioning for these exemptions, you get something that is not too different from what we already have (and most certainly something that we're heading to).
 
 And don't even get me started on the chaos which would ensue if this is declared immediately. If DORSCON orange already led to panic, what would a lockdown lead to? How do you enforce the lockdown against a tide of panicked people? Send the police and army? Will that make things better?

2097,"My unpopular opinion is that all these new rules were not properly thought through and hard to enforce. For example eating places need to maintain social distance but what about public transport? The reasoning I heard is that public transport is considered ""transient"". But from what I know, people finish their workday lunch in 15-20 mins and leave while a bus ride is easily 30 mins +. 
 
 That's why I think we might as well bite the bullet and lock down. The Covid situation is fluid and we must adapt, just like how one moment we were told to support local attractions and the next moment to stay at home. Our infection graph was quite nice in Feb but started to spike once the overseas Singaporeans returned.
 
 Singapore is a small country and our enforcement is good. From the generous budget, we know the govt can afford to pay full wages up to median salary for more than 2 mths (ie 25% salary over 3 quarters). With the borders as good as closed, just focus on clearing the virus from SG. Even if our curve has a long tail, I'll bet my last penny it will be shorter than the messy Europeans / Americans and our even messier neighbours.
 
 With things under control, at least life can get back to some normalcy. Everyone will still have to scrape by, some are still screwed but at least we are not in this not-here-not-there limbo. During this time, the govt can also take the time to ponder how we ""leap ahead"" once the virus is over world wide.

2427,"The thing I've realized since my last post is that there are some people who will persist in posting misinformation or misrepresentations of what the app is, isn't and what your argument is and isn't. I would like to clear the air and make sure that the narrative here is one of constructive criticism rather than picking at useless minutiae of potential risk and 'principles' which are irrelevant to the topic at hand: To what extent should we be concerned about this app, and how beneficial can it be?
 
 I AM NOT SPONSORED, OR A GOVERNMENT SHILL, as much as you'd love for that to be true. I am just excited that an app can potentially save thousands of lives, even millions, if we can prove it works and export this model abroad. I am convinced of its value and safety. 
 
 They've claimed I am a shill/spy/whatever it is, they've claimed I don't know what I am talking about, they've claimed I am being defensive, etc, etc. I would like to take this moment to encourage everyone who is reading this and the post above to consider the following facts. 
 
 This app was developed by a stat board. It is not made by the PAP, or indeed any political agency. They are staffed by people with very difficult-to-obtain degrees in IS, IT, and Comp-sci. If you fundamentally want to question their motives, that's fine. But the technology is sound and proven. 
 
 **Safe anot?**
 
 Encryption is a well understood topic. You use it daily for internet banking, logging in to reddit, surfing the web. Its nothing new to encrypt your information. It is very hard to steal information from your phone in ANY form, even so-called 'bluetooth snarfing'. The cost of attacking you is prohibitive in terms of time, exposure and potential reward gained. 99.999% of all people who will use this app have nothing valuable to steal from their phones. I agree there is a risk of such a thing happening, but in all likelihood? It will not happen. It is like being afraid of being struck by lightning. Can it happen? Yes. Will it happen? Extremely unlikely. 
 
 **Why no open source?**
 
 The government being the slow cumbersome beast it is are often staffed by people who know less than they should and yet are in higher levels of authority than other people who might have made better decisions. They may believe that not releasing the code is somehow more secure. There may also be proprietary/sensitive code involved in making this app. That is not to say that it is suspicious or is out to make money from you. It is just to indemnify themselves from potential risks. They have also stated that moving towards open source is something they want to do after this initial period. 
 
 **Will it see if I go to geylang?**
 
 No. It doesn't. Unless the Government pulls an MIB move with thousands of 'relay bluetooth stations' which is a fantastical idea at best, and absolute nonsense at worst. This was heavily upvoted in the other thread. I need to stress that while theoretically possible, if they actually do want to track everyone, there are less obvious and expensive ways to do so than that. This app specifically with regards to your movement does not enable the government to track you.
 
 https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360043224874-Can-TraceTogether-track-the-location-of-all-phones-installed-with-TraceTogether-
 
 **I dont trust it, why should I install?**
 
 This is more a philosophical debate than anything actually pertinent to the app, but allow me to default to a utilitarian argument: What number of infected cases would there need to be before you felt that this app was necessary? 100? 1000? 10000? What proportion of the population needs to be infected before you feel personally threatened enough to use the app for the sake, not only of yourself, but the old and those with pre-existing conditions around you? 5% of the population? 10%? 
 
 I understand that before it becomes a problem you are wont to download this app and you'd rather have your privacy. Allow me to stress once again. It is safe, unless a state sponsored actor or billionaire playboy philanthropist comes in to try and track everyone. If you cannot understand the technology and have this fear, please read the FAQ below. I hope it can assure you of the good intentions and practices behind this app.

2454,"After reading the whole thread and OP's replies, I've found that OP has some skewed conceptions about the security aspects and concerns about this whole thing.
 
 Firstly,
 
 >A. Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. ""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.
 
 Lmao. For someone who sounds so technologically informed, I was surprised when I realised what OP wrote when I read this for the second time. Sounds like OP is confusing the difference between hash and encryption, which should be a basic concept in the field of IT/Cybersecurity.
 
 Furthermore, phone numbers in Singapore are 8 digits, and either starts with 8xxx xxxx or 9xxx xxxx. Brute forcing the combination with a self-made list containing all the possible phone numbers isn't really that hard to do, and won't take up a lot of time, considering the computing and processing power that computers have these days.
 
 OP also replied to one of the comments by saying "" There isn't anything inherently scary about bluetooth"". Well, let me introduce you to [Bluejacking](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5045/bluejacking), [Bluebugging](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5044/bluebugging) & [Bluesnarfing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5046/bluesnarfing).
 
 Building on what I've said earlier about Bluetooth, if some siaokia really wants to, he can build a malicious version of the app, and use it to extract the supposedly anonymous information, or modify the payload and send malware into other devices using Bluetooth.
 
 OP subsequently said the following in another of his replies:
 
 >And do you think in this time of a pandemic that cybercriminals are roaming about with massive bluetooth hijacking setups in order to walk next to what is potentially another virus carrier? You have to be within bluetooth range and you have to handshake with the right authentication or permission for bluetooth access. I would take my chances with that over the possible spread of COVID19, which is a clear, imminent danger and proven threat.
 
 You'd be surprised. The value of the information may outweigh the risk of contracting of the virus to some, and some hackers would still take the risk of getting into a crowded idea just to hijack other devices. If they are that scared of the virus, they can easily minimise the risk by driving around in a car, carrying out a [wardriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving) bluetooth attack.
 
 OP is also operating under the presumption that hackers won't want to go out and gather all that information/deliver malware during this period. That's like saying ""Oh I shouldn't leave my housedoor locked, it's too much of a hassle. It's COVID period now. who would want to break into my house, right?""
 
 OP keeps insisting that he isn't some government employee, and that he isn't paid to do this. But with how much of a tryhard he is in this thread, I honestly doubt so.
 
 I'm not here to discourage people from downloading the app, but I'm here to inform people of the potential risks that they're getting into by downloading this app/prolonging their use of bluetooth, and to point out OP's flaw in logic/misconception as well.

 Right now, in 2021, SPF is generally above board and competent. Same can be said for the government. But in 2026? 2031? 2036? Look at Hong Kong - in a few short years the police went from well respected to colluding with triads and suiciding people. Can you dare to say that this will never happen to Singapore? If you are considered law abiding now, that may not be true forever.
 
 There's also the slippery slope that now police can use it, then who is next? How about other government agencies? If you are a civil servant, do you want them to use TT to clock in clock out at work? It's far fetched. But that's what people who thought ""TT will only be used for contact tracing"" thought - that the government will know when to stop on the slippery slope. Obviously they don't.
 
 For something a bit more immediate - everyone makes mistakes and police are no exception. What if because of TT you get wrongly dragged into an investigation? What if police make a mistake, or want to close case and use it to pin the blame on you? I would rather turn off Bluetooth than risk that.
 
 Hope you understand now. If you don't bother about the privacy issues, maybe you bother that this is going to reduce trust and usage of TT and hamper contact tracing efforts.

2624,"**Salt (cryptography)**
 
 In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods.

 The review by the opensource reviewers also leaves much to be desired since the one I read basically said that a large portion of what goes in was not available for review, and their conclusion was that it may be necessary due to time constraints but should be subject to further review and a potential hackathon and then we hear nothing about it since. They also reviewed a first gen TT device, who knows what changes it has undergone in the last 3 months?

 A [growing consensus](https://ipvm.com/reports/temp-screening-effect) among Western health leaders of temperature screening being [ineffective security theatre](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/paging-dr-hamblin-temperature-checks-coronavirus/615190/) may mean an upcoming elimination of this requirement. This would cement the reduction in manpower for SafeEntry. 
 
 We are currently not in the position of being pressured to increase mandatory SafeEntry to more stores or even public transport. Edit: SafeEntry is also ineffective for large venues where visitors spend extended durations, like malls, department stores, libraries, even some supermarkets. Asking everyone in the area during a certain time to track their symptoms for 14 results in a lot of anxiety in aggregate, especially in situations like the NTU failure.

 Contact tracing is best done without excessive interaction, and less reliance on faulty human memory. Bluetooth Low Energy was built for this.
 
 I'm also heartened by the approach of storing the data as a local blob which never leaves your phone unless the user AND MOH both validate.
 
 This is important to prevent false positives (DOS/spam attack vector) from pranksters by requiring MOH validation, and address concerns of Orwellian state sponsored surveillance by requiring user opt-in. If people have unaddressed security concerns, they won't install and we fail to get the critical mass needed for this to work.

 In the Straits Times article
 ""When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.""
 
 This stance just discourages people from installing, they can't be charged for not allowing release of information they don't have. 
 
 Using this stick approach narrows the user acquisition funnel, for marginal enforcement gain at best. 
 If a user has already installed the app, at the cost of battery life, system resources and privacy, they've already committed at some level, threatening prosecution to secure permission they've already implied at point of install, comes at the cost of turning many potential users off with draconian enforcement. 
 
 That said, it's not stated on the CNA article, so that may not be the official policy stance. If that's the case, the Straits Times article should be corrected so it doesn't discourage installs due to fear of recrimination. 
 
 In my opinion, it's better to set incentives by giving privileged access to critical and scarce services to people who use the app.
 Eg: higher queue preference for testing and ICU given to people based on length of days running the app.

 I understand these are in the plans (based on the lead's Facebook comments) , which would be great because the more eyes we have on the code, with adequate responsible disclosure, the global infosec community can help this improve, and reduce unforeseen bugs or exploits which leak or compromise user data and result in loss of confidence in the system.
 
 Also, it allows other countries with less sophisticated contact tracing infrastructure & manpower to leverage on this work to secure their populations. Safer neighbours means less imported cases and helping them helps us eventually.

 Sure, they have taken steps to protect your privacy and data, but there must be some reversible algorithm going on here to allow the authorities to trace back and identify who is TanAhGao69 right?

 (b) Is there a difference between TT data from app vs token? If token has no GPS functionality or any other data functionality then the only way more useful data can be extracted is from TT app. Our phones have GPS etc.

 If it‚Äôs not open source, the alternative is that we put our trust in the app developer only. They may be incredible coders, but we all makes mistakes.

 If they had the app, they are unlikely to leave their quarantined premises. Why?

Just curious, have you actually tried the app to see how much battery it really consumes or just basing it off random comments online? And what...a power bank to support to app....talk about exaggeration haha

In all my testing, it never goes above 0.5% of total battery usage.

>Who knows, some nutjob in ISD taps onto the TraceTogether system for their ""personal vendetta?""

If you understood the underlying tech of TraceTogether, you wouldn't make this comment. I'll link the long read version here but to summarize:

1. TraceTogether saves data locally on the phone and it doesn't send to some central server where ISD can tap into it 

2. The underlying platform is open source so any 'future' changes are public knowledge

In general, that is expected of politicians. They will tell whatever good stories about their proposal and ignore/skim over the cons. Or in any debate anyway. This is why we need a healthy balance in the government. PAP suggest something, Oppo try to shoot it down. Oppo suggests something, PAP try to shoot it down. Hopefully, the end result is an overall better plan and not a stalemate with nothing done. The problem is when will the pandemic be over? Some experts say it won't be over until 2024, some say it may never be over because the virus keeps mutating that is no vaccine that will work forever and people who recovered can get it again too. So how then? If the pandemic can never really end, will the government insist that TTT become part and parcel of our daily life? Then how will TTT evolved? That is what I'm more concerned about. I know they can track individuals already. The problem is how much work is involved. The TTT represent a potential to make it much easier if they feature creep on TTT and eventually equip it with sufficient functionality as I mentioned before, in the name of convenience such as combining EZlink, digital payment etc. How ""big"" a fish is, is often related to the cost/benefits of tracking him/her. Say if the government needs 10 man days to track/trace one person. They may only have resources to target 10 individuals at a time. However, if they are able to cut the cost down to 1 man hour. They can target more than 2000 individuals at a time. With excess capacity, it becomes easier to include smaller fishes that previously would had been too much effort to gun down. Perhaps my expectations of a politician is that if they are not saying the tradeoffs, thats lying. and thats not what I will vote for. I am not saying I need you to tell me what the tradeoffs are. We are educated and information is free. But you treat me like a fool. Thats where I draw the line. I am skeptical of what constitutes a healthy balance. At the end of the day its still a numbers game and a stalemate or a coalition government will be formed. When that happens can we say its best for the people? There will be populism and we all know what that leads too. Much like minimum wage, the vote goes to the highest bidder. How can the electorate ensure that it does not happen? the answer is we cant. We want the cake and eat it. But in reality there is no such thing. You rightly pointed out, tracking is already a possibility. the key is the intent. Why are ppl doubtful of the intent?

That is an exaggeration, I think they‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve done a reasonable job of creating a central system that doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t geolocate users as a matter of course.

Now, could they? Of course. They can do it today if they wanted (e.g. Israel has a system that tracks without warrant through mobile phone signals in the name of national security).  They don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t need to rely on this clumsy system for it.

If you‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve got a magic ball end date for the pandemic I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll be glad to hear its prediction.  You‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve set the end date arbitrarily to a vaccine deployment - what in your mind is a successful deployment?  What does that look like globally? Just our major trading partners?  In a position of power and working from good faith, being **accountable for failure**, I too might tell private citizens that have really mundane lives their privacy concerns are so self-aggrandized it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s laughable and seek to maintain flexibility in the face of the unknown.

We dont have to go into detail to tell them how to do it. You want government to provide them with programmers and coders and customer support staff? No. You set the floor, and let the companies do the work. That's the point of capitalism.

And if it ends up making things harder for the FW, then we adjust and try again. Policy is always open-ended in that sense.

Edit: Speaking of economics, the pertinent problem here is that  these companies are causing a negative externality in the form of higher spread of disease. This negative externality is borne by the public. Now if you really know your economics, you know exactly what we must do in face of negative externalities: Tax.

3026,">In other words, I was right. Singapore did not do great. Yes they did fuck up. The numbers are indisputably worse than even many third world countries. Case closed.

Agreed.

>Your narrative of not being allowed to criticise them because ""oh they can't be perfect, look at how hard they are trying"" is completely disingenuous. They are the most highly paid government on earth. I expect them to perform the best. They are nowhere close and we need to find out why, and then decide if they deserve their job, or deserve their pay. Your whitewashing is undermining genuine efforts to do so

Moving on to finding out why they fucked up, which you agree to be what we need to find out. While I'm not gonna bother finding out if they are indeed paid the highest but I do concur that they are paid handsomely. And yes for that much remuneration it is definitely natural and justified to expect performance of a high calibre. 

Perhaps I did come off as defensive when I said that we are in no position to judge them when we aren't in their shoes. I'd like to clarify that what I meant was not that they cannot be judged but we have to take into account the asymmetry in our situation and theirs. Yes you can argue that given their pay they should be expected to make correct decisions and I do concur that point. All I'm trying to say is, at that point in time and under that pressure from the other parties in the picture, perhaps that decision they made was the one they believed to be the correct one. Then the issue becomes whether their calibre is worth their pay or not does it not? If that is the best they can do, should they still be paid the sums they are being paid? That is a question I don't think I'm qualified to answer.

>The rest of your post is nothing more than an inference that just because there were fewer tests PER CAPITA (NOT total tests) that that automatically means that Singapore MUST have less actual cases than those countries. You know that is not true.
>
>The most likely reason the number of cases are so low in those countries is because THEY HAVE LOWER CASES. Period. This is basic statistical inference. That is why we can tell the result of elections from just a small subset of voter results. What matters is we have a statistically significant number of total tests carried out. This is valid for all earlier mentioned countries, including Singapore
>
>If you have evidence that these countries are underreporting their actual cases. I would like to invite you provide actual direct evidence of that. You can win a prize for investigative journalism should you manage to do so. I eagerly await to read your findings

Now I'd like to clarify that the purpose of me digging up all those numbers are only to back up the fact that SG is indeed doing active testing, more active than other countries. Nowhere in my previous comment did I try to compare case counts.

Moving on, I think we can both agree that if the number of confirmed cases is high, it's either due to two things: 1) there is just that many cases; and/or 2) we are picking up more cases due to more active testing (because let's face it no country is going to be able to pick out every single case). I am not denying that our high numbers are most probably due to that we have a large population of infected patients. Rather what I'm trying to highlight is our degree of active testing is indeed much more active than other nations.

Perhaps I came across as whitewashing, but all I'm trying to do with my previous comment is 1) highlight that SG is doing more active testing than other countries (something which I think we should recognise, just not too much) ; and 2) our ministers did fuck up but I don't think we are in a good place to be judging them for it (it's my personal belief so if the part about not being in a good place to judge others doesn't resonate with you then it's just a matter of personal beliefs).",Tracetogether,0,0,0.0,0,722,4,-10.33074886671895,168,22,33,0.2556193570123893,0

Questions were raised about the criteria to which TT could be accessed and Shanmugan said ""serious cases"". But that's such a vague term. Granted he can't spell out explicitly what ""serious cases"" are but it doesn't instil confidence that such powers would be adequately ring fenced. A point was raised about what's stopping the police from going to TT at the very first available instance and that point wasn't addressed either.

Vivian also tried to play to the compassionate card to try to compel people's sensibilities to comply but honestly I don't have much confidence in his words either. He told everyone that TT would he voluntarily and would only be used for a very specific use case; both of which had since been proven wrong.

Of course you'll say times changed and he didn't knew about the CPC's reach, but my god you essentially led a lot of people to believe (and they did) that they were buying in to this very specific set of conditions.

Vivian spoke about this again, likely before the WP questions were tabled.

I don't think people disagree that the police shouldn't have access to information that could stop a murder, a terrorist incident or any incident that involves the loss of lives.

The accuracy is poor and it can never be nowhere close to the seamless integration and effectiveness of what Apple and Google have came up with.

Just look at the series of complaints and issues that TT app has. Bluetooth interference with headsets, high CPU usage, high battery consumption, and some used it an entire day only to find 0 Bluetooth interactions at the end of the day.

Numerous Bluetooth exchanges would have gone missing or not captured due to this myriad of issues, and ultimately SafeEntry is still the safer bet to tracking.

That's just a convenient cover.

The real reason is that without your NRIC, when MOH finds out that your phone has been a close contact, they can only call your phone number. If you hang up on them or refuse to follow instructions, they can't do much. Maybe they can check Singpass databases or demand that the Telco gives up your NRIC number, but this takes time. People may transfer phones within the family too. Anyway, if they have your NRIC, they can send enforcement agents to your address. Basically, you should be issued SHN already, the govt doesn't want to allow you to dodge by not responding.

That's also why the govt doesn't want to adopt the Google/Apple API. The latter would not allow linking of device with NRIC. If you were exposed, you'd get a notification, which you can choose to ignore i.e. not acceptable to MOH.

Nevertheless, I am ok with the NRIC link. It is consistent with the previous govt policies of close contacts identified by traditional means. No dodging allowed.",Tracetogether,0,1,1.0,1,193,4,-11.340415644807837,38,6,9,1.041459791645707,0

And by the time people realized the link, millions of people had been exposed to it. Sometimes diseases and side effects can occur years down the line. 
 
 Sure, I understand that. But I feel that these are risks we already take on a daily basis. It's simply not feasible to wait for years of testing before approving the usage of every single new technology. For every case of asbestos, how many other new technologies were rolled out to the public without years or testing and had no side-effects? Are you proposing that we conduct years of testing for every single new technology before implementation?
 
 To be completely clear, I do understand the need to be cautious of new technology, especially those that are directly injected / consumed by humans. However I also do think that given the pandemic we're in, it makes sense to encourage vaccine adoption given that the phase 3 trial studies have concluded that it's safe for use.

 The data is as sufficient as possible because they tested on a larger group of people. The reason they cut short the testing is because it became a matter of ethics to let the control group not have the vaccine during this pandemic as the control group was slowly increasing with the amount of infected people. 
 
 Other type of vaccines has small pool of data hence they took longer. 
 
 Phase 1 of the vaccine was to prove that it is safe. Phase 2 is to prove that it is effective in protecting against the virus. Phase 3 is to see that the virus has no long term side effects. As it is an emergency phase 3 cannot be completed. But phase 1 proves that the vaccine is safe for use.
 
 And even if the vaccine is bad for some people. The rule of thumb for such things is the good of the many outweighs the good of one.

Because of the nano lipid particle used to encase the mrna itself, it is theorised that the vaccine may potentially be able to cross the blood brain barrier and enter into immunologically privileged sites.

 Not much study on that for now. 
 
 And currently Pfizers phase 3 data was collected over a period of 2 months. Safety and efficacy cannot be established beyond that period of time but we generally assume it to be safe. 
 
 If future doses are required to maintain immunity, will compounded doses result in a different safety profile? 
 
 There is a reason why hcws may want to shy away from the mrna vaccine for now because they actually read medical journals and not pro vaccine messages from the mass media. 
 
 Attenuated virus vaccines have been well studied. And we do know that the attenuated virus retains the trophism of the target virus (in this case, sars cov2).

3636,"Long term side effects usually comes from long term use of a medication. It happens because the way modern medicine works. 
 
 The body has lots of natural processes going on. Some of this processes, when out of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, can lead to disease. Drugs target aspects of such biological processes to bring it back to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, sometimes by blocking it, sometimes by enhancing it. 
 
 Drugs are *small* molecules. The body doesn‚Äôt care about the atoms making up the molecule, the body cares about the *shape*. These specially designed drug molecules go into the protein (or other molecules) and do its ‚Äúmagic‚Äù, affecting the natural biological processes and bring it into balance.
 
 One problem with this is that the body sometimes likes to reuse the same protein (or family of similar proteins) in different places to control different processes. A drug may unintentionally affect an otherwise unintended process(es) and cause long term unforseen problems.
 
 Another problem is that a drug can target some completely unexpected target. As I said earlier, the shape is important. While a drug can be designed to fit a certain protein, there is chance that by coincidence, it can also hit some unrelated protein elsewhere and affect other processes and cause problems in the long term.
 
 Also, ultimately, all drugs are poison and the only thing that differentiate medicine from poison is the dosage. Too much of an effect can be bad. There are drugs that can cause damage to organs at higher dosages, for example. 
 
 Sometimes, the drug molecule itself can be chemically reactive, and can cause damage. Keep using it and you get long term damage. Rarely, if such chemically reactive drug damage the DNA enough over the years, people can even get cancer. Fortunately, people know some of the common reactive features and avoid those.
 
 To complicate things, the body tends to do things to a drug molecule to make it easier to get rid of it. That thing can be inherently toxic (such as one of paracetamol/panadol‚Äôs metabolite), or it can have effects of its own.
 
 There are a lot of ways for a drug to cause long term problems and side effects. However, does this mean mRNA vaccines can do so too? There are differences between mRNA and drug molecules and that makes things different.
 
 Ultimately, mRNA is a naturally occuring information carrying molecule. You have it in your body and it comes in many different lengths. The mRNA in the vaccine is not going to be any more reactive than those you already have!
 
 Compared to drug molecules, mRNA are huge. Things bind to sites on the mRNA, not really the other way around. It‚Äôs not very likely to trigger things you wouldn‚Äôt expect a normal mRNA to trigger.
 
 Inherently, mRNA are not toxic, so that is one safe part.
 
 Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the viral product it encode for can target unwanted processes and cause effects, it isn‚Äôt something very likely. Given that mRNA is not very stable, it doesn‚Äôt stay for long and you are only exposed to the amounts injected. Even if the product is not harmless, it is transient and shouldn‚Äôt cause too much of an effect, and unlikely to cause a long-term one. Your body can take a bit of damage. You go out under the sun? Damage. Eat or touch stuff too hot? Damage. Etc etc.
 
 It would be *far worse* to get the real deal, since the actual virus can replicate and make much much more potentially harmful viral proteins that a mRNA vaccine can cause your body to produce, on top of other problems associated with the actual covid virus.
 
 To be honest, the most likely reactions are immune related ones and those most side effects are short term and not likely to be very harmful.
 
 If you react very negatively to the mRNA in the vaccine and the protein it produces, I don‚Äôt think you would fare any better with the real virus.

Pzifer and Moderna can only manufacture 800k doses per day. Only 6 companies are racing to make vaccines for 2021 and let's say if the other companies manufacture at the same rate of 800k per day. That's 1490 days (4 years) to vaccinate 90% of the population. If there're more companies in 2022 onwards, realistically it'll be 1-2 years faster.

""At Tuesday‚Äö√Ñ√¥s press conference, Pal‚àö¬∞cios said Sinovac‚Äö√Ñ√¥s relatively low efficacy rate of 50% was due to its more rigorous standard for what counts as an infection among trial volunteers. The Butantan Institute said it included six types of cases in its results: asymptomatic, very mild, mild, two levels of moderate, and severe. (The Brazilian authorities stressed that the public should focus on the vaccine‚Äö√Ñ√¥s 100% efficacy in protecting against severe cases of COVID-19.) Western vaccine makers generally included only mild, moderate, and severe categories, and companies like Pfizer are doing additional studies to see if the vaccine will prevent asymptomatic cases.""

People want to compare other studies, but that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s like comparing a person that runs a 1-kilometer race on a flat stretch and another doing it on a steep and obstacle-filled stretch,‚Äö√Ñ√π Pal‚àö¬∞cios said.

"" There is some evidence to back up Pal‚àö¬∞cios‚Äö√Ñ√¥ claim that Brazil‚Äö√Ñ√¥s trial standards are more likely to catch mild cases of COVID-19 than trials conducted elsewhere, which would result in a lower efficacy rate."" In the U.S.‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Food and Drug Administration‚Äö√Ñ√¥s evaluation of Pfizer‚Äö√Ñ√¥s vaccine trials, the agency found that there were up to 1,594 suspected but unconfirmed cases of COVID-19. Because the infections were unconfirmed, they didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t factor into the Pfizer vaccine‚Äö√Ñ√¥s efficacy rate.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s true that other vaccine trials have not been able to confirm as many mild infections [as Sinovac],‚Äö√Ñ√π says Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The [vaccine efficacy] against mild disease could be lower than 90%-95% for Moderna and Pfizer.‚Äö√Ñ√π

What you're looking up is a ""Good Class Bungalow"", which in laymen's terms is...a mansion. In the middle of a major city. To count as a GCB the lot (land, not interior) must be over 1400sqm, or 15,000 sqft, and on top of that it must be in one of a few select locations that are particularly desirable. For the record, Dyson (of vacuum fame) has a GCB in Singapore. So did the Saudi embassy, but they sold it. Might have been too rich for their blood./s I mean, look at who's selling the GCB you linked. It's Sotheby's. [The Sotheby's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby%27s). Sure, their realty is a franchise, but the fact that they're willing to attach their name to it means it's strictly UHNWI-only.
