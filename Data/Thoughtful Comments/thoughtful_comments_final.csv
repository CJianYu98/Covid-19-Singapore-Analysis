120,"> For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April.

I think this is a global issue, not unique to Singapore, though I'd say it's a problem too. Wuhan had that two massive temporary hospitals. UK has NHS Nightingale (their equivalent of ""Expo hospital""). The world realised we are woefully unprepared/underprepared for a contagious pandemic.

> Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

The shelters thing might sound good, but even with a centralised location, we seem to have a manpower crunch in Expo (as seen by the article of a person who got sent there). What more if we start to decentralize quarantine facilities, you need to duplicate the manpower across Singapore and monitor more staff for unwanted spread (e.g. what if Kallang's quarantine center has an outbreak within their staff?). The more places you have, the more likely you could ""screw up"" the handling and accidentally spread it somewhere else.

I'd say that having Expo/Suntec/whatever equipped to be converted to quarantine facilities in a day/two should be our goal. Make it so that the fixed facilities/infrastructure (e.g. HVAC) is rated for quarantine use. I believe MOH has done this with things like the Community Quarantine Facilities (which is why quarantine was set up super fast).",1,1,1,1,circuit breaker,268,-11.278340418343879,56,8,1.270501646079258

254,"\[Opinion\] Covid-19 exposes several problems/ weaknesses of every country. For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April. We converted places like [exhibition halls](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-more-than-18-000-bed-spaces-for-isolation-and-care-12683558) (Expo/ Changi Exhibition Centre) and army camps to cater to such needs.

Based on Covid-19's experience, we could expect new waves of it, or possibility of new diseases that might be equally or more contagious in the future (/slap wood). 

Thus, I was thinking that SG should consider building a fixed number of ""quarantine facilities"" in every town, like playgrounds/ parks etc in future towns (or added on to existing towns). It is similar to the idea of disaster shelters. Of course, in unused times, they could be used for other purposes, like those [shelters](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/home/civil-defence-shelter/types-of-shelter) in void decks.

Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

side note: I think the next of such thread can change to ""May"" instead of April.",1,1,1,1,circuit breaker,201,-11.826398473016626,34,7,1.2745934943253234

as the new york mayor put it: nothing is more serious than death. not even mental illness. if everyone feels like he/she cannot tahan, go out socialise or do whatever they want because they feel like they are going crazy, they are more likely to catch the virus and pass it on to people who actually do their part to safeguard the community.",0,1,0,0,circuit breaker,159,-10.142152146660639,36,6,3.454359834495029

One thing that I find is a silver lining in all these, is that the government has finally recognized the importance of mental health, and places the official hotlines and resources quite prominently in their messaging. I work in an industry where it's not civil service but on the periphery, and I can see that the government messaging is taken seriously and my managers are all imploring us to take wfh seriously but at the same time lightly, take care of our own needs, use available resources if we feel our mental health is suffering. 

I'm not sure how many of the isolated migrant workers have access to a counsellor or therapist, but I'd place that as quite a high priority to address after their lodging, food, healthcare and other basic logistics are settled. Anyone has any information if such resources are provided for them? They are particularly vulnerable if they can't speak english and thus tap onto official government resources so I think it's a valid concern. 

Beyond that, I feel that allowing interaction is super important, for people who don't live within the same household. Beyond the immediate family situation that is addressed by phase 1, one thing that could have helped is for dating couples to be allowed to visit each other. The risk is marginal; the spread will be within 2 households even if theres a positive contact, the contact is easily traced (tracetogether, or log the visit to a special portal etc). With data analytics it's not impossible to quickly capture the source/destination, spatial and time dimension and mitigate the risk of an untraceable outbreak because the virus spread between households like STDs in a college campus.",1,1,1,1,circuit breaker,312,-11.028439242553755,58,16,0.8919460844354813

508,"That's a good qn. I can't really give a comprehensive answer to that, but I'll say it's definitely within the realm of plausibility. Lower traffic during peak hours due to WFH schemes and not running certain bus lines allows redirection of manpower and buses to other lanes. Trains would be the one seeing the bottleneck, although that's presuming that 3min frequency is optimum give and take, and we want higher frequency to translate to similar travel time. We can have more trains on hold in between lanes, but that will be on the expense of time to take a more preventive measure. 

I think we shouldn't translate higher frequency to being faster too. It's just spreading the people to break them apart from crowding spots such as bus stops and train stations. Perhaps then it may disincentive certain employers to call people back to workplaces if it's so troublesome to move around.",1,1,1,1,safe distancing,152,-11.198465010119836,26,8,0.6973001533331618

824,"And maybe the repercussions to our economy and rest of society will be much more than whatever Wuhan experienced. Unlike Wuhan, we don't have other provinces to channel supplies to us. Already other countries like Thailand are slowly turning off the tap on essentials like food. If we ""lockdown"" in the manner you suggest, how are we going to pay, and what can we offer in return? And if we *do* run out of these supplies we're gonna be in a *much* more sticky situation than with the virus alone. It's not trendy these days to mention this, but *thrashing the economy also results in loss of life*.

Then theres the issue of what a lockdown actually means. Its easy to say ""well, lets just give exceptions for essential services, like healthcare workers, people working in critical industries like water, telecoms etc"". But the devil is in the details: where do you draw the line? Obviously, clubs and pubs aren't essential. But what about hotels where you house the people in SHN: these need to be somewhat staffed as well, right? What about our military --- is that essential? And then you come to hawkers and restaurants: our frontline workers need to eat too, right? Even if you allow only for takeouts, the eateries still have to be open. Or our ports: we've got to ship in food and supplies from *somewhere*. Once you think about it further, you'd realize that after provisioning for these exemptions, you get something that is not too different from what we already have (and most certainly something that we're heading to).

And don't even get me started on the chaos which would ensue if this is declared immediately. If DORSCON orange already led to panic, what would a lockdown lead to? How do you enforce the lockdown against a tide of panicked people? Send the police and army? Will that make things better? This is one big reason why the G has been gradually ramping up measures (that is, increasing the shade of red in the orange).",1,1,1,1,safe distancing,343,-10.61541300166105,69,14,0.06097743003244864

997,"My unpopular opinion is that all these new rules were not properly thought through and hard to enforce. For example eating places need to maintain social distance but what about public transport? The reasoning I heard is that public transport is considered ""transient"". But from what I know, people finish their workday lunch in 15-20 mins and leave while a bus ride is easily 30 mins +. 

That's why I think we might as well bite the bullet and lock down. The Covid situation is fluid and we must adapt, just like how one moment we were told to support local attractions and the next moment to stay at home. Our infection graph was quite nice in Feb but started to spike once the overseas Singaporeans returned.

Singapore is a small country and our enforcement is good. From the generous budget, we know the govt can afford to pay full wages up to median salary for more than 2 mths (ie 25% salary over 3 quarters). With the borders as good as closed, just focus on clearing the virus from SG. Even if our curve has a long tail, I'll bet my last penny it will be shorter than the messy Europeans / Americans and our even messier neighbours.

With things under control, at least life can get back to some normalcy. Everyone will still have to scrape by, some are still screwed but at least we are not in this not-here-not-there limbo. During this time, the govt can also take the time to ponder how we ""leap ahead"" once the virus is over world wide.

1027,"The thing I've realized since my last post is that there are some people who will persist in posting misinformation or misrepresentations of what the app is, isn't and what your argument is and isn't. I would like to clear the air and make sure that the narrative here is one of constructive criticism rather than picking at useless minutiae of potential risk and 'principles' which are irrelevant to the topic at hand: To what extent should we be concerned about this app, and how beneficial can it be?

I AM NOT SPONSORED, OR A GOVERNMENT SHILL, as much as you'd love for that to be true. I am just excited that an app can potentially save thousands of lives, even millions, if we can prove it works and export this model abroad. I am convinced of its value and safety. 

They've claimed I am a shill/spy/whatever it is, they've claimed I don't know what I am talking about, they've claimed I am being defensive, etc, etc. I would like to take this moment to encourage everyone who is reading this and the post above to consider the following facts. 

This app was developed by a stat board. It is not made by the PAP, or indeed any political agency. They are staffed by people with very difficult-to-obtain degrees in IS, IT, and Comp-sci. If you fundamentally want to question their motives, that's fine. But the technology is sound and proven. 

**Safe anot?**

Encryption is a well understood topic. You use it daily for internet banking, logging in to reddit, surfing the web. Its nothing new to encrypt your information. It is very hard to steal information from your phone in ANY form, even so-called 'bluetooth snarfing'. The cost of attacking you is prohibitive in terms of time, exposure and potential reward gained. 99.999% of all people who will use this app have nothing valuable to steal from their phones. I agree there is a risk of such a thing happening, but in all likelihood? It will not happen. It is like being afraid of being struck by lightning. Can it happen? Yes. Will it happen? Extremely unlikely. 

**Why no open source?**

The government being the slow cumbersome beast it is are often staffed by people who know less than they should and yet are in higher levels of authority than other people who might have made better decisions. They may believe that not releasing the code is somehow more secure. There may also be proprietary/sensitive code involved in making this app. That is not to say that it is suspicious or is out to make money from you. It is just to indemnify themselves from potential risks. They have also stated that moving towards open source is something they want to do after this initial period. 

**Will it see if I go to geylang?**

No. It doesn't. Unless the Government pulls an MIB move with thousands of 'relay bluetooth stations' which is a fantastical idea at best, and absolute nonsense at worst. This was heavily upvoted in the other thread. I need to stress that while theoretically possible, if they actually do want to track everyone, there are less obvious and expensive ways to do so than that. This app specifically with regards to your movement does not enable the government to track you.

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360043224874-Can-TraceTogether-track-the-location-of-all-phones-installed-with-TraceTogether-

**I dont trust it, why should I install?**

This is more a philosophical debate than anything actually pertinent to the app, but allow me to default to a utilitarian argument: What number of infected cases would there need to be before you felt that this app was necessary? 100? 1000? 10000? What proportion of the population needs to be infected before you feel personally threatened enough to use the app for the sake, not only of yourself, but the old and those with pre-existing conditions around you? 5% of the population? 10%? 

I understand that before it becomes a problem you are wont to download this app and you'd rather have your privacy. Allow me to stress once again. It is safe, unless a state sponsored actor or billionaire playboy philanthropist comes in to try and track everyone. If you cannot understand the technology and have this fear, please read the FAQ below. I hope it can assure you of the good intentions and practices behind this app.

**Where can I read the declared intent and scope of the app and all relevant questions?**

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg

**Why are you so supportive of this app? You paid is it?**

I am actually very fearful personally of getting this virus, and I am fearful for loved ones getting the virus. Perhaps that is driving a deep sense of duty within me to control what I can. I have been sleeping much less for the last few days since the situation deteriorated My insecurities are probably one of the things which are fuelling this enthusiasm for advocating for a solution. 

I have seen few other solutions to this virus which are as simple and effective as this one. Do not mistake my enthusiasm for malice. I truly believe that if this app works the way it should, then we have a solution to COVID19 spread which helps ensure life continues to go on, without any lock down, and that we can contain the spread.",1,1,1,1,Tracetogether,888,-10.6730115507984,191,41,-0.14334259461816012

1054,"After reading the whole thread and OP's replies, I've found that OP has some skewed conceptions about the security aspects and concerns about this whole thing.

Firstly,

>A. Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. ""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.

Lmao. For someone who sounds so technologically informed, I was surprised when I realised what OP wrote when I read this for the second time. Sounds like OP is confusing the difference between hash and encryption, which should be a basic concept in the field of IT/Cybersecurity.

Furthermore, phone numbers in Singapore are 8 digits, and either starts with 8xxx xxxx or 9xxx xxxx. Brute forcing the combination with a self-made list containing all the possible phone numbers isn't really that hard to do, and won't take up a lot of time, considering the computing and processing power that computers have these days.

OP also replied to one of the comments by saying "" There isn't anything inherently scary about bluetooth"". Well, let me introduce you to [Bluejacking](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5045/bluejacking), [Bluebugging](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5044/bluebugging) & [Bluesnarfing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5046/bluesnarfing).

Building on what I've said earlier about Bluetooth, if some siaokia really wants to, he can build a malicious version of the app, and use it to extract the supposedly anonymous information, or modify the payload and send malware into other devices using Bluetooth.

OP subsequently said the following in another of his replies:

>And do you think in this time of a pandemic that cybercriminals are roaming about with massive bluetooth hijacking setups in order to walk next to what is potentially another virus carrier? You have to be within bluetooth range and you have to handshake with the right authentication or permission for bluetooth access. I would take my chances with that over the possible spread of COVID19, which is a clear, imminent danger and proven threat.

You'd be surprised. The value of the information may outweigh the risk of contracting of the virus to some, and some hackers would still take the risk of getting into a crowded idea just to hijack other devices. If they are that scared of the virus, they can easily minimise the risk by driving around in a car, carrying out a [wardriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving) bluetooth attack.

OP is also operating under the presumption that hackers won't want to go out and gather all that information/deliver malware during this period. That's like saying ""Oh I shouldn't leave my housedoor locked, it's too much of a hassle. It's COVID period now. who would want to break into my house, right?""

OP keeps insisting that he isn't some government employee, and that he isn't paid to do this. But with how much of a tryhard he is in this thread, I honestly doubt so.

I'm not here to discourage people from downloading the app, but I'm here to inform people of the potential risks that they're getting into by downloading this app/prolonging their use of bluetooth, and to point out OP's flaw in logic/misconception as well.

For something a bit more immediate - everyone makes mistakes and police are no exception. What if because of TT you get wrongly dragged into an investigation? What if police make a mistake, or want to close case and use it to pin the blame on you? I would rather turn off Bluetooth than risk that.

In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods.

It seems like they're intent on forcing this SE+TT combo into everything down the line.


The review by the opensource reviewers also leaves much to be desired since the one I read basically said that a large portion of what goes in was not available for review, and their conclusion was that it may be necessary due to time constraints but should be subject to further review and a potential hackathon and then we hear nothing about it since. They also reviewed a first gen TT device, who knows what changes it has undergone in the last 3 months? 


If anything, the data seems to suggest that the community cases are decreasing and that it is no longer a matter of utmost emergency to implement TT that we cannot waste any time to review it for privacy concerns before rolling it out.

A [growing consensus](https://ipvm.com/reports/temp-screening-effect) among Western health leaders of temperature screening being [ineffective security theatre](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/paging-dr-hamblin-temperature-checks-coronavirus/615190/) may mean an upcoming elimination of this requirement. This would cement the reduction in manpower for SafeEntry. 

We are currently not in the position of being pressured to increase mandatory SafeEntry to more stores or even public transport. Edit: SafeEntry is also ineffective for large venues where visitors spend extended durations, like malls, department stores, libraries, even some supermarkets. Asking everyone in the area during a certain time to track their symptoms for 14 results in a lot of anxiety in aggregate, especially in situations like the NTU failure.

Contact tracing is best done without excessive interaction, and less reliance on faulty human memory. Bluetooth Low Energy was built for this.

I'm also heartened by the approach of storing the data as a local blob which never leaves your phone unless the user AND MOH both validate.

This is important to prevent false positives (DOS/spam attack vector) from pranksters by requiring MOH validation, and address concerns of Orwellian state sponsored surveillance by requiring user opt-in. If people have unaddressed security concerns, they won't install and we fail to get the critical mass needed for this to work.

In the Straits Times article
""When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.""

This stance just discourages people from installing, they can't be charged for not allowing release of information they don't have. 

Using this stick approach narrows the user acquisition funnel, for marginal enforcement gain at best. 
If a user has already installed the app, at the cost of battery life, system resources and privacy, they've already committed at some level, threatening prosecution to secure permission they've already implied at point of install, comes at the cost of turning many potential users off with draconian enforcement. 

That said, it's not stated on the CNA article, so that may not be the official policy stance. If that's the case, the Straits Times article should be corrected so it doesn't discourage installs due to fear of recrimination. 

In my opinion, it's better to set incentives by giving privileged access to critical and scarce services to people who use the app.
Eg: higher queue preference for testing and ICU given to people based on length of days running the app.

I understand these are in the plans (based on the lead's Facebook comments) , which would be great because the more eyes we have on the code, with adequate responsible disclosure, the global infosec community can help this improve, and reduce unforeseen bugs or exploits which leak or compromise user data and result in loss of confidence in the system.

Also, it allows other countries with less sophisticated contact tracing infrastructure & manpower to leverage on this work to secure their populations. Safer neighbours means less imported cases and helping them helps us eventually.

(a) what TT data is there that it is useful for such purposes? Handshake data alone cannot possibly be sufficient. If the crime happened in the unit next to mine and I was in handshake range 

(b) Is there a difference between TT data from app vs token? If token has no GPS functionality or any other data functionality then the only way more useful data can be extracted is from TT app. Our phones have GPS etc.

***To limit tracking, it's possible that uninstalling TT app and using the TT token would be best.***

That's the contradiction I pointed out in my OP. If I sat next to an infected person, it is unlikely that they have the app and that they are aware that they are infected in the first place.

If they had the app, they are unlikely to leave their quarantined premises. Why?

Putting the idea of ""I will be caught leaving my house if I use this app"" aside, we need to keep in mind that this person downloaded this app with the reason to reduce the spread of the virus. Hence my assumption.

It doesn't make sense that someone would download this app *and* leave their quarantine zone. Otherwise, my question of ""Had there been many cases where someone was caught breaking quarantine? "" is still valid.

If ""time"" is your point here, there is a 14 day incubation period [or more](https://www.businessinsider.sg/wuhan-coronavirus-symptoms-24-days-after-infection-2020-2?op=1&r=US&IR=T) for someone to be infected without major symptoms. This doesn't help with time.

Other than that, it does make sense that this app is to reduce the time to locate those who were contacted by the infected.

And by the time people realized the link, millions of people had been exposed to it. Sometimes diseases and side effects can occur years down the line. 

Sure, I understand that. But I feel that these are risks we already take on a daily basis. It's simply not feasible to wait for years of testing before approving the usage of every single new technology. For every case of asbestos, how many other new technologies were rolled out to the public without years or testing and had no side-effects? Are you proposing that we conduct years of testing for every single new technology before implementation?

To be completely clear, I do understand the need to be cautious of new technology, especially those that are directly injected / consumed by humans. However I also do think that given the pandemic we're in, it makes sense to encourage vaccine adoption given that the phase 3 trial studies have concluded that it's safe for use. You might think that Singapore is currently under control, but in reality we are sacrificing a huge amount of resources and our economy to maintain this ""control"" without a vaccine.

Because of the nano lipid particle used to encase the mrna itself, it is theorised that the vaccine may potentially be able to cross the blood brain barrier and enter into immunologically privileged sites. Where does the vaccine go? 

Not much study on that for now. 

And currently Pfizers phase 3 data was collected over a period of 2 months. Safety and efficacy cannot be established beyond that period of time but we generally assume it to be safe. 

If future doses are required to maintain immunity, will compounded doses result in a different safety profile? 

There is a reason why hcws may want to shy away from the mrna vaccine for now because they actually read medical journals and not pro vaccine messages from the mass media. 

Attenuated virus vaccines have been well studied. And we do know that the attenuated virus retains the trophism of the target virus (in this case, sars cov2).

1935,"Long term side effects usually comes from long term use of a medication. It happens because the way modern medicine works. 

The body has lots of natural processes going on. Some of this processes, when out of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, can lead to disease. Drugs target aspects of such biological processes to bring it back to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, sometimes by blocking it, sometimes by enhancing it. 

Drugs are *small* molecules. The body doesn‚Äôt care about the atoms making up the molecule, the body cares about the *shape*. These specially designed drug molecules go into the protein (or other molecules) and do its ‚Äúmagic‚Äù, affecting the natural biological processes and bring it into balance.

One problem with this is that the body sometimes likes to reuse the same protein (or family of similar proteins) in different places to control different processes. A drug may unintentionally affect an otherwise unintended process(es) and cause long term unforseen problems.

Another problem is that a drug can target some completely unexpected target. As I said earlier, the shape is important. While a drug can be designed to fit a certain protein, there is chance that by coincidence, it can also hit some unrelated protein elsewhere and affect other processes and cause problems in the long term.

Also, ultimately, all drugs are poison and the only thing that differentiate medicine from poison is the dosage. Too much of an effect can be bad. There are drugs that can cause damage to organs at higher dosages, for example. 

Sometimes, the drug molecule itself can be chemically reactive, and can cause damage. Keep using it and you get long term damage. Rarely, if such chemically reactive drug damage the DNA enough over the years, people can even get cancer. Fortunately, people know some of the common reactive features and avoid those.

To complicate things, the body tends to do things to a drug molecule to make it easier to get rid of it. That thing can be inherently toxic (such as one of paracetamol/panadol‚Äôs metabolite), or it can have effects of its own.

There are a lot of ways for a drug to cause long term problems and side effects. However, does this mean mRNA vaccines can do so too? There are differences between mRNA and drug molecules and that makes things different.

Ultimately, mRNA is a naturally occuring information carrying molecule. You have it in your body and it comes in many different lengths. The mRNA in the vaccine is not going to be any more reactive than those you already have!

Compared to drug molecules, mRNA are huge. Things bind to sites on the mRNA, not really the other way around. It‚Äôs not very likely to trigger things you wouldn‚Äôt expect a normal mRNA to trigger.

Inherently, mRNA are not toxic, so that is one safe part.

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the viral product it encode for can target unwanted processes and cause effects, it isn‚Äôt something very likely. Given that mRNA is not very stable, it doesn‚Äôt stay for long and you are only exposed to the amounts injected. Even if the product is not harmless, it is transient and shouldn‚Äôt cause too much of an effect, and unlikely to cause a long-term one. Your body can take a bit of damage. You go out under the sun? Damage. Eat or touch stuff too hot? Damage. Etc etc.

It would be *far worse* to get the real deal, since the actual virus can replicate and make much much more potentially harmful viral proteins that a mRNA vaccine can cause your body to produce, on top of other problems associated with the actual covid virus.

To be honest, the most likely reactions are immune related ones and those most side effects are short term and not likely to be very harmful.

If you react very negatively to the mRNA in the vaccine and the protein it produces, I don‚Äôt think you would fare any better with the real virus.

The chances of the vaccine working as intended safely is high, probably better odds with that then the odds between mild and serious covid.",1,1,1,1,vaccination,690,-10.95510977409243,117,27,0.09891863620519373
