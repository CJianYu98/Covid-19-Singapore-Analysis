306,"Thanks for this reply. Too many Singaporeans ignore the economics of the situation.

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

We need to be careful with this as well, otherwise the costs for the better dorms will be passed to the workers. A majority of them won't want this - they just want to do their time, earn enough, and leave as soon as possible.",Foreign Worker,1,1,1,1,1,180,4,-10.29991479,32,6,3,0.824032848,0

Atomise the group into mutually exclusive contact cells and forbid the cells from contacting each others.

421,"Unpopular opinion: nothing will happen to the dorm owners and it is not their fault

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be. 

There are restrictions on how many beds you can put in a certain area, how many toilets per number of ppl, fire safety requirements, a sickbay separate from living qtrs must be planned, WiFi is compulsory, even entertainment is a must. These are all set out by big G not the dorm owners. Why will any dorm owner go beyond the basic requirement to make a loss? 

Most people will not believe it but the obscene environment is actually caused by the workers themselves. The best example is hanging clothes. By law, the dorm owner must specifically have an area just for hanging clothes because hanging clothes in your sleeping qtrs is asking for disease to spread but the workers would rather hang them in their own rooms for convenience. 

Many do not practice basic hygiene. My own employees said it was a living hell with bedbug infestations so we moved them out.

There's a limit to how much we can interfere with free market and more importantly, how nice should we treat the employees? Should the cost rise to 2-3k per employee? Our hdb and condo will be 3-4x more and nobody will be able to afford it. In other countries, bricklayers can be paid 5k a month. Will Singaporeans do it for 5k a month?

Yes, it does make for very clear guidelines, but it also draws the line in the sand with regards to how people ought to act. If you have ever wondered why Singaporeans are such bullies on the road, look no further, because everything thinks they have the right of way simply because they have the law on their side. 

In addition, the Singaporean government was the one who decided to open the floodgates in the first place to drive growth in the country, in addition to driving down wages and further straining our infrastructure. It was always a ticking time bomb waiting to happen.

460,"Foreign worker dormitory is basically BMT army dormitory. A couple if not more bunk beds in a room, depending on room size with shared living area.

They aren't living in inhuman conditions. I doubt they will be fined except for if safe distancing law applies to the dorm supervisors. The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well. HUGE FINES like people are hoping for probably won't happen.

If it all adds up it might be substantial, but nothing big enough to invoke waves of change. Stricter supervision will become a thing, but I doubt they will suddenly be living in better homes. While living conditions were not stellar, they were livable. There were no major issues prior to Covid. So the majority of this outrage is stemming from *distancing issues.*

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

If anyone of you can solve these issues, and compile the math and financial budget required for any minister to undertake this task, be my guest. I'd love to see these workers living in good condition too. But personally I think it's a more concrete issue of budget than a philosophical issue of discrimination and lack of care.",Foreign Worker,1,1,1,1,1,379,4,-11.39708778,72,10,9,0.041243884,0

How many skilled workers are needed to operate the vehicle, what is the lump-sum cost of investment and what is the upkeep cost? How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce? How much training is necessary and how long will it take to implement?

""Just upgrade lah"" is something you hear too often from ignorant bosses and ignorant masses. It provides absolutely zero solution, and zero steps towards the solution. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.

2) I can agree with this. However, you talk about capitalism in your third point. Don't allow the successful to have landed property, lose the successful. This disgusting world you are living in is controlled by the 1%.

HCQ was never a harmful treatment.

I don't see Pritam's question as ""divisive"", that is something that people projected onto it. There is nothing wrong with PRs landing good jobs in SG, especially if they bring along skills that our economy requires, but that is not what the debate was about.

We dont have to go into detail to tell them how to do it. You want government to provide them with programmers and coders and customer support staff? No. You set the floor, and let the companies do the work. That's the point of capitalism.

If the Sultan could forsee the subsequent  actions of the British under Dr. Crawfurd which seized all soveriegnty  from the Sultan, I doubt he would have deemed the Treaty reasonable.

Ehh the reason why the Sultan agreed to sign the new treaty was because he was broke AF and gambled his money away. Power was no longer with him and the British could just own him by signing the treaty.

Literal tax paying citizens of Hong Kong lives in more inhumane conditions. Did you even read what I wrote? 

Living in a dormitory cluster is not inhumane. We are not throwing them into the slums where people have to literally live surrounded by their own waste with no readily available source of water or sanitary toilets. 

Just what kind of living conditions do you believe FW dorms to be?

They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers.

If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore. If you are saying people are dying because of the living condition, bring up evidence, because as far as I can tell, nothing has even come close to being negligent enough to cause death. 

Most if not all foreign worker death comes from workplace accidents.

Clearly that's not an accurate way to measure living conditions.

They live in humane conditions. Living in a bunk setting is far from inhumane. Amenities are provided to ensure they are living in humane condition.

1037,"If the interpretation of PM's statement is not twisted then I don't know what is. PM makes that claim in Parliament in 2007, and in 2008 someone is charged with it. The outcome clearly does not match his official statement and public intention. Sure, you might say the AG did not actually need to twist or give any shit about PM's official statement since it's entirely within his right as an independent body, but that's purely semantical if we consider all the instruments of law before the decision reached the AGC.

I do know that the AGC decides what to charge a suspect with based on police evidence. But if the police follows the intention of the government and not investigate or present evidence that affirms an offence under 377A, would the AGC have any legs to stand on and make the charge happen? Now surely you can't say that the Police that operates under the auspices of MHA is independent and does not obey the intentions of our PM.

As AGC is the one who charges and makes this decision independently of the government of the day or the Cabinet (as it rightfully should be), then what right or authority did PM Lee have to claim there will be no active enforcement, whatever ""enforcement"" and by whom means? If he is aware of the separations of powers that might create an outcome that he guaranteed will not happen, shouldn't he initiate a bill to repeal and remove the agency from AGC after the fact?

We all know what happened after the fact. Promise was made, people were charged, 3 constitutional challenges were made, courts shrugged their shoulder and went ""letter of law says so, go ask the legislature to repeal if you're not happy"", Cabinet went ""moral courage silent majority something something"" and issue was forgotten again. 13 years in the making. And we still made no progress. 

TLDR; Cabinet wants to have their cake and eat it; play the good cop and say no enforcement, but acts blur when someone actually gets charged and do nothing to repeal.

So if they have a bluetooth device installed at entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth?

Shouldn't the US military have been able to curb stomp the Taliban and Iraqi insurgents already? They couldn't in Vietnam, despite having jet fighters versus guys with AKs. Why did they need to send American GI joe with a rifle to go and root out a Taliban fighter with a rifle? Anytime anyone make your kind of argument, I can be sure they understand nothing about defence.

Not to mention, will the US military at that point still be loyal, and to whom? The Army, Marine, and Air Force person el are rotated through bases so they don't get attached to a locality too much but the National Guard, which has a nominally separate Chain of Command, just about the same number of divisions as the Army are stationed in the same state that the Guardsmen live in. They are, in other words, a lot more attached with the locals. Whose side will the National Guard be on? The National Guard has an Air Force, too; called the Air National Guard. It's highly possible that you will see the National Guards fighting back at the Federal troops.

The trick for national defence of a small country, like Finland, Israel, Vietnam is for every able-bodied adult to have received some military training and promise the invaders that yes, their tanks can go anywhere over the border, but the moment the crews turn of the engine and go to get dinner, take a shit, bath, or sleep, they will be killed.

1285,"For those worrying about the safety, here's the Pfizer press-release,
 
 >To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination.
 
 And here's the Moderna one:
 
 >The interim analysis included a concurrent review of the available Phase 3 COVE study safety data by the DSMB, which did not report any significant safety concerns. A review of solicited adverse events indicated that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Grade 3 (severe) events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first dose included injection site pain (2.7%), and after the second dose included fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), headache (4.5%), pain (4.1%) and erythema/redness at the injection site (2.0%). These solicited adverse events were generally short-lived. These data are subject to change based on ongoing analysis of further Phase 3 COVE study data and final analysis.
 
 You usually expect any safety signals to manifest themselves with 7-21 days from the last dose received and from a safety perspective, they appear to be well tolerated.

 I am not a doctor yet but I'll give you an example of doing an unbiased risk assessment without giving my opinions. At the end of this test you will find that ultimately I have not influenced you in anyway.
 
 With regards to the Pfizer Vaccine, it is a new technology. Unlike previous vaccines where they introduce a inactivated virus into your body which would activate your immunity system to fight against this Covid virus. Instead of inject a virus, they inject a protein into your body. It is supposedly safer because you are not injecting a virus into your body. There is a fear (not a risk) that this protein may cause some autoimmune issues, this is an opinion of some people there is no data of this happening. The technology has been studied for decades but they have not pushed this to the markets. The reason is that this technology is an expensive solution to the traditional solution (they ultimately do the same thing) but from a market perspective it is largely unproven. Whether it is safe or not, nobody has enough data to conclusively tell you whether it is safe to take or not. You have to decide on your own. Known side effects for the vaccines are also common there may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site. Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination. These normal vaccine reactions are usually mild and subside after a few days.
 
 Ultimately, you should decide to take an unproven vaccine vs trying to return to a time where there is no fear of getting Covid.",Vaccination,1,1,1,1,1,339,4,-10.67322217,66,13,14,0.30011263,0

 Thalidomide was a new drug a few decades ago and was recommended as a drug for hyperemesis gravidarium. Turns out it took them a few months to realise it actually caused birth defects. 
 
 In recent history the dengue vaccine from Sanofi actually was associated with the deaths of over 600 phillippine children despite having been trialled extensively. It is believed that the mechanism was due to antibody dependent enhancement, or an overly exuberant immune reaction to the dengue virus if u will.
 
 Mrna vaccines don't have that tried and tested safety record unlike inactivated virus vaccines.
 
 There are concerns that the lipid nano particles used to encase the mrna can end up in unintended places and trigger off unhelpful inflammatory responses in certain organs.

The reason they cut short the testing is because it became a matter of ethics to let the control group not have the vaccine during this pandemic as the control group was slowly increasing with the amount of infected people.
 
 Just because the situation didnt let them test for long term effects doesnt mean they dont exist, however. A wider sample is good, but doesnt cover that aspect
