231,"Fast forward to 6.00 in the video. To listen   This is my view,   The truth of the matter is when export remains the most important rule for all economies, access to open markets has to expose people to work in the manufacturing sector or create their own manufacturing systems to build their own fortunes within a lifetime. While people remain in the franchise and given the opportunity to forge a new system in other lands beyond within a single ecosystem to move beyond common borders or boundaries. This becomes especially significant when too many people are set in the service industry and there is a reduction in supply for people to remain employed in their adult to senior years.  https://youtu.be/SOA2wggd0tU",2021-01-29,118

This way, the process will not be abused.  Case in point: if a high ranking police officer wants to stalk a person for his own personal agenda, he would have to go through an additional process, and this will deter him from abusing the system.  In any case when there is a criminal investigation, the court will likely to be involved, and the court has a part to say which information will be useful for its legal process. ",2021-01-06,111

929,"Dear PM Lee, Many thanks for your caring & leadership and the great job of your team to tackle this massive disaster. Though not out of the woods yet but we now can see the light at the end tunnel.  The entire year of 2020 has been a challenging year unprecedented in recent history. 2020 is a year we will never forget.   While most of us have to endure discomfort and inconveniences stemming from a drastic change in our lifestyle, others suffer the greater hardships in life after losing their source of income or even their loved ones. However, no matter what the pandemic has taken from us, we have all gained something from this massive disaster.  In fact, it is a year with great opportunity for us to learn many crucial things in our life. It's a year has taught us Patience, Empathy, Knowledge of Survival in facing challenges, adapted to unforeseen situation like never before.  When the going gets tough, the tough gets going. We are seeing discipline, resilience, courage, understanding and care for each other amid this colossal crisis more than any other times in the past. We thought out of the box for survival, economically & mentally.  We maximized the usage of technology in our daily life. We never thought before that we could chit-chat with our friends, colleagues & loved ones via Zoom & always got connected. We never thought that we could work from home to carry out our works effectively throughout the weeks without going back to office.  We had the chance to accumulate these crucial life lessions in just a year. 2020 is a great teacher    We recognise that every changing colour of a leaf is beautiful, every changing scenery of a season has beautiful view & thus every changing situation of life is meaningful.  So we never grumble or complain. Instead, we remember that Pain is a sign that we are alive, facing problems are a sign that we are strong, indefatigable & tenacious.  We will continue acknowledge these truths & condition our heart & mind, our live will be more meaningful, different & worthwhile.  This pandemic has shown us that we are capable of adapting to changes in life and moving on together as one.  Just a few more hours, we are ushering into year 2021.  Let us usher into 2021 confidently with same mindset & attitude.  Wishing you & your team a blessed & joyful year ahead. Cheers. Bobby, Resident from Pasir Ris",2020-12-31,395

2612,"Dear Prime Minister,   Thank you for your strong political leadership that led us as a society and as a nation out of those 9 dark months of COVID-19.   Collectively, we have reduced its spread in our country.   Now, there is more hope ahead as we rebuild our lives.    As we emerge from this dark tunnel with hope at its exit, we must help a small group of fellow Singaporeans stuck in despair.  This group is affected by Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s recall of the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) payouts that MOM had given earlier (Straits Times Dec 12, 2020 page B7 “Self-employed who under-declared income asked to return Covid-19 aid”).   It reported MOM’s letters to such SIRS recipients stated that their employment income for work years 2018 to 2019 exceeded the threshold of $2,300 per month.  But this 2018 to 2019 income was not as far as I remember a criterion when the SIRS first rolled out in March 2020.   Furthermore, many who lost their regular jobs and became self-employed such as private car hire drivers shortly before the SIRS was implemented in March 2020.  They hardly made ends meet with car rental fee of about $2,000 per month and passengers hardly existed in the ghostly circuit breaker period.     Moreover, some recipients received the SIRS payment only after appealing to MOM when their initial application failed.  If the 2018 to 2019 income had become a criterion by then, why did MOM proceed to approve those appeals?       The SIRS payments pulled these fellow citizens out of starvation through those dark months, and these citizens have started to help rebuild our economy.     Sadly, this recall of the SIRS payments casts another blow to them and might drive some of those without means into deeper despair while the rest of us move towards hope.     Also, the above Straits Times report elaborated that MOM did not respond to its queries on how MOM would handle such appeals to MOM’s letters asking for refund.   We must help these fellow citizens.  One way is to set aside the recall for refunds or make a hard leadership decision on a one-time waiver.     Prime Minister, I hope your address to our nation on 14 December 2020 can also cover this issue and let it be a beacon of hope for these desperate fellow Singaporeans.     They are part of our valuable human resource rebuilding our economy from COVID-19’s devastation.     Please help them.   ",2020-12-13,388

Everything seemed pale and so I decided to look for help in spell casters who have the capability to bring my ex husband back to me. As envisaged, I went on the internet and as you too have seen in your search for a reliable spell caster, I saw a lot of testimonies of spell casters in the recovery of ex husbands and loved ones. Driven by belief in Doctor Dayo, I contacted him and after explaining things to him, he accepted to face the challenges on ground. He did brilliantly well. My ex husband came back to me within 2 days of contact with more care and affection and promised never to leave me. I will therefore like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him and share this testimony to enable others in need to contact him for his selfless service to situations and problems. Commendable, he shows great courage at taking on the daunting task of finding solutions to practically any given problem. Contact him at landofsolutionsolve@gmail.com or WhatsApp him +2349067952280 and I believe he will help you as he did to me.    https://www.facebook.com/Dr-Dayo-101608578400227/ ",2020-12-13,236

In real life many of us tends to forget very fast once crisis is over, and as such many don't really learn (except those that always stay vigilant at all time regardless whether in times of crisis or peaceful period).  Many of us always prefer to select the easy way out and take things for granted, and especially so when our government were too efficient, as we can always put the blame to the government (just like many of the opposition supporters love to do).

3187,"Dear PM Lee, I was accompanying my son to school in UK recently and I am very proud of what our Government has done to regulate our cooked food handlers hygiene standards strictly, even way before COVID19.   I was in a bagel shop where I witnessed a store supervisor clearing a trash bag before my eyes, didn't wash his hands, took my order, and prepared everything without gloves and mask. I had to dispose the food out of not confronting him as I didn't think it's mandatory for him to do so. I had chosen to discard the food instead. I don't think he's the only one who practiced such acts as it's probably not regulated despite the pandemic. It's even scarier to think about those who prepare in a closed kitchens who deliver foods through online channels.   I wondered why numbers and death rates can be so high in some countries? I had also written to WHO Singapore office to escalate such observations and I have yet to receive a reply. I hope G to G can also help to share such good  practices as every precious human live matters and constantly are at risks. Our fellow Singaporeans are also living abroad.   Thank you very much for your attention. Stay blessed!",2020-12-02,205

3199,"Today, 2nd Dec 2020 is the 167th day of the Phase 2 of our Re-opening.  After more than two weeks, there was an infection in the community.  There is no clear sign ahead that this virus will end soon. Is the vaccine a cure or prevention?  Is there a medical treatment or medical cure for COVID-19?. However, worldwide mankind has crossed the 365th day and the infection has gone up in some big countries and cities, latest there were more than 10m infection, and more than 1m deaths.  Will this madness go on for another 12 or 24 months, and will deaths go up to 2 or 3m?  What are our plans? What are our yearly roadmaps for the coming 10 years to 2031? Who will ask for it in Parliament?  ======  Mask-wearing…do we see the bigger picture?Is the vaccine a cure or a prevention measure?Will red dot encourage the UN and the WHO to do this 40 thing?  Should the UN and WHO get all countries to cooperate and shut down for 40 days and 40 nights to stamp out COVID-19? The best of time is now for the countries in the northern hemisphere during this wintry period [Christmas, New Year 2021, and the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays] to shut down for 40 days [like in the olden days of the leprosy infection to quarantine the new arrivals until the all-clear signal to let them out].  Now is the time to do just that for the all-clear of infected persons to stamp out COVID-19 and force it to have a natural ending.As for all other counties, those at the equator and those in the southern hemisphere [summer time], all should unite and comply to shut down too for 40s day to stamp out this disease well and good.  Can the UN and WHO obtain this universal cooperation by all countries around the world to shut down this earth for 40 days and 40 nights at the same time?  Time for the whole world to go in hibernation for 40 days. If we don’t do we want to continue with the madness for another 400 or more days worldwide affecting the economy and all aspects of human lives.  Choose wisely to have a suffering of 40 or 400 days, or could be more.",2020-12-02,357

3250,"Dear PM, I really appreciate the effort by Gov and Temasek foundation to protect citizens and residents. The latest mask really looks good but I found that the filter is really difficult to be assembled to the mask. Please spare few minutes to try it and I am sure you will be aware of the issue. Further more, the filter will not be able seamlessly cover the edges of the mask, the air will take the least resistance path during breathing. This makes the filter basically useless. The previous distribution of DET30 mask does not have all these issues. I whole heartily give this feedback and hopefully the procurement for the mask will make more effort to try out before mass purchase of the masks, to give better products to all of us and to ensure money well spent.. Lastly, I would like to thank you and your team again for all the helps to fellow citizens and residents during this difficult time..",2020-12-09,163

Thanks Mr. Lee for you and your government who took bold steps to deal with this Covid outbreak and tried so hard to prevent the spread.. I didn't see many countries dealing with the vivid 19 challenges of low income workers who also were part of the countries population as Singapore did... Well done Singapore ...thanks to everyone there from your government to your people... From the opposite end of this world your efforts in handling this is greatly appreciated has an impact on us all. Thank you,2020-11-27,139

3312,"It is indeed tough and tumultuous, just couldn’t imagine what is it like without the lifeline and stimulus rescue packages rolled out by  our government. So far we are coping quite well but the threat of another wave is very real. This is given the fact that there are public places visited by covid patients, therefore giving the virus an opportunity to cause havoc. So far, our measures are able to keep the possible spread of the virus in the community at bay. Another outbreak would have a severe impact on our lives and economy. Well done everyone, and a big thank you to our PM, Mr Lee, for mitigating the impact that this pandemic has on our lives and livelihoods. You are indeed our savior. ",2020-11-27,127

There is no point going back to the same occupations and industries - the pandemic and the mitigating measures, such as physical distancing and working from home among others, have changed the landscape forever.  Retraining for pre-pandemic jobs will not be helpful at all. Even the very format of retraining will also have to be changed.  Subsidies to prop up certain industries, like tourism, will not help in transition.  An overhaul of the economy, how we work, and how we earn are sorely needed.",2020-11-27,96

Every leader, government and everyone must realize how destructive a pandemic can be. Stimulus and rescue packages rolled out by each individual state is beginning to loose steam as countries suffer not one but more waves of outbreak. World leaders must come to a realization and work together to bring the pandemic under control. All efforts could be easily wipe out, policies planned are prone to setbacks as long as Covid exists. It’s not when but “How “ should the world open up to ensure that cross border travels are safe. Wonderful that world leaders are more responsible and working towards a better tomorrow. It will take time but hopefully not too long. Wishing everyone a safe and healthy 2021.",2020-11-23,144

Many thanks to both the Hong Kong and Singapore teams for working closely on this historical milestone.   商務及經濟發展局 CEDB  https://www.facebook.com/1904092703194154/posts/2852177781718970/,2020-11-11,40

4242,I like your fitted suit. Very nice look,2020-11-11,8
4243,This is a great start towards some semblance of normality Min Ong. The government previously announced that travelers who contract COVID-19 would have to pay on their own medical expenses (although eligible to use Medishield Life). Will this self pay for COVID-19 treatment also apply for air bubble travel?,2020-11-11,49
4244,"Mr Ong, thank you for the hard work in making the travel bubble possible. While happy, I'm concerned that the visitors are not tested upon landing in Singapore. Isn't it safer to have the Hong Kong travellers tested upon landing in Singapore? Maybe a rapid test like those we conducted before big events? The token apps will only help track but not detect since the test would have been done 72 hours in advance.",2020-11-11,71

With neither natural resources nor a sizeable and strong domestic market to propel our already severely stagnated economy, opening our borders would be the master key in unlocking the door and turning the extremely bleak situation around. A quick test method should be deployed expeditiously which would empower us to open our borders more extensively and get the gears of our economy humming once again. More job losses and closures is a completely preventable tragedy but only if we act in a timely and decisive manner to mitigate this fallout. Government grants which have already depleted a significant portion of our national reserves cannot go on indefinitely and can only cushion the impact in the short term. Make no mistake, we are now way past the short term. May the painstaking hard work and effort of the previous generations in making our nation one to be taken seriously not end up in shambles. It would be a complete shame if we are allowed to go down that slippery and tenebrous path.",2020-10-30,198

Teaching very young children early about hand washing will allow them to form habits that will stay with them for life .

Wishing all a joyful handwashing celebration today 👏👍🙏,2020-10-15,115

4919,"What is the problem with Singapore?  ￼  Arkaneh Urairat  ·  June 4, 2020  Live in Bangkok know Thailand and Thais well.  There is one place in this part of the world which is too good to be true. I am talking about Singapore.  For people who have not been to Singapore, they may have heard a reputation for harsh punishment with nicknames such as a nanny-state or a police-state. Although it tells you something about the country that it does not reflect what Singapore is really like.  From my perception as a Thai from Bangkok, let me tell you what the problem with Singapore is.  Start the day by going out in Singapore, walk along a spick and span sidewalk under a cool-looking covered walkway from your doorstep to the bus stop or train station to take a clean-looking public bus or train without getting into the scorching sun.  Crossing the road is a breeze on a green man with a numeral signal at a slow pace. All cars stop as you walk, even at a snail pace. It’s the same wherever you are in this awesome Garden City. Taking a taxi at a taxi stand in an orderly manner, no one jumps the line or cuts in as everyone is conscious of one another. Buses arrive on time as expected in a lengthy line, neither double-parking nor conductors shouting their destinations. Passengers walk to board the buses at a normal pace to their delight. No pushing and no cut-in. A very elderly lady inches her way from one end of a bus stop to a waiting bus. With no sign of irritation from the bus driver, only with a smile, she tabs her senior card and inches her way to a vacant seat before the bus takes off. A migrant worker is attended to by a pair of the boys in Blue after the public made a call seeing him looking unwell but with beaming eyes of appreciation. A little girl spilled a drink from a bottle while walking with her mom on a sidewalk, a moment later a road cleaner wiped it off. A pretty lady in tiny shorts exposing her beautiful long legs, walking past the construction site full of men at work, but nobody has a blink of an eye, no whistle, no name-calling. The man rushed back to a cafe to his relief, a wallet he left on a seat half an hour ago was still there, despite being packed with almost full of office workers during lunchtime. All roadside trees are numbered, as are lamp posts, trash cans, and bus stops. An elderly man is walking straight to the only pay phone booth left, and the phone is working. When in Singapore, if anyone has any problem… just have to Dial 999, within 6 minutes, a pair of police officers will be there in Fast Response Car (FRC)… Help is coming!  ￼  Living in Singapore is just like fairy tales and when Singaporeans step out of their country and that is when the reality in life kicks in. Little do they know about the problem of Singapore?  I remember when a fire broke out in Hotel Fire in Bangkok many years ago. Most guests ran for their lives, some scaled down from the concrete ledges at the front, while others from the sewer pipes. Sadly, many guests have been found dead after the fire was put out.  They have found the bodies of a family from Singapore who died from smoke inhalation in a bathtub. A surviving housekeeper who told the man to leave told reporters a Singaporean man said out loud that: “Help was coming.”… Reported in a Thai newspaper.",2020-10-14,604

5056,"What is the problem with Singapore?  ￼  Arkaneh Urairat  ·  June 4, 2020  Live in Bangkok know Thailand and Thais well.  There is one place in this part of the world which is too good to be true. I am talking about Singapore.  For people who have not been to Singapore, they may have heard a reputation for harsh punishment with nicknames such as a nanny-state or a police-state. Although it tells you something about the country that it does not reflect what Singapore is really like.  From my perception as a Thai from Bangkok, let me tell you what the problem with Singapore is.  Start the day by going out in Singapore, walk along a spick and span sidewalk under a cool-looking covered walkway from your doorstep to the bus stop or train station to take a clean-looking public bus or train without getting into the scorching sun.  Crossing the road is a breeze on a green man with a numeral signal at a slow pace. All cars stop as you walk, even at a snail pace. It’s the same wherever you are in this awesome Garden City.

5222,"What is the problem with Singapore?  ￼  Arkaneh Urairat  ·  June 4, 2020  Live in Bangkok know Thailand and Thais well.  There is one place in this part of the world which is too good to be true. I am talking about Singapore.  For people who have not been to Singapore, they may have heard a reputation for harsh punishment with nicknames such as a nanny-state or a police-state. Although it tells you something about the country that it does not reflect what Singapore is really like.  From my perception as a Thai from Bangkok, let me tell you what the problem with Singapore is.  Start the day by going out in Singapore, walk along a spick and span sidewalk under a cool-looking covered walkway from your doorstep to the bus stop or train station to take a clean-looking public bus or train without getting into the scorching sun.  Crossing the road is a breeze on a green man with a numeral signal at a slow pace. All cars stop as you walk, even at a snail pace. It’s the same wherever you are in this awesome Garden City. Taking a taxi at a taxi stand in an orderly manner, no one jumps the line or cuts in as everyone is conscious of one another. Buses arrive on time as expected in a lengthy line, neither double-parking nor conductors shouting their destinations. Passengers walk to board the buses at a normal pace to their delight. No pushing and no cut-in. A very elderly lady inches her way from one end of a bus stop to a waiting bus. With no sign of irritation from the bus driver, only with a smile, she tabs her senior card and inches her way to a vacant seat before the bus takes off. A migrant worker is attended to by a pair of the boys in Blue after the public made a call seeing him looking unwell but with beaming eyes of appreciation. A little girl spilled a drink from a bottle while walking with her mom on a sidewalk, a moment later a road cleaner wiped it off. A pretty lady in tiny shorts exposing her beautiful long legs, walking past the construction site full of men at work, but nobody has a blink of an eye, no whistle, no name-calling. The man rushed back to a cafe to his relief, a wallet he left on a seat half an hour ago was still there, despite being packed with almost full of office workers during lunchtime. All roadside trees are numbered, as are lamp posts, trash cans, and bus stops. An elderly man is walking straight to the only pay phone booth left, and the phone is working. When in Singapore, if anyone has any problem… just have to Dial 999, within 6 minutes, a pair of police officers will be there in Fast Response Car (FRC)… Help is coming!  ￼  Living in Singapore is just like fairy tales and when Singaporeans step out of their country and that is when the reality in life kicks in. Little do they know about the problem of Singapore?  I remember when a fire broke out in Hotel Fire in Bangkok many years ago. Most guests ran for their lives, some scaled down from the concrete ledges at the front, while others from the sewer pipes. Sadly, many guests have been found dead after the fire was put out.  They have found the bodies of a family from Singapore who died from smoke inhalation in a bathtub. A surviving housekeeper who told the man to leave told reporters a Singaporean man said out loud that: “Help was coming.”… Reported in a Thai newspaper.",2020-10-13,604

As she had always been healthy before the deadly bite, we are deeply saddened by her sudden departure and hope more can be done to eradicate the problem.  Instead of just stating the obvious fact which we have been hearing year after year to expect spike in number of dengue cases, what we are hoping to hear from the relevant ministry is an effective and comprehensive solution to solve this dengue problem, which has been around for decades.",2020-10-01,112

The CDC has come out and said that more people have died from suicides than COVID. The social media is scrubbing posts which have been quoting the CDC than only 6% of the reports of the deaths were from only COVID – less than 10,000. That same report confirmed that less than 15,000 people died under the age of 55. The Germany Minister of Health admitted that the lockdowns were a mistake. Now the data on the COVID situation and mortality in Germany have surfaced showing that there has “apparently never been an epidemiological emergency.” It is time that we demand an investigation that is REAL and we expose those who have been orchestrating this false flag to force their Climate Change agenda on the world.",2020-09-08,152

Even if a vaccine costs $50, and we purchase for 5M people, it will be just 0.25 billion. That is nothing compared to the loss of business due to lock down, the cost to test and isolate, the continued loss of jobs. Every month is billions to Singapore so we should get the vaccine at the earliest date possible. Thank you.",2020-09-02,112

Despite Corvid-19, globally, Singapore is ""the"" or one of the most competitive economies in the world. Why? Thanks to meticulous and hardwork of PAP despite limited natural resources. Thankful for excellent governance and diplomatic relations, one of the world's most secure financial markets, advanced digital society, highly educated labour force, and more.   Domestically, despite Corvid-19, nobody gets left behind! Why? Thanks to PAP!  World-class  healthcare, no shortage of basic needs, including food security. PAP is working around the clock to put secure employment for all.  Many other countries lack all of the above. Most important, a PAP govt is responsible and works non-stop to ensure all aspects of security, not just food security.   If PAP doesn't continue as government, the cost of policy reversals are a serious and immeasurable harm to the sovereignty and economic development of Singapore! And our lives and that of the future generations.   Plenty of other good reasons to vote for PAP.  Your vote counts. Do vote mindfully but not emotionally during the Corvid-19 era.  But do vote! Thank you!  Sharing late evening nomination day selfie. Excited to vote!   Blessings for continued good health and safety.   (Chai) 🙏👌💕",2020-07-01,212

The COVID-19 Pandemic is not the main culprit, but its accelerated and faster the process which landed us quickly on the rotten ground. Whether any Pandemic or not, the world recession will still be realised slowly at years, but destruction will be far more complicated with more incurable wounds. COVID 19 could be a plot or a gift that successfully wash cards and reset the order. New round of cards new opportunities, new reset of order new development, new decisions new outlook.

Ur party never took a pay cut during this crisis , the team let the ball drop on the migrant worker issues , levies have been collected for years , new policies are introduced and I’m sure will keep on coming to make the cost of living here so high , us middle income families are struggling . Medicare , housing , transport , food are rising , salaries are stagnant except maybe yours . Nepotism is so rampant it’s vulgar . People in office are being chosen by race . What happened to the pledge ? I’m disappointed at how the elderly , taxi Drivers, Nurses , fireman & policeman are underpaid . You are the highest paid prime minister in the world , do u care for our welfare ? U speak of reserves , why aren’t we allowed to manage our own retirement funds . U made a MediShield account , is that not enough ? U look frail , is your team able to run if you fall ill . There are only a few who actually cut the grade . Your standards of minister selection has dropped . The old guard that are leaving were stellar. This newbies are lack lustre . Pay close attention to your people , they are yelling for help . You will find this election , you will have to fight for our vote . Don’t fear monger , you educated Singaporeans, the majority of us are peaceful , law abiding citizens , living in harmony . Now we need a genuine government to lead . The elitism & nepotism has to stop ✋🏽. 2020 make ur ministers work for the people bcoz they are paid by us . Don’t raise taxes & lower cost . You really aren’t doing a good job sir & your team come across as indifferent. Please do more for the people of Singapore not the foreigners . We the citizens really need a hand .

7517,"Dear Fellow Singaporeans! Dear Fellow Singaporeans!  In every Family, the Father knows best the Strengths & Weaknesses of his sons! Who is more good,  who is more  naughty, the Father knows best but chooses to see only the good side of his sons & loves them both!  Who is to follow the Father's foot steps, the Father knows best too!  The same applies, as I believe with our late Founding Father & Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's Home!   Today, as we know clearly, it is our Dear PM Lee Hsien Loong & not his brother Hsien Yang who is entrusted to continue the same pursuit to lead & chart the Destiny for Singapore & Singaporeans, with the same conviction & same common values as shared  collectively by our Country's past Founding Fathers, Founding & Succeeding Leaders!  Our Dear PM Lee was groomed from young!  He walks the 'GROUNDS' with his Father!  But certainly as I believed, it is not meant to be a continuation of the Lee Family's Legacy but a determined continuation to pursue & write the Singapore's Success Story together with every Singaporeans for the GOOD of our Present & Future Generations!!  A continuation to uphold the same belief that 'SINGAPORE WILL SURVIVE' against all ODDS!   To be No one Stooge!   To be No one Subject!  Our Dear PM Lee has honorably placed Country over Self & our Nation's Well-being over Family's  kinship!  He upholds our State's Office & Institutions with impartiality regardless of person!  But deep inside, from a layman Singaporean's observation, we know he loves his  Brother & Sister Dearly & Deeply!  Without prejudice, to JAKE TEO & LOW SUANG LENG, do you think our Late Stateman, our greatly esteemed Founding Father, our Founding Prime Minister believes & subscribes to what you say & suggest!  Our late Founding Prime Minister 'eat salts more than you eat rice'. He knows who is Singapore's Adversaries who write with a 'poison' pen, mis-represent His Will, & sowing the seeds of discord between his two beloved sons!  Without prejudice, To JAKE TEO & LOW SUANG LENG.  Fyi, I dreamt of our late Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew last night!  He was standing between his two sons!  He had his arms over his two sons' shoulders lovingly patting them; PM Hsien Loong on his Right & Hsien Yang on his left!  To both he said 'Beware of  Adversaries' who divide you!   They speak no truth! But write to divide.  They speak like 'SOMEBODY' but are but 'Empty'.  I faced such Adversaries too when I was Governing!  To PM Lee he said. 'Son Hsien Loong, against all ODDS continue to write the Singapore Story with your Team, together, 'hand-in-hand with every Singaporeans!  Wise & discerning Singaporeans knows what is good & what is bad! They will continue to support you!  To Hsien Yang, he said, 'Son, why are you with TCB?   As Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong has told the public, it was him who recommended TCB's Candidacy to me for consideration!  Why did TCB, distorts & told the Media I had sought him? This untrue & false!  Be wise son less you be 'manipulated'!  TCB is of Age, what is he fighting for? Deflated Ego?  Personal Pride?  Using my 'Lee Kuan Yew's Name & 'Ex-Factor' to enhance his Candidacy & Party, doing it when I am not around to attest to what he said?  I woke up from my dream & realise it was just a but dream.   Realising that PM Lee HL & Lee Hsien Yang are still Brothers after all, of the same Heritage & of the same Blood'.   Press on our Dear PM Lee, count us in!  We hope Mr Lee Hsien Yang will return to his own 'Fold'!  LAO LEE PO PI!  From a Singaporean!  From a Citizen Soldier!  😎",2020-06-29,589

7955,"Dear PM  Ivan Lim and Desmond Tan may cause PAP to lost many more seats next month! I am concerned!   Today, I have posted an article in ST, CNA, Mothership, Independent.sg, &  Heng Swee Kiat fb pertaining to Desmond Tan, ex-CE of People's Association urged him to defend on the alleged cover-up that I put forth as below:   *[For Desmond Tan Kok Ming to reply]*  As a public servant, Integrity & Transparency are upmost important!   However, Desmond Tan apparently lacked in this attribute.   In late 2019, the Deputy General Manager of Southeast CDC, under the purview of PA with Desmond Tan as CE, was criminally charged in the State Court of Singapore.  Despite numerous call to him to at least suspend the duty of the staff in view of pending court case, Desmond Tan decided not to interdict his staff, this was in contrast to the practice of the entire public service, and it goes against public interests to continue letting his staff who has been criminally-charged to continue serving the members of the public while the Court Hearing is on-going!   We can't help but believe there is element of covering up and Desmond Tan, as CE, is guilty of that!   With GE coming, I urge Desmond Tan to quickly clear the air in local media, or risk losing the entire GRC to the Oppositions!   I reiterate again that Integrity and transparency are important attributes are expected in public servant and political appointees alike!   Thank you.

7966,"Dear PM,   It is really heartening to see PAP’s new candidates coming from various backgrounds for this GE. There are many promising ones, and a lot of capable female candidates too.   As with any form of selection, we may end up with a few gems but it’s not uncommon, some less than suitable candidates made their way through.   Have you seen the respond of Mr Ivan Lim on ST to the various allegations made about him? What do you think about it? I have no direct contact with him, so it’s not in my position to determine what is the truth. However, his statement reeks of only one thing - ARROGANCE.   1. There were many things said about him from student days, NS, even till this date, in the course of work. However, he chose to pick the very, very few instances he felt he had a case.  2. Everyone makes mistakes. There is no shame in looking back on our actions of the past and learn from them. For Mr Lim, there wasn’t any sort of hint that he might have been less than right in some of his actions, nor any form of reflection throughout his entire statement.   All he did was to justify and to state his resolve to  “stay on the course and to serve”.  Can a person who is always Right (unable to reflect) be the leader we can look up to, or a steward of people who is willing to listen and serve?   Hopefully, PAP can take another look at this candidate and truly assess if he is the right choice for the people. If so, please convince us that whoever vote the team for which he is attached to is getting a worthy package and not one where we are “forced” to accept because we wanted the rest of the team.   Thank you.  ",2020-06-27,311

They gave the people Hopes, easing the restrictions gradually while ensuring that safe distancing measures are strictly adhered as much as possible  They showered the citizens with love by giving us money, supplying us with masks and doing their best to keep as many jobs alive and even gave the people the benefit of doubt regardless whether they shown any evidence of proof of loss of income when they applied for the 500 dollars.   As much as life will probably never be the same as before in the near future, the government spared no effort in taking care of every patient who was diagnosed with covid19 and isolated or admitted in hospitals or other shelters. The government also bear full cost for the medical bills incurred due to the covid 19 throughout a reasonable time frame.  Ministers has been updating the public regularly with regards to the circuit breaker, status of the covid19, reassuring the people that the country will be back stronger than before and always putting the people as their priority   As much as the people are all undergoing a different standard of living, I would proudly say that practically everyone in this country has a place to stay. No cases of starvation to death and jobs though are lessen but still available.   We must not treat this for granted and appreciate what our current government has done for us! It might not be  up to some people's expectation but certainly I would say singapore is definitely 1 of the best country in this world.

8812,"How are can emulate Vietnam with zero COVID death toll. Firstly Vietnamese already using masks for umpteen years when riding motorcycles as their primary mode of travel which is also self-isolation travel rather than public buses. So these effectively prevent mass infections. Maybe our government if they think carefully should reintroduced PMD (Personal Mobility Devices) and also allow these PMDs on the road rather than pavement while shifting the buses lane to the middle lane and only filter to the left when stopping for the few passengers instead. Likewise, the SMART super long buses are actually quite empty wasting public funds and we should now focus on using mini-vans like in Hongkong. Generic routes are considered inefficient nowadays. With mobile Apps passengers can book the travel in advance and regional mini-vans will use AI or databases SQL to match their destination and pickup times to optimize fuel and costs.  https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/29/a...hnk/index.html",2020-05-30,146

9211,"Hi PM Lee, the recent community cases have come down, and our economy is at a real brink of collapse, I lobby to you to allow more companies, apart from the essential few, to operate asap but with strict rules of safeguards, which I agree. To save workers is to save the employers or the companies, otherwise ppl are not sick but gradually starved to death. To emerge stronger later is to ensure our present survival first. The businesses are either suffering or collapsing, It would have been a economic catastrophe if you expect a close to zero community infections for a few days before you lift up.",2020-05-07,108

9219,"Dear Pm Lee, I am an advocate for the CB, and believe materialism can not be put in front of humanity. I know about Singapore's reaching out to many pharmaceutical companies and our investments in them so that Singaporeans get the first vaccines when they are available. However, our FW's are now sequestered and receiving their due care, and, businesses are suffering, albeit, there is evidence from Germany of a second wave. It maybe be prudent to be patient and err on the side of safer model. Another pet peeve of mine is petrol prices. This is fundamental to our cost of living, and, in Australia prices have dropped to reflect the fall of oil prices but not in Singapore, nor are our petrol taxes been increased, so why are petrol kiosks allowed to possibly profiteer?",2020-05-08,134

I believe our ministerial team briefed today the approach using testings, tracking using sensors, wearing mask, social distancing etc to manage safety risks..., and is in correct direction as most  countries fighting the CoVid19 war is doing....   To safe jobs, companies can adopt a win- win approach by negotiating salary (with government subsidies) adjustment with employees instead of making them redundant,  and readjust the salary back once the economy goes back .  I hope the government will brief the public soon, on the schedule and sequence how the various businesses are to be open, once the plan is ready.",2020-05-08,113

9256,"Dear PM, I learned today the new cases came down to 486 but it’s because one of our labs is not working.  This means if we had more testing capacity, we would find more cases.  I also learned today that the UK has a similar problem... their labs are too slow and as a result, they sent 50,000 samples to the US for testing.  I really think we should collect a lot more test samples from the dorms and ask Korea for support to test some of the samples for us.  As we ramp up to 40,000 tests a day, and if Korea can help us to test quickly, say, 100,000 in the next couple days, we should be able to isolate all the infected.  Today, there are still hundreds and hundreds of infected foreign workers in the dorms not showing symptoms yet and they continue to spread the virus.  Sending samples to Korea for testing while we ramp up our capacity is the best way to quickly isolate all the infected.",2020-05-11,169

May we who have the flexibility to care for our children when their schools close remember those children who will go hungry with no school meals. May we who have to cancel our trips remember those with no place to go. May we who are losing our margin money  in the tumult of the economic market remember those who have no margin at all. May we who settle in for quarantine at home remember those who have no home. As fear grips our country let us choose love. During this time when we cannot physically wrap our arms around each other let us yet find ways to be the loving embrace of God to our neighbour. Through Jesus Christ our Saviour, whose arms of love embrace us all. Amen.",2020-05-09,181

After few occasional paranoid run and hoarding of essential items, we have proven that our 2 step ahead strategy (as mentioned by Minister Chan CS) did not failed us again. We live up to our name that we maintained our port open despite the severity of CoVID-19 is another milestone that we honoured what we signed and agreed with our trading partners too.

Staggering of school start times within a zone. Social distancing in classroom No CCA  Extra hygiene & disinfecting of public toilets.

My family member is currently staying at Swissotel The Stamford Ram 1056 and she is experiencing difficulty in breathing due to an allergy to smoke. Yes, since yesterday she could smell cigarette smoke several times a day in the bathroom. Multiple complaints have been lodged with the hotel managers but this still did not stop. Someone is smoking in the hotel room and I’m appalled and offended that the hotel has no contingency plan to deal with this. A change of room is planned pending approval from the authorities and it’s been 4 hours since this request was made but still the approval is pending. I’m very concerned about this as smoking in the room is against the law, a safety hazard and a medical hazard to my family member. I ask for your help before any bad happens.

It is a lot of work literally endlessly, everyday, just to make sure Singapore survives through, TOGETHER. I can imagine because my son is involved and I see him no weekday or  weekend nor public holiday difference, just go do the work that is waiting there, everyday. No day or night working hours, just answer the call and spring to action. He is not at all in health care yet his worklife everyday is about Covid-19 and I am proud of him serving the nation. Many, many, many others are doing their respective roles, the Government is doing its best.  Some media take this opportunity to intentionally make a mockery of Singapore, some criticisms come from within. It is always easier to criticize but whoever criticize may not always be able to do better.

I also hope places of worship will soon be open so we can go and meet our fellow members and worship God together.  My elderly friends are suffering mental anguish being cooped up at home.

It is prudent to stick strictly to our original extension of circuit breaker measures till 1 June. Once you start to ease the restrictions, you are risking our community to more potential outbreaks. Any spike in cases and outbreaks after that will be catastrophe and overwhelming to our healthcare resources. I hope that Singapore do not imitate others in rushing to open up the economy at the expense of residents' health. Even after the end of the circuit breaker, social distancing measures and putting on masks in school, at work or in public areas must still be strictly enforced in place for a period. We cannot afford to be complacent and risk another outbreak.",2020-05-02,140

Every government, businesses, educational institutions, religious organizations and communities must work hand in hand to put a curb to covid 19. As long as any country has an outbreak, the threat of it spreading to others will always be there because we are very much globalized. Cross border exchanges and traveling is unavoidable. Every effort by individual country will eventually add up to become a global effort. It is to nobody’s advantage if any country is left behind in this battle. It requires everyone to do the right things right. Singaporeans have tuned in to our PM’s May Day rally and heard your call, the call for all Singaporeans to understand current situations, a call to put individual differences aside and to work together. We may not have been perfect but we certainly can learn and be better. Yes, PM Mr Lee sir, we will work with you and are confident that you will guide us through this pandemic and future challenges.Our former PM LKY said “ Each step we take is to open avenues for ourselves and our children’s future.” Do it not only for ourselves but also for future generations.",2020-05-01,228

They told us life is forever a learning process. Yes, old jobs may diminished. But in the midst of all these, new opportunities will appear. We just have to be open to new opportunities & be open-minded to learn new skills. Who knows, we may love the new jobs available. Who says Singapore has no resources? Our hardworking people are the best resources. When GOD closes one door, he will open another door for us. HAPPY LABOUR DAY TO EVERYONE! 🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👏👏👏🥰🥰🥰🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬",2020-05-01,119

It's going to be a long long wait, at least till the whole world is clear and beyond, before tourists are allowed in again. As a guide I've acquired skills in communication, patience, people management. I'm healthy, active physically and mentally. I was rejected when I applied for social distancing ambassador job due to my age. Who do I turn to? Even NTUC, of which I'm a member in Chapter, is of no help. On top of that they keep on asking paper after paper to qualify for the fund despite knowing in a free lance guide registered with them. Can there be a re - consideration of age factor pls. I wish to contribute in any service during this tough time. I believe there are many like me above 60's affected similarly. This PG needs a way out. I do not plan to retire from my profession as my years of personal experiences witnessing events unfold before me from the 1950s are an asset I don't want to keep but share.

9882,"Dear PM,  Can you please consider any additional financial aid for self employed with 2 properties? Many do not qualify for any schemes because of having 2 properties. If income earned last year is really low there will be no savings. Instead there maybe more debts. Now its worst because of loss of income ,many are having difficulties servicing the loans especially if tenants dont pay rent or there is no tenants at all. Even if we sell the property it will be a long time due to current situation. Plus must return to the bank .Even if banks can defer installments but still dont have enough for daily expense with no income.  Would really help if the SEP SIRS criteria can allow multiple property owners to be eligible if their income is really low . Can just look at income level. Many self employed middle income earners are not that rich. Please help. Thank you.",2020-04-30,153

We can still recruit them again when situation improved.  In addition, let everyone take vegetarian. Those already infected with Covid19 , those serving 14 days quarantine, those in the dormitories , eat vege , eggs , fruits , milk , cheese , butter will do. Avoid meats , seafoods, fishes , living animals etc. this will build their immune system.  This will save their lives against infected and develop depression. Thank you.

Strenuous exercise should be considered as non-essential and not doing so for the next 1.5 months will not have any impact in a person life.

For e.g. could the dashboard predict where are the other clusters to emerge? Where should we next allocate our resources to?  For the dashboard, suggest to analyse the the risk factors of death (RFD) due to COVID, from the current medical papers published, be it from WHO or the medical institutions (local and abroad).   The RFDs could be age, disease burden (type of chronic disease), smokers,  other underlying health conditions.  Cross layer the wherabouts of these people with the RFDs against the current outbreak clusters (i.e. ongoing and subsided).   Analyse the distance and you can identify the likely emergent susceptible cohort of persons to next fall to COVID19.   Also consider our readiness to fight a triple war; where COVID is combined with Dengue and Haze. Each war has its own susceptible cohort of persons which can be overlayed for the agencies to identify actionable clusters to do their interventions.

While scrolling down the page on my phone, the graphs auto zoomed in or become 'distorted'.

We have to fight this battle together.  With regards to feedback, I am proposing a few below, subject of course to the availability of data:   1. Please consider releasing stats on i) Number of Tests done accompanying the positive cases number in the various categories and the resultant ratio of +ve cases to tests done. This should rationalise the +ve cases number better and give us a more accurate picture of the overall trend of infection rate; ii) Subcategory of Asymptomatic Cases ==>  +ve Asymptomatic cases detected / total +ve cases and / total tested.  These added statistics will address the topic of positive cases being a function of the number of tests conducted and give a better estimation of the underlying risk of asymptomatic infections.  2. Also, if this dashboard is to be released to the public, the definitions of the various categories need to be explained (e.g. an info touch icon next to terms).  #SGUnited ",2020-04-27,181

10689,"Evening PM Mr Lee sir, personally I think that extensive testing on the migrant workers is a positive way to go. It is crucial that all migrant workers are to be tested. They may have to undergo more than one round of testing just like a water filtering system. People  who are are under quarantine or SHN should also be tested after their two weeks. This is to filter out the infected especially the asymptomatic . It will make isolation more effective and efficient. Such measures will require more manpower and testing kits which is currently overstretch. Everything is always easier said than done. However, if testing is not extensive, it could erase all past efforts and result in another wave of infection. These are just my concerns and I meant no offense. Appreciate and thank you PM sir, frontline responders and everyone who are working relentlessly during these tough situations.",2020-04-26,150

A noticeable difference of infrastructure when crossing the bordered in from neighbouring countries 7. Embrace science and technology to be future ready while still having subtle religious undertones 8. Surrounded by countries that it borrows language, culture and food from 9. A symbiotic relationship with neighbours but a massive global player 10. Politically silent I.e.

11755,"Dear All Human Beings,   We are called humans not because of our physical appearance, but because of insight that we have. Only human being can think deeply and act wisely. So, the virus is spreading very fast and therefore this is high time for us to think deeply and act wisely. In fact, the virus or death doesn't care which religion, nationality, race and political party we belong to. The virus and death only care about whether we are living being or not. Since it is so, at least now, we must stop discrimination according to our own religion, political party, race or nationality. Just we must stand up as a wise Human being without discrimination to fight against the virus. By now, our main priority must be to stop spreading and transmission of the virus. However, we can see still people look forward and go out to eat McDonald, KFC, Pizza hut and Starbucks. If we do so, it is better to get ready for our funeral. This is not time for having fun or pleasing our tongue. This is not time for us to live to eat, but eat to live. So, just we need to be satisfied with what we have. There may be only one meal per day, but still we can survive by eating something. If we can't tolerate and be patient with it, we will have to suffer a lot and even leave everything. To overcome the current epidemic, we must let our conceit and egoistic ideas go and we must have a good listening skill. It is clear that we are not experts in medical treatments. That is why we must obey and follow the instructions of the doctors' and healthcare staffs. No matter how much power, money and material things we have, no one can use or no way to use those things at the moment. So, let's be united as humans and let's do our part properly. Let's fulfill our own duties and responsibilities towards the society and let's try our best to help our own government, army forces and healthcare staffs to stop the virus and to see a peaceful future.   May each and everyone be wise and have insight to act as humans without any discrimination and without any egoistic and selfish thought. May the humanity arise against the virus and may the whole world be free from the virus, its cause, its danger, its fear, its worry and its suffering. May all each and everyone and every being be protected by the Blessings of all kind hearted people's Loving-kindness and Compassionate thoughts....!",2020-04-24,426

Do go down to some wet markets and you will see plastic used to cover up all the tables and chairs to avoid people from sitting down to eat during this challenging period.  But is it a necessity to do so? What is going to happene to these plastics after the CB period? Where will the plastic cover goes?

11885,"The 0.2% Fatality Rate of Covid-19 in Singapore Inspires New Option on Herd Immunity (update 1)  As of April 21, there are a total of 9,125 Covid-19 cases in Singapore, with a total of 11 deaths equivalent to 0.12% fatality rate, and 27 in ICU cases, or projected 0.2% considering 30% in ICU could pass away. Why Singapore ’s case fatality rate so low lies in that of all cases, there are 7,497 work permit holders who are not senior citizens and not living with their families, accounting for 82% of the total. Non-vulnerable groups can easily beat the coronavirus through, proven by German's 0.2% fatality rate of age below 60. These work permit holders as non-vulnerable groups lower the fatality rate and ICU number to a very safe level. This inspired us to implement herd immunity among non-vulnerable groups, so as to achieve safe and low-cost herd immunity globally.  To win the war by herd immunity, my proposal is that we name the soldiers and battlefield to spread the virus and beat it, while keeping our vulnerable in safe places. It is herd immunity under controllable virus spreading rather than a random spreading.  https://www.bloombergquint.com/amp/coronavirus-outbreak/a-herd-immunity-strategy-could-actually-work-in-youthful-india Infect Everyone: How Herd Immunity Could Work for Poor Countries",2020-04-23,186

Risk of an upswing of serious cases from the older population.  [3] COVID epidemic (FW) – Bring down the R number. Watch out for upswing of severe cases. Do not assume that FW outbreak continues to be mild. Real outcomes only in 1 -3 weeks. Leverage existing resources and discern each dorms layout supports or hinder efforts.

11950,"Dear All Human Beings,   We are called humans not because of our physical appearance, but because of insight that we have. Only human being can think deeply and act wisely. So, the virus is spreading very fast and therefore this is high time for us to think deeply and act wisely. In fact, the virus or death doesn't care which religion, nationality, race and political party we belong to. The virus and death only care about whether we are living being or not. Since it is so, at least now, we must stop discrimination according to our own religion, political party, race or nationality. Just we must stand up as a wise Human being without discrimination to fight against the virus. By now, our main priority must be to stop spreading and transmission of the virus. However, we can see still people look forward and go out to eat McDonald, KFC, Pizza hut and Starbucks. If we do so, it is better to get ready for our funeral. This is not time for having fun or pleasing our tongue. This is not time for us to live to eat, but eat to live. So, just we need to be satisfied with what we have. There may be only one meal per day, but still we can survive by eating something. If we can't tolerate and be patient with it, we will have to suffer a lot and even leave everything. To overcome the current epidemic, we must let our conceit and egoistic ideas go and we must have a good listening skill. It is clear that we are not experts in medical treatments. That is why we must obey and follow the instructions of the doctors' and healthcare staffs. No matter how much power, money and material things we have, no one can use or no way to use those things at the moment. So, let's be united as humans and let's do our part properly. Let's fulfill our own duties and responsibilities towards the society and let's try our best to help our own government, army forces and healthcare staffs to stop the virus and to see a peaceful future.   May each and everyone be wise and have insight to act as humans without any discrimination and without any egoistic and selfish thought. May the humanity arise against the virus and may the whole world be free from the virus, its cause, its danger, its fear, its worry and its suffering. May all each and everyone and every being be protected by the Blessings of all kind hearted people's Loving-kindness and Compassionate thoughts....!",2020-04-23,426

In April, the global situation is very serious. Especially in July, we must be careful to control the epidemic to prevent more serious things from happening. So these few months must be handled well! This situation is similar to smallpox 300 years ago and the black death 100 years ago. Viruses in the environment are difficult to control, and it is necessary to find vaccines to prevent prevention. Action to study R&D vaccines is imperative to development. I hope to make some contribution to this society!",2020-04-15,118

Most of us certainly obey it's requirements but I understand that there are people still flaunting the current law either through ignorance or by intentional means. In my humble opinion, we should follow the example of UK's government and come up with a simple message directed at the people. The UK's one is: Stay Home. Protect the NHS. Save Lives. For us in Singapore, we could use the following phrase instead: Stay Home. Save Lives. Protect Our Loved Ones. This message should be repeated to everyone by your cabinet at the end of every public announcement through every form of media outlets and social media. By constantly driving home this message, Singaporeans will come to understand the vital importance of this circuit breaker period so that each of us will willingly do our part to follow the rules.

I moved to HK 2 years ago and feel that apart from WFH, the fact that everyone wears a surgical mask when stepping out of their homes is part of the reason the spread is so low. It is better to tell people to wear masks when they step out rather than specify markets, buses etc. It needs to be part of everyone’s “fashion accessory” for these difficult times.

I have just heard that some pupils whose parents have been identified as workers of essential services have been allowed to go to school everyday. However, this constant contact of the teachers in rotation and these children puts even more people at risk of infections! Not just the children but the teachers who have families would be at risk as well. I understand that the teachers are rotated to ensure contact tracing is possible, but contact tracing does not mean no infections. There must be an end to this.  You would argue that it is necessary for us to support the families of those who are in essential services but yet we don't do the same accommodations during month long or week long school breaks which just goes to show that these children do have other caretaking arrangements that are possible! Not to mention, the criteria for these children to qualify is extremely low, only one of the parents need to be in essential services to qualify for their child to continue physical attendance at school.

12708,"Dear Mr Prime Minister,  I call your attention to the rapidly rising price of essential foodstuff such as rice, which had risen by 11% since March this year. (From . $625/metric ton to $699/metric ton, source: indexmundi.com)  As an island with neither land nor natural resources, it is a worrying trend that our sources of basic necessities are not as secure as we might think, when countries where we import our usual essentials such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia are reeling just as badly from this plague.   As much as handing out financial aids might assist poor families, it is all pointless if the price of essentials raise to the point where no amount of money can afford. Hyperinflation is a real threat, and there is no sign in the weeks to come that the issue can just be wished away. Also, unlike the 2007-8 hyperinflation, the price of commodities this time is driven by an existential crisis - it is not artificial debt that is driving the price up, but the existence of a reliable supply.  I believe we should call attention to our pressing needs at this moment and consider food and fuel rationing. Put a clean stop to food/water/electric wastage, and issue food stamps. I can only pray that my gloomy predictions are unfounded, but in these days of crisis, the only thing that one can trust is oneself - unless there are sufficient reasons for otherwise. Past performance is never a guarantee for future, after all. ",2020-04-11,245

I hope the government quickly address this issue what other ways of covering up are acceptable, for example, wearing a scarf around the face, or face shields.

Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience. ...  Good Friday everyone... Respect what is taught to us thru words of the Bible.

13241,"it's time to rein in on the virus. CB, safe distancing and whatever you have will be wasted if you do not efficiently search out the virus carriers, isolate and contain them. Please do not rely on PHPC as they can only wait 5 days to decide if to get patient to hospital for testing. Some patients even push their luck and ask for 5 more days.  During SARs time SG had 993 and very effectively rounded up all carriers as the disease had high fatality rate. This round if government don't quickly identify the carriers and allow 5 or 10 days to spread, SG will have a hard time solving this COVID problem. A suggestion though is to set up a group of transporters such as grab hirers/taxis (with subsidy by government for each trip)fully geared with PPE and windows wind down for picking up COVID patients. PHPC is then not allowed to provide 5days medical leaves for patient with COVID symptoms. An emergency number should be dedicated for suspect patients / PHPC to call, and trained transporter to be dispatched to pickup patients at subsidized rate. After swab test patient should be sent back by same transporter and asked to self isolate and quarantine. Once COVID patients are identified, ambulance or trained transporter should be again activated by hospital to bring patient to hospital or designated area for treatment. While there could be a sharp spike of new cases during the first 2 weeks, the cases could eventually taper down quickly once it crosses the peak. The dormitories issue should be treated separately as their isolation and safe distancing are different. Government must quickly provide safe distancing for FWs, identify the sick ones and get them treated  Please help get this done so that SG will not be wasting resources after putting in so much to carry out Circuit  breaker.

13248,"Sir,  Here are my views/  recommendations for more effective #circuitbreaker and #safedistancing  1. Taxis - Not more than 2 passengers  2. Private cars - Not more than 3  3. ERP increase to operate near 24/7 with 2x -3x rates on all gantries. This would discourage travel. Essential services registered business and professional supporting essential services apply for a  refund/ rebate  4. Lesser frequencies of Bus with alternate seating only. No standing.  5. Trains to allow only seating in alternate seats no standing. Reduced frequencies  6. Travelling beyond 1Km from residence should be registered (to launch a mobile app to facilitate registration). Max 3 trips of 2hrs max per week per address  7. Tracetogether app must be kept ON while travelling outside residence. Failure to do so would attract penalties   8. Those staying beyond 2 km from address on IC to declare else eligible for being penalized for moving around  9. Visitor car and motorcycle to charge from first minute island wide. No free parking for visitors at HDB and public car parks. Carpark charges to double temporarily.  10. Stricter implementation of social distancing in entering MRT, waiting for bus, etc.",2020-04-10,167

The game changer, well said “The Father of Singapore”, Changed the “sands to lands” and far much more. Its from here came his dream of making this a “Garden city” Today the nation as a whole comes together  To fulfil as their first responsibility. Cleanliness seen like never before, The “litter free” singapore is yet the core. The laws like “no chewing gum” which today are rare to find, Are the basics of this city that leave everyone else behind! That iconic “Marina Bay Skyline”, That love for “Singapore sling”,music and wine, Those lush green gardens spread everywhere, That master stroke “Jewel” - crafted so fine!! That perfect blend of beauty and science at a glance; Its here to mention the “Rains” of this city That will fill your heart with a new romance!  From active weekday mornings To beautiful “clark quay” evenings From the traditional food court culture calls To those N number of shopping malls From the Universal Studios thrilling fun To the Sentosa’s soothing “Swim in the Sun” Its all so unique Something beyond that my words can speak!  Amidst the current covid -19 chaos that scares Applause for the sense of responsibility that every citizen shares Those amazing efforts of the grassroots volunteers  Are some more things that deserve a big  “cheers!!

It allows us to clearly visualise how stable our political government is and how you are keeping the crisis under control. Considering how you guys help us smoothen out the transition as much as possible to help us not to get into panic frenzy mode. I wouldn't trade this government for anything.

14345,"Thank you to you & your team for your hard works. Here are few suggestions, not sure are they possible to carry out?: 1. Think putting on mask is lmportant. It can protect   itself & also others. As noticed that some sick peoples they won,t put on masks, also this virus is cunny....so the best is set rule that everyone must wear mask, just like Taiwan did. 2. Noticed that Singapore is shortage of masks supply. May I know is it possible that Singapore can produce masks ourselves, just like what Taiwan did. I,m a local Singaporean, born here, grow up here.

Thank you for handling  and think ahead for this pandemic situation despite the numbers increasing rapidly.  However, I hope you can also address different matters in the coming days.

Secondly, could you provide more information on retail and rental cost as now if we close then how are we to pay for our rental and other retail necessities such as utilities and salary of workers.

14523,"Fact is: The numbers show SG is on a different trajectory than before. As a result different measures necessary.  Given this it’s astonishing to see what’s happening in the malls and supermarkets. Crowd control? Social distancing? People have shown they do not (or cannot) stick to the advice. Government will need to enforce (enforcing is not the same as punishing after sth happened - it means prevention). It’s better for everyone. This panic shopping is counterproductive. (Effectively mass gatherings).  Other countries are in lockdown and everything is fine. Grocery shopping, doctor visits etc are possible (even better than before in panic/rumour mode).  It’s impressive to see how Hong Kong and Taiwan managed it without lockdown (also Korea with mass and rapid testing after the initial fallout). In Hong Kong most impressive since the government is a joke and barely governing. It’s the ppl who handled it themselves.  Singapore has managed the situation extremely well so far in their own way and I think they will do the right thing. But I believe there will be measures we have seen elsewhere already.",2020-04-03,186

14525,It is high time we relook at our public toilets. The dustbin placed in each cubicle is not suitable - especially for the squatting toilet bowl. - it prevents one from squatting “efficiently” to ensure the urine doesn’t flow out of the toilet bowl.  Cos wet floor is always dirtier than dry floor. The dustbins used in the cubicle are always filled up or get stuck at the flap- this causes the sanitary pads to be exposed.  Perhaps can consider - getting users to throw at the dustbin outside the cubicle by providing sanitary paper bags? ,2020-04-03,94

I suggest social distance ambassadors in independent food chains, larger super/hypermarts. Not all cashiers will remind one to stand 1 metre apart. Some are still not practicing social distance in queues so it may defeat effort others are putting in. If more new cases I'm guessing additional business will be suspended, perhaps wet markets.

No matter how many times you tell the public there is enough - it's a herd mentality to hoard and rush to the supermarkets.

So it makes more sense to control the number of people entering at a time.

The no of death, no of elderly people get infected are rising. More clusters are emerging and unlinked cases are escalating. This should not be the norm, this is very worrying.   We know Lockdown will not eradicate the virus. But, if we lockdown for 30 days and still apply all the current measures after that, we can break the chain and slow down the spread.  The multi-ministerial task force has been doing a fantastic job so far. However, swift decision is now needed and if we go a bit further I am confident that we can contain the virus effectively and swiftly.   We are all together in this SG UNITED!",2020-04-03,129

15151,"Thank you for your excellent response. The numbers show how effective your leadership has been, but if there is one area for improvement, it is on the limited access to testing. My story: This morning I was denied a Covid-19 test at a government polyclinic. I went to the polyclinic because I had a sore throat and thought I should do the right thing for my community, and for the peace of mind of my family, and get tested. I requested a test, but was told my symptoms do not justify being tested. I asked 5 times, but was denied 5 times. Instead I was issued with an SHN. So my symptoms were sufficient to justify an SHN, but not sufficient to justify testing. When i asked the doctor why I was refused testing he replied ""If we test everyone it will create panic"". I disagreed with him and said ""what will create panic is uncertainty, and refusing to test people creates uncertainty and is a guaranteed way to spread panic."" I also pointed out to him that by issuing SHNs while denying testing, it creates a disincentive for people to seek medical support. Instead people will wait until they are sicker, and more contagious, before seeking help. I have written to the Ministry of Health about this issue, but I strongly urge you to follow the excellent results seen in South Korea where they have made testing highly accessible, and not denied a test to anyone.

15154,"Dear PM Lee,  ""The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks. This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important role—you’ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others."" - George Gao, director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/not-wearing-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-big-mistake-top-chinese-scientist-says  Singapore Government must change its policy and guideline on face masks fast, before 1,000 cases soon becomes 10,000.  Need to have the flexibility and humility to do so.  Sg sent 20,000 test kits and 3 PCR testing machines to China in Jan/Feb as assistance (CNA report).  Sg could easily ask for and get several tens of  millions of surgical face masks from China in return. Easy production for a country of 1.4bn people, the factory of the world.  Pls do so, and tell the public to wear facemasks at all times when outside home.",2020-04-03,185
15155,"Dear Fellow Singaporeans,  We are now into our 17th day of MCO in Malaysia.  Initially, it was full of anxiety and anticipation. Five days into the MCO, we only managed to get 70% to comply. Then, the army had to be called in. We managed to achieve 95% compliance but it wasn't enough. So tougher measures were put in. Road blocks everywhere. No using of highways. Need letters to move around. Only one person per car. Travelling within 10km radius etc.  Though we managed to flatten the curve a bit, we will have to wait till 10/4/2020 to see if further implementation of the MCO is needed.   This is like Malaysia, where other than the urban areas, we have many uncontrollable out of town areas. Some villages in full lockdown. One condominium in full lockdown etc. We have many illegal immigrants. Porous borders.  Fellow Singaporeans, you are much better disciplined than us. You have gone through NS. You can do it. Fret not.  In this period of MCO, you can help your community. Ensure those living in isolation but need help, help them.  Frontliners might need PPE, see how you can help prepare face shields, sew gowns etc.  Most importantly, help each other as neighbours and fellow countrymen.  If can deliver online veggies, fruits and groceries, better. Less contact at stores.  Some of us have community Facebook groups to help connect each other if we need services. If your community hasn't got one, see how you can help start one.  All the best..",2020-04-03,246
15156,"Dear Mr Lee, Thank you for implementing much stricter measures to fight the spread of the Covid-19 virus. However, on top of all these measures, there must be one more that must be put in place: that everyone MUST wear a mask when they leave their homes for whatever purpose. This was proposed by Dr Johan Sharma, a family doctor, in his Youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKNxyzCzHrg).  Dr Sharma said that we need to focus on stopping the virus from being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers. And since it is next to impossible to find out who has the virus if they are asymptomatic, we must presume that EVERYONE has the virus, and take steps to prevent the virus from getting out. So EVERYONE must wear a mask, not to protect ourselves from getting the virus, but to prevent the virus from escaping from people who have it.   This mask does not have to be a surgical mask – it can be any mask, made of clothes, towels, handkerchiefs, scarves, etc. We just need something that can prevent the droplets from getting out. If the people are told this, they will not panic. Instructions on how to make one’s own mask can be conveyed to the people through whatsapp, Facebook and other social media.   Making it mandatory to wear some kind of mask when one leaves one’s home (especially when taking public transportation) will also solve the problem of irresponsible sick people (coughing, having a runny nose) who insist on going out and not wearing masks when they do.  Our government should adopt the policy “NO MASK, NO ENTRY” to all malls, shops, banks, markets, workplaces that are still operating, and any place that’s still open to the public, as well as all public transportation (drivers must also wear masks, of course).  On top of this, I’d like to suggest that the shops, especially supermarkets, that are still open should provide hand sanitisers at their points of entry, and ensure that customers sanitize their hands BEFORE entering the premises, since everyone (including asymptomatic carriers) will be touching a lot of things there. (I saw this being done at a sports shop at one of the malls.)  If we add these measures to the existing ones, Singapore’s “circuit breaker” will be even more effective.   I hope that our government will seriously consider making the wearing of masks in public mandatory, and to implement it immediately.   Thank you.",2020-04-04,406

15159,"Mr Lee, to be honest our response to COVID is weak and reactive. I believe we were more careful during SARs time. At least we got no. 993 dedicated to SARs and there was closure of schools. While COVID is different from SARs, I would like to suggest the following: 1. Only ambulance or trained transporters with proper geared PPE are allowed to bring sick COVID patients to hospital. 2. To set up a team (as many Singaporeans as possible taxi drivers grab hirers) to help deliver essential or necessary supplies to households. These team must also be trained to put on mask. 3. Essential services like mrt, buses water supply electrical supply to continue to operate and employees / users must equip with the necessary protection  4. Non essential services to work from home or only with clear social distancing and all necessary protection are in place to allow them to be at their work location 5. Essential supplies shop like ntuc, supermarket. hypermart etc to only serve genuine customers who needed the daily necessities but cannot do online purchases. 6. PHPC clinics to continue to operate working closely with MOH but the nurses should be strict with themselves and the patients. Nurses should not wear mask on their chin or forehead. I was in one of the PHPC clinic yesterday, the doctor was so strict and was  telling me all sorts of rules that I must adhere to but once outside at the nurse counter I saw a nos. of nurses wearing mask not covering the nose and only on half the mouth. 7. Please set up more emergency teams getting police and army to help if possible to seriously defeat the virus once and for all 8. Encourage local manufacturers to make masks or medical supplies. Hope you would be successful within a month so that you can lift SG flag high, PAP flag high and all Singaporeans  will be proud of you. You are saving lives.",2020-04-03,320

I told a Grab driver today on my way home that during such times, the only place I really want to fall ill in is Singapore. That's because the healthcare system is reliable, accessible. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else for treatment. As a teacher, we have been working very hard to roll out HBL for our students, so that life can be as normal as possible. The work has been tiring, but defintely rewarding when the students appreciate what we do for them. I'm even more grateful to all the ministers working so hard for the country.

15879,"Dear Esteemed PM Lee,  You would probably not see this message yourself but I would like to thank you for the efforts the government have been making to slow down the spread of COVID-19.   However, it is also known that the virus transmits through droplets into any openings of your body (nose, eyes, mouth etc). Masks, although not an iron clad defense against the virus, are effective at capturing those droplets which are the main transmission route.  With my observation of Singapore currently, I feel the government should be encouraging citizens to all be wearing masks with our high human density and public transport confined spaces during peak hour.  Although the government have been encouraging citizens to be socially responsible and stay at home when showing symptoms or are unwell, there will be anomalies in society where people do not listen and where masks are the best way we can protect ourselves.   While having social order is crucial, ensuring the virus is contained is as important and I hope with the increased stocks and production of masks in China, more people will start wearing masks to go about with their every day life.

So good to see that they have chosen to do the right thing at the right time independently. Sweet! For all of us who have journeyed with them, THIS is truly rewarding. This is their moment of truth. What I like best is that this was not a posed shot - like all the promotional posters that adorn many walls. Thank you, Sir for choosing to give these two young men a place in your very public forum.  This has been such an encouragement coming at the end of a very trying week. ",2020-04-04,123

I have been looking at the numbers of infection and have become increasingly concerned and worried. When the numbers of imported cases were high, I felt that ""it was to be expected"" with numbers of returning Singaporeans. However, now we see a higher number of not just local cases but unlinked cases. I'm beginning to be spooked by the higher number of ""unlinked"" cases.   I start to think: have we missed out anything, despite our strict safe distancing measures? What about buses, trains, even the causeway (might not be an issue now since our neighbour has restricted movement in her country).",2020-04-01,121

Therefore, please distance yourselves from the unnecessary public. But if really necessary, such as work, school or even purchasing daily necessities, keep the distance.   If you have the means, wearing a mask can help further (although gov say no need). Imagine this, if we are queing 1 meter apart, and both are putting on mask, wouldnt it better than not putting on one?

Since many youngster will not show any sign or symptom of COVID 19 and this will also increase their viral load till it reaches a critical and becomes highly infections to others or starts to affect the youngsters. Both surgical or cotton mask would be fine. In fact we can add another protective layer to both mask by smearing a bar of soap on its outer surface. Since COVID like any other coronaviruses have weak lipid (fat) protective shell. Soap with its hydrophillic and hydrophobic properties will tear the COVID shell apart. So when you apply an layer of soap on the mask (whether surgical or cotton) it will not only reduce the micron holes sizes but importantly to kill any residual viruses sitting on the outer mask. Your outgoing breath in the inner mask will also ensure that the soap hydrophillic properties will be turned outwards ready to pry into the viruses shell should any rest on the mask surface.",2020-04-03,189

Currently not every hawker centers are crowded even on weekend, especially those in Central area, like our premises... equally as a dead town. During weekdays totally quiet, even weekends crowds are low... That's right ! Customer can always eat their favourite foods with safe sits distancing...otherwise most hawkers in those area will be facing a very tough time in surviving.. No doubt the current free rental for stalls may help temporary, but less earning or at a loss may create worst situation for such business... Government can't always give the support, that's just a temporary solution... We are not afraid of hardwork, using our barehand to make a living. The main idea is whether how to encourage the customers to patronise our stall in certain time, with safe distancing and at the same time, need to practice staying safe at home...eat and go, or pack and go.

However they refused because they said no advisory is released.   Pls check the statistics of Czech Republic. The Czech Republic is one of the few in Europe that has significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. The main difference is that everyone who has to leave their house has to wear a mask.  Mask is available in the market at $30+ a box . This is NOT expensive by today's market rate in other cities such as China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Seoul, Japan etc. In fact , Kuala Lumpur has seen higher price.

16039,"Dear Mr PM. I truly thank you for all the support and ensuring our safety. We all have you in our prayers. I would like to  share my unpleasant experience these past 2 days. I am dependant on bus and train for my travel to work. These past 2 days - Monday (30/3) & Tuesday (31/3) has been a real nightmare for me.  I was on the bus 70 opposite Kong Hwa School at noon and was happy to note that the bus enough seats to distance myself. However, as I  walked  to the back of the bus to get my seat, this guy (in his 30's)  gave out a loud cough and his droplets landed on my arm. Can you imagine my dismay? He  continued coughing right to the time he alighted  at Paya Lebar MRT station. From where I was seated,  I could see big droplets flying in the air. When I got to my seat  I quickly grabbed my wipes and cleaned my arm. On Tuesday, in the afternoon, I took the bus again to PLQ. This time I took the escalator at Paya Lebar MRT to take the link to PlQ. Whilst on the escalator, there was a guy (early 40's) who was 2 steps behind me  and he gave a loud sneeze without covering his nose. This is the 2nd time in 2 days I felt droplets on me ( this time on the back of my neck) It would be good if people could take simple instructions and wear a mask if they are unwell or unable to contain their coughing or sneezing. I feel it poses as a danger to the person at the receiving end. I might add that the reason I am highlighting this is because I am 65 and taking medication for my chronic diseases and more vulnerable to infection.   I sincerely hope people will be more mindful and practise good hygiene for the benefit of all of us.  Thank you.",2020-04-01,319
16041,"Solution that i could think off to break this covid chain, is 1st to lockdown the country ,2nd to quarantine all those infected n people that have been around them whether with or without symptomps  3rd implement very strict rules all people to be stay at home . And only allow 1 member of the family to go out if its urgent n wearing mask is a must  4th then implement social distancing. It will work that way rather then implement it now which defeat the purpose when there are still so many humans out there everywhere.",2020-04-02,91
16042,"Sir customers are not always cooperative...  I know families can sit together but with a group as large as the one I had to handle, it would have meant shutting down a lot of tables to accommodate that distance from the group.   I have no idea if they ever stayed to eat. But I am sure I just pissed the lady off when I said a max of 4 at that table.  28th march 2020 Saturday . A plea to everyone. Please excuse any voice typing errors that I missed.  They have very clear markers at the drinks stall where we should stand. An old man walked past me and pushed his way to share my box.  I was horrified and stepped back. Then I realized why. He had obviously had a stroke. He could not move his left hand and very likely could not control the way he walked. In the end he gave up and went back to his meal. I asked the  stall operator to find out what he wanted and bought his drink for him. I do not earn a lot but a few cents to help will not hurt.  I'm asking the general public for the sake of people like him, to please be mindful about cooperating with food places so that they can remain operating. If a food place has too many customers not cooperating at this current climate we stand a risk of being shut down.  People like that old man who obviously depend on eating out might suffer. We do not know his history and background. It could be that he has no family to look after him.   Please if the stall or store tells you to stand outside, sit here or do something you don't want  to... please cooperate. I do not know who it was but it got to my ears that one of my colleagues had a hard time with a lady who was told to wait outside. She ended up criticizing our service.  Daily we deal with such people. Daily I deal with rubbish left behind by customers. Fair enough if a food place does not have a return tray station. But at places that do it would help a lot if you returned your tray and packed your used tissues into something disposable, so that staff like myself can dispose of it with a minimum of risk.  We potentially face  abuse from customers who refuse to cooperate. Many even drag the seats all over the place.   It's not going to hurt to mind your public hygiene for good.  Please we also have to protect ourselves and our livelihood is at risk.  Mei.",2020-04-01,438

Working day and night on this Covid 19. However, as the no. of cases grow. It's extremely stressful for working parents. We need to worry about work, our employer's business, our family and friends health. We have to monitor the groceries level in our neighborhood. We follow instructions never stock up. Rice & toilet paper. But sir, everyday/ every hours live we live in fear. It's possible to share you sop with us. If there's a lockdown in Singapore when our no. Hit 1200 or after 5, 6 deaths? It's much easier for us to plan and react. I tried practicing placing orders online 3 weeks ago till today. All three supermarket systems show delivery not available! This week my company allow workers to go home earlier,. This is to avoid peak hour crowd.To my surprise, I saw many students wandering at malls and playground!? In groups! Can you look into this? This is going to be a long fight. Is it possible for MPs to speed up our measures? I don't see more people wearing mask could be running out or don't bother. But because of this don't care group. Our family have to wear masks. It's a big sum of money! Will you consider all must wear mask when they take public transport like MRT and buses?  For people who follow rules, have been doing our very best to stay away from crowd for months. The young and old are getting impatient and really frustrated at home.

16213,"Dear PM, thank you for your leadership.  I would like to suggest that alongside our social distancing measures and stay home advisory, may we also require society to each and everyone going outside to ALL wear a face mask (reusable and single-use),.  This will go along way in slowing and delaying the spread, giving our health system a long runway in tackling this problem.  Also an advisory for people not to talk in the train or enclosed spaces such as the lifts  I hope my suggestion helps. Thank you.",2020-03-31,88
16214,Our Task Force has done a tremendous job from the 1st infected Covid-19 person till now - the tracing itself is so tiring and we never give up.  We will all go through this together and we can do it !! 🤝  We are proud with our Government ❤️👍🏻💪🏻.,2020-03-31,44

Without them, everyone's life and task will be tougher by 10 fold.

16225,"Dear PM Lee, as a Teck Ghee resident, I has the honour to met you twice and I can feel that you are really a great leader who always think for your citizen. I hope you can read this. The 2 articles on The Straits Times today about the death of the 70-year-old man and the experience in ICU of the 50-year-old IT manager are really alarming bells. Until now, they are unable to tell the reason from where they got infected. The man commuted to work everyday by mrt, same as me, amd the risk is there. It can be anyone of us. It comes to my question that how many more cases and death of innocent people have to be happened then the government will apply stricter measure, such as mrt closure, compulsory work from home order for all applicable business? With my deepest condolence for the man, I hope the government really think about it as it can be any of us!",2020-03-31,162

16229,What are we waiting for? Please lockdown Singapore and force stay home for everyone for a week. The local transmission is greater in number than the imported cases. These ‘brakes’ do not work as we have seen from across the world. You need a hard lockdown. How many more deaths do we want on our hands before we do the right thing? We need to bite the bullet and flatten the curve before it’s too late.,2020-04-01,77
16230,"Seems like a short clip, not the full interview. Hopefully can watch the full version later.  PM Lee, with all due respect, a suggestion is that you look at the camera during the interview (video conferencing technique) because audiences are watching you too.  :-) ",2020-03-30,43

16241,"PM, sir, I stand up and salute, so far nobody dare to tell the USA right in their face that what they are doing (constantly advocating against China) are not going to solve the CoVID-19 pandemic, worst of all when the WHO and the world already accepted the term CoVID-19 as official name for the virus, their secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, still calling it ""Wuhan-virus"" during the G7 summit.  We are small but we are brave and tough, we stand up against discrimination and falsehood, Singaporeans are proud of you.  Just like what you mentioned this pandemic may bring the world to their knee, if everybody are selfish and individualistic, we need to work together to overcome and win this battle as one united world  Last but not least, sir, please try to help Iran/N.Korea, USA sanctions will be destroying them, I am not supportive of them for their nuclear programs, but nevertheless they are part of the earth community, thanks.",2020-03-30,160

16254,"It’s heartening to know that Singaporeans are a disciplined community that cared, takes pride and appreciates what their elected leaders are doing right for them.   But what’s most important is for the younger and new generations to fully understand the history, so that they fit in well to better themselves as being innovative to insulate themselves from pandemics and predictably cyber warfare of the future.   The recent success in containing Covid-19 with Singapore amongst the fewest of countries in the world still doing business as normal without a lockdown is living testimony of a well-governed nation with the brightest of chance in overcoming and succeeding in the future.   Someday, in the near future, Singaporeans would get to share your experiences with the world and hopefully by then, through reputation and world recognition, Singapore is more than ready to play host to realizing the ”One World One Dream” community.   It's all predictably possible coming from SG United and I wish Malaysians would do some catching up with UI in power to share the vision and mission.   Cheers!!!🙏",2020-03-31,176

16313,Dear sir   I know I am writing into thin air  Can #comfortdelgro #transcab #grab #gojek for once come together for once and don’t see each other as a competition to agree to have a fix rate for fix distance travel fare and keep it within reasonable price like $6-$8-$10-$15 max and remove the evening surcharge as well for taxis since ERP is showing it’s support  I believe many Singaporean will support to commute at this period if the price is really fixed and good.   This way it’s not only allows drivers to earn a income rather than waiting for nothing  Also it benefits “social distancing” and “contact tracing”   #lta ,2020-04-01,106

16354,"Best is try to best revert everything to as best normal as possible.    Healthcare need to do it's job,  other sector also doing their part by remaining open for business. Sick stay home/see doctor/wear mask. Not sick go out work/play/eat.  SHN and LOA should also be phased off.   It is not practical.  We must be ""hybrid"", strong robust healthcare, yet free open economy business.  Tackle only what's on hand, so if you're really not sick, please carry on with your daily lives/mingle/work/fun/play..  Stop all the social distancing, it is disrupting for people and business, and it is just introducing more fear.  If one feel unsafe or feel need to social distance oneself, then wear a mask.    People on the ground are frustrated with their daily lives, things need to improve and be better and normal.   We can also test our internal sustainability, and the reason why we need population growth to 10m eventually..     Actions will tell the people that we need to be ready, be brave, be bold and be decisive that we want our normal lives back no matter what.

16372,"Receiving international recognition is always note worthy especially for a small country like Singapore.  However I would like to point out what is reported on Straits Times, MAR 21, 2020, 8:09 PM SGT, total COVID-19 cases in Singapore, 432 cases.  And again, Straits times, MAR 29, 2020, 8:12 PM SGT, 844 cases.  Extrapolating from these numbers, in a little more than a week, there have been more than a 90% increase in the total number of cases.  While the overall number is still low in respect to the overall size of the population, the increase in number is still quite alarming.  And as you are fully aware, every  infection can lead to more infections.  Will contact tracing continue to be an effective method when the numbers continue to grow?    At which point do you think it is prudent to require Singaporeans to shelter-in-place?  And ban outgoing travel at least for the next 30 days unless it is absolutely necessary?  Is the Singapore government ready for mass testing when required as a means to contain the spread?",2020-03-30,165

Despite the recommended WFH, Staggering Work Hours and other measures, some companies may still require physical attendance and some public may still require to take public transport, the safe distancing just abruptly fails at public transport sector.  Understand that we do not want to create panic buy of already-in-short-supply masks needed for healthcare workers, plus that wearing mask is not a guarantee that you won't get sick.... Wondering if use of some basic masks (even those reusable cloth ones or simple mouth coverings) could be encouraged for all needing to use public transport just to capture possible droplet dispersion to reduce the chance to pass on diseases and protect others. The proposal is more from the angle of protecting others, and in return, be protected from unnecessary spread thru' asymptomatic carriers who may not be aware.  There is no concrete evidence it may work. Given that respiratory droplets is the main transmission route of coronavirus, any possible ways to reduce that should cut the chance for the disease to pass on.    Just thinking... and wishing for a quicker recovery, Singapore.  #Staysafe #staysane",2020-03-30,221

He did not mention that Presidents Trump  and Xi had a long telecommunication. Both are helping other countries too. CNN has always been anti Trump. PM Mr.Lee is an intelligent person and he knows who this guy is. They work for the CNN boss who was caught. Singapore dont want FAKERS and FAKE NEWS.God bless Singapore",2020-03-30,104

17113,"COVID-19... Are the world leaders' at their wit's end?  Can they see the bigger picture and the purpose of this virus crisis?  Do they see the impasse, dead end and deadlocks if humans continue to ignore the messages on the walls, and that a worldwide emergency has been declared for earth, and all mankind?  ========  S$7.2 trillion for the fight by the G20..  Did the G20 leaders [via teleconferencing] discuss the importance of getting the UN and WHO to take the lead in assembling the best experts, researchers, and resources under one location or roof to research for a medical cure and vaccine?  Time is the essence.  This is a fight for the sake of all mankind.  It is not a time for games of gamesmanship.    This is the time for unity of purpose putting aside selfish, self-centred, egocentric and arrogant desires as the world is in dire need to get the cure and vaccine fast.     It is not the time for world leaders of the G20 to split hairs over trivial things or nomenclature.    They are not children.  They are world leaders and are adults.  The time to play games are over for them.  This crisis is to show humankind how tired this planet earth has become as she needs a break and rest by bringing humans' activities and pollution to a stop.  This virus crisis is not a bad thing.    It is to open up the eyes of human beings especially their leaders to their follies, and self-centred and selfish nationalistic interests, which must stop, and must be put to an end.",2020-03-29,257

17634,I have a question in mind...if all Singaporeans are told to stay home as much as they can. Why are FDW allowed to go out during their off days (even employer requested them to stay home but they refused); this will not only create more risk of spreading the COVID-19 outside and also bringing them home to the employer with children and seniors taken care by them. MOM should pass a rules to stop all their gatherings too....is a weekly event for them.....just think of how this could spread the virus further.,2020-03-26,95

17676,"I have been very supportive of the government but there is always a first time. I think that the social distancing measures in coffee shops and eating places are impractical. Are families supposed to sit and eat separately? After all they don't distance themselves once at home. So it doesn't make any difference.  A safe distance between tables is more reasonable as we should keep a safe distance from strangers rather than family members. If one member gets the virus, the probability of infecting the other family members staying under one roof is high anyway.  Another matter that I like to bring up is we should advise the public not to talk loudly and aggressively in crowded areas or over people's food. Because some people talk with their saliva flying all over the place when they walk pass you while you are eating. In this case, eating at a safe distance from another is no longer safe... still have to watch out for people talking over your head while waiting for your table.  If the purpose of these measures is to discourage eating out, then perhaps everyone should self-quarantine indefinitely. I hope people can exercise discretion, be considerate and be self-disciplined, so that we don't have to implement harsh measures.",2020-03-27,204

I tried cancelling all the airlines ( other national airlines) no issue , no questions asked , full refund even when the fare conditions are non - refundable. But our own national airlines, do not entertain us , always can’t get through their lines and only does email replies saying they don’t allow refund and only do free change .

17720,"Thanks for all the timely measures introduced for Singapore, dear PM Lee. No doubt social distancing is a good measure and by limiting the number of people in the malls, supermarkets etc. does help in decreasing the crowds, can we also look into letting the vulnerable group enter the malls or supermarkets on priority queue at all times?  I understand there are already 'priority shopping hours' for the elderly and the pregnant group either 7am or 8am at ntuc, cold storage etc, but not everyone can make it during those hours.  At 29 weeks pregnant, it is an absolute physical challenge to have to queue for as long as an hour just to get into a mall before I can get to the supermarket for my weekly fresh produce for a healthy expectant mum's diet. How is this queuing to get into the malls, suoermarkets help the 'less crowding' situation? And it does not help the vulnerable group either if they have no choice but to join the queue to get their essential goods.  When the announcement was made on the new policy, demand instantly shot up on online shopping platforms and delivery slots are all snapped up throughout all the online supermarts. I wish to opt for delivery, but with no more slots I can't and I'm forced to go out and join the queues. Won't that be counterproductive?  I hope this suggestion can be considered and improved measures can be introduced soon to take into account having priority queues for the elderly and pregnant group to enter the malls and supermarkets at any hour. Thanks once again, for every efforts the government has made so far in a unique situation like this. #sgunited",2020-03-29,277

17769,"24th March 2020 Tuesday I wish everyone would do their part and avoid going out into crowds  or travelling  unnecessarily.   It bothers me a lot that I have to clear possibly contaminated waste left behind by customers. However it is part of the job and I don't have a choice but to grit my teeth and do it.  It bothers me a lot they leave medical waste behind, without thinking it might cause issues for those people cleaning up. It's not just picking up your mask and throwing it away because you don't want to, it means sanitizing the area bagging the trash and sanitizing the dustbin. If you throw up,  make sure you inform the staff. We have a right to take precautions as we approach the cleanup.  People often pee in public behind our building and there's a toilet at the guard post damnit.  In these difficult times this is not the sort of behaviour above I would encourage. My income would be affected because I cannot afford to go on quarantine. My guess is that eventually we can learn to co-exist with the disease once it dies down a bit. Like any other strain of flu for example many will develop an immunity. it may take a year or so but it will happen.  You go traveling god knows what you will bring back. I can understand traveling for work, but if you get sick those of us in close contact would have to be quarantined too.   A big shout out to people who are working in the front line. People working at food places to see that you get fed and get your home delivery... People who dispose of trash, the janitors that keep places clean. People in the medical line even the receptionist, first responders etc, the police and whoever else that is forced to work in these difficult circumstances. Thank you so much.  God bless you.

The trains and buses are still packing with commuters, social distancing simply impractical in public transportation.

17888,"Mr Prime Minister, thank you for your leadership and your tireless work and that of all our leaders. I am grateful. Today there is advisory for us to not go the malls except for food and essentials and to order groceries online. What does this mean for retailers like me? Should we all close our shops. Rental is a huge part of our overheads. With this advisory will there even be the odd customer that comes by? As it is sales has been down to almost nothing. What do we do about our staff? The advisory also ask us to order groceries online. Have you tried? I have tried for the last 3 weeks  going into the website every day  but I was unable to get a delivery slot. They are inundated and unable to cope with deliveries. We are so strict on safe distancing at eateries and stores but we are packing them in in the buses and training. 1 metre apart in the buses? Only alternate seats? There is a great inconsistency. If we are going to charge people for keeping alternate seats vacant  we will have to implement that in the buses too. What is the answer?",2020-03-28,198

As for now eating fresh pineapple fruit might be a good way to keep your body in good shape and health. This fruit do more then just providing you with nutrients.

It is therefore extremely important that our policies must be directed at containing community transmission of the virus.  The message to the people must be that social distancing is very important. Unfortunately, the new rule limiting maximum persons at any gathering to 250 is sending the wrong message. People are not staying home as much as possible. They feel it is fine to go out to public areas with friends and family.  Taking the SAFRA cluster transmission rate as a guide, another cluster arising from a gathering of 250 persons will lead to another 60 persons being infected.  I therefore appeal to you to ban any gathering of more than 20 persons before it is too late.  Dr ",2020-03-21,138

To avoid the situation where we run out of ICU space or medical ventilators, or where medical staff gets infected due to lack of sleep or we have to implement triage system. Please.   1. Tighten border controls, with strict enforcement of no outboard travels. This border  tightening is only temporary.  2. Strict enforcement of no gatherings, religious or otherwise.  3. Put health above economics. We do have reserves for rainy day. Other countries are also closing their borders on us. Closure is only temporary.  4. While we appreciate lead time before travel restrictions set in, people are gaming the system by travelling before the timeline.  Desperate times call for desperate measures.

Our company has been implementing temperature checks but that is the extent of what has been done so far. I am getting worried with the returning travelers coming back to work following the school holiday and especially on the case of taking crowded public transports to commute to and fro from work / home.  With the school reopening on Monday, I will be sharing the trains and buses with people who may or may not be taking extra precautions - especially since the 14 days LOA is not mandatory for working adults returning from their holidays. Additionally, is there a way to enforce rules on companies such as my own to force the management to actually implement BCP ie alternate work days / teams? We have broken down the company into 2 teams as part of BCP to adhere to government advise but no action has been taken to actually make this effective; which in other terms is totally useless in this fight against the virus.

Can we not make all these people put up a security bond for the amount required to treat a Covid-19 patient?  I'm sure we can estimate the cost of treating a confirmed case including hospitalization, medication, and all other related cost.  This is necessary because these irresponsible people have the mindsets that they will not get the Covid-19 and if they did, our govt will take care of them with the taxpayers money.  Implementing the security bond will make them realise whether they can afford the treatment cost should they be infected.  And if they are not infected, then we can return them their security bonds, less the testing costs.",2020-03-25,140

The discussion are from various perspectives, such as education system protection, kids safety, public transport risks etc.   I would like to contribute my two cents from another perspective - INNOVATION. No one can deny, e-learning is next hot topic. China and US companies have invested tremendous efforts and resources to grow this. This is much more complicated than just online video conference. This is to move class room f2f teaching system to online. One of the fundamental factors that make Singapore standing out of other countries is innovation.

I appreciate the efforts of the Teachers to call each parent to confirm if they have been to other countries (including Malaysia) for the past week, however as a parent I need a 100% assurance that the data the schools gathered are 100% accurate. Our government should seriously consider suspending classes for the meantime, given the increase in numbers of cases and the lesser no. Of patients being discharged daily. I just don’t want us to regret when the numbers are already overwhelming and that no matter how best is our healthcare system, it can still fail. Because our front-liners: our Doctors, Nurses and all other healthcare practitioners are all humans, they get tired and fall sick too, they are not robots. Furthermore, I observed that majority of the students need to travel by trains or buses to go to school, so how do we implement social distancing while taking these public transportations? As a parent no matter how we take care of our children at home but there’s no assurance of their safety outside, there will always be fear in our hearts.

Teachers can teach online. Schools shall also remain open so that if the parents cannot arrange caretakers can send their kids to school. With this, it can greatly reduce the number of students going back school and help to minimise interaction among them.

18462,"Yes , my heart is with the families of the deceased too .   Dear Honourable PM Lee ,  sharing my humble thought with Mdm Ho earlier as follows :   “Preventive for the next wave of outbreak as we watch the virus progression and exponential statistics.   My thoughts :  A stitch in time saves nine . We may yet trace the root cause of the virus but we may be able to do more . It’s not to late to have the medical expertise and task force look into how we can have measure set aside looking at what happens 🌎 world wide . The conclusive of the death were those like elderly , those with chronic diseases like cardiovascular and diabetes complication . With the records we have from our medical CMIS , we should be able to keep a lookout for these group of people ( citizens ) and ensure they are taken care in the way of same measures to stay at home when unwell , to have corporate and companies support remote off site working ( social distancing) and notice to such to avoid certain places and activities . In that way , we may even have combat readiness to prevent the huge wave of outbreak that may come along . This is just my humble thought that I always believe such would contain the resources we have at hospitals and clinics and material time and manpower resources including medical expertise like test kits etc . It’s good to kiasu on such to have a better win win to battle to world wide outbreak . Every life counts Thus we must remember  the word “ scarcity “ from Economic which we witnessed from ITALY 🇮🇹 and that it means - essence of time  , the limited means 🆚 the unlimited wants .  I am someone with the personality of INTJ but I think 🤔 to be front loading and think far and deep is of importance to read in read out of the causation to the virus 🦠 and to handle from all perspective and prevention is the equivalent quotient to combat readiness . Pardon my daring to speak up on this through your post ; it’s your kindness and duty of care for such that emboldened me to share my two sense worth of thought. Thank you 🙏 a very good morning and 万福金安. “ - you n Team have done well and let’s keep going to do better . ",2020-03-21,381

18465,"I would seriously urge the government to consider closing school for two weeks. We could treat these two weeks as school holidays by shortening the June holidays by two weeks. For the following reasons:  1. Based on the global situation, it is highly unlikely the problem will be resolved by June, it makes no major difference by shortening the holidays in June by two weeks.  2. However, by extending the March school holidays, we can be safer. As there are a few untraceable cases of local spreads on a daily basis, there is a likelihood that some of our 60k teachers/school staff and 600k pri/sec/jc students have been infected locally without realising it, or perhaps their family members have been infected without realising it. One such case may potentially result in a two-digit cases of infection, among our teenagers.   2. The student may be infected by the parents if he/she stays at home. However, this will still happen as long as the student still goes home after school. By going to school, it only increases chance of community spread in school campus and on public transport.  3. And our public transport is not safe obviously during peak hours. I suspect most of the untraceable cases currently were infected in such crowd. Majority of the students who have to travel at least twice a day are exposed to this risk.  4. I understand MOH is concerning about doctors and nurse taking child care leave if the holidays are extended. However, even if they don't take it now they will still take it in June if we don't shorten the holidays there. Also, in a crisis as such, government should cease the child care leave approval for medical sectors, and compensate in other ways.  5. Lastly from a teacher's point of view: we are exhausted. (A) Some of our colleagues are on LOA due to oversea travels, we will have an increasing workload when school reopens.

19042,"Truly noble. Thank you and highly appreciate. Together, we stand united to overcome Covid-19.  ******  12 March 2020  ONGOING SUSPENSION OF MASSES  My dear People of God  It was with much sadness that I had to order the suspension of Masses on 14th February, particularly because the celebration of the Eucharist is the Summit of our faith.   More than anyone, as the Archbishop, it is my desire to make the Eucharist available to everyone.   However, as the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Singapore, I have to act responsibly not just for the sake of our Catholics but the community at large.  To this end, we have been working hard to put in place the precautionary measures in our parishes so that we can resume the Masses.    When I made the announcement to lift the suspension last Thursday, it was in the context of a stabilised situation.  However, the situation has become so serious that WHO has just declared COVID-19 a pandemic.  The worsening regional threat and recent big cluster arising from SAFRA Jurong have caused much anxiety among the community at large.  There is a rising number of infections.   Outbreak control measures are in full swing.  The authorities are putting up more stringent measures to include social distancing and assembly of crowds.  All social activities involving seniors by government agencies have been suspended. We are not helping the situation if we resume Masses at this time, simply because of the sheer numbers of Catholics packing in each service, and their fluidity in moving from one parish to another, and attending different services.  Furthermore, a large percentage of our parishioners belong to a vulnerable group-seniors with lower immunity. As responsible Catholics, we should be mindful that we do not do anything that might further burden the already strained healthcare system. Hence, to protect the larger population, I have decided to rescind the order to resume Masses until the situation is much improved and more stabilised.    I know many of you who desire to participate in the Mass and receive the Eucharist will be greatly disappointed.  There are as many who are for the ongoing suspension as there are those for its resumption.   After weighing all the views and bringing them to prayer, I have discerned that we should not proceed at this point in time.   Our Catholic Medical Guild (CMG), which is helping us monitor the situation on the ground and is constantly in consultation with the government, will do the necessary reviews. The CMG will make its recommendations to me when it is time to resume Masses.   I know it is a decision that will not please all, but as the Head of the Catholic Church in Singapore, I have to decide for the common good.  Should anything untoward happen, it would be too late to regret.  We should not insist on having the Eucharist at the expense of the safety of the larger community.   Hence, I appeal to all Catholics to be magnanimous, charitable and generous, especially during this season of Lent, for the greater good of our people in Singapore.   When others see us as being socially responsible, they will appreciate our faith even more because they see us putting Christian charity into action.  This is how we show ourselves to be good Catholics.   I invite you to make the greatest sacrifice of all, which is to deprive ourselves of the celebration of the Sacrifice of the Mass.  Instead, you will use this time to yearn for our Lord in the Eucharist even more through participation in the on-line Masses, prayer services and praying the scriptures.   It is an occasion for us to be conscious that we should never take the freedom to practise our faith or the Eucharist for granted. We must not think that just because we are without the Eucharist for the time being, our faith would be compromised.  The early Christians and those Christians still under persecution in some countries today also did not have the privilege of the Eucharist to accompany them in their faith journey. But they were still able to keep their faith alive, and grow from strength to strength by reading, praying and sharing the Word of God. Instead of lamenting the prohibition of the use of traditional ways to provide our people their spiritual needs, we must see this crisis as a grace of God to challenge the Church to rethink how we can continue to sustain the faith and evangelise our people by leveraging modern technology and other resources available to us.   Parishes can be more proactive and creative by offering on-line Masses, on-line catechesis, on-line Spiritual reflections and talks, and encourage the formation of small bible-sharing groups.  We encourage our Catechists and children to continue to nurture their faith through on-line catechesis. This would be a great opportunity to strengthen our neighbourhood communities and church organisations.    Thank you for your understanding and for putting the interests of the larger community before our own.  Let us support each other in our faith and continue to pray for the elimination of this virus from the world.  Please keep me and our priests in your prayers as well. Your devoted Shepherd,  Most Rev. William Goh Archbishop of Singapore",2020-03-12,859

This plague is more serious than SARS 17 years ago, and the side effect of using the medicine is even greater. If a special effect medicine comes out, it can only save lives. That's all!

As in base on Mr Chan, he said we have enough ration to support Singapore food, beside that, we have our own vegetable farm in SG. Surely those will be able to feed our fellow country mate.  Meat I do not dare to think.. but perhaps our vegetable and fish, surely enough for the 2 month.  Just 2 months sir. Can?  I'm sure those 2 month, we are free from the evil mutated and the stupid virus.   Thereafter, we will maybe resume importation by temporary banning those Malaysia truck to release the vegetable or livestock in the Singapore custom and our trader will collect from the border and delivery to respective area.  I think that should be the better decision on the 3rd month onward.. until the virus completely clear?  Refraining to go work might affect our appraisal,  school? Worst, the student might not catch up...",2020-03-08,168

19460,I will like to enquire why is bukit batok RC still organising events and gatherings for senior citizens just today (7/3) even with the recent spike of Covid-19 after the SAFRA event? It is to my understanding that MP Murali is  also present. Kindly get back to me as I am highly unpleased that vulnerable senior citizens are exposed when the govt is advocating minimising social gatherings. Don't advocate and tell ppl to avoid gatherings when your people are not following and our parents are given the wrong impression that it is safe. It is highly ironic.,2020-03-07,95

Technically, can regulatory agency, subject to legal warrant, interrogate the population mobile phone GPS data (i.e. Google and Apple have been tracking us anyway) to perform matching of time, place and duration of others who could have been in close proximity with the identified Covid-19 cases?  Not suggesting these cases were identified that way; but the graph in this article suggests a logical data process could possibly be leveraged on.  Those who could have been exposed to the identified cases, but unaware of it may value that piece of information (i.e. an SMS from the regulatory agency) to inform them (a) to quarantine themselves, and (b) report to authorised testing centre to get tested.",2020-02-26,119

20314,"Europe or US definitely won't take same strict measures of lock down coz to them so called freedom (or economy) is very important. With only few imported cases and existing lessons of China you c wats the situation in Europe now. Btw Japan Italy US etc in all these countries it is not so easy for even those with travel exposure n with fever to get tested so the reported number is way underestimated. Sg cant ban everyone. Just hope authorities can release some regulations asking those back from Europe Iran Japan Korea etc self quarantine at home for 14 days.

You are PM so you will be protected and taken care by best healthcare system but citizen not. Be realistic and be Donald Trump rather than Obama.

20617,"Dear PM Lee, I have a suggestion to make the surgical mask more effective and reusable. It is a practically viable one which I hope it can be passed down to fellow citizens.  You may first refer to this publication for the fundamentals behind the suggestion.  https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956  A summary of the suggestion leveraging on this work is as follows:  Spray sodium chloride (salt) solution on the exterior side of the mask. High concentration is better. It will dry and form a crystallized layer. When the virus from cough or sneezing lands on the mask, the salt it contacts will dissolve, then quickly dries and form crystals again, killing the virus. This can make a mask resuable, not only stop virus from passing through but also killing it. A single mask can be used for a long time by spraying and frying it at the end of the day.  The saline can be self made or purchased from the shelf as those used for contact lens.  For your consideration. Thank you. ",2020-02-14,169

Supermarkets sold out on bottles of dettol, alcohol wet wipes and now progressing to daily essentials like food such as rice. There is definitely heightened sense of insecurity which is worrying over the past 24 hours. Was it really necessary to raise it to orange I wonder. The well intended warning from the government and caution has unintentionally resulted in fear and panic in people here and with social media/ videos circulating is not helpful. Please also see to using the power of social media, tv etc to ally fears and panic. Kudos on addressing self hygiene and contact awareness in public. Hopefully the panic and anxiety will reduce over the weekend. We shouldn’t need to feel like we are in a war zone. Do take care of yourself too PM 🍊🍊",2020-02-08,145

Can you explain why people are not afraid of the seasonal flu that killed at least 10,000 Americans yearly and many thousands more in other countries but so scared of this Wuhan virus that killed 600 plus people so far. What’s the rationale for this human behaviour. Also I think the mortality rate is very low (China doesn’t have the correct figure because many people were not tested), probably 0.2 outside of China. So should we spent so much effort on this? Probably and likely it is some sort of a very bad flu. Trust me. If you are not the elderly or got chronic medical problems you should be alright.",2020-02-08,124
21182,"Blessed Chap Goh Mei! It's a time for family gathering. While we will stand with the govt in fighting this virus and do our best to prevent the virus from spreading within our means... I hope our govt do have concrete plans ahead to ensure the well being of the nation.   plans of reducing the risk and exposure of commuters daily travelling on MRT to the virus is perhaps a major concern to address earlier than later. If I am not wrong, China govt has suspended their similar city train services in their major cities. Given there is shortage of masks a reality, how confidence by having so many passengers travelling daily in the mass transit vehicle without wearing masks while the nCoV has a incubation period which a patient may not show any symptoms, but is already able to spread the virus to people nearby? Besides this, will government be providing guidelines to companies wrt the segregation of work force on what is the major consideration from the perspective of an individual worker exposure and risk to the virus from their transportation to offices ? Clearly, my company has not consider this at all and has segregation of duties on no basis of such consideration... Staff with same roles and functions were split between working from home and reporting to workplace. staff staying near workplaces and walk to workplace daily and  staff driving to work place from home are allowed to work from home, while staff who need to commute in crowded MRT and buses needs to report to offices daily. If the precaution measures were taken with the principle of putting staff well being as top priority, I doubt the arrangement would be as such.",2020-02-08,285

This can allow those who been infected with the virus but have yet to show symptoms to not spread the virus, since the virus incubation period is about 2weeks. This will allow all those infected and develop symptoms within the incubation period to be safety identified and seek professional treatment safety and greatly reduces the risk of spreading to others, while the rest of the community are also protected with the mask protection.",2020-02-02,110

That way, residents can simply go down stairs at their own convenience, open their locked mailboxes and get the package. Instead, its become so bureaucratic and inefficient. Must go to a RC or CC designated to your block, must line up don't know for how long, must go within such and such hours, must show IC, etc. We are trying to avoid being the public as much as possible, but this is forcing us to expose ourselves in the line ups. Also, the poor volunteers in the RC and CC are seeing thousands of people coming in, and they are also getting exposed to potential carriers of the virus. ",2020-02-02,136

21652,"Dear PM Lee Sir, I my humble opinion, to really prevent and reduce the risk of any possible virus spread, I will strongly suggest to enforce that everyone in singapore to wear mask for 2 weeks to 1 month instead. This can allow those who been infected with the virus but have yet to show symptoms to not spread the virus, since the virus incubation period is about 2weeks. This will allow all those infected and develop symptoms within the incubation period to be safety identified and seek professional treatment safety and greatly reduces the risk of spreading to others, while the rest of the community are also protected with the mask protection.",2020-02-02,110

21734,"Mask gives one a sense of security in an infectious outbreak. Whether it is real sense of security or false sense of security is debatable. Me think it is a real sense of security for mask not only minimized those infected from discharging contagious droplets but also provides protection to some extent to those not infected from the contagious droplets in the environment. A false sense of security will only sets in when the wearer becomes careless n complacent in other aspect of personal hygiene. This is unlikely as in a disease outbreak, the need for security is so high that the margin into complacency territory is wide. Discouraging the wearing of mask also has the negative side effects on some that the situation is not so dire n thus they can drop their guards. A sense of security leads to a peaceful mind. A calm mind strengthens the body immune system.",2020-02-01,152

Next day since blockade till today we still have sufficient food & drinkable water. No mers outbreaks. The population in Qatar smaller than Singapore too. Please stop marketing your self as I do not want to follow u. Freaking FB ads algorithm!😤  By the way, Singaporeans living overseas r buying masks n sanitizer for those in need n shipping it over. Healthy people stockpile to sell mask for profits. Older people n families with young children need the masks more than those healthy ones. #cantstandstupidity #staged #wanttogainpublicvotes #papscrewupcitizensuffers",2020-02-08,136

22119,"Dear Mr Lee, Happy CNY! I'm a new Singapore citizen, who just accompanied my relatives to ICA in the hope of extending their short term visit pass this morning. My aunt and uncle, who are both over 60 years old, arrived in Singapore from Harbin on Jan 7th and didn't go anywhere outside of Singapore after their arrival. Their daughter, my cousin, and her husband are both PR but they aren't qualified to apply LTVP for my aunt and uncle. But when they visit yearly, they sometimes make use of the normal one-time, one-month extension to spend a time longer than one month with family. Yesterday, their extension application was rejected. We also saw on CNA that extension to short term visa is suspended. We went to ICA very early this morning to try to find out if any kind of appeal was possible, and the answer was no. Even though Scoot airline had already canceled their original flight that was scheduled for Feb 6th, the officers told us we have to book them tickets from other airlines for them to go back before the one month visa expires. Outside ICA Level 4 waiting area and around the information counter, the whole area was filled with Chinese families, and what looked like two hundred people, all having the same hope of not having the option of extension cut off. After all, these family members arrived early enough in January and didn't go to China again. But there was no exception. Some officers said they sympathize that people's family members have to go back to China at a risky time even though they don't pose threat in Singapore, and that they couldn't get an extension all in a sudden, the officers had no choice but following the new instructions. I would like to tell you how saddening it is for us to send our families back to China right now, when just two days ago we felt lucky that they arrived early enough, they could still use the extension of 30 days to avoid the risk of catching the virus back in China. I'm trying my best to get in touch with Singapore officials who might be able to consider a more appropriate action at this time. Do you think this action alone by ICA is absolutely necessary? Thank you and best regards, Tianshu",2020-02-01,378
22121,"Wuhan was slow in implementing stringent corrective and preventive measures when they first identified the virus. Guess they are complacent as they have beaten sars and thinking they should be able to handle this virus. This is a different virus and it's asymptomatic and more contagious than sars. The 11k plus diagnosed cases are just the tip of the iceberg, many undetected and unknown cases will soon surface. Not handled properly and not implementing very strict and stringent corrective and preventive measures such as total isolation, no meeting no mingling until virus die down, the province will soon be in a sad state and there is possibility of a portion of the people been wiped out. Hope Singapore will learn from their weaknesses and not be complacent and kind to the virus. We have to be harsh and not let the virus any chance of slipping in",2020-02-01,145

My aunt and uncle, who are both over 60 years old, arrived in Singapore from Harbin on Jan 7th and didn't go anywhere outside of Singapore after their arrival. Their daughter, my cousin, and her husband are both PR but they aren't qualified to apply LTVP for my aunt and uncle. But when they visit yearly, they sometimes make use of the normal one-time, one-month extension to spend a time longer than one month with family. Yesterday, their extension application was rejected. We also saw on CNA that extension to short term visa is suspended. We went to ICA very early this morning to try to find out if any kind of appeal was possible, and the answer was no. Even though Scoot airline had already canceled their original flight that was scheduled for Feb 6th, the officers told us we have to book them tickets from other airlines for them to go back before the one month visa expires. Outside ICA Level 4 waiting area and around the information counter, the whole area was filled with Chinese families, and what looked like two hundred people, all having the same hope of not having the option of extension cut off. After all, these family members arrived early enough in January and didn't go to China again. But there was no exception. Some officers said they sympathize that people's family members have to go back to China at a risky time even though they don't pose threat in Singapore, and that they couldn't get an extension all in a sudden, the officers had no choice but following the new instructions. I would like to tell you how saddening it is for us to send our families back to China right now, when just two days ago we felt lucky that they arrived early enough, they could still use the extension of 30 days to avoid the risk of catching the virus back in China. I'm trying my best to get in touch with Singapore officials who might be able to consider a more appropriate action at this time. Do you think this action alone by ICA is absolutely necessary? Thank you and best regards, Tianshu",2020-01-31,378
22375,"Dear PM Lee, refering to the latest announcement from MOH https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/extension-of-precautionary-measures-to-minimise-risk-of-community-spread-in-singapore. Just few days ago, 4G leader Ong Ye Kung said ""己不欲勿施于人"" when being asked whether Singapore should consider a total travel ban from China. Now, with this announcement, it is a sheer slap in his own face. Some more, this new measure is not only targeting travellers from mainland China, but also affect all PRC passport holders from the rest of the world. Can you imagine a PRC passport holder who stayed in Australia or Japan wants to travel or transit in Singapore and banned from doing so?  Can you help to clarify why this measure has to target nationalities or specific passport holders?",2020-01-31,112

Screening of temperature at airports is insufficient & unable to identify those ""walkers"" with the virus hidden in them. This will help to allay some of our fears of possible community outbreaks.

22568,"Sir, Just my humble opinion. I am worried.  Because i think It is a not a good idea for the distribution of masks to all residents in Singapore, to be done by getting people to come to the RC centres and community centres because,  1) The chances of getting virus infection will be increased thousands of times as crowds of millions of people, including the old and the handicapped , line up , and infect each other with viruses , which defeat the very purpose of having masks ,and 2) it is so unproductive for people to take leave , just to go collect those masks and 3) Its a waste of time of so many volunteers to help in the distribution exercise and 4) A smart idea would be to just get the post office delivery men , to open up the back of the mail boxes at bottom of each block of HDB flats and then slot in all the masks into all the letter boxes, and this could be done within a few seconds for each block of flat. Imagine the huge time savings ,and getting the task done so quickly and efficiently , compared to getting millions of people to spend hours going to RC centres and community centres to Q up ,and having hundreds of thousands people infecting each other with viruses .  Please do consider my humble opinion, to do the distribution of masks, through mail box.  Thank you",2020-02-01,234

22574,We appreciate the gesture and efforts .. however won’t it be more effective if these masks were be mailed out to individual households instead of having someone to collect ?   Firstly the mobilisation of manpower and logistics be massive and expensive considering the suddenness of the demand ...!  Secondly large crowd would descend to the collection centres and this is definitely not a good idea for people to crowd around waiting to collect ...!!!   The cost would be negligible considering the light weight and compactness of the masks.   And conveniences of receiving the masks by post would certainly also prevent mass hysteria should certain popular centres run out the masks ...not to mention the inconveniences of a family member having to make time just to collect 4 masks ..!!!!,2020-01-30,124
22575,"Dear Mr Lee, we appreciate the gesture of allocating 4 masks per household. However, the govt should also consider during these times to mandate that GPs give out at least one mask to patients who are genuinely unwell. We visited a reputed medical chain yesterday as a family member was down with cough and cold. We asked for one mask as we did not have any and were unable to get any. However, we were told that the clinic does not supply ANY mask. We were not asking to buy a whole box, just ONE mask for the sick patient. And our request was denied. I find this practice highly illogical especially in such times given that patients who are unwell should be wearing masks and yet the clinic in question is not able to provide. And meanwhile, the sick patient is spreading the virus around because there are no masks available! BTW, this is not an isolated experience at just one clinic!",2020-01-31,162

22600,"Dear PM, I do agree the purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent spreading the virus if one is sick.  BUT to avoid getting the virus from the sick who is not wearing mask, it’s still safer better for us to wear mask if one understand well the whole picture.  In Singapore, even in this sensitive time, it is still common to see people with coughs and running nose not wearing mask because most of us don’t have the habit of wearing mask when they having flu cough running nose.  And on this Wuhan virus, seriously we don’t know who is having the early symptoms of the virus when you are in the public.  This issue of masks to Singaporean and PR in the Community Centres can be worrying too if it create a contained crowd, cos I feel it is better to avoid crowd places.  4 masks for each household is seriously barely enough in this risky time. Be safer than sorry.  Just sharing my opinion and hope it can help the government to do more better for the people 🙏 ❤️Peace and Love to ALL❤️ ",2020-01-31,188

22784,"Sir you doing the best as head of nation,sir at these critical period to save the nation,sir the best is if flights from china stopped,before more harm happened ,that is best to safe singapore from more coranvious virus,thank you only suggestion god bless simgapore.",2020-01-30,48
22785,"I'm not convinced this is a good idea at all. During SARS we learned that these masks get damp due to the water vapour in exhaled breath and the damp cloth provides a surface for the virus to attach, thus actually increasing the risk of infection. Hence the best advice is that only those with an infection should wear them. I guess the government has a short memory.",2020-01-30,67
22789,"I do not quite agree that only people feeling unwell need to wear masks. I read from a doctor in China only today that infected people rarely show symptoms like nose block and running nose. That basically makes it difficult for others to differentiate them from healthy people. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the virus can spread so fast in Wuhan. I can understand that the current stock of surgical masks is inadequate to meet demand. However, whoever has the mask now should be advised to wear it especially when in crowded places. This will effectively minimize the prospect of a widespread outbreak of the Wuhan virus in our communities. We never can tell whether there are healthy carriers walking around at the moment especially among people who have just returned from China. So ideally, we should have everyone wearing mask in public as soon as supply is adequate to enable us to do so. 小心驶得万年船。",2020-01-30,158

22857,"Dear PM Lee Because many Hubei residents have left Hubei before the outbreak was officially known,  in my view, the entry to Singapore ought to include all people coming in from any Chinese cities.  We are a small country.  I like to dedicate our medical resources and emergency resources to our own citizens.

22861,"More needs to be done for national interest.  I think a travel ban beyond Hubei is necessary for at least 10 days. That way, any incubation period will be set from that lockdown date.  We are now experiencing newer cases who have been in Singapore for longer Jan 18/ Jan 20 etc. They have escaped the travel lockdown  It only makes sense to align our travel lockdown with that of the major provinces and cities in China.  Surely our national interests for all 5+M of us citizens are more important than the tourism dollars in the next 14-21 days?!!!???  Golden weeks in May and Oct are long time aways yet.

22864,"Is it enough to just ban those whom visited hubei recently? Many people have already escaped hubei before the lockdown and could be anywhere in sg now. The supply of masks is also not readily available, even places like liang court guardian also sold out, shouldnt there be some measures done about this?  As for advices regarding how healthy people shouldnt wear masks, isnt it sending wrong signal? There are cases whereby no symptoms shown but the person is still infected. And all it takes is one infected person to cough into the face of a healthy person not wearing a mask, its still a high risk no? Maybe govt shod ensure singaporeans, both healthy or not, have ample supply of masks first?",2020-01-28,123
22865,Perhaps a national body could be responsible for dispensing masks of the right quality at a fair price ... and not allow pharmacies and other retailers to profit from this situation.

We have many Singapore residents who are from Wuhan and has relatives visiting them from Wuhan.  How are we managing this?

22994,"I REALLY would like to see the government put more emphasis and promotional materials on hand hygiene adopted by the hospitals to educate and INGRAIN the public to understand why washing your hands properly and not touching your face can be more effective than wearing a surgical mask. This might potentially alleviate the mass hysteria problem of everyone buying masks.   There is one point though which I disagree... “Masks are only for unwell people and you do not need it if you are well” I can’t control if people sneeze or cough at me, at least I can control/minimise the droplets from getting into my mouth and nose... I would say that’s darn important... even it’s a 5percent increased chance of avoiding the virus. I’ll take it.  I’ma chemo patient and my immunity is weak! A simple cough can causes me a serious infection and pneumonia is instant death. I could use that 5 percent.  So even without the Wuhan virus or not, I hope education on this subject matter gets around more to the people of Singapore.   We simply need to wash our hands as often as we can and avoid touching our faces so much. Wear a mask if you are sick but also wear a mask if you’re more prone to sickness too.  I love SIngapore. I believe if everyone made an effort to work together on getting this hygiene habit out. We should be all right for now!

I kept some masks even if they past expiry and had to be thrown away , I will just stock  new ones again .  If government is sincerely looking to resolve and prevent spreading in the community, and since we have ample stocks (or do u intend to keep the masks to grow mould ?) , start giving away masks at mrt and bus interchanges. The sooner we start wearing masks, the better we can prevent this virus from spreading locally. Stop saying the 7 cases are imported cases, all 7 of them used local transport to reach local destinations and interacted with locals. We have no idea who were so lucky to have catch their virus. If we wait till there are local infections, they would have passed it on to their families and friends and colleagues, second and third tier infection and virus mutations will probably have begun.

They  are  so  many  and  it’s  important  to  trace  who  are  the  ones  from  Hubei  (not  just  recent)  and  to  follow  through.  As for the government’s advice re wearing of masks. Since you all dont take mrt trains and buses, you dont understand that there are many coughing and sneezing in the carriages without covering their mouths or wearing a mask.  We  face  that  every  time  we  take  the  train.

To minimise this risk, can I propose having a hotline (in different languages) for individuals suspected of being contracted with the virus to call in.  A trained operator can assist the caller with basic questions like those answered by the polyclinic hotline to help us determine whether to visit a polyclinic. This new Wuhan Virus hotline will allow individuals to determine if one’s chance of being a suspected case is high.  If the result is affirmative, the trained operator can advise the caller to stay where he/she is or moved to a less crowded place and send a special transportation to transport the individual to a designated location for further testing before determining if quarantine measures are required.

By not wearing mask is encouraging the virus to spread faster. Those in public services including transportation services should be make to wear mask since they meet general public by the hundreds each day.  Covering up and protecting oneself is the best prevention unless Singapore does not have the ready stock for everyone to last couple of months.,2020-01-29,92

We know your addressed the general  masses as 'fellow Singaporeans' but CCS called us idiots. Is he saying this on a personal capacity  or is he representing the government to air his displeasure.   He further reiterated the reason/rational of telling Singaporeans to wear a mask only if you are sick it seems there is a hidden agenda; there is not enough masks to go around as opposed to other MP saying there is ample in the stockpile. Please address this pertinent query, as a Singaporean i am entitled to know. His derogatory mannerism is beyond tolerance. So far, we have not heard you as a Head of the country coming out to clarify his behaviour. I am utterly dismay at his command of the English language, it sets me wondering what has happened to our bilingualism policy.  Moreover, he admitted adopting different behaviour in public and in closed door concept. This is a very concerning point as our Minister. Care to address this. Thanks.",2020-01-28,186

23453,"Dear PM Lee,  first I really appreciate the measures that our country has taken including setting up quarantine facilities ; providing free masks and many others.  You, your leaders and many are working very hard to help manage and contain the situation.  But at the same time,  I am feeling very frustrated and worried with the climbing number of cases in SG.  All the cases are Chinese nationals who arrived SG on 19th Jan and after.  At that time, we already knew about the Virus, its source City Wuhan, and that it is highly infectious, spreading and taking lives .  So why did we still allow them to enter Singapore and freely move about. This is a burning question. Why we seemed slow to act towards this? As a result, SG though a very small country is now ranked top 3 behind China and Thailand.   Can we act fast and step up more effective measures before it is too late.  As the saying goes... you got to nip it at the bud.  We got to stop people from the high risk Country ( and not just Wuhan city) from coming into our land . Or at least they should be quarantined upfront for 2 weeks upon arrival before joining our civilization.  The schools and companies are already stepping up measures and asking those who have been to China or been in close contact with such ;  to stay away from their premises .  But their efforts alone are not going to be enough.  We need our Country to do the same and stop them on our shores.   Second,  those from Wuhan who are still amongst us, can we trace and quarantine-  so that we don’t have new cases each day and they have already made contact with many others by then.  I seek your consideration and hope to hear your responses.  We continue to look to your leadership , vigilance and courage to protect our country, our home, our people.  Let’s unite and stand up for Singapore.  Respectfully yours ....",2020-01-28,331

Add to the fact that China has always not been forthcoming with their infection rates medical data, there is a real risk that anyone from China coming into Singapore now can be carriers, do not display fever symptoms and go on to then infect people in Singapore.   Philippines and North.Korea has already closed their borders to China.   The fact that the government has not closed borders with China is a major reason why people are panicking and stockpiling face masks.  https://sg.news.yahoo.com/wuhan-virus-petitions-in-singapore-calling-to-ban-travellers-from-china-making-rounds-101950658.html",2020-01-28,103

23468,Your office temperature and humidity is conducive for virus growth like SARS or Wuhan viruses. Scientists have found that dried SARS CoV can retain its viability for 5 days in temperature between 22 and 25 degree celsius. At higher temperature of 38 degree and humidity >95% its viability is rapidly lost.  So we should  not create an ambient environment for these viruses to grow. I guess our National Infectious Disease Centre or SGH temperature and humidity level is currently most conducive for the Wuhan viruses to retain its virility.,2020-01-30,84

I have been going around day and night to look for blue surgical masks, even happy if I could get 10, yet there is none. I doubt the hoarders buy by one box each at a retailer. So holding back stockpile does not solve the situation of many. OK, so now we have a precious commodity of 4. Time to salute the govt :D Sure healthy ones- dont need to wear a mask.

23472,I arrived in Changi Airport from Indonesia yesterday. There was no screening for us. Also saw alot of China people arriving in the airport and many are not wearing masks.

But I think to wear it all day long outdoors is almost impossible as it is both uncomfortable to start off with apart from the fact you need to take it off at some point. Cleanliness and strict hygiene helps but the  critical point is still, I   think would be that of a temporary ban of travellers from China. It would be appropriate to safeguard our health interests due to the very nature of the coronavirus. 1 month ban would do.  Apart from this, I would like to suggest home based learning and working instead of travelling out for the time being. We should make use of technology to get us through this period.  Perhaps ordering food and groceries could be made via online too. Get professionals to deliever them to the door instead of people travelling out. This way it cuts down the risk of contacting the virus.",2020-01-28,176

Fyi, there are some parents who prefer their children to stay at home for 14 days to prevent further outbreak of the Coronavirus. We believe prevention is better than cure and sometimes it is good to be a bit kiasu. So even if there is an outbreak of the virus within schools, this group of parents will not blame MOE. Fyi, some people including my family can't buy a single piece of mask as everywhere is out of stock. We don't wish to put our kids at risk as they need to travel to and fro school by public transport.  For those parents who are comfortable to let their children to go to school tomorrow, they can go ahead to do so. No one is stopping them.   Of course, it will be even better if MOE can announce closing of schools for 14 days. Just like the previous SARS situation.

23601,"Looking at the statistics so far released and noticing their patterns, it is true that the virus spreads very fast. But its fatality rate is not so alarming. So far about 25 deaths are added today while about 1800 new cases are confirmed. The day before it was 24 deaths for the day and about 700 new cases. From these numbers, we see that while the number of deaths remains somewhat stable, the spreading rate doubles. The same pattern was observed on earlier days. If this is anything to go by, the death figure for tomorrow will be between 140 and 150. But the number of confirmed cases may reach 9000 cases going by the pattern. At this spreading rate, it's going to overwhelm the medical team and logistical arrangements in Wuhan. I am sure our government is aware of it. A very important point to note is that recovery rate from the disease is very low too. Coupled with low death rate and rapid increase in new cases, the resultant demand for more hospital wards and beds is going to be alarming. This must be taken into account in formulating our contingency plan. As it is believed that the virus is potent even during the incubation period, which stretches from 2 days to 14 days, there's no way of telling if we already have carriers walking around without showing any symptoms.

23641,"Dear PM  I write this message as a Singaporean who is gravely concerned for the well being of all Singapore citizens and residents, and who is worried at the style and speed with which your government is acting.  1. First Observation - within a matter of days, Singapore has run out of face masks. None of the pharmacies I visited today have a single piece of mask left. Why is this so? Is it because our supply chain is not robust? Is it because we allowed visitors to buy an indiscriminate number of masks? Are these visitors exporting masks? Are businesses being held accountable or are they diverting the masks to the next most profitable client / country? Is the government doing anything to investigate / verify / and place measures to counteract the above-mentioned points via solid actions? I strongly recommend that the government work to Ensure a strong supply of masks. A suggestion - Restrict Tourists to purchase only 1 piece per passport per day and reserve at least X pieces of mask per Singapore residing household per day, depending on the number of family members. You have all the data. Please Ensure that you remember a fundamental principle: Singaporeans should be entitled to a safe environment and it is your duty to deliver on that entitlement.  2. Second observation - Only today was it released that Hubei residents will be restricted from entering Singapore. 3 questions come to mind - Why only Hubei and not Whole of China? n-COV is more contagious than SARS. Why only today and not within 48 hours of the crisis? Why did we allow approx 2000 China visitors to roam the streets freely? I am sure you and your team of able Ministers had consulted very able and talented Doctors, Professors, International agencies. It is public news days ago that this virus is more virulent and contagious than SARS. Should stronger measures not have been put into place within 24-48H of the virus becoming international news? Have you questioned the speed, efficiency and confidence with which you and your fellow ministers have put in place measures?  Minister, do remember that the health & safety of all Singaporeans is your responsibility.  And it seems to many Singaporeans at this juncture, that this responsibility is not being carried out well. Prove us wrong. Just ask yourself if we want Singaporean deaths and infections arising from this. Many families will suffer the consequences.  Please also activate our defence force . The army ambulances should be activated to cope, non-sensitive camps should be used as a “fever centre” to ease the load on Hospitals and GPs.   Please, implement with speed. Take a strong stand, and take risks, that would pay off for the well being of Singaporeans.   Thank you.",2020-01-28,445

23654,For ur information those people from china came to Singapore brought up all our face mask and hand starilizers before heading back to their country i dont think it vry fair to let them do that what about us,2020-01-29,39
23655,"I follow the Wuhan virus news closely like most ordinary folks out there, especially when I have the vulnerable young and elderly.  I believe this Wuhan virus is not causing huge panic here in Singapore, but more of frustration.  The latest frustration would be the lack of face masks, despite the assurances from the government that face masks are readily available. Showing photos of warehouse stock full of face masks only add to our frustration as many people were trying to just get hold of some for themselves and their family. I believe most of us are civic-minded and will not buy in bulk so that everyone has the chance to get their hands on the masks.  I can say I am responsible, taking care of personal hygiene, covering up when sneezing or coughing and go out less often. Likewise for my family. But you just need one irresponsible person to sneeze and cough in public without covering and people surrounding this person would be affected (especially now where most of us could not even get any masks - how to protect oneself then?).  As such, masks should be available to all households during this critical period. If this is still not deem as critical period, then what is? Till a community breakout? We should always “Hope for the Best but Prepare for the Worst”.  I feel that RCs come in particularly handy during this period. Instead of organizing tours and distributing free fruits to residents, RCs can be the  designated point for each household to pick up their masks.   The RC can be open for residents at their estate to pick up the masks during weekends (Sat and Sun).  Each person should get 7 masks to tide over one week. One person in each household will go collect on behalf of all, taking photo of the NRIC/birth cert of the person staying in the household. This is to verify how many people are staying in the house by verifying the address. I know some will say “privacy” issue, but we are not talking about joining contests or whatsoever. We are talking about critical period where masks have been flying off the shelves and leaving many with none. This will allow control and the government can stock-take their masks and not cause any further frustration.  The same exercise will happen again one week later so that no one will stock so many masks at home unnecessarily.  Some might point out that this is a logistic nightmare. But what is logistic nightmare when this Wuhan virus is already causing deaths in China and we now know it can be transmitted human-to-human? I believe such distribution can surely be done.   In addition, restricting Wuhan people from arriving to Singapore is definitely a late, but welcome move; but many have already escaped the “loophole” of the lockdown period. As CNY ends soon, many would be coming back to Singapore to work. Serving LOA is not going to deter them from going out; it serves not much purpose actually, if that individual is a selfish and irresponsible being. The best way would be to ferry them to Pulau Ubin (as Outward Bound is reported to be a quarantine facility) the moment they arrive in Singapore and quarantine these people for two weeks to ensure they are “all-clear” before stepping foot into our densely populated country.  I believe if the government is swifter in their decision, people would be less frustrated. We as Singaporeans will stand united to fight this Wuhan virus together, so as our pledge says   “We, the CITIZENS of Singapore. Pledge ourselves as one UNITED people”  人民一心，打到病菌",2020-01-28,599

23661,"“29 Jan, 7.30pm JUST IN: There are 10 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore as of 2pm today. All of them are Chinese nationals, with 9 Wuhan residents.”  It started with 2 cases and increased to 10 within a very short period of time. While many Asian countries had already stopped Chinese visitors onto their shores, Singapore just only stopped Chinese nationals with Hubei passports to enter. A most effective way to contain the current situation in my opinion but only came way too late; with the slightest consolation is that it’s better late than never.   Please DO NOT just look at the absolute numbers.  Even so, with 10 confirmed cases thus far, it isn’t even reflecting good anyway.   Geographical and population size wise, Singapore is the smallest of all the countries that have confirmed cases of the Coronavirus. Put that into percentage against geographic and/or population size, we are undoubtedly ranked No.1 in terms of confirmed cases as of this moment.  Singapore strives to be No.1 in the world in many aspects but certain No.1’s isn’t worth it.   I strongly believe this number or percentage could have been better contained or stopped from rising had our government implement the temporary ban on Chinese nationals (at least those holding onto Hubei passports) much earlier. This approach came late because the government have over estimated their abilities to contain the situation at the earlier stage.  Please do not put fellow Singaporeans and our medical personnel into further risks by reacting slower.   There is not much use by telling people to practise good hand hygiene, wear masks, stay calm and vigilant etc if we keep allowing the risks to come in.  Do something more timely and practical please, monitor and react/implement the most effective ways to combat the situation.   Just like when SPF wasn’t capable to stop the Little India Riot, and while alcohol is a catalyst but not the root cause, the government took to banning alcohol almost immediately after the incident, islandwide after certain hours.  Then why can’t we refuse the entry of Chinese nationals or at least people from Wuhan way earlier then?   And though it’s nothing wrong to do some good deeds in times like this where we have donated 120,000 masks to Wuhan but why are our people needing to wait long in queues to buy masks, and some shops even jack up the prices and nothing is done to improve the situation here? Eg., if we can send masks to Wuhan, it is also much appreciated if the MOH could send out masks at places where there’ll be crowds like MRT stations too rather than just telling people to stay vigilant. Surely we have more than enough in our surplus to give out masks to the public especially in times like this and the reason couldn’t have been more valid.",2020-01-28,479

Do hope that there is a cure soonest and that there is no need for pulau ubin to be used as quarantine area for this virus.  Below stated is what has been shared and posted by someone claimed from medical facility.   Thanks to the sender  Good News re: CORONA Virus  1st good News: China has developed a testing kit for CoronaVirus & will have it distributed nationwide. It can accurately confirm the presence of coronavirus on any suspect who has fever within 2-3hours. (Don’t know if this will soon be available in our country).  2nd good news: The new coronavirus can’t stand high-temperature environments.  -CoronaVirus will die in 56’C environment for 30mins.  -Utensils should be regularly sterilised /disinfected or boiled in 100’C water to totally eliminate all viruses. -eat cooked foods; don’t eat raw foods for the time being.  3rd good news: New coronavirus is easily eradicated by medical grade alcohol. -75%alcohol or  Chlorine disinfectant can effectively eliminate the coronavirus.  (Tip: bring alcohol in your bag to regularly disinfect your hands esp while outdoors; use alcohol to sanitize doorknobs in your home if someone develops flu-like symptoms; keep those who get sick inside their bedroom or bring to a doctor immediately).   According to a research professor’s advice: this winter; those with heating system in the house should keep the indoor temperature above 20’C. Don’t worry about wastage of electricity. -Coronavirus can’t survive long in a warm environment. Thus all households should keep the house heating & ventilation system on during this period.

23709,Good morning!everybody I have some very heartwarming  n rather important views regarding the Wuhan virus which i wanna share w everybody.yes.no doubt bcos of this infectious n scary virus it has indeed caused much fears  n scaring every Sporean .not just only us Sporeans but the whole world is very worried n frankly speaking very alarmed.however i personally feel that we cannot just bcos of one fatality n 106 cases bcos of this serious virus therfore ban those Hubei or china people from travelling to n fro from Singapore.My most respected n highly esteemed  ministers  of Singapore.please kindly listen to an honest  yet sincere citizen of Spore.firstly as i have read through certain comments on this very sensitive issue regarding this Wuhan virus yes.of course it is indeed a very deadly n infectious virus.however we cannot  ban these businessmen from travelling to n fro from china to Spore n vice versa.firstly this ban if really put into implementation will indeed cause a lot of disharmony n inconvenience between China n our  country.the mutual well maintained closeness n friendship between China n Spore will be greatly affected diplomatically.Rather than banning Hubei chinaman from visiting Singapore why can't we sit down togethet n think of ways n methods on how to improve our own personal hygiene n cleanliness.i believe many sicknesses are the cause due to lack of personal hygiene.many occasions i personally see little children dropping sweets n these kids simply just picked up those sweets n popped them into their mouths again when their parents were not observing them.i understand that  very young children are not aware of personal hygiene.perhaps good hygiene habits ought to start from the home Such as teaching a child the proper n correct way of handwashing N the precautions one ought to take at this crucial moment like this.monitering a child's temperature when the child is down a fever.seeking help from a doc immediately if the fever is above 38.perhaps our Spore govt could implement some rather good n quick ways of checking up n making sure before these China man make a trip to Spore. Maybe a thorough medical report of their state of health within the past few weeks.a  full certified report to be presented before they can take the flight to Spore I personally believe in this saying When there is a will there is a way Let me ask the parliament one very honest n straightforward yet very direct question.if supposing one Sporean suddenly contracted a weird kind of deadly virus n he or she brings  this fatal n deadly vieus over to China how will these China  population react to this matter.sometime things might looked very  very complicated ncertain issues are indeed very sensitive but frankly speaking for me as a very good n honest Spore citizen i feel we ought not n must not bcos of one person who brings in this Wuhan virus then feel that it is the whole China who is at fault.rather than being so worried n scared what the govt needs to do now is to think of a way of .to solve this edgy issue.prevention is better than cure.the parents are the one who can teach n train a child very well good hygiene habits.maybe we ought to consider the pros n cons  N sit down  n hopefully a new vaccine might be found to save our lives from this virus.perhaps at the customs there ought to be more stands for some kinds of medical check upd.perhaps those coming to n fro from Hubei need to provide a full  cerified report of their medical n health condition for the past few werks before they bard the plane headed 4  Spore.thank u.Sir.for your listening ears.i  have to rush to work.thank u have a great day,2020-01-28,606

23718,"My personal opinion, are we over-reacting ?? Some mention to closed school till further notice in case of getting the virus 🦠? Then how about the adults going to work ?? Does that mean all companies to closed till further notice ??some Singaporeans are selfish and they will buy in boxes of masks to keep causing shortage of masks . To me this Coronavirus is just like hfmd or mmr  all these is contagious but do we really need to over react ??? Some suggested to ban all China nationality from coming back to Singapore then who is going to do their job for them ? I believe the governments has their safety measures and i can trust in them  and besides this virus is not that easily to be transmitted unless under certain conditions. Nevertheless Please wear surgical mask  in enclosed area or sick. Just take care of personal hygiene . we can fight away this virus  . 😊",2020-01-28,150
23719,"Thank you PM🙏 During the height of haze issues,households were sent at least one mask. Tried to buy one surgical mask (to keep handy for flights and for crowded risky areas) but alas none available. Perhaps if we were to have access to 1 mask...it would be a good fallback. Not to wear everywhere but just when absolutely necessary...on flights especially. 🙏",2020-01-28,63

Malaysia and Philipines shut it border on china.. Malaysia 4 cases (all from singapore) and philipines .. 0 case. Does this also make sense to you?   If we have 1 case of Infected SG or PR who has never went to china before...what makes you think other country will not shut their border on us in an heart beat? Even if they did, they did it to protect their citizen... would anyone blame them?",2020-01-29,109

23726,If you're already sick you shouldn't be going out with a face mask in the first place but go to the hospital instead. While those wanting to go on with their lives and work SHOULD be wearing the mask as the virus only show symptoms after a few days of infection. So you might be standing next to an infected person without any protection and not know it. Would you take that chance? You need to take the KIASU approach on this and not act like it's back to normal.,2020-01-28,87

Stopping tourists from one city won’t lower our risks of getting more confirmed cases. Giving almost 24 hours of notifications to ban travellers from one city to enter our land, is equivalent to inviting more virus carriers to come in fast before I shut my door on you.
