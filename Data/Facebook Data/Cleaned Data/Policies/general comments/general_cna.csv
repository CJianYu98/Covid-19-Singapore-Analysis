380,"Bloody Sunday has sparked calls for an interim government and R2P  ***************************************   On Sunday, a global holiday, Burmese people are not able to rest like millions of people around the world.  Bullets fired by those who pledged to protect the lives and property of the people, regardless of their lives, for the future independence of the country.  Bombs;  Fighting between numbers sticks has made history as a bloody Sunday.   The United Nations has confirmed that 18 people have been killed and many more injured in a brutal crackdown on a month-Fri uprising that day.   But the people of Burma are increasingly calling for tougher sanctions than the default Western condemnation of the United Nations, which is monitoring the situation in the country.   The situation is likely to get worse as the people are determined to fight hard for their future because of the fear of living under a military dictatorship.   At the same time, they are calling for help, using the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) enacted by the UN Leaders' Summit in December 2005 to protect their citizens from authoritarian regimes that are killing them violently.   There are three major stages in R2P.   The first step is for every government to establish a genocide site in its own country.  Ethnic cleansing;  We must protect ourselves from war crimes and atrocities against our citizens.   The second step is to put pressure on the government to comply with the international community if it fails to do so.   If the third step fails to do so, the international community must take timely and effective action in accordance with the UN Charter.   The situation in Burma is now clear that the coup d'Ã©tat is brutally killing its loyalists and civilians, and that the first and second steps have been taken.   The implementation of the R2P must be reported to the UN Secretary-General's Security Council, and the armed intervention must be approved by the Security Council.   So far, 80 UN Security Council resolutions have been adopted.  13 General Assembly resolutions;  The Human Rights Council has approved the need for R2P with 50 resolutions.  This is especially true of African countries.   In the current situation, there is a lack of funds and resources to intervene militarily.  The United Nations has strongly warned the coup not to move forward since the talks began, but it could be very effective and could save many lives for the people of Burma.   In this case, the UN Secretary-General himself does not need to ask for a request from the relevant government, but only on the ground.  The United Nations Secretary-General has vowed to try to thwart the coup, but the Burmese people are now questioning him about how many more should be killed in a war-torn country.   The situation in Burma is now facing serious social upheaval, and if it gets worse, it could lead to civil war.  The coup d'Ã©tat was so shocking that it, like the previous 72-hour gin, is now releasing a gin that says no foreign intervention in the event of a civil war.  There is no need to go too far and prove that this is not Gin.  You can see Russian troops attacking President Assad during the Syrian civil war.   Min Aung Hlaing faces the crisis of inviting international intervention even more violently, and the people and the military and police are as disgusted as the Fascist Japanese.   At home, the CRPH is preparing to form a caretaker government.  The CRPH does not have a rival government, as some say, because it has the legal right to do so.  Naming a rival government would be tantamount to recognizing the coup as a government.   The CRPH is now widely recognized by the people across the country as their legitimate government.  At the same time, there are a number of ways in which CRPH can be used to undermine public support.  His men are attacking him with criticism.   In collaboration with the CRPH, ambassadors and staff from many countries have been recalled for fear of participating in an internationally recognized diplomatic offensive, and instructions have been issued not to have any contact with the CRPH.  In addition, those who do not wish to join the CRPH must report to the Military Council by March 6, as the previous election as a Pyithu Hluttaw member has been canceled.  The Irrawaddy reports that the government has issued a statement saying it will take severe action.   But no one will take their orders for granted by force of arms.   This is why the CRPH recognizes that they are becoming a major threat.  CRPH's international relations representatives now include senior US government officials;  The lower house and the upper house are in contact with each other, and they should be encouraged to say, ""The military option will not be ruled out.""   The International Criminal Court (ICC) has set up a Special International Criminal Tribunal (ICRC) in Cambodia to try the crimes committed by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Cambodia after the break-up of the coup d'Ã©tat.  Even conscripts were sentenced to prison terms.  Many were imprisoned and forced to live with their children and spouses.  Therefore, we must be aware that the crimes we have committed have been in the shadows for many years.   It is also important to consider the geopolitical situation in which the United States and its allies will never have a Chinese-dominated Burma, as the Cold War of the twentieth century has shifted to the Asian front instead of Europe in the twentieth century.   Secretary-General of the United Nations;  US Secretary of State  A number of countries, including Indonesia, the EU foreign minister and members of the Asean front, have issued a statement condemning the massacre on Sunday.   Who will legitimize a government formed by people who are killing unarmed citizens?   The uprising must be won !!!",2021-03-01,950

We are demanding the immediate release of all political activists and journalists unlawfully arrested Oromia, EthiopiaðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹.  We strongly request that to release Our Leaders 27 days of hunger strike  #OromoPoliticalPrisonersOfHungerStrike  #Starvingforjustice  #FreeAlloromoPoliticalPrisoners #JusticeforHachalu  #OromoProtests #FreeJawarMohammed  #FreeBekeleGerba #freeAbdiRagassa #FreeColonelGemechuAyana #Freedejenaxafa #FreeMeleseDirribsa #FreeHamzaBorana #Freeshemsedintaha #FreeMichaelBoran #FreeLammiibeenyaa #FreeDawitabdeta #FreeKennasaAyana  Day 27 of Hunger Strike at Kaliti Federal Prison. ____  Jawar Mohammed, Bekele Gerba, Hamza Borana and other Oromo political prisoners are on their 27th day of a hunger strike in Kaliti Federal Prison. They are all in critical condition. Seven of the strikers are hospitalized, and all of them have developed kidney problems.    The prisoners asserted that they started this hunger strike because of a worsening political condition and the derailed transition to democracy.   The Oromo political prisoners put their demands as follow:   1. Release All Oromo Political Prisoners  Jails and prisons are full of Oromos, more than any other group in the country. Currently there are more than 50,000 Oromo political prisoners in Ethiopia. In Kaliti alone there are more than 5,000 Oromo political prisoners, constituting 90% of the nationâ€™s entire prisoners.   There are also more than 30 Oromo political prisoners in Ethiopia who returned from different parts of the world following the 2018 promised transition to democracy. Among the returnees are high ranking officials of the OLF & OFC, including the most influential young political figure from the U.S, Jawar Mohammed.   Therefore, release all prisoners of conscience languishing in Ethiopian jails and prisons, of which the overwhelming majority are Oromo political prisoners.  2. Allow Oromo Political Party Offices to be Opened and to Operate Fully  More than 103 offices of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) across the country, including the HQ in Finfinne, have been closed by the government. More than 90 Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC) offices across Oromia are also now closed by the government.   The ruling party must stop the alienation and systematic disenfranchisement of the Oromo Nation from political participation in the country. Government must allow Oromo media TV station offices that were closed and their licenses suspended to be reinstated and to resume operations. We also demand that they organize an  all-inclusive national dialogue before the national election.  The government must open up and widen the political space in order to bring the derailed transition back on track, so that all who have vision for the betterment of Ethiopia could participate in a free and fair election.  Hence, the hunger strikers demand is to open and allow opposition political parties offices to operate. Stop the alienation, systematic disfranchisement and to open up the political space equally for all.  3. End Mistreatment of Families of Political Prisoners  Government security forces must end mistreatment of political prisoners while they visit their loved ones at Kaliti Prison and elsewhere. End any inhumane treatment of prisoners under custody or under investigation.   _____",2021-02-24,452

I never believed that anyone can solve someone's problems.I could rudely reply to the posts about the healers with insults little did i know that one day they will help me. The most grateful news of how my situation changed after a long period of suffering in an abusive marriage. My husband used to drink a lot and he loses all his mind and he could beat me up for no reason, I tried to settle matters with him but he kept a deaf ear, the worst thing was that I had failed to give him any kid, I conceived him twice but had miscarriages this made all his family to hate me and considered me as a person with bad luck but in reality I wanted to have kids so much. I looked for help in many places. Some used to tell me they could see darkness around my life and others could say bad luck while others could not give a serious reason behind my problems.and i that made mi to spend a lot reaching to the exetend of selling some of my things trying to get a better life with my husband bt i wouldn't loss hope,because of the situation i was facing! They all used to promise me good results but none could deliver, Most of the times when hardships come to us friends are few I was left alone crying every day and as a result, I lost my job because I couldn't perform well. Many friends left me and my husband filed a divorce and I became a laughing topic but I never lost hope. It was last year when I saw people writing about Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 and I felt interested to contact her one more time. I made my problems known to Mama who advised me to be cleansed from all that was making me suffer and to open up my luck in everything I do. I was asked to buy materials to help me which I did we begun the prayer and results were delivered in Four days. I thought it would be so easy but some stones remained unturned till last week when my husband came up with un apology to me for all he has been doing, he confessed for cheating and I forgave him and finally yesterday when i went for the check-up and the Mama confirmed that am two weeks pregnant with no complications. Am hoping to be a mother soon. Any woman out there facing the same in your love life please don't be ashamed of looking for help just contact Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 privately by either a Call or Whatsapp or Email: mamashamirahsince1970@gmail.com ",2021-02-23,468

1262,"The Covid-19 pandemic has reduced to a very much extent our common space within Singapore. Everywhere is restricted by SafeEntry measures. Travel overseas is a daunting prospect. I hope this will blow over and the Singapore which we are familiar with can return to normalcy. I read with sadness that people who are not wearing a face mask are arrested by the Police Officers. This is not the way to treat people. Also, there is a certain group of Singaporeans always complaining to the police whenever they feel disturbed by others, even making things up against the innocent people.",2021-02-16,99
1263,Went to a neighborhood mall just now. Very crowded. And everywhere you can hear people coughing and one lady came into the washroom with her mask totally down  as if she canâ€™t breathe well and then later met her again in Cold Storage she was coughing and coughing though she had her mask covered back up. I left Cold Storage immediately. Please stay safe everyone. Am sure there are cases. Just not detected yet. ,2021-02-15,74

1277,Yes and that is because there are covid cases on the âœˆï¸ and that is why it is ridiculously risky to let so many people in with covid.

1302,The world is burning  Controlled itinerary ?  How do you know the figures are accurate ?  Now we have caught them As usual so scared to offend people You only encourage others to infiltrate our country setting up illegal Govt in our country plus creating reliant people  It is really tough to ensure country is able to be independent and sovereign It is not you keep it to yourself  Others will treat you well I wonder how we end up in this state We better be careful of authoritarian Govt sending in their operatives here Price to pay for doing business without looking at the integrity and the type of Govt they have  We should do business with all but cannot be too extensive if the risk of being influenced and controlled negatively is high,2021-02-14,133

1687,"Speech by the military General Min Aung Hlaing stating that â€œthe seizure of powers was due to the â€˜Voting and electionâ€™ fraudsâ€ as broadcasted in their MRTV television channel, is nothing but a lie in broad daylight.  Truth be told; the seizure of powers is a direct result of facing rejection by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi TWICE when the military tried to negotiate with her for their own interests.   The first negotiation was to renew the term of â€œCommander-in-chief Generalâ€ position for another 5-years to which our peopleâ€™s leader refused.   The second negotiation was to chair the Commander the â€œPresidentâ€ position to which our leader also bluntly refused.   Military coup and its seizure of powers is solely based on these two main reasons. The matter of True or False will be revealed, ascertained and proved for those who were involved and helped in this negotiation process still remain alive today.   The people of Myanmar must cease to go to work in order to destroy and bring down the system of military dictatorship. You will need not only to refuse to go to work yourself but also to encourage those around you to do the same.   #MilitaryDictatorshipMustFail",2021-02-11,190

2033,"Re: Calling for Myanmar Mission in UN, All Myanmar Embassies and Myanmar Representative Offices Around the World to join hands with Civil Disobedience Movement in Myanmar  9th February 2021  Dear all Myanmar Ambassadors and Diplomats around the world,   On 1st February 2021, military generals led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing had committed treason by staging a coup.    This is a heinous crime and it is a rebellion against Daw Aung San Suu Kyi led Civilian Government.   We, People of Myanmar, do not recognize a rebel group led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and his puppet co-called a new cabinet.   Myanmar people are now showing their support for a democratically elected government through a series of non-violent ways such as non-cooperation with junta and its autocratic system; boycotting junta and its affiliates businesses and ex-communicating with their dummies; and, since yesterday, hundreds of thousands of people are staging the mass demonstrations around country.   Civil Servants and government employees are not going to offices in Myanmar starting from 8th February 2021 (Monday) as part of the Civil Disobedience Movement to show their support for a democratically elected civilian government.   People of Myanmar overwhelmingly voted for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi led NLD party and we only support our legitimate government led by President U Win Myint.   We, People of Myanmar, have a democratically elected parliament, the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH).    Therefore, we, People of Myanmar, are calling for All Myanmar Embassies and UN Representative Offices Around the World to join hands with the Civil Disobedience Movement in Myanmar by declaring your loyalty to a democratically elected government led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.   Let us join hands together to eliminate all forms of military dictatorship in Myanmar to restore establishing a genuine democratic system in Myanmar.

First, the military stopped the use of Facebook where Myanmar civilians have been sharing news and Civil Disobediemce Campaigns. Now, the military has completely shut down the internet, cutting off the country from the rest of the world.   I cannot contact my parents, relatives and friends.

The pans and pots bearing campaign is still going on every night at 8 pm to show rejection to the coup. In Myanmar tradition, pots and pans are banged to drive evil from your home.

2262,"Dear World,  Myanmar has gone dark.  Just 6 days after Myanmar military has seized control of the country in a coup and detaining the country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratically-elected leaders while making up charges to hold them, Myanmar has now gone dark. First, the military stopped the use of Facebook where Myanmar civilians have been sharing news and Civil Disobediemce Campaigns. Now, the military has completely shut down the internet, cutting off the country from the rest of the world.   I cannot contact my parents, relatives and friends. My friends have not been able to contact their families either.  Civil disobedience campaigns have spreaded across the country, with health professionals being at the forefront of it. Myanmar civilians are fighting peacefully for the end to military dictatorship once and for all. We are all fighting peacefully for democracy.  The pans and pots bearing campaign is still going on every night at 8 pm to show rejection to the coup. In Myanmar tradition, pots and pans are banged to drive evil from your home.   May the World know that we are resisting the coup and fighting back peacefully.  Please help Myanmar by calling your Govenrment and your representatives to take immediate and swift actions toward these military junta. #crd #savemyanamar  #rejectmilitarycoupmyanmar #HearTheVoiceOfMyanmar",2021-02-08,207

Doctors and nurses from over 180 hospitals and medical departments in Myanmar walked out of their duties despite being in the middle of the pandemic, leading the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) by refusing to work under dictatorship and calling for help from the international medical community.  . MYANMAR COUP: Amidst chaos in the COVID-19 crisis, the military unlawfully seized control of the countryâ€™s sovereignty by overthrowing the democratically elected government which won a landslide victory in a recent 2020 election. Myanmarâ€™s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the President Win Myint were arrested by the armed forces before dawn of 01/02/2021 which ultimately led to Dawn of Injustice. BACKGROUND: Myanmar had been under Military Junta for 50 years (1962 - 2011). Military dictators were notorious for how brutal they were to their own people, slaughtering thousands of civilians across multiple uprisings. Despite being a Buddhist country, they did not hesitate to gun down Buddhist monks in the 2007 Saffron Revolution. A hard-won democracy was achieved after people had elected Suu Kyiâ€™s party for the first time in 2015.  . WHAT ARE THE RESPONSES: Waking up to a morning only to find out your world has turned upside down is not novel for Myanmar people but we are certainly filled with utter dismay due to mayhem brought about by the Burmese Military. So far, it has been a â€œBloodless Coupâ€ given that the military used lethal forces against protesters previously. People are banging pots and pans at nightfall during night-time curfew as our tradition to do so to force â€œEvil Beingsâ€ out of neighbourhood.  . CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT (CDM): Healthcare workers in Myanmar had initiated the movement expressing opposition to the authoritarian rule. Medical students, preceptors and rectors had also joined forces to defy continuing medical education under dictatorship. As the campaign picked up steam, other university students, lecturers and staff from government organizations became a part of CDM.  . OUR OBJECTIVE: Our main goal is to abolish the bureaucratic chain of illegitimate military regimes, once and for all, using a non-violent approach. We are protesting for the release of our leaders and the return of sovereignty back to the civilian mandated government.  . WHAT CAN YOU HELP: We need your VOICE. We would like you to spread the message of what is happening in Myanmar, and we need your SUPPORT. The immoral regime is weakening us by using psychological warfares including warnings to revoke medical licenses, unjust dismissals and offering specialized training as a quid pro quo. We would like the international medical community to stand together with us. Even a tweet, a social media post or a letter of moral support to our brothers and sisters would mean a whole lot to fuel our endurance in this longlasting battle against injustice using the following hashtags:  #HearTheVoiceOfMyanmar  #RespectOurVotes  #CivilDisobedienceMovement  Credit",2021-02-07,458

2696,"The coronavirus IS a biological weapon developed by USA when Trump was President. And they conveniently passed the blame to China and got the tycoon-controlled US media to flog it so, everyday. The truth eventually prevails. (Source of Covid-19 - USA  Trump is over! Many acts of injustice will kill themselves, and the sky has the eyes and does not avoid it!   Heaven has reincarnation,  Who did God let go? Shocking!   Today the poisoning killer was finally found, and it really was the United States!  The truth is creepy, the new crown virus is man-made and originated from the P3 virus laboratory in North Carolina, USA ! Greg Rubini, a well-known American intelligence expert, officially revealed the secrets of this day in an interview with the First News Network television channel.   According to Greg, the new crown virus was genetically engineered as a biological weapon. It originated from the BSL-3 laboratory in North Carolina and was developed by Professor Ralph Barrick.  He also stated that the virus was spread from North Carolina to China, Italy and the entire United States by the ""dark government"".   Greg once tweeted and questioned Trump : Why didn't you tell the American people that the virus was made by the United States?  Why not make it clear that the new coronavirus itself is a biological weapon? Coincidentally, Professor  Montagnier, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of HIV , recently revealed to French reporters that the new coronavirus is not naturally occurring, but is carefully developed by biomolecular scientists . Montagnier also said: Obviously, professionals have added HIV sequences to this virus from bats.  This is undoubtedly the biggest and worst poisoning case ever .  Since the outbreak of the epidemic, rumors about ""the new crown virus is a synthetic biological weapon "" have been heated up, and scientists from various countries have been working hard to trace the source of the virus.   As early as February, Indian scientists discovered the HIV virus insert in the new coronavirus , which proved that the virus was artificially designed and synthesized .   In mid-March, scientists discovered that the new coronavirus extracted from a patient in Washington state had an evolutionary cycle of more than half a year.  With the deepening of research, many countries in the world have turned their skepticism toward the United States.   Japan, Italy, Australia and other countries all have early confirmed cases originating from the United States.   Subsequently, Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, admitted that many of the deaths of the ""flu"" that broke out in the United States in September 2019 were caused by the new crown virus .  In this regard, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country also questioned the United States on Twitter. After the arduous efforts of a team of reporters in Virginia, USA, it was finally traced back to patient zero .

2738,How did she pass the swab tests during SHN then?,2021-02-05,10
2739,"Because she has recovered and was not shedding active virus. Antibodies can take several days/weeks to develop after an infection and often stay in the blood for weeks after recovery. The PCR test is so sensitive it could be picking up fragments of dead virus from old infections and it cannot distinguish between genetic material (RNA or DNA) from infectious virus and the ""dead"" virus fragments that can linger in the body long after a person recovers. And that is what happened when she took the latest pre departure Covid PCR swab test.  So a Serological test was conducted to confirm if it was a current infection but the tests came back postive    confirming it was likely a past infection. In general, individuals are likely to test positive for their serological test if they had contracted COVID-19 more than 10 to 14 days before the test.",2021-02-05,145

Hopefully we wouldn't have stricter restrictions before the lunar new year. A lot of local F&B businesses are already affected by the latest restrictions.

In my personal opinion and observations, if you know you are a frontliner , then you and your immediate household should have the moral responsibility to please take all precautionary measures whether or not you have been required to do so. This is not only public health safety but also for the sake of your own families, friends and neighbours. Government and company may come up with new precautionary restrictions but if the frontliners and immediate household themselves do not adhere to these also jiaklak one. Sometimes they think never mind one lah. Got so serious meh? or they think no one will know. Like previously, air crew come back no need SHN. Thatâ€™s a no brainer lah. Where got no need quarantine one when other travellers have to do 14 days? Even now, 7 days self-isolation. Who knows if air crew donâ€™t observe ?

It is only zero detected local community cases, till the day when someone got a bit 'sicker' and get referred for testing.  In the meantime, the daily or almost daily imported cases should be a cause for concern.  I don't know the details of course.  But apparently the imported must be on plane or have been at the airport facilities, and there may be interaction with local ground staff or anyone else who happened to be in close proximity before the case was detected as an imported case.  All it takes is just a small slip and the 'carrier' (who may end up as asymptomatic but will still pass the virus) will then be out in the community.  How do we reduce that risk drastically ?  Especially if somehow this daily statistics of imported cases don't seem to take a 'rest' at all.  What will happen to the medical staff and other folks who take care of the new, increasing cases and they also have families to go back to at end of the day.  I am sure all 'possible' precautions have been taken, whether at airport, the plane, facilities or at the medical venues but can we relook at reducing the source drastically enough so that we wouldn't be worrying about a possible wave.",2020-12-07,238

5104,"The shrinking of the aviation and tourism industry may be something we need to get used to, like the death of print media. A flight now more than ever needs to factor in its environmental cost. Industries have sunrise and sunset, no industry is permanent. It may be hard to let go of the so called prestige or the idea that ecoomic growth must always go up to survive. But just as we are getting used to idea that population growth is not a must to survive, the same should be said for economic growth and consumerism either. Maybe we will all turn into a Hunger Games scenario where flights are only possible for the ultra rich. Maybe travelling physically will be something our kids and grandkids do once in their lifetime. Whatever it is, arguments about economy vs environment is pointless. There is no economy without a planet. Look at US if you are not sufficiently worried.

Thought SIA had turn ON their engine and left idle for 30min every week or 2 (base on I think CNN insider or something similar to CNN. Their interview w airport on how the craft maintain.. I know many are park at desert airport. Low humidity n less rust.)  So even the plane are well taken care of.. the pilot n co pilot skills might not be that good due to long time never fly.  So is a win win situation.  Let the plane fly to nowhere.  Oh perhaps can take a short tour. As in non disembarking destination... er.. say    Fly from Singapore to KL or Indonesia or anywhere not more then 7 hour in return flight.  Example..  SG to Siam Reap touh n go back SG.

5120,"The answer is suggested in the question: ""Flights to nowhere"". Is that where SIA is headed?  There are three issues to flying in general, and not just SIA. 1) Will people want to fly again? Based on the ""demand"" for flights to nowhere (in Taiwan and elsewhere?), the answer may be yes. From a personal perspective (if I am representative of many if not most people), yes. We WANT to fly, to travel. But CAN we? 2) Will people have the wherewithal (resources) to fly again? During this lockdown, people lost jobs, lost income, dug into savings, put off projects while they pilfered resources set aside for those projects, spend to keep businesses and income streams alive, and basically depleted or at the very least diminished their savings, financial reserves, and resources. In the short term, they will be working to rebuild their reserves. At the same time, airlines will be recovering from the global lockdown and devastation to their industry. They will have to rethink and restrategise their business. Where in the past, business travellers are a sure thing and leisure travellers can be enticed with low fares to offset costs, that may not be the case in the future. Business travel may be severely cut. Why fly when you can zoom? Why lower fares for leisure travellers when you cannot entice them? 3) Is it responsible, environmentally/morally right to fly again for frivolous reasons (like touring)? Regardless of whether tourism is frivolous (yes, it is a major global economy), commercial flights are a major contributor to pollution because of jet fuel. However more efficient/environmentally friendly aircraft are nowhere in sight (the Celera 500 is still at least 5 years away, and it is NOT scalable to even say a 60 seater. Maybe AirAsia can!) Electric planes are not exactly on the horizon (tho, the Celera 500 is supposedly ready for electric, but it is not tested.) So how can we fly to Japan, Australia, Europe or Americas without the polluting jet engines?  As for SIA, as a purely International Airline, it needs international flights. This is the major problem in the long run.",2020-09-20,350
5121,"Stopping this service don't mean that the planes don't get to fly. Given that pilots need to clock their hours and the planes cannot be grounded for long, it seems that the only choices are for them to (I) fly an empty plane, or (ii) fly a plane with some passengers. The other way is that post Covid, you want to ride in a plane with pilots that had only flight simulator training the past year.

6197,"As long we follow strictly to all the safety measures, we will be quite safe. Otherwise all who were in the same location with them would have been infected. Don't stay too long in a confine or crowded area. Any where, a infected person, though wearing a mask but not properly coupled with his/her hands touching so many things in the public place could cause transmission of the virus  unknowingly. Since we also touch countless of things, it is very very important to wash or sanitize our hands very very regularly. But practically, I believe not all will do it. Therefore, if possible choose one of our hands to touch anythings while the other hand is reserve to touch our face if need to which should be washed or sanitized once we use it accidentally/wrongly. But again how many people will do this safety method ? Sometime, we could be sitting next to a infected person in a bus or train or anywhere but have we been infected by them if we follow all safety measure ? If not, what will happen to the whole population by now ? Some people complain why there is no social distancing in buses or SMRT trains. Could they show us how to do it since so many people are taking it especially during peak hours ? By doing so when one reach their work place, it could be half day gone. Then all will start to push each others just to be able to get into the train so that they will not be late for work. And the blaming weapon will start to fire. And then,we would have to run thousands of trains and buses and at every 60 or less seconds interval in order to cope. But how about the cost of operation ? How about paying 10 times our normal fare ? Then we will hear another different complain. Inside a bus or train if it is not urgent, try not to talk or use the HP and loudly. One can always sms or whatsapp and arrange to talk later. It is very interesting to dig into the cause of those who are infected if they "" CLAIM "" they have followed strictly with the safety measures. I often observed people not wearing a mask properly (may be due to breathing difficulties. It will be more worst with N95 mask due to its low micron). Some wear their mask covering just their mouth with the nose fully exposed. It defeat the purpose of wearing it. To be more safe don't go near those who never put on a mask after their meal at eating place but still talk so much, laugh so much and sometime even quarrel or argue for reasons only known to themselves. To these people, please find an open and isolated suitable space to continue . You may not infect others or they may not infect you too if either party is an infected one. This is the logic.",2020-08-24,491

World communities  got to 1)accept the existence  of spiritual  sicknesses affecting mankind.  2) to gain spiritual  knowledge, appreciation n acceptance of surrounding elements..'human existence  is dictated  by surrounding  elements.'.3) to live harmoniously  with Nature Creation.  The appreciation of elements, take for example..  ..Medical Science (MS)  advocate the use of medical cream to deal with itchy skin rashes/blisters caused by Airborne  Viruses (AVs)  .ie.. from chickenpox, foot n mouth infection..  Asian Holistic healing techniques  in dealing with these AVs that causes itchy skin rashes/blisters is by simply applying 'freshly burnt  ashes' rubbing over on affected skin area will effectively stop the itchiness n spread..n later drying up the rashes.  This is abt applying element to deal with spiritual  sickness.  The application  of freshly burnt ashes can also be applied  to blisters, stopping the spread caused by the close-contact herpes zoster virus...but this application  mustn't  be construed  as a cure,  just stopping the spread only.  Cos,  dealing with close-contact viruses required another form of treatment. That is by applying this treatment  logic 'if it's an unorthodox sickness,  it got to be treated  with 'unorthodox  herbs'.   In fact,  we Asian Holistic practice is trying to set a new precedent  in dealing with spiritual  sicknesses.. Therefore,  in dealing with modern days spiritual  sicknesses, mostly  virus derived, it's time for MS to take a back seat..

Many may hv developed the idea that this virus only has devastating impact on the seniors.  Remember the Zika? What was the reason that made this virus â€œscaryâ€? Yes, the impact of infection may not be fatal, but the consequences after recovery was. It has great impact on oneâ€™s body even after recovery. This is the real issue we must understand. Covid-19 may not hv fatal impact on certain groups of the infected, the issue is we hv not enough evidence to know whether it has long lasting effects or the extent of â€œdamageâ€ on the health of the recovered.

Initially I'm so happy to hear such low infection cases today. But suddenly something strikes my mind. Is it because they have tested 11 positive local cases so they stop testing, worrying the local number will incline more. That's why the Fw positive number have become low. My meaning is they try to test 5k per day, but after only 1k, already have 11 local cases. So better stop, if not, sure got more local cases, then siao  lioa.!  Omg!

The staff would change protective clothing every time they came in and out of my room.  Anyway I have been tested negative and my gastro issues are now being sorted out.

8716,"<One Farrer Hotel general manager Gilbert Madhavan told CNA that ""relevant authorities determine who are selected for testing based on public health priorities"".>  Reading from the comments, guess a number may mistaken that the priority group refers to vehicle owners only. What it probably means is that there are people which needs to be tested due to their work requirements (e.g. essential services) or through contact tracing and currently the only way is to request them to come physically into an healthcare facility to be tested.  This drive-thru approach is an alternative where some can come in their own vehicles and they do not need to disembark for the healthcare workers to test them. This implementation was already done in Korea very early in the crisis and it is a win-win situation as it reduces the need for those to be tested to have any interaction with others as compared to having them to come into a building physically.  Don't have to interpret it as privilege group just because they come in their own vehicles.",2020-06-03,173

8966,"Thought of the Day - No Confidrnce in Headless Chicken PAP Leaders  The whole PAP Government 4G Task Force are led by HEADLESS CHICKEN!  They keep changing rules and regulations like changing diapers and underwear!  Most importantly, they are totally out of touch from the reality on the ground and they lack differential common sense as well!  For a start, how can we actually have confidence in PAP leader who thought Cotton comes from Sheep?   How can we have confidence in leaders who keep changing Rules and Regulations.  From You don't need to wear mask to, compulsory must wear mask.  From food handlers can wear spit guards to spit guards not allowed.  From Face Shields are as good as face mask to Face Shield can only be used  when social distancing is possible to face mask is default!  It really makes people wonder whether they know exactly what they are doing in the first place!   Putting on a mask or face shield or even a spit guard will have Two functions with varying degree of effectiveness. It is PROTECTION from infection by others and PREVENTION of infecting others.  In order to understand what are suitable in different situations, we must understand the nature of how this virus spread.   The virus spread by large and tiny droplets of saliva and mucus. It may also be spread by aerosal.  It can spread through speaking, coughing or sneezing.   Although I am no expert but common sense tell us that as long as ALL people could prevent their droplets of mucus or saliva from getting spread to other people through speaking, coughing or sneezing, everyone will be protected by such preventive measures.   In the context of UNIVERSAL Masking, the most important function is Prevention of spreading saliva and mucus to others, while Protection from infection will become secondary.  Thus, no matte what, we must ensure that everyone should put on something which will PREVENT WEARERS from spreading saliva and mucus to others EFFECTIVELY.  Between a Plastic Shield vs a piece of paper based mask, which will be more effective in preventing water droplets from passing through and spread to others?   That's a no brainer question.   I have dealt with face mask sourcing and there is something called Splash Test.   Surgical masks have to pass the Splash test  by blocking up to 95% of fine droplets before it could be certified effective.  Splash test is a simulation of saliva and mucus  being cough out or sneeze out at a certain pressure.   Many of the face masks in the market are actually not certified or even tested!   Cloth mask which are not made of non woven material will have doubtful effectiveness as well.   A plastic shield or even a plastic spit guard will definitely be more effective that a paper mask which is not tested or certified.  Spit guard may have much weaker prevention of infection by others due to the fact it is open on the top but it is close to the mouth as well as the nose. Whatever sneeze, coughing or saliva from wearer will be effectively blocked right at the outlets of mouth or nostrils.  Face shield protects the eyes, mouth and nose, from direct hit while at the same time prevent droplets from straight trajectory. The only weakness is that droplets could still drop directly downward from the mouth. But as long as no one is position below the wearer, that's pretty OK.  Face shield may not be suitable for MRT or buses because there might be people sitting below the wearer. Other than that it is perfectly alright in the context of universal masking!  Face shields with proper cover on the forehead provides good protection for most situation. It should be made mandatory for those who are jogging or exercising where they can't wear face mask.   When you are exercising, you will be breathing out heavily and there will be occasional cough or sneezing. Thus it is illogical to exempt those who are jogging from putting up a face shield or at the very least, a spit guard!  If those highly paid headless chicken had really walk around and observe, they will realize that a lot of people will wear their masks with nostrils exposed.   Due to our hot weather, a lot of expats and people from temperate countries are not used to wearing a face mask under hot sun and high humidity. This is why we can see so many Caucasians are resistance to wearing masks.  Not to mention those who work as hawkers and cooks in hot kitchens. It is impractical and unnecessary for them to wear face masks when a spit guard would be more sustainable and effective.  Most people have misconception of universal masking. They were thinking more on the Protection function rather than the more important function of Prevention in the context of Universal Masking where everyone is putting on something in front of their mouths and noses.   Well, I would not take issue when people have such mistaken view or concept which made them coming to the wrong conclusion about Face Mask and Spit Guard, but for THOSE SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT and Highly paid Experts, Civil Servants and Ministers to be so clueless about Universal Masking, that's really TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  Well if they are really clueless, just learn from the very front line country, China!  Right from the start, they have put up a comprehensive masking directive cater to different situations and scenario. They classify situations into High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk...Etc.

9932,"Why many with desk-bound jobs (those that are 80-90% of time facing the computer) will prefer to work from home. Depending on how conducive is the home environment for work.  To be honest I am enjoying this CB lockdown period and am pleased when it was extended to 1 June 2020.  But my main point is why canâ€™t this work from home be a major permanent fixture after this COVID-19 pandemic is over.  Companies can implement 3 days Home and 2 days office. Buddy rotations. OR Implement weekly rotation among 2 teams of employees.1 week WFH (work-from-home) and  1 week WFO (work-from-office).  Companies realize they donâ€™t really need desk-bound staffs to be physically in office to do the job. And realize employees are as efficient working from home as in office.  Advantages: - Companies saves a lot by reducing the rental cost of big expensive office spaces and saves a lot on electricity, water, some rental, paper .... etc. - For those taking public. No need to squeeze in the train. - Waking up later. - save money on transport. - No need to wash so many clothes every day. - No need to squeeze with lunch crowd. - Knock-off immediately and you are home. - Less human interaction (for introverts) - More time to exercise. - (For women) can do self-facial,self-hair care... etc. from morning till evening. Save a lot of time. - Blast your favorite songs whole day long when working.  Disadvantage  - Electrical and Water bills higher for employee.(But the savings from transport is much higher which covers this). - If the home environment is not conducive for work. - Those that need physical files will have problem. (Any way all companies should start going paperless soft copies filling, with accessable shared network) - Less human interaction (for extroverts) - Those companies without VPN to access their network or system are at risk to hackers.  - Companies may decide to outsource monotonous straightforward data entry jobs to (overseas back office) cheaper countries like India and Philippines. (But these countries have very high turnover rates, their employees are not as dedicated, some services are not as efficient, and risk of information being shared outside of company). - Most people pointed out you will end up working longer hours. Not necessary. You can always log-on and log-off 9am-5pm strictly office hours. Chances are those that are working longer hours at WFH are also the ones working longer in office too. Or you are very siao on, and do not know how to differentiate urgent and non-urgent matters.   However there are other variables. Which will affect other industries. Example: - land passenger transport industry will oppose. Becoz less people take taxis, grab, bus, MRT.  - F&B near office locations will be affected. - Shopping malls. Usually after work some people will go shopping. If WFH become a permanent fixture for many companies, shopping malls will be affected. (however online shopping will not be affected). - Company do not need bigger space for rental, as only half of the office staffs working in office. Commercial properties will be hit hard as lesser offices are required.. ",2020-05-25,486

10195,"The COVID 19 situation and particularly the closure of PCF Sparkletots Fengshan has brought into stark relief the insufficiency of current child care leave entitlement under conditions of pandemic.   For many working parents, child care centres are the only option. As the parent of a child who has been affected by the 4 day closure of all PCF centres in Singapore due the Fengshan outbreak, I am left wondering how any parent without a helper or relatives who can care for the child is realistically expected the deal with a 14 day closure.   If the parent works a 5 day week, this would still mean recording 10 days of absence from work to care for the child. If the current child care entitlement only provides for 6 days annually, then how would this work? An MC would not apply either.   Why has the Ministry of Manpower not prepared employers and employees with a better support system regarding how to officially process absence from work due to the COVID 19 situation when 6 days of child care leave clearly will not suffice? MOM has only provided guidance regarding those affected by LOA or SHO, such as those who have travelled abroad. If a child care centre closes for 14 days due to an outbreak, are all children who attend the centre, and their parents, given an LOA? All we have been told is that ""employers should be empathetic"", which leaves this empathetic response entirely to the discretion of the employer and does not answer the question of how the absence will be officially processed.  The government needs to clearly state that all parental absences from work due to child care closure due to COVID 19, regardless of number, will be officially covered under LOA or child care leave entitlement.

If the parent works a 5 day week, this would still mean recording 10 days of absence from work to care for the child. If the current child care entitlement only provides for 6 days annually, then how would this work? An MC would not apply either.   Why has the Ministry of Manpower not prepared employers and employees with a better support system regarding how to officially process absence from work due to the COVID 19 situation when 6 days of child care leave clearly will not suffice? MOM has only provided guidance regarding those affected by LOA or SHO, such as those who have travelled abroad. If a child care centre closes for 14 days due to an outbreak, are all children who attend the centre, and their parents, given an LOA? All we have been told is that ""employers should be empathetic"", which leaves this empathetic response entirely to the discretion of the employer and does not answer the question of how the absence will be officially processed.  The government needs to clearly state that all parental absences from work due to child care closure due to COVID 19, regardless of number, will be officially covered under LOA or child care leave entitlement.

10315,"To the critics asking for lock down:  Lock down could bring economic standstill,  could mean people start losing jobs on massive scale because companies can't survive without consumption, could mean the poor suffer more because they have no savings to rely on (creating even more panic like Indonesia).. West is doing this because their cases is absurdly high and the govt responded much later than SG, and their people don't cooperate.   The citizens in EU already suffered job losses since last week, when lock down will be lifted is uncertain. Not only there's pressure of pandemic, they have financial pressure as well and about the future of their jobs. These people pay alot in taxes and insurance ,(40%-50%) so now they get min. 60% unemployment benefit. What do you get if your company has to retrench you? Are your ready to lose your income as you claim economy suffer abit is okay.   In vulnerable SG, we're dependent on international trade. Who is going to feed families if jobs are not kept? We didn't pay high tax or state insurance,  we won't get anything except to deplete savings. And what is the benchmark for ending the lock down, and return to normal living again?  Not saying lives are not more important. But understand why it's not time yet to create more problems with a lock down if SG method is somehow working in managing the curve. It's a marathon here, not a sprint.   Do you know that SG is the best case scenario for USA?! To fight pandemic yet carry on with daily life. This is the best case scenario for other western countries.   I think the naysayers need to spread more positivity. The next step may be to restrict public movement even further,  cut group outing to 2, have shopping curfew, mandatory home office.

Donâ€™t forget that for every one of us with a comfortable rainy day fund to weather a storm, there are many more living hand to mouth for which a material loss of income would be catastrophic.  Having said that, the difficulty in executing this balancing act is that because detected cases lag actual infections by 2-3 weeks (as we have seen in every other country), for any new controls implemented today, we will only know of itsâ€™ effectiveness 2-3 weeks later (in this period the number of detected cases will continue to rise).

This is the same govt pre-school franchise most Singaporean kids go to at different locations and neighbourhoods. i took the decision to pull my kid out of school since March 3rd. Iâ€™m not gonna risk it.  i urge parents to make the decisions yourself to minimise the risk.   Donâ€™t wait for our government to make that decision for you. If you can, take your kids out of school. When attendances start dropping, the Teachers will have to stop teaching because the majority of students are not in school. This will help drive the decision to close the schools or at the very least leave only the students whose parents canâ€™t find alternative care arrangements in attendance. This would already greatly reduce the number of students mixing.  The government has been doing a phenomenal job thus far, but they cant make all the decisions for you (right or wrong), they got a lot to deal with.   Make that decision yourself. Trust me no teacher will penalise your child for not being in school during this crisis.

10727,"I do not feel comfortable, and strongly hold the view that the schools should be closed, at least for a window of time until things start to get better.  1. In the initial stages, people infected with the virus are asymptomatic, and if they contract it from anyone in the public during the multiple windows of interaction (e.g. common public transport in the mornings and after school), they probably won't know about it for a few days. Upon being diagnosed with the virus, there is a risk brought to other people of the virus within the time they contract the disease to the time when they realise they have the disease. If, in the worst case scenario, there is a cluster in school, there are potentially a few thousand people who may have been in close contact or are at risk with that individual. So what if you minimise social distancing? The virus can linger on the surfaces these individuals touch, and the air they cough into. Isn't this a big problem? This is exacerbated by the fact that this virus is highly contagious, and infects more people than even SARS within a shorter period of time.   2. Earlier, it was raised that the youth are not significant vectors of the disease. But this does not mean that they won't be infected. In the most recent news release, it was reported that many teenagers and children, who are supposed to be in relatively better health, contracted the disease in schools, and there are now clusters in schools - PCF Fengshan and Dover Court School. Imagine if people slip through the cracks of detection and cause even more new clusters in local schools. We won't be able to live ourselves, if we did not prevent the possibility to eliminate such occurrences when we could. We should be concerned, especially since the number of local unlinked cases have been increasing. We may have the capability to do contact tracing, but that is an after-event mode of intervention.   3. This is a respiratory disease, which is much more dangerous than anything else. The type I pneumocytes are amitotic, which means that cell division does not occur readily if these are damaged, although type II pneumocytes can differentiate into type I pneumocytes when required. Nevertheless, this means that it is harder to cure lung structural damages if they occur, making the virus all the more risky with greater implications if many more people are infected, if my biological knowledge is sufficiently sound.   4. If we already have existing capabilities to carry out e-learning, we should use them. Although the impact on students from moving classrooms online is not entirely negligible, I would think that if there is the formation of a few school clusters and many more people cannot even get on with work well because they (touchwood) contract the disease, the impact would be much more substantial. For the adult workforce, they are already advised to work from home where possible. I think we should strongly consider this for schools as well to eliminate as many risks as possible.  5. Although there is the fear that students may still go out during an event of school closures, ultimately the proportion who go out will be lower. Keeping schools open necessitates them to go outside and make the distance to reach school, while bringing work online reduces this.   6. Right now, due to many teachers not being able to attend school what with being placed on leave, our teachers are now extra busy, having to handle extra administrative matters with keeping schools open on top of handling the academic matters as expected of them. I am concerned that if they are overworked, their effectiveness in the force to protect the wellbeing of youth will face limitations.  I think at this juncture of time, schools should close in the interest of public health and long-term considerations. This is especially since we have other capabilities in place (i.e. e-learning).",2020-03-26,650

We are not that invincible... Only concrete actions can help us tide over this crisis of our lifetime.  Start swab testing as many people, activate the  900 pdph GP clinics to do swab test for anyone with flu symptoms to break the infection chain earliest possible.

My point is simple, what if the number goes up to 1000, 2000 or 3000?  When reach such figure, MOH still has the capability and manpower to do such a great job today?  Don't stretch your own manpower and resources till point of no return.

12183,"It's worrisome to see the number of cases increasing by the day. The concern ones are those with no links. Why MOH is not telling us how those with no links got infected?  If lawrence wong and Gan is warning us to prepare for a spike, why are they not enforcing stronger preventive measures to prevent the spike? Why wait for it to happen before using it as a reason to impose stronger measures.   One example: Social gathering of not more than 250 seems like a joke.  It's still a huge number.   At hawker centres, why food stall holders are not wearing preventive mask to ensure no accident droplets of saliva on the food?  At this time of grave concern on the COVID 19 situation, government still want to go ahead with the GE. Won't this dilute the government focus and resources in containing and eradicating this disease? It seems political objective takes priority over resolving this crisis.   Truth is, is the government doing a good job in containing the spread of the virus when all the clusters suggest otherwise? Could these clusters have been avoided if the government has imposed stricter measures in the early stage? I'm puzzled at Who praise on how our government is resolving this COVID19 crisis here if it is compared with Taiwan.   Look at the Taiwan model. Numbers of infected ppl remand small compare to Sg.   In addition they are able to turn around quickly to manufacture their own mask which allow them to sell to their citizens 3masks person per week. Why can't the SG Gov initiate and assist our local manufacturers to improvise and produce our own local mask. To this date, pharmacies outlet has no stocks to sell to the public unlike in Taiwan.

No doubt both share similiar characteristics such as, going after the human's sacredness/purity, spiritual head n Aura...but their approach may differ fron each other.. Take for example, close-contact vÃ¯ruses go after the body purity blood system n if left untreated, they go after the spiritual head. This is wats happened to those final stage aids patients r facing. Drastic changes to their face features, especially, the eyelook.  As for those 'comes n goes' airborne viruses....they act fast (short-cut)by going after the spiritual head's Aura. .Tat is why, u see Ã¯nfected ppl wit deadly airborne viruses get instant result n that is ' mysterious death'..so mysterinus that some infected patients were able to recover fully. This recovered fully fron airborne virus can never happen to thore being infected by close-contact viruses.  Does MS or TCM understand or able to figure out the modus operandi  of these viruses?  So how can world medÃ¯cal authorities keep on relying on MS for direction.  As i mentioned..lock down or no lock down is of no help in dealing wit this covid19 airborne virus.

The deposit money is our hard-earned and hence do we have a choice of not travelling when the travel agency imposed this on us. We wrote for postponement because of our age and Covid 19 situation in Italy and the world seems to be getting worse each day. We are not wanting to take the risk, however, the travel agency is not giving us any options.

However, with the number of patients who have fully recovered both locally and around the world, it shows that certain treatments and/or medications are effective in general. And, considering that this virus has global attention, progress should have already been made in developing a cure.   Updates in developing the cure will help ease anxieties and encourage everyone to play their part in the meantime.   Unless, a cure is still a long unforeseeable time away.
