This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

4386,5308,"Every wrong decision cost lives. Be wise. Jogging is not an essential activity. There are so many exercises to do indoors. Why must insist on jogging and joggers expel so much droplets when they run. If they have the virus how? Also they draw in a lot of oxygen too.

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time.

Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time.

If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time.

If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3.

If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3.

Please bring spare dry masks if you run longer so you can use the fresh one when you enter the lifts and public area.   For some of us exercise is key to being healthy.  Some of us have problems with some of member of the house but can‚Äôt afford to get another housing for example they do need some space ...

If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3.

11120,1547,"Thought of the Day - No Confidrnce in Headless Chicken PAP Leaders  The whole PAP Government 4G Task Force are led by HEADLESS CHICKEN!  They keep changing rules and regulations like changing diapers and underwear!  Most importantly, they are totally out of touch from the reality on the ground and they lack differential common sense as well!  For a start, how can we actually have confidence in PAP leader who thought Cotton comes from Sheep?   How can we have confidence in leaders who keep changing Rules and Regulations.  From You don't need to wear mask to, compulsory must wear mask.  From food handlers can wear spit guards to spit guards not allowed.  From Face Shields are as good as face mask to Face Shield can only be used  when social distancing is possible to face mask is default!  It really makes people wonder whether they know exactly what they are doing in the first place!   Putting on a mask or face shield or even a spit guard will have Two functions with varying degree of effectiveness. It is PROTECTION from infection by others and PREVENTION of infecting others.  In order to understand what are suitable in different situations, we must understand the nature of how this virus spread.   The virus spread by large and tiny droplets of saliva and mucus. It may also be spread by aerosal.  It can spread through speaking, coughing or sneezing.   Although I am no expert but common sense tell us that as long as ALL people could prevent their droplets of mucus or saliva from getting spread to other people through speaking, coughing or sneezing, everyone will be protected by such preventive measures.   In the context of UNIVERSAL Masking, the most important function is Prevention of spreading saliva and mucus to others, while Protection from infection will become secondary.  Thus, no matte what, we must ensure that everyone should put on something which will PREVENT WEARERS from spreading saliva and mucus to others EFFECTIVELY.  Between a Plastic Shield vs a piece of paper based mask, which will be more effective in preventing water droplets from passing through and spread to others?   That's a no brainer question.   I have dealt with face mask sourcing and there is something called Splash Test.   Surgical masks have to pass the Splash test  by blocking up to 95% of fine droplets before it could be certified effective.  Splash test is a simulation of saliva and mucus  being cough out or sneeze out at a certain pressure.   Many of the face masks in the market are actually not certified or even tested!   Cloth mask which are not made of non woven material will have doubtful effectiveness as well.   A plastic shield or even a plastic spit guard will definitely be more effective that a paper mask which is not tested or certified.  Spit guard may have much weaker prevention of infection by others due to the fact it is open on the top but it is close to the mouth as well as the nose. Whatever sneeze, coughing or saliva from wearer will be effectively blocked right at the outlets of mouth or nostrils.  Face shield protects the eyes, mouth and nose, from direct hit while at the same time prevent droplets from straight trajectory. The only weakness is that droplets could still drop directly downward from the mouth. But as long as no one is position below the wearer, that's pretty OK.  Face shield may not be suitable for MRT or buses because there might be people sitting below the wearer. Other than that it is perfectly alright in the context of universal masking!  Face shields with proper cover on the forehead provides good protection for most situation. It should be made mandatory for those who are jogging or exercising where they can't wear face mask.   When you are exercising, you will be breathing out heavily and there will be occasional cough or sneezing. Thus it is illogical to exempt those who are jogging from putting up a face shield or at the very least, a spit guard!  If those highly paid headless chicken had really walk around and observe, they will realize that a lot of people will wear their masks with nostrils exposed.   Due to our hot weather, a lot of expats and people from temperate countries are not used to wearing a face mask under hot sun and high humidity. This is why we can see so many Caucasians are resistance to wearing masks.  Not to mention those who work as hawkers and cooks in hot kitchens. It is impractical and unnecessary for them to wear face masks when a spit guard would be more sustainable and effective.  Most people have misconception of universal masking. They were thinking more on the Protection function rather than the more important function of Prevention in the context of Universal Masking where everyone is putting on something in front of their mouths and noses.   Well, I would not take issue when people have such mistaken view or concept which made them coming to the wrong conclusion about Face Mask and Spit Guard, but for THOSE SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT and Highly paid Experts, Civil Servants and Ministers to be so clueless about Universal Masking, that's really TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  Well if they are really clueless, just learn from the very front line country, China!  Right from the start, they have put up a comprehensive masking directive cater to different situations and scenario. They classify situations into High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk...Etc.   They differentiate between different types of masks and now, they encourage the use of face shield in practical and pragmatic situations.   How could our HIGHEST PAID Ministers in the world become so mediocre in comparison to the Chinese counterparts who are only paid a fraction of their salary?   How could Singaporeans have any confidence left in PAP leadership if they can't even get such simple things right?",2020-06-01,978

11375,1860,"Thought of the Day - No Confidrnce in Headless Chicken PAP Leaders  The whole PAP Government 4G Task Force are led by HEADLESS CHICKEN!  They keep changing rules and regulations like changing diapers and underwear!  Most importantly, they are totally out of touch from the reality on the ground and they lack differential common sense as well!  For a start, how can we actually have confidence in PAP leader who thought Cotton comes from Sheep?   How can we have confidence in leaders who keep changing Rules and Regulations.  From You don't need to wear mask to, compulsory must wear mask.  From food handlers can wear spit guards to spit guards not allowed.  From Face Shields are as good as face mask to Face Shield can only be used  when social distancing is possible to face mask is default!  It really makes people wonder whether they know exactly what they are doing in the first place!   Putting on a mask or face shield or even a spit guard will have Two functions with varying degree of effectiveness. It is PROTECTION from infection by others and PREVENTION of infecting others.  In order to understand what are suitable in different situations, we must understand the nature of how this virus spread.   The virus spread by large and tiny droplets of saliva and mucus. It may also be spread by aerosal.  It can spread through speaking, coughing or sneezing.   Although I am no expert but common sense tell us that as long as ALL people could prevent their droplets of mucus or saliva from getting spread to other people through speaking, coughing or sneezing, everyone will be protected by such preventive measures.   In the context of UNIVERSAL Masking, the most important function is Prevention of spreading saliva and mucus to others, while Protection from infection will become secondary.  Thus, no matte what, we must ensure that everyone should put on something which will PREVENT WEARERS from spreading saliva and mucus to others EFFECTIVELY.  Between a Plastic Shield vs a piece of paper based mask, which will be more effective in preventing water droplets from passing through and spread to others?   That's a no brainer question.   I have dealt with face mask sourcing and there is something called Splash Test.   Surgical masks have to pass the Splash test  by blocking up to 95% of fine droplets before it could be certified effective.  Splash test is a simulation of saliva and mucus  being cough out or sneeze out at a certain pressure.   Many of the face masks in the market are actually not certified or even tested!   Cloth mask which are not made of non woven material will have doubtful effectiveness as well.   A plastic shield or even a plastic spit guard will definitely be more effective that a paper mask which is not tested or certified.  Spit guard may have much weaker prevention of infection by others due to the fact it is open on the top but it is close to the mouth as well as the nose. Whatever sneeze, coughing or saliva from wearer will be effectively blocked right at the outlets of mouth or nostrils.  Face shield protects the eyes, mouth and nose, from direct hit while at the same time prevent droplets from straight trajectory. The only weakness is that droplets could still drop directly downward from the mouth. But as long as no one is position below the wearer, that's pretty OK.  Face shield may not be suitable for MRT or buses because there might be people sitting below the wearer. Other than that it is perfectly alright in the context of universal masking!  Face shields with proper cover on the forehead provides good protection for most situation. It should be made mandatory for those who are jogging or exercising where they can't wear face mask.   When you are exercising, you will be breathing out heavily and there will be occasional cough or sneezing. Thus it is illogical to exempt those who are jogging from putting up a face shield or at the very least, a spit guard!  If those highly paid headless chicken had really walk around and observe, they will realize that a lot of people will wear their masks with nostrils exposed.   Due to our hot weather, a lot of expats and people from temperate countries are not used to wearing a face mask under hot sun and high humidity. This is why we can see so many Caucasians are resistance to wearing masks.  Not to mention those who work as hawkers and cooks in hot kitchens. It is impractical and unnecessary for them to wear face masks when a spit guard would be more sustainable and effective.  Most people have misconception of universal masking. They were thinking more on the Protection function rather than the more important function of Prevention in the context of Universal Masking where everyone is putting on something in front of their mouths and noses.   Well, I would not take issue when people have such mistaken view or concept which made them coming to the wrong conclusion about Face Mask and Spit Guard, but for THOSE SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT and Highly paid Experts, Civil Servants and Ministers to be so clueless about Universal Masking, that's really TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  Well if they are really clueless, just learn from the very front line country, China!  Right from the start, they have put up a comprehensive masking directive cater to different situations and scenario. They classify situations into High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk...Etc.   They differentiate between different types of masks and now, they encourage the use of face shield in practical and pragmatic situations.   How could our HIGHEST PAID Ministers in the world become so mediocre in comparison to the Chinese counterparts who are only paid a fraction of their salary?   How could Singaporeans have any confidence left in PAP leadership if they can't even get such simple things right?",2020-06-01,978

11630,2173,"Thought of the Day - No Confidrnce in Headless Chicken PAP Leaders  The whole PAP Government 4G Task Force are led by HEADLESS CHICKEN!  They keep changing rules and regulations like changing diapers and underwear!  Most importantly, they are totally out of touch from the reality on the ground and they lack differential common sense as well!  For a start, how can we actually have confidence in PAP leader who thought Cotton comes from Sheep?   How can we have confidence in leaders who keep changing Rules and Regulations.  From You don't need to wear mask to, compulsory must wear mask.  From food handlers can wear spit guards to spit guards not allowed.  From Face Shields are as good as face mask to Face Shield can only be used  when social distancing is possible to face mask is default!  It really makes people wonder whether they know exactly what they are doing in the first place!   Putting on a mask or face shield or even a spit guard will have Two functions with varying degree of effectiveness. It is PROTECTION from infection by others and PREVENTION of infecting others.  In order to understand what are suitable in different situations, we must understand the nature of how this virus spread.   The virus spread by large and tiny droplets of saliva and mucus. It may also be spread by aerosal.  It can spread through speaking, coughing or sneezing.   Although I am no expert but common sense tell us that as long as ALL people could prevent their droplets of mucus or saliva from getting spread to other people through speaking, coughing or sneezing, everyone will be protected by such preventive measures.   In the context of UNIVERSAL Masking, the most important function is Prevention of spreading saliva and mucus to others, while Protection from infection will become secondary.  Thus, no matte what, we must ensure that everyone should put on something which will PREVENT WEARERS from spreading saliva and mucus to others EFFECTIVELY.  Between a Plastic Shield vs a piece of paper based mask, which will be more effective in preventing water droplets from passing through and spread to others?   That's a no brainer question.   I have dealt with face mask sourcing and there is something called Splash Test.   Surgical masks have to pass the Splash test  by blocking up to 95% of fine droplets before it could be certified effective.  Splash test is a simulation of saliva and mucus  being cough out or sneeze out at a certain pressure.   Many of the face masks in the market are actually not certified or even tested!   Cloth mask which are not made of non woven material will have doubtful effectiveness as well.   A plastic shield or even a plastic spit guard will definitely be more effective that a paper mask which is not tested or certified.  Spit guard may have much weaker prevention of infection by others due to the fact it is open on the top but it is close to the mouth as well as the nose. Whatever sneeze, coughing or saliva from wearer will be effectively blocked right at the outlets of mouth or nostrils.  Face shield protects the eyes, mouth and nose, from direct hit while at the same time prevent droplets from straight trajectory. The only weakness is that droplets could still drop directly downward from the mouth. But as long as no one is position below the wearer, that's pretty OK.  Face shield may not be suitable for MRT or buses because there might be people sitting below the wearer. Other than that it is perfectly alright in the context of universal masking!  Face shields with proper cover on the forehead provides good protection for most situation. It should be made mandatory for those who are jogging or exercising where they can't wear face mask.   When you are exercising, you will be breathing out heavily and there will be occasional cough or sneezing. Thus it is illogical to exempt those who are jogging from putting up a face shield or at the very least, a spit guard!  If those highly paid headless chicken had really walk around and observe, they will realize that a lot of people will wear their masks with nostrils exposed.   Due to our hot weather, a lot of expats and people from temperate countries are not used to wearing a face mask under hot sun and high humidity. This is why we can see so many Caucasians are resistance to wearing masks.  Not to mention those who work as hawkers and cooks in hot kitchens. It is impractical and unnecessary for them to wear face masks when a spit guard would be more sustainable and effective.  Most people have misconception of universal masking. They were thinking more on the Protection function rather than the more important function of Prevention in the context of Universal Masking where everyone is putting on something in front of their mouths and noses.   Well, I would not take issue when people have such mistaken view or concept which made them coming to the wrong conclusion about Face Mask and Spit Guard, but for THOSE SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT and Highly paid Experts, Civil Servants and Ministers to be so clueless about Universal Masking, that's really TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  Well if they are really clueless, just learn from the very front line country, China!  Right from the start, they have put up a comprehensive masking directive cater to different situations and scenario. They classify situations into High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk...Etc.   They differentiate between different types of masks and now, they encourage the use of face shield in practical and pragmatic situations.   How could our HIGHEST PAID Ministers in the world become so mediocre in comparison to the Chinese counterparts who are only paid a fraction of their salary?   How could Singaporeans have any confidence left in PAP leadership if they can't even get such simple things right?",2020-06-01,978

11885,2486,"Thought of the Day - No Confidrnce in Headless Chicken PAP Leaders  The whole PAP Government 4G Task Force are led by HEADLESS CHICKEN!  They keep changing rules and regulations like changing diapers and underwear!  Most importantly, they are totally out of touch from the reality on the ground and they lack differential common sense as well!  For a start, how can we actually have confidence in PAP leader who thought Cotton comes from Sheep?   How can we have confidence in leaders who keep changing Rules and Regulations.  From You don't need to wear mask to, compulsory must wear mask.  From food handlers can wear spit guards to spit guards not allowed.  From Face Shields are as good as face mask to Face Shield can only be used  when social distancing is possible to face mask is default!  It really makes people wonder whether they know exactly what they are doing in the first place!   Putting on a mask or face shield or even a spit guard will have Two functions with varying degree of effectiveness. It is PROTECTION from infection by others and PREVENTION of infecting others.  In order to understand what are suitable in different situations, we must understand the nature of how this virus spread.   The virus spread by large and tiny droplets of saliva and mucus. It may also be spread by aerosal.  It can spread through speaking, coughing or sneezing.   Although I am no expert but common sense tell us that as long as ALL people could prevent their droplets of mucus or saliva from getting spread to other people through speaking, coughing or sneezing, everyone will be protected by such preventive measures.   In the context of UNIVERSAL Masking, the most important function is Prevention of spreading saliva and mucus to others, while Protection from infection will become secondary.  Thus, no matte what, we must ensure that everyone should put on something which will PREVENT WEARERS from spreading saliva and mucus to others EFFECTIVELY.  Between a Plastic Shield vs a piece of paper based mask, which will be more effective in preventing water droplets from passing through and spread to others?   That's a no brainer question.   I have dealt with face mask sourcing and there is something called Splash Test.   Surgical masks have to pass the Splash test  by blocking up to 95% of fine droplets before it could be certified effective.  Splash test is a simulation of saliva and mucus  being cough out or sneeze out at a certain pressure.   Many of the face masks in the market are actually not certified or even tested!   Cloth mask which are not made of non woven material will have doubtful effectiveness as well.   A plastic shield or even a plastic spit guard will definitely be more effective that a paper mask which is not tested or certified.  Spit guard may have much weaker prevention of infection by others due to the fact it is open on the top but it is close to the mouth as well as the nose. Whatever sneeze, coughing or saliva from wearer will be effectively blocked right at the outlets of mouth or nostrils.  Face shield protects the eyes, mouth and nose, from direct hit while at the same time prevent droplets from straight trajectory. The only weakness is that droplets could still drop directly downward from the mouth. But as long as no one is position below the wearer, that's pretty OK.  Face shield may not be suitable for MRT or buses because there might be people sitting below the wearer. Other than that it is perfectly alright in the context of universal masking!  Face shields with proper cover on the forehead provides good protection for most situation. It should be made mandatory for those who are jogging or exercising where they can't wear face mask.   When you are exercising, you will be breathing out heavily and there will be occasional cough or sneezing. Thus it is illogical to exempt those who are jogging from putting up a face shield or at the very least, a spit guard!  If those highly paid headless chicken had really walk around and observe, they will realize that a lot of people will wear their masks with nostrils exposed.   Due to our hot weather, a lot of expats and people from temperate countries are not used to wearing a face mask under hot sun and high humidity. This is why we can see so many Caucasians are resistance to wearing masks.  Not to mention those who work as hawkers and cooks in hot kitchens. It is impractical and unnecessary for them to wear face masks when a spit guard would be more sustainable and effective.  Most people have misconception of universal masking. They were thinking more on the Protection function rather than the more important function of Prevention in the context of Universal Masking where everyone is putting on something in front of their mouths and noses.   Well, I would not take issue when people have such mistaken view or concept which made them coming to the wrong conclusion about Face Mask and Spit Guard, but for THOSE SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT and Highly paid Experts, Civil Servants and Ministers to be so clueless about Universal Masking, that's really TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  Well if they are really clueless, just learn from the very front line country, China!  Right from the start, they have put up a comprehensive masking directive cater to different situations and scenario. They classify situations into High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk...Etc.   They differentiate between different types of masks and now, they encourage the use of face shield in practical and pragmatic situations.   How could our HIGHEST PAID Ministers in the world become so mediocre in comparison to the Chinese counterparts who are only paid a fraction of their salary?   How could Singaporeans have any confidence left in PAP leadership if they can't even get such simple things right?",2020-06-01,978

12140,2799,"Thought of the Day - No Confidrnce in Headless Chicken PAP Leaders  The whole PAP Government 4G Task Force are led by HEADLESS CHICKEN!  They keep changing rules and regulations like changing diapers and underwear!  Most importantly, they are totally out of touch from the reality on the ground and they lack differential common sense as well!  For a start, how can we actually have confidence in PAP leader who thought Cotton comes from Sheep?   How can we have confidence in leaders who keep changing Rules and Regulations.  From You don't need to wear mask to, compulsory must wear mask.  From food handlers can wear spit guards to spit guards not allowed.  From Face Shields are as good as face mask to Face Shield can only be used  when social distancing is possible to face mask is default!  It really makes people wonder whether they know exactly what they are doing in the first place!   Putting on a mask or face shield or even a spit guard will have Two functions with varying degree of effectiveness. It is PROTECTION from infection by others and PREVENTION of infecting others.  In order to understand what are suitable in different situations, we must understand the nature of how this virus spread.   The virus spread by large and tiny droplets of saliva and mucus. It may also be spread by aerosal.  It can spread through speaking, coughing or sneezing.   Although I am no expert but common sense tell us that as long as ALL people could prevent their droplets of mucus or saliva from getting spread to other people through speaking, coughing or sneezing, everyone will be protected by such preventive measures.   In the context of UNIVERSAL Masking, the most important function is Prevention of spreading saliva and mucus to others, while Protection from infection will become secondary.  Thus, no matte what, we must ensure that everyone should put on something which will PREVENT WEARERS from spreading saliva and mucus to others EFFECTIVELY.  Between a Plastic Shield vs a piece of paper based mask, which will be more effective in preventing water droplets from passing through and spread to others?   That's a no brainer question.   I have dealt with face mask sourcing and there is something called Splash Test.   Surgical masks have to pass the Splash test  by blocking up to 95% of fine droplets before it could be certified effective.  Splash test is a simulation of saliva and mucus  being cough out or sneeze out at a certain pressure.   Many of the face masks in the market are actually not certified or even tested!   Cloth mask which are not made of non woven material will have doubtful effectiveness as well.   A plastic shield or even a plastic spit guard will definitely be more effective that a paper mask which is not tested or certified.  Spit guard may have much weaker prevention of infection by others due to the fact it is open on the top but it is close to the mouth as well as the nose. Whatever sneeze, coughing or saliva from wearer will be effectively blocked right at the outlets of mouth or nostrils.  Face shield protects the eyes, mouth and nose, from direct hit while at the same time prevent droplets from straight trajectory. The only weakness is that droplets could still drop directly downward from the mouth. But as long as no one is position below the wearer, that's pretty OK.  Face shield may not be suitable for MRT or buses because there might be people sitting below the wearer. Other than that it is perfectly alright in the context of universal masking!  Face shields with proper cover on the forehead provides good protection for most situation. It should be made mandatory for those who are jogging or exercising where they can't wear face mask.   When you are exercising, you will be breathing out heavily and there will be occasional cough or sneezing. Thus it is illogical to exempt those who are jogging from putting up a face shield or at the very least, a spit guard!  If those highly paid headless chicken had really walk around and observe, they will realize that a lot of people will wear their masks with nostrils exposed.   Due to our hot weather, a lot of expats and people from temperate countries are not used to wearing a face mask under hot sun and high humidity. This is why we can see so many Caucasians are resistance to wearing masks.  Not to mention those who work as hawkers and cooks in hot kitchens. It is impractical and unnecessary for them to wear face masks when a spit guard would be more sustainable and effective.  Most people have misconception of universal masking. They were thinking more on the Protection function rather than the more important function of Prevention in the context of Universal Masking where everyone is putting on something in front of their mouths and noses.   Well, I would not take issue when people have such mistaken view or concept which made them coming to the wrong conclusion about Face Mask and Spit Guard, but for THOSE SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT and Highly paid Experts, Civil Servants and Ministers to be so clueless about Universal Masking, that's really TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  Well if they are really clueless, just learn from the very front line country, China!  Right from the start, they have put up a comprehensive masking directive cater to different situations and scenario. They classify situations into High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk...Etc.   They differentiate between different types of masks and now, they encourage the use of face shield in practical and pragmatic situations.   How could our HIGHEST PAID Ministers in the world become so mediocre in comparison to the Chinese counterparts who are only paid a fraction of their salary?   How could Singaporeans have any confidence left in PAP leadership if they can't even get such simple things right?",2020-06-01,978

12395,3112,"Thought of the Day - No Confidrnce in Headless Chicken PAP Leaders  The whole PAP Government 4G Task Force are led by HEADLESS CHICKEN!  They keep changing rules and regulations like changing diapers and underwear!  Most importantly, they are totally out of touch from the reality on the ground and they lack differential common sense as well!  For a start, how can we actually have confidence in PAP leader who thought Cotton comes from Sheep?   How can we have confidence in leaders who keep changing Rules and Regulations.  From You don't need to wear mask to, compulsory must wear mask.  From food handlers can wear spit guards to spit guards not allowed.  From Face Shields are as good as face mask to Face Shield can only be used  when social distancing is possible to face mask is default!  It really makes people wonder whether they know exactly what they are doing in the first place!   Putting on a mask or face shield or even a spit guard will have Two functions with varying degree of effectiveness. It is PROTECTION from infection by others and PREVENTION of infecting others.  In order to understand what are suitable in different situations, we must understand the nature of how this virus spread.   The virus spread by large and tiny droplets of saliva and mucus. It may also be spread by aerosal.  It can spread through speaking, coughing or sneezing.   Although I am no expert but common sense tell us that as long as ALL people could prevent their droplets of mucus or saliva from getting spread to other people through speaking, coughing or sneezing, everyone will be protected by such preventive measures.   In the context of UNIVERSAL Masking, the most important function is Prevention of spreading saliva and mucus to others, while Protection from infection will become secondary.  Thus, no matte what, we must ensure that everyone should put on something which will PREVENT WEARERS from spreading saliva and mucus to others EFFECTIVELY.  Between a Plastic Shield vs a piece of paper based mask, which will be more effective in preventing water droplets from passing through and spread to others?   That's a no brainer question.   I have dealt with face mask sourcing and there is something called Splash Test.   Surgical masks have to pass the Splash test  by blocking up to 95% of fine droplets before it could be certified effective.  Splash test is a simulation of saliva and mucus  being cough out or sneeze out at a certain pressure.   Many of the face masks in the market are actually not certified or even tested!   Cloth mask which are not made of non woven material will have doubtful effectiveness as well.   A plastic shield or even a plastic spit guard will definitely be more effective that a paper mask which is not tested or certified.  Spit guard may have much weaker prevention of infection by others due to the fact it is open on the top but it is close to the mouth as well as the nose. Whatever sneeze, coughing or saliva from wearer will be effectively blocked right at the outlets of mouth or nostrils.  Face shield protects the eyes, mouth and nose, from direct hit while at the same time prevent droplets from straight trajectory. The only weakness is that droplets could still drop directly downward from the mouth. But as long as no one is position below the wearer, that's pretty OK.  Face shield may not be suitable for MRT or buses because there might be people sitting below the wearer. Other than that it is perfectly alright in the context of universal masking!  Face shields with proper cover on the forehead provides good protection for most situation. It should be made mandatory for those who are jogging or exercising where they can't wear face mask.   When you are exercising, you will be breathing out heavily and there will be occasional cough or sneezing. Thus it is illogical to exempt those who are jogging from putting up a face shield or at the very least, a spit guard!  If those highly paid headless chicken had really walk around and observe, they will realize that a lot of people will wear their masks with nostrils exposed.   Due to our hot weather, a lot of expats and people from temperate countries are not used to wearing a face mask under hot sun and high humidity. This is why we can see so many Caucasians are resistance to wearing masks.  Not to mention those who work as hawkers and cooks in hot kitchens. It is impractical and unnecessary for them to wear face masks when a spit guard would be more sustainable and effective.  Most people have misconception of universal masking. They were thinking more on the Protection function rather than the more important function of Prevention in the context of Universal Masking where everyone is putting on something in front of their mouths and noses.   Well, I would not take issue when people have such mistaken view or concept which made them coming to the wrong conclusion about Face Mask and Spit Guard, but for THOSE SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT and Highly paid Experts, Civil Servants and Ministers to be so clueless about Universal Masking, that's really TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  Well if they are really clueless, just learn from the very front line country, China!  Right from the start, they have put up a comprehensive masking directive cater to different situations and scenario. They classify situations into High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk...Etc.
