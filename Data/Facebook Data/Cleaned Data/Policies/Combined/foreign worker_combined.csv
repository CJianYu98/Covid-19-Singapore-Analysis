"Hope the authority can consider allowing funeral directors to be vaccinated earlier base on the grounds   1) they are essential workers even during lock down  2) they handle COVID death cases. During the funeral arrangements for such cases, family members of the deceased could be still under SHN or recovered status  3) they mingle with groups of 30 attendees and family members of the deceased daily   4) when they collect bodies from houses maybe die of other causes. Usually this kind of death will not trigger a need to go through swab, so if the deceased is infected with COVID then it will be a risk to funeral directors.  5) serving family members of those on SHN when they comes back from overseas to attend their loved ones funeral  ",8/3/21,123,Foreign Worker,129,4,-11.20093509,22,7,0,1.202304228,0,0,1

"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,11/3/21,479,Foreign Worker,491,4,-11.29594518,91,10,4,-0.091541747,0,1,1

"I have reported a complaint to BCA about FWs at worksites not complying to the covid-19 rules and regulation, namely about wearing of face mask. The mask was not worn and or were worn but under the chin without covering the nose and mouth. This was about a month ago when the dorms started showing re-infected numbers after been declared cleared. Till today, I can still see the same happenings at construction sites. I have been wondering if the lady I spoke to in BCA have reported upwards to her manager or just couldn't be bordered? If she did, what have the manager done about my complain? Took bus 35 from Bedok Mall. This bus passes by a dormitory along Tanah Merah Costal road. Most of the time, I can see FWs standing outside their dorm door without social distancing and without putting on face mask. Occasionally, I can see them walking from 1 door to another and mix socializing.  So, I have expected to see that re-infections in dorms is very likely and high.  A sad encounter... with stupid people in the BCA. I could tell and felt that the lady I spoke to was not interested as she did not even asked for my particulars for me to expect BCA's feedback and actions taken.  Where are the dormitory ambassador to control and ensure proper mask wearing and socializing control in the dorms?  There is no whistle blowing contact to the correct agencies.  Maybe I should take some photos and call the police at the same time to make it an issue.  Talk so much about covid-19 numbers coming from FWs but has it improved?  There is a need to step up control and enforcement in dormitories and worksites.",9/9/20,284,Foreign Worker,290,4,-11.05031839,61,16,10,0.298849386,0,1,1

The test comes back positive for as long as there are tiny shattered parts of the virus left. Correct: Even if the infectious viruses are long dead, a corona test can come back positive, because the PCR method multiplies even a tiny fraction of the viral genetic material enough to be detected.  The PCR test with its extreme sensitivity was initially perfect to find out where the virus could be. But this test cannot identify whether the virus is still alive, i.e. still infectous.""

"There are two parts to this. One is an essential need, and one is not. Essential: the need for foreign workers to send money back to their families. Many locals seem naively unaware that domestic helpers (and other foreign workers) need to get money home to their families frequently. Heck, that's the reason why they come to work here! To get money to send home! This essential need must be allowed, or else their families risk starving back home. And this is not a stretched truth. And that is why you see long snaking queues at said venues. In a nutshell, REMITTENCE. it is the lifeblood of your domestic helper. Govt can work with embassies and remittance businesses to bring the remittance to the worker instead, to prevent hot spots at the usual haunts of ofws. Also, employers and OFWs can explore online remit options where possible. Rates may not be as good, but if for the time being, perhaps the employer can work out something with the helper.  Non essential: some domestic helpers take the chance to fake it and go to said venues to meet their friends. This is a big no. socialising in groups at said venues. This should definitely not be allowed. Same rules apply whether you are a foreign worker domestic helper or a local or expat. The virus is no differentiator of man. We must all follow the phases so that we can make a full recovery to reopen the economy. NO socialising after remittance. Go home.  When the home is also your workplace, it can get unbearable for your helper. For you working at home, to get away from work, you switch off your PC and work mail. How does your helper ""switch off"" when all her bosses are at home? Therefore she needs time to mentally and physically destress and recalibrate. If you don't want to give her rest then please GET A ROBOT instead. And even robots need time to recharge! So, allow your helpers to do some exercise or other activities while following within the rules at all times.  A good employer knows that a good helper is an asset to his/her family. If you take care of the helper, the helper will want to take care of your household.",13/6/20,379,Foreign Worker,381,4,-10.78361083,71,17,12,0.234710534,0,1,1

"FOREIGN WORKERS - clear it's communal spread especially in Bangladeshi/Indian community that's passed on to dorms and other nationalities (China/Malaysia/Myanmar/Sri Lanka), does not matter whether patient zeros from within/outside dorms - cannot and unfair to rely on dorm operators to resolve urgent issue of overcrowding in dormitories, which ST reports to be 1mm foreign workers in 43 dorms  (i) BEDS/ISOLATIONS TENTS IN STADIUMS => see Wuhan - separate foreign workers out from dorms to 35 stadiums, some stadiums with spaced out beds to increase physical distancing, some stadiums with individual tents (from decathlon) to isolate close contacts of confirmed cases => pls consider what Wuhan did, use of rooms in school and stadiums for different kinds of isolations/quarantine  https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-home-quarantine-repeats-mistake-made-in-china-doctors-say  (ii) IMMEDIATE TESTS => HONG KONG & S KOREA - immediate testing of foreign worker on cough, fever or loss of smell/taste, cannot afford to wait potentially 10days for sufficient symptoms necessary for covid-9 test, because (i) still spreads in dorms whilst in isolation, (ii) fast deterioration when symptoms worsen making acute/ICU care likely, (iii) early treatment for faster recovery - early detection help (i) reduce further transmissions, (ii) isolate close contacts and places - Testing at least for fever or loss of sense of smell/taste should be case for general public, given reality of communal transmission / asymptomatic transmission / mild symptoms (such that these people recover without being detected but pass to others, meaning it can go on and on) - CLEAR that early tests for early detection and early treatment is reason why S Korea has low fatalities and now Hong Kong (9Mar HK govmt clinics allowed to swab and ask for tests, on 1 symptom eg cough or fever) has MUCH fewer critical cases, compared to Feb'2020  (iii) MASKS - Give some surgical masks from stockpile to foreign workers first.

"The very fact they consist a small proportion against the entire population and yet yesterday have almost double the infected compared to singaporean locals means one thing. They have not observed and kept the hygiene standards and also not been observing any distancing measures.   The dormitory all allocated to them were almost new and good condition when they moved in. The fact there are cockroaches derive from littering and bad personal maintainence of their personal spaces.  In the Singapore army in BMT we have 10 men to a single bunk room and an entire company of 160 men using a single block. Yet with proper area cleaning we kept it spotless. Toilets are sparkling. On top of that as full time soldiers we had to fufil every single training obligation issued to us.  Instead of complaining about cockroaches and bad hygienic conditions....why not start area cleaning. They are getting a full months pay to do nothing. Spend the time wisely! Hundreds of Singaporeans too live in blocks and dine in local hawker centers with hundreds of people at any time.  My fear is if their girlfriends who may be FDWs go back home with their infection. The entire family she lives with will suffer. This will cause a massive infestation. I pray this day never comes.   I believe the govt policy to quarantine 20,000 is very sound. This is a preventative measure against a mass outbreak amongst millions of local Singaporeans who have stood by Singapore thick and thin and served the nation when she needed us. It’s understandable that many foreigners are here to enjoy the wealth, prosperity and jobs that we are blessed with. However consider the flip side of the coin....assuming there is a war....outbreak....or any disaster....will the very ones who flocked here for jobs stay with us and fight with us or will they be the first ones to board planes and ships out. It’s the sons of this land who will lose the most as we have families and friends here. As a son if this land without question I will fight for her as my love ones are here.

"""Embrace uncertainty,some of the most beautiful things in our lives wont have a title."" I and my husband were meant to be forever but he met another woman at his work place.

But my sister advised me about this great woman who is well known of Love spells, I decided to call her having got her contact from my sister.

"According to MOH, they conduct 3000 tests every day, daily confirmed cases on average are approx. 850 cases, so as a  %, should be about 30%; if at the pace MOH is testing and to test all the 300k migrant workers it would take 3  months to finalise and if the 30% ( a constant) apply on each batch, the time lag between incubation, symptoms and infected in the midst of testing, the asymptomatic carriers and the virus carrier without symptoms ( granted the presence of the carriers and inexorably rising ) will continue to infect the healthy workers we will see new infected cases  grow higher each day and tally at approx 70k by end of 3 months  .  Am I on the right computation.  How long the incumbent authorities are going to isolate the migrant workers in the dorms in cramped quarters with movement control, won't the length of times in sort of movement control would put the mental and emotional health of the migrant workers to test.

The possibility that it can get critical and no loved ones can be with you? When all it takes is to stay home, only buy whats needed, keep a distance and come home immediately. Do the authorities have to detail everything out or even make it more strict to keep people at home? Just because last week they didnt wear a mask and nothing happened doesnt mean it cant this week. To these irresponsible people who are practically demoralizing the authorities, healthcare workers, putting them at more risk, having to chase after you, putting other citizens who want to be responsible at risk, is inappropriate.

"I appreciate the efforts of the joint-ministries task force. A big thank you to all our medical, healthcare & other frontline staff (the police, contact tracing team & researchers etc.) who have helped Singapore in our fight against COVID-19.  The plans to manage the huge dormitory clusters are quite comprehensive but there is something more that can be done to halt the transmission of COVID-19 amongst the dormitory residents. Run more COVID-19 detection tests on all close contacts of current dormitory confirmed cases now, within capacity that our lab team can currently cope & run them now. Because simply confining the dormitory workers in their crammed dormitory will not prevent further COVID-19 transmission amongst the dormitory workers especially if they continue to stay together in the high density crammed conditions, now that we can almost be certain of  asymptomatic carriers who unintentionally infect others as they do not realized they are sick.  The bigger clusters is a result of dormitories having higher density   crammed. Enclosed space and closed proximity has remain the constant theme for transmission. It would be ideal if density at these dormitories are reduced significantly. But even doing so is not enough against insidious spread of COVID-19.  More can be done now to ""actively attack"" the virus transmissions at these dormitories, the top priority now is to identify & isolate any more potential infected carriers especially asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who may not realized they are carrier. Most men(which the bulk of these dormitories workers are, would probably have been more busy with their work at workplaces previously)& will tend to be less fastidious about COVID-19 prevention measures like safe distancing with others in dormitories & enhanced hygiene measures, so health officials may need to come out with programs to educate & emphasize to them the importance of personal hygiene(not touching face without thorough washing of hands with soap & water & after visiting toilets & before meals etc.)in their native languages for any who have difficulty comprehending English. Facilities owners will need to increase frequencies of toilet/bathing area cleaning at these dormitories as well.  With current developments of Singapore's own rapid test kits which we have been sharing with our neighboring countries, this is the time to ramp-up production of these accurate testing kits as there may now be a need to conduct more tests on any potentially infeyuuúcted dormitory  workers for early detection & isolation to prevent an even higher transmission numbers.  Contact Tracing/ Investigation Teams will need to work quickly to establish & identify any previous close contacts of current confirmed cases from the dormitories. We need to quickly mount a larger scale COVID-19 testing on these close contacts of the dormitories' confirmed cases. As many people may appear healthy now but they maybe rapidly infecting others. We need to be able to quickly identify & isolate any such persons from the crowded dormitories.

"This Plannedemic is a hoax, whereby the death rate is just a mere 0.1%-0.3%, much similar to the flu.    Data has shown that the death rates both for overall diseases as well as for the elderly in 2020 are NO DIFFERENT to those recorded for between 2016-2019.   The Biden administration is now coming clean and admitting that the Covid death rates in America for 2020 had been grossly exaggerated (most probably to make Trump look bad); and that the PCR testing should not be used as a diagnostic tool for positive cases.    The AMA also recently advised that Doctors should go ahead to treat patients in their early stage with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine — this, after rigging the results last April that there was no evidence for the effectiveness with the 60+ years old drug, followed by a ban of their sales in the US.    In other words, the whole world had been lied to by those intent on bringing down the world economy, and to oust Trump out of office.  Chief among these culprits :  China for trying to hide the virus while sending thousands of  infected Chinese out into the world, and Fauci of FDA, WHO, as well as the complicit media and corrupted medical staff for blatantly lying about the severity of this virus.

"GOVERNMENT & PARLIAMENT the difference  GOVERNMENT  - run the country  PARLIAMENT  - represent the people - hold the government to account.   We want both a good government and a good Parliament.   For 55 yrs, our Parliament do not have enough parties truly representing the people. Instead majority inside are of the same ruling party, representing not the people, but the PAP.   This means we, the SG voters, have sold ourselves to be slaves (because we sold our Voice) and not master of our collective destiny.   You may argue we have a good government but we don't have a good Parliament. Giving PAP supermajority in parliament is like selling away our birthrights as stakeholders of our SG. Result is you get a SG by PAP, for PAP and not a SG by the People, for the People.   You can have BOTH a good government and a good Parliament.

"Dear PM , sorry but can you make me understand on what is the government plan? Because I go to all the malls in the neighbourhood is always packed with people. All businesses are doing great. Long Q with no social distancing. But people who run business in the city are closing down because you made all the people to work from home . Cannot pay rent because government help only till July. Now the landlord after the retail shops for rental. So no people coming to work. So how can the retailers in the city survive? Since you feel so much for the people and asking them to work from home then I hope you will care for the retail shops and waive the rental till phase 3 .

"Good to see that the situation is under control, and Singapore is starting to reopen the economy.  But the pandemic is not yet over, much effort is still required in passing on the correct information to the public, the community and the foreign workers.  To ensure restaurants can reopen safely, it is a good idea to indicate at the entrance the maximum number of patrons allowed, so that there is no argument.  In Australia, the rule is 1 person per 4sqm.  The restaurant has to further limit the number if there are additional health or safety concerns.  It is encouraging to see the government assisting small businesses to adopt digital payment.  However, to minimise costs for unnecessary subsequent upgrade of equipment, service providers should consider wireless and edge technologies, solar and battery backup power, cybersecurity, etc.  The more the service providers can do to lower adoption and operation costs, the more small businesses will take up the practice, and the more savings flow to the individual consumers.",14/6/20,165,Foreign Worker,167,4,-10.46579139,30,8,0,0.480564478,0,1,1

Moving ahead, how do we be able to cost effectively cope with covid 19 recovery phase and immunity phase.  Your trace tracker can add a step counter to sync with the Health 365, save on your budget and it has a reward effect for those who wear it to win vouchers for hitting 10k steps..  All the sites using the same method or different? What's the cost to recover ratio? What the elements that have the highest recovery? How to lower the cost while maintaining efficiency?  This is not a sprint, more like a marathon. Devil on the detail. Prevention vs detection. Dive in the policies and guideline in social distancing, contact tracing.

However, I hope many of the essential services that are allowed to continue operations should be also revised and reviewed and we should further cut back on movements.   For a start , there are so many essential services concentrated in Changi Airport and as a result a lot of staff movement which includes a significant number of work permit holders. So this is one area where we can scale down as airline frequency is quite Low. Can we consider having Changi airport to close for one month so that we also carry out necessary renovations and upgrade. This is the best time to speed up any infrastructure upgrades when there is no pax movement .   Any flights in the meantime can be operated from Seletar airport if possible.  So we can still have freighter cargo flights operating.   We need to consider cutting down on essential services movement as much as possible. Let’s all hope our efforts bear positive results soon. Thank you sir.  #sgunited",21/4/20,173,Foreign Worker,171,4,-10.9578961,34,11,7,0.731159517,0,1,1
"Not sure to make the decision to extend the CB by another month at this moment is the correct one as so far, majority of the cases occurred at the dorm and local cases around 20. As we moved to the 2nd half of the CB, we should see the local cases coming down even further.  I think to make the call whether to extend the CB on the end of 3rd week will give us better visibility on our measures. CB has huge impact on our economy with many businesses affected, workers losing their jobs and students not learning much from HBL. I hope u can review the extension of the CB again at the end of 4th week ie 4 May. Thank u",21/4/20,120,Foreign Worker,125,4,-10.43602051,17,2,4,1.251012879,0,1,1

"One of the things we should be looking at is bringing the operators of the dormitories, and the contractors who are in charge of the workers, to task--for years they prioritised profit over ensuring a decent level of hygiene and safety standards, lining their pockets to buy GCBs and build Sentosa show-mansions on the backs of their fellow humans' misery. Now, they have cost the country's economy hundreds of millions of dollars in a month, caused our nation's reserves to be depleted, and exacerbated the economic hardship of our people, with the government having to pick up the tab!

Currently, we have to use a pen and paper to write down our particulars, this added an opportunity for the virus to pass to one another, as viruses are known to stay on surfaces for extended periods (up to 3 days on paper and plastics).  For the same reason, I try only to touch the things I need to buy, avoiding any unnecessary exposure to myself.  My solution is to have a simple functionality added to TraceTogether, using the camera function to scan a QR code at the premise when we enter.  Do what we need to do and quickly leave.  This was used at the recent airshow at Changi, the only difference, we pre-fill our particulars, just scan & go! Those without smartphones may still use old tech - pen and paper.

Have you guys ever consider those people that are in essential services? These people include police officers, firefighters and etc. They are facing the members of public, and 6 weeks without a haircut will make them look very unprofessional looking.

"I fully support and welcome the government to extend the circuit breaker measure to 1 June 2020. However, as there are still big pool of reservoir of unlink cases, and in the spirit to prevent new wave of Covid 19, may I propose to government to consider to postpone all non essential hospital medical appointment and non essential civil suits file in high court as well as state court. Of course, urgent criminal cases must and should be adhere to original court schedule.   Below is my definition of non essential medical appointment and non essential civil suits   Non essential medical appointment refer to medical condition that is not life threatening or non respiratory related symptom.   Non essential civil suits refer to suits that was file with the court on or after November 2019 as these cases are still in the early stage of proceeding and can afford to wait until the Covid 19 is more stabilise.   The above proposal will reduce the human traffic in these 2 essential building and thus reduce and eliminate new wave of transmission.

"Hi I'm work in Singapore, I'm still in Singapore,, I have some comments about us . Who we are staying in Singapore. Government provide for us domotery it's fine but many are domotery in1 room staying maximum15 people some more then this. Just I have to say,,, just government provide for us domotery it's enough ,I don't think so  1. 1room staying many people.. Very congested and room temperature very hot, just proved fan😢. We don't enough sleep at night, enough sleep is very important for the worker worke hard .many cases In Singapore incident because the worker some time lost his body control. That why very important to take enough rest.. Just I have to say at the working time we are worker but end of the day we also be a human,, we also tired and need to take rest... So I request all of you all the domotery provid air-condition  at list we can take enough rest at night in our room...   2. I already say many people are staying same room.. This also are very important I think.. You can see now what going on in Singapore.. Many people are effective this virus,, maximum people are staying domotery because all of you know in1 domotery how many   worker staying.... If this issue can you do some thing change, maybe we can avoid many cases .  , please don't take me wrong if I'm saying wrong sorry for that. All of you are Singapore we work for you and get money from you,, because we have also family... This is all of your responsibility to provide good good staying place food and other things...

"Dear Mr Lee, in order to beat this virus by end of eCB, just think we need the task force to move much further ahead of the curve. Just as I tweeted not to waste the original CB period and implement compulsory wearing when leaving the house, I am glad with or without my tweet it is implemented. Just my thoughts on few areas we may want to think about to get ahead. First, current contact trace methodology is not effective when it comes to asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic. Even though I am not comfortable with the contact tracing app due to privacy concerns, please make it compulsory. We need to relink the unlinked cases through location/time overlap analysis with patient 0, coupled with testing to find patient -1. We need to use technology to shorten the analysis. Second, if the possibility exists that the pandemic will last far beyond eCB, we need to have a more effective mask strategy. Cotton masks while reducing the level of contaminants do not have the same trapping properties of a simple 3 ply surgical mask. A Canadian study have shown such a mask is sufficient besides offering some more protection to the wearer. Third. We need to use our science teams to figure out how to make aerosols settle quickly or maybe trapping it especially in aircon places. Maybe it is in the form of a diffuser/purifier. It will be a reusable solution not just in Singapore and for future epidemics. Fourth, we cannot just sit and wait for Jun 1st and than figure out, can we re-open, how do we re-open, etc. We plan on a worst case basis that the virus will take a long time to address, so we need to be smart about how do we still open. Do we use mass testing for e.g. figure out who is already immune and be deployable ? do we open office building by building, or sector. How do we use enhanced contact tracing to quickly contain the cases, can we get testing down to 1 min and implement quick test at buildings, etc. The rainy budget is not bottomless and more SMEs fold, it will be worst than the property bust we have seen before. regards",21/4/20,368,Foreign Worker,376,4,-11.12698003,77,17,14,0.05270066,0,0,1

"Sir:  I propose for the Ministry of Healthy and relevant agencies to impose a shutdown of food delivery platforms such as Grab, FoodPanda, Deliveroo etc, to prevent new clusters of Covid-19 transmission and the spread of the virus.  It has been evident in the past two weeks of 'Circuit Breaker' that delivery riders have faced tremendous pressure in their job of delivering F&B to customers at home. Shortly after the announcement of tightening and restriction of what is deemed to be “essential”, a number of videos have circulated on the internet which displayed the rowdy behaviour of delivery riders and F&B workers. Some of the commotion between the riders and stores resulted in close contact of these persons in their individual bids to put their point across.  Such behaviour is fairly understandable- likely due to the pressures of increased orders and lacklustre management of orders. These delivery riders on the ground are helpless except to do their utmost to fulfil their daily orders. The delivery platforms have also been purported to be almost impossible for delivery riders to cancel orders in view of unforeseen situations such as long waiting times or out-of-stock items. These circumstances inadvertently culminated into displays of frustrations, jostling, and hurling of insults or abuses. It has also been evident many F&B locations are ironically, the ground of close gathering of delivery riders who have almost no option to practice safe-distancing at these crowded venues. The mood of Singaporeans from all walks of life is expected to run high through the Circuit Breaker period, and occurrences of these unfortunate disputes are likely to increase.  One cannot be certain that all delivery riders or F&B outlets are Covid-free. It would take just one infected individual in the nucleus to spread devastating consequences deep into the homes of families waiting for their orders.  The measures at wet markets and supermarkets are quite effective in allowing families to purchase groceries. Food establishments also remain open and people should have little difficulty to get food and drinks for consumption.  It is timely that the Ministry consider a shutdown of the delivery platforms to minimise potential outbreak of the virus within the community.",22/4/20,362,Foreign Worker,365,4,-11.32128567,54,14,1,-0.01554694,0,1,1

"One of the best perspectives of the current situation that I read so far :-  From Dr Sharmil de Silva:  I think the thing most people don’t understand is that the lock down is in place to slow the progression of the disease, NOT to eradicate it by end of May.  I think people are missing the point because they naively think the govt will somehow get rid of it so life goes back to normal. These are people who have ignored the global reality since January. This is the dangerous delusional thinking that some people are applying in their assessment of the situation when advocating we should stop the lockdown because they are literally only waking up to this thing now, or when we were initially shut down. So let’s lift the curtain a bit.  1. Flattening the curve means slowing down the disease so that hospitals can cope with the sick. It does not mean eradicating the disease all together.  2. No government will be able to eradicate the disease this year. It’s here until a cure or a vaccine is found   3. A vaccine is at least a year away. That’s April 2021. The earliest vaccine trials just started late last month. It takes 18 to 24 months to make, test and assess the efficacy of a vaccine. So 1 year is literally a Hail Mary.   4. There is NO going back to normal. Your normal will not exist for at least a year. Economies globally will keep bleeding and we are likely to have rolling lockdowns until a vaccine is found.  5. Even when the ban is lifted, tourism and hospitality industry, and many others will not see an increase in business for at least a year. Until a vaccine is found people will continue to self isolate even when a lock down is lifted.   6. The only reprieve we are going to get is if we have thousands of people who have been infected and recovered and minimum deaths so that we have some level of herd immunity. That is also still a theory that is yet to be proven because some countries think they may be seeing people get reinfected. Even with that in place normal is not feasible because fear still reigns and people will remain isolated until safety is guaranteed- cure or vaccine. Refer to point 3.  7. The above is still 6 months away. We are projected to reach our peak in September. That means, bleeding economy, rolling lockdowns, death and chaos until then.  8. The decisions made in the lockdown like no alcohol and no dog walking or running and no e-commerce are not made with the privileged in mind. They are made with the masses in mind. What you allow in the suburbs you must allow in the townships and those two things look very different in execution.   Now our government is doing the best it can and they have reacted faster than most developed countries. Our progress is still better than most and right now we’re riding the dumb hope that somehow BCG gives us some fighting chance (still unproven).   So please please we all need to do whatever we can to help our neighbors, help each other, support our government and stop having delusional ideas about any level of normalcy at the end of this month. Adjust your projections and hunker down.   This is not a joke and it’s not even anywhere near any semblance of real yet.   Normal is dead. Let that sink in. But HOPE  is very much alive!",21/4/20,584,Foreign Worker,594,4,-10.42204089,124,28,11,-0.074404939,0,1,1

"As most are working from home, the Parks seems to be more crowded on weekends. Parks should be closed.

Neighbours DO NOT CLOSE doors and walking around, without any care or concern. I hope Social Distancing can be Explicit that All HDB home doors are closed, to prevent people just walking in and out up and down  stairs, because there's no prevention of distancing. Next, It is a very crucial preventive  measure because 80% of us live in HDB. If neighbours are careless, just imagine!

"PM Lee Though the case today is 942 ,  i can tell you and your Team.  Generally the ground is calm to accept it as we see our government did not sit on it BUT all out to close the gap. To filter out the affected in dormitory asap.  I agree with Forum letter today that when we do execise, mask must be on, without exercise for 1 or 2 months will not risk our lives. when i went  NTUC today,  i see every where people flouting the rule under the cover of exercise by putting on the the sportsshoe or ride on a bicysle to jalan jalan without mask on. This has created unhappiness in the ground, many has sacrified to stay home and only go out when necessary and most have obeyed when out must with mask on all times.we must not allow these trouble makersto put our effort in vain  People are unappreciative of the flexibility granted But exploit them for own convenience or try to be hero [ BUT remeber when hero created, someone must die or many will dies].

Due to our structural limitations, and that migrant workers are essentially younger, fitter and healthier, perhaps we may explore a form of “herd immunity” strategy to mitigate this crisis provided that infected symptoms are mild or asymptomatic, not in danger and that welfare prioritized.  Recovered patients can voluntarily donate plasma to help speedy recoveries of their friends.  Recovered patients can become and add to our increasing “immunized” core migrant workforce numbers to further help our economy and start more virtuous cycles.

"We have had overlooked the FW angle in this crisis. The possibility of future outbreaks exist so post CB should be carefully planned  1. Although it may affect human rights or privacy , a tracing app should be made mandatory for all. The app is installed automatically on all mobile phones by the telco . Visitors are not to be exempted . We need to work out the security and this app disabled on departure for visitors. ( Perhaps we can work out an agreement among the ASEAN members) 2. It may be difficult to put back all the FW into the dorm again and alternatives cannot be produced overnight .  Suggest that the temporary accommodations be used as long as practicable such as yet to be demolished HDBs , empty schools , empty barracks etc. Floatels and cruise ships are just too expensive .  3. In the long run , we have to consider seriously the question of FW accommodations . It is impossible to have hygienic communal toilets and kitchens . Remember all those SIT flats that were torn down.

Please add just a few more measures: give all infected persons with mild symptoms and frontline personnel vitamins A, C, D and zinc (10,000 IU, 1000 mg, 5000 IU and 30 mg every day); ensure all meals are low in sugar and refined carbohydrates but rich in vegetables, fruits and fibre; and add a serving or two of yogurt with live cultures every day. They must have adequate protein in their meals. And make sure they all have 15 minutes sun exposure on large areas of their bodies between 10am to 4pm. Dark-skinned folks will need to spend more time under the sun (2-4X). These measures will give them internal qi to fight the infection or prevent frontline from getting struck down by the virus.

"Dear Mr Lee, I have some suggestions on how to combat the pandemic outbreak. There is much we can learn from how South Korea successfully arrested the outbreak after a terrifying start.   Firstly, we need to significantly ramp up testing so as to identify the infected, especially the asymptomatic ones. I watched a video in which a South Korean medical expert explained that the main reason why they could contain what seemed like widespread community transmission was by extensively testing the population so that the infected could be quarantined. Even though South Korea's situation is now under control, they still have public booths available for any member of the public to be tested.   Contrast that to Singapore's situation. My friend who was sick visited a clinic and requested for a coronavirus test but was rejected. He was deemed not to exhibit sufficient symptoms to be tested. But hasn't the coronavirus been proven to be asymptomatic? In light of that, we should not be turning people away for tests. We have to be more proactive in order to quickly identify the infected before the spread worsens.   I understand there is a political price with extensive testing, as the numbers could significantly increase. Indeed the South Korean president was initially embarrassed by the speed of the outbreak, but his willingness to swallow the bitter pill has won him the respect of his people as he managed to arrest the outbreak. His party won a resounding electoral victory. We too must swallow the bitter pill in order to stop the outbreak.   Secondly, may I suggest that we get the best PITs from the SAF to design some home-based fitness routines for all ages. In the absence of a vaccine, the best medicine to fight the virus is exercise. Exercising is crucial in building up our immune system, which is an important way for us to fight off the coronavirus. It is also a good way to relax our mind and cost nothing. We can air exercise routines live on tv, and encourage everyone to participate at home. This is a good way for the nation to bond in this time of crisis.

"A problem surfaces and the stock answer is: let's solve the problem and move on. This should not have happened if the ""think tanks"" have given a thought about this obvious situation with FWs. The relevant ministries should have been aware of the living conditions in the dorms.

The dorm operators should be punished and held responsible for spreading an infectious disease. We have not heard a squeak from the owners/operators of the dorms. Are they still allowed to carry on?

"Firstly, still feeling very grateful for the government efforts in dealing with this Pandemic. While the exponential increase in the cases is a cause of concern, it's also a real opportunity for us Singaporeans, 4G leaders and young Singaporeans who may not have gone through ww2 to go through the baptism of fire.   Comments from other countries media have pointed that the 2nd wave of transmission has knocked us off our feet. It has. The question is how we bounce back. Bouncing back with ingunity and guts lets us learn a better lesson than if we had got by with solutions such as hotel stays at rasa Sentosa. We want to be remembered for bouncing back, beating the curve, being able to continue our lives after the CB. That shall be our gold standard.   It is clear that the leaders are moving away from the strong statesmen approach of the yesterday towards a consultative, multi agency, evidence based approach. We all have to rise to the challenge. The 3 prong approach does not sound aggressive enough. In time to come, more solutions will be need to be deployed to solve the issue of migrant workers density.

Unlike other bigger countries, Singapore being a small nation  (population and size) has a advantage and in best position to implement a mandatory covid testing exercise for all. The rapid test kit is easy to use and efficiently screen suspected patients. This will immediately and effectively filter out those infected individuals and more importantly those undetected carriers.

I suspect some FWs (WP, EP included) and foreign students with Covid-19 are staying low & not going for test especially with work-from-home, study-from-home wef Tuesday.   We should make their employers/sponsors personally responsible for their accommodation if they want to keep them in Singapore.   Some are still illegally lodging in HDB and private apartments turned into dormitories.   May I suggest URA, HDB and MOM work together to stamp these out. They must be given more authority to enter these premises when neighbours report them.  And increase the penalties on such owners.  I used to live in an apartment block and a few of us owners reported on an unit that was converted to a dormitory with temporary partitions. For years, the authorities were unable to enter the unit and the tenants knew what to say when authorities came knocking. This should not be so difficult if MOM records show more than 8 tenants including FWs/students registered under the same address.   Another measure is to get FWs update any change of their address online with each move as they tend to move frequently.  And the owner has to confirm their occupancy.

This applies even if they queue with their helpers. Please don't allow them to use trolleys as they stack up too much n leave trolleys lying around everywhere. This cause others who only buy few items to wait for a v long time, half an hour or more to get to pay. 3. Enforce stricter measures for people who break the rules like heavier fines or go to jail.

"PM Lee, despite the various measures implemented and pleas from the authorities and many sectors of society, it is truly alarming to see the number of locally transmitted unlinked cases shooting up! This clearly reflect the irresponsible, arrogant and selfish attitudes of some of our citizens. This is indeed a shame to say the least. Perhaps it’s time for more harder measures and stronger words as well as harsher punishment to be implemented. After all these are very difficult times that Singapore is experiencing and being confronted by an unseen ‘enemy’ that is growing threateningly uncontrollable by the day! For a start all Malls should be shut to discourage crowds, wearing of masks should be made mandatory when taking public transport, gathering of 10 should be scaled down to not more than 3 and social distancing guidelines must be strictly adhered to or else appropriate punishment be meted out promptly.  Hopefully you are right that in the weeks to come we may see a drop in local transmission. Thank you and God bless!",6/4/20,172,Foreign Worker,173,4,-10.97070993,34,8,4,0.671320697,0,1,1

"What about those in the dormitory, Sir ? As far as we know, some dormitories have their own minimart, food court, eateries etc.  Are we missing too many loopholes ?  We also see that a lot of foreign workers have no knowledge of what is going on now, what is covid19, how it is affecting people if they do not practice social distancing and good hygiene. They are seen to be sitting on crossed seats and still gather in groups and speak to each other in close proximity. Many of them do nt understand or read English, so they can’t understand such notice too even when they enter the mall.   Also pls refrain from allowing our seniors from working in the dormitories and places that’s high risk pls ...   Can make it a mandatory to close the F&B outlets in the dormitory clusters, so that those elderly who worked there are forced to stay home ?  My mom 64 a singapore citizen is working in sungei tengah dormitory as a hawker, and her employer is simply not bothered because it’s her boss’s best chance to earn more $$$ with foreign workers all being lockdown. Her boss is not stationed there himself to work at all. So he won’t face any risk of infection. We have been persuading her to quit but she see no risk. Instead she feel it’s hard for her to get a job at her age so she wants to continue despite the high risk. Today she is still going to work, even on weekends. Waking up at 4am to reach dormitory before 6am, and slog until 3pm. We are all very worried about her, even my aunts have been persuading her to quit but old ppl is really stubborn .

"Dormitories tend to be more crammed which explains the bigger clusters. Enclosed space & closed proximity has remain the constant theme for transmission. It would be ideal if density at these dormitories are reduced significantly.  However, more can be done now to ""actively attack"" the virus transmission at these dormitories, the top priority now is to identify & isolate any more potential infected carriers especially asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who may not realized they are carrier. Most men(which the bulk of these dormitories workers are, would probably have been more busy with their work at workplaces previously)& will tend to be less fastidious about COVID-19 prevention measures like safe distancing with others in dormitories & enhanced hygiene measures, so health officials may need to come out with programs to educate & emphasize to them the importance of personal hygiene(not touching face without thorough washing of hands with soap & water & after visiting toilets & before meals etc.)in their native languages for any who have difficulty comprehending English. Facilities owners will need to increase frequencies of toilet/bathing area cleaning at these dormitories as well.  With current development of Singapore's own rapid test kits which we have shared with neighboring countries, it should be time to ramp-up production of more of these accurate test kits as there may now be a need to conduct more tests on any potentially infected dormitories residents for early detection & isolation to prevent even higher transmission numbers.  Contact Tracing/Investigation Teams will need to quickly establish & identify any potential close contacts of current confirmed cases of dormitories residents & authorities would need to quickly mount a larger scale COVID-19 testing on these close contacts of the confirmed cases who may appear healthy now at these dormitories so as to identify & isolate any asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who will not realize they are sick yet & halt any further transmissions in such higher density dormitories setting & reduce the burden on Singapore Healthcare workers & facilities.",6/4/20,320,Foreign Worker,322,4,-11.98835677,56,2,1,0.06307795,0,1,1
