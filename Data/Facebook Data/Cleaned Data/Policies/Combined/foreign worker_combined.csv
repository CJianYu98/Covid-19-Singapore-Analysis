1,1,"Hope the authority can consider allowing funeral directors to be vaccinated earlier base on the grounds   1) they are essential workers even during lock down  2) they handle COVID death cases. During the funeral arrangements for such cases, family members of the deceased could be still under SHN or recovered status  3) they mingle with groups of 30 attendees and family members of the deceased daily   4) when they collect bodies from houses maybe die of other causes. Usually this kind of death will not trigger a need to go through swab, so if the deceased is infected with COVID then it will be a risk to funeral directors.  5) serving family members of those on SHN when they comes back from overseas to attend their loved ones funeral  ",2021-03-08,123

25,28,"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,2021-03-11,479

The mask was not worn and or were worn but under the chin without covering the nose and mouth. This was about a month ago when the dorms started showing re-infected numbers after been declared cleared. Till today, I can still see the same happenings at construction sites. I have been wondering if the lady I spoke to in BCA have reported upwards to her manager or just couldn't be bordered? If she did, what have the manager done about my complain? Took bus 35 from Bedok Mall. This bus passes by a dormitory along Tanah Merah Costal road. Most of the time, I can see FWs standing outside their dorm door without social distancing and without putting on face mask. Occasionally, I can see them walking from 1 door to another and mix socializing.  So, I have expected to see that re-infections in dorms is very likely and high.  A sad encounter... with stupid people in the BCA. I could tell and felt that the lady I spoke to was not interested as she did not even asked for my particulars for me to expect BCA's feedback and actions taken.  Where are the dormitory ambassador to control and ensure proper mask wearing and socializing control in the dorms?  There is no whistle blowing contact to the correct agencies.  Maybe I should take some photos and call the police at the same time to make it an issue.  Talk so much about covid-19 numbers coming from FWs but has it improved?

Correct: Even if the infectious viruses are long dead, a corona test can come back positive, because the PCR method multiplies even a tiny fraction of the viral genetic material enough to be detected.  The PCR test with its extreme sensitivity was initially perfect to find out where the virus could be. But this test cannot identify whether the virus is still alive, i.e. still infectous.""

434,483,"Easy for everyone to have their GENIUS opinion but have you tried to research why they need to manually go to the remittance centers to send money in their country? These might be some of the reasons: 1. Maid does not have a bank account in SG. There are strict requirements from the FDW and Employers to be able to open a bank account 2.Relatives in their country does not have a bank account and/or lives in a remote area where rural banks are not accessible 3. Lucky plaza has all the remittance agencies that can send cash at yoyr doorstep 4. Human being. If your off day is still staying at your workplace, how would you feel? Psychologically and mentally it does not refresh you. Esp if your employer does not respect your own time during your off day at home.  Please EMPATHiZE every one has their own struggle. These FDW are not burdens but a big help in a FAMILY.  We are all sociable human beings, aren't we all under stress right now that we cannot even meet and hug our friends who stay just nearby? FDW stays far away from their families. Please be kind.",2020-06-13,194
435,484,"There are two parts to this. One is an essential need, and one is not. Essential: the need for foreign workers to send money back to their families. Many locals seem naively unaware that domestic helpers (and other foreign workers) need to get money home to their families frequently. Heck, that's the reason why they come to work here! To get money to send home! This essential need must be allowed, or else their families risk starving back home. And this is not a stretched truth. And that is why you see long snaking queues at said venues. In a nutshell, REMITTENCE. it is the lifeblood of your domestic helper. Govt can work with embassies and remittance businesses to bring the remittance to the worker instead, to prevent hot spots at the usual haunts of ofws. Also, employers and OFWs can explore online remit options where possible. Rates may not be as good, but if for the time being, perhaps the employer can work out something with the helper.  Non essential: some domestic helpers take the chance to fake it and go to said venues to meet their friends. This is a big no. socialising in groups at said venues. This should definitely not be allowed. Same rules apply whether you are a foreign worker domestic helper or a local or expat. The virus is no differentiator of man. We must all follow the phases so that we can make a full recovery to reopen the economy. NO socialising after remittance. Go home.  When the home is also your workplace, it can get unbearable for your helper. For you working at home, to get away from work, you switch off your PC and work mail. How does your helper ""switch off"" when all her bosses are at home? Therefore she needs time to mentally and physically destress and recalibrate. If you don't want to give her rest then please GET A ROBOT instead. And even robots need time to recharge! So, allow your helpers to do some exercise or other activities while following within the rules at all times.  A good employer knows that a good helper is an asset to his/her family. If you take care of the helper, the helper will want to take care of your household.",2020-06-13,379

701,171,"The very fact they consist a small proportion against the entire population and yet yesterday have almost double the infected compared to singaporean locals means one thing. They have not observed and kept the hygiene standards and also not been observing any distancing measures.   The dormitory all allocated to them were almost new and good condition when they moved in. The fact there are cockroaches derive from littering and bad personal maintainence of their personal spaces.  In the Singapore army in BMT we have 10 men to a single bunk room and an entire company of 160 men using a single block. Yet with proper area cleaning we kept it spotless. Toilets are sparkling. On top of that as full time soldiers we had to fufil every single training obligation issued to us.  Instead of complaining about cockroaches and bad hygienic conditions....why not start area cleaning. They are getting a full months pay to do nothing. Spend the time wisely! Hundreds of Singaporeans too live in blocks and dine in local hawker centers with hundreds of people at any time.  My fear is if their girlfriends who may be FDWs go back home with their infection. The entire family she lives with will suffer. This will cause a massive infestation. I pray this day never comes.   I believe the govt policy to quarantine 20,000 is very sound. This is a preventative measure against a mass outbreak amongst millions of local Singaporeans who have stood by Singapore thick and thin and served the nation when she needed us. It’s understandable that many foreigners are here to enjoy the wealth, prosperity and jobs that we are blessed with. However consider the flip side of the coin....assuming there is a war....outbreak....or any disaster....will the very ones who flocked here for jobs stay with us and fight with us or will they be the first ones to board planes and ships out. It’s the sons of this land who will lose the most as we have families and friends here. As a son if this land without question I will fight for her as my love ones are here.

1027,415,"Have to thank the Task Force, frontliners, contact teams and all those working tirelessly day in day out to make these measures work. Especially the patience and tolerance in allowing the citizens to still have a way of life, though limiting. Yet, be demoralized day after day by irresponsible behaviour. Even if there is to be full blown restrictions, many will still disobey and try their luck. No idea which part of this pandemic do they not understand. The fact that someone not showing symptoms can possibly infect another? The possibility of contracting pneumonia and being isolated in hospital hooked up to a ventilator to help you breath? The possibility that it can get critical and no loved ones can be with you? When all it takes is to stay home, only buy whats needed, keep a distance and come home immediately. Do the authorities have to detail everything out or even make it more strict to keep people at home? Just because last week they didnt wear a mask and nothing happened doesnt mean it cant this week. To these irresponsible people who are practically demoralizing the authorities, healthcare workers, putting them at more risk, having to chase after you, putting other citizens who want to be responsible at risk, is inappropriate. And then complain the Gov has no control? When no matter what is done, they still dont bother? People out there have familes, children and loved ones who dont want this, and neither does the Gov who is trying to protect us all. Stupidity doesnt account for bravery when risks are involved. Neither does heroism if you survive",2020-04-05,271

1039,432,"I appreciate the efforts of the joint-ministries task force. A big thank you to all our medical, healthcare & other frontline staff (the police, contact tracing team & researchers etc.) who have helped Singapore in our fight against COVID-19.  The plans to manage the huge dormitory clusters are quite comprehensive but there is something more that can be done to halt the transmission of COVID-19 amongst the dormitory residents. Run more COVID-19 detection tests on all close contacts of current dormitory confirmed cases now, within capacity that our lab team can currently cope & run them now. Because simply confining the dormitory workers in their crammed dormitory will not prevent further COVID-19 transmission amongst the dormitory workers especially if they continue to stay together in the high density crammed conditions, now that we can almost be certain of  asymptomatic carriers who unintentionally infect others as they do not realized they are sick.  The bigger clusters is a result of dormitories having higher density   crammed. Enclosed space and closed proximity has remain the constant theme for transmission. It would be ideal if density at these dormitories are reduced significantly. But even doing so is not enough against insidious spread of COVID-19.  More can be done now to ""actively attack"" the virus transmissions at these dormitories, the top priority now is to identify & isolate any more potential infected carriers especially asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who may not realized they are carrier. Most men(which the bulk of these dormitories workers are, would probably have been more busy with their work at workplaces previously)& will tend to be less fastidious about COVID-19 prevention measures like safe distancing with others in dormitories & enhanced hygiene measures, so health officials may need to come out with programs to educate & emphasize to them the importance of personal hygiene(not touching face without thorough washing of hands with soap & water & after visiting toilets & before meals etc.)in their native languages for any who have difficulty comprehending English. Facilities owners will need to increase frequencies of toilet/bathing area cleaning at these dormitories as well.  With current developments of Singapore's own rapid test kits which we have been sharing with our neighboring countries, this is the time to ramp-up production of these accurate testing kits as there may now be a need to conduct more tests on any potentially infeyuuúcted dormitory  workers for early detection & isolation to prevent an even higher transmission numbers.  Contact Tracing/ Investigation Teams will need to work quickly to establish & identify any previous close contacts of current confirmed cases from the dormitories. We need to quickly mount a larger scale COVID-19 testing on these close contacts of the dormitories' confirmed cases. As many people may appear healthy now but they maybe rapidly infecting others. We need to be able to quickly identify & isolate any such persons from the crowded dormitories.  Please work out plans to test more of our dormitory  workers who had previous close contacts to current confirmed cases now.",2020-04-06,489

In 2014 again my company offer me to participate shipyard supervisor safety course SSSC This time i can't say no than i had completed  my SSSC and in 2016 i had completed my Risk Management Course  Than my Company  appointed me as a supervisior,  last five years we don't have a single accident or incident report, in my supervising season i have worked with a lots of guys and i know everyone has a different personality and work ability so as a supervisior i think every supervisor should adjust them with personality of their guys, and  Before starting any job must ask them first that  how they want to start the job and what's the safest way to complete a job if  the supervisor think their guys ideas are correct and safe, let them do if not correct give them proper knowledge and show them the safest way and of course a supervisor should keep enough knowledge to read their guys mind during work and focus on their physical condition it's may help to reduce accident and find out the competent person for a job and a serious issue is every supervisor should respect their worker and be loyal with them and order with respect so that they will accept your order from their mind and this thing will help,  productivity, saving  man hours, and reduce productive cost.",2021-03-03,300

My British friend with his Filipino wife and their 2 children have lived in SG for more than 10 years. They rent a HDB flat, their children were born here and attend local schools. They opened their homes to their neighbours and their children grow & play along with the local children. But they have been denied PR status 4 times. Perhaps it is due to him not having a degree, even though he is a professional in the IT industry. Meanwhile, the JP Morgan Indian national got his PR or maybe citizenship by marriage to a Singaporean and starts to insult the guard at his condo. Well, he is not the only one.

The Biden administration is now coming clean and admitting that the Covid death rates in America for 2020 had been grossly exaggerated (most probably to make Trump look bad); and that the PCR testing should not be used as a diagnostic tool for positive cases.    The AMA also recently advised that Doctors should go ahead to treat patients in their early stage with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine — this, after rigging the results last April that there was no evidence for the effectiveness with the 60+ years old drug, followed by a ban of their sales in the US.

Everyone knows they are not being treated equally as a community. Of-course not all locals are but majority. Always treated as a outsider. A perfect example , look at the worker dorms location always AWAY from the HDB buildings and local communities. Like a lower class community will have to live in outside of the city in congested buildings.

Please DO NOT underestimate their contribution and please DO NOT accuse them of taking over our jobs. We need to reflect on ourselves and ask why employers prefer these FT.
