We must live and move on like usual with a little bit changes. Rotting at home will not do us good. When you are out of money, out of job, out of food, you will know covid is not the worst.

Are we ready to let in FWs from neighbouring countries to kickstart many stalled projects? Most importantly are Singaporean ready to face the consequences of backfiring if things donâ€™t go as planned. Can we survive another round of CB? Answer is an obvious NO. Let nots ignore the facts that the infections arounds the world are still on the high side. The fatality rates are into hundreds and thousands. Many countries are showing signs of second wave outbreaks. We are being blessed that our fatality rate are low but letâ€™s not overcount our blessing just yet. Do remember that other countries can lockdown towns by towns or states by states to contain the infections but Singapore being a small and dense population countries, once there is wide spread we do not have the luxuries of doing that and will have to lockdown our whole island again.
