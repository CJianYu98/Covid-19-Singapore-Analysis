Will these 11 themes be effective and sustainable to address the crisis which we have gone through the past year? And why are you not interlocking these 11 themes so that one shapes or drive the other? Eg focus on med labs/test kits; green solutioning, have these been thought through on the education system? On green solutioning; why can't we develop and produce our own EV and tie to development of our young from a R&D perspective? Similarly on the medical front; there are so many other critical areas that are lacking during the pandemic. Have we looked at those? Strengthen global hub???

"What should NTUC do for their members? Is insurance the answer? What else is missing? What did I write on this in 2011? ====== Forum: A good insurance plan can help the jobless, while avoiding pitfalls PUBLISHED6 HOURS AGO on 8th Marh 2021 in ST Forum FACEBOOKTWITTER The idea of implementing an unemployment insurance scheme in Singapore has been mooted several times over the years, and it was again discussed at a recent Parliament session. The pushback on its introduction has always been that such a scheme may lead to the unemployed not wanting to seek employment. However, implementing this scheme and encouraging the unemployed to actively seek employment need not be mutually exclusive if the insurance scheme is carefully thought out and calibrated to avoid unintended pitfalls. A potential unemployment insurance scheme could base its premium on policyholders' declared monthly income. In the event of verified unemployment, the monthly payout could be pegged at a certain percentage of the insured's last drawn monthly salary, subject to a maximum of 24 months' payout. The payout could be calibrated in such a way that it would not see the insured falling into immediate financial hardship, but yet not be lucrative enough to discourage the insured from actively seeking employment, since the payout would be only a fraction of his last drawn monthly salary, and will last for only a period of time. As the economy transforms and the employment landscape goes through structural changes, I believe more people will go through periods of unemployment during their career. Such a scheme will go a long way in helping individuals and families to weather periods of uncertainty in their lives.

"On paper, our GST and taxes are low.   However, consider the following:   1) BTOs are about $600 psf in 2018. You can get a freehold condo in New York for $200-300 psf.   Land sales is a  contribution to our state revenue, AKA taxes.  2) Singaporean men have to serve NS- it takes away 2/40 income producing years. I consider this as a tax, the low stipend given represents a cost saving on the state (the opposite of taxes)   So if you take all of this into account, our taxes are very high indeed.

Studies have shown a 90% reduction of severe symptoms just by taking Vit D. Cleaning up your diet by eating whole foods and reducing processed foods works too.  Weigh the benefits and risks by asking the doctor to list them out to you. Don't just believe that the 'benefits outweigh the risks' narrative repeated everywhere. The ONLY benefit I could see so far is the reduction in severe illness.  Another reminder. Other than the 29 deaths here, all the rest of the survivors recovered.

I have mentioned and highlighted on this sector quite a while ago that retail are reasonably desirable jobs for local but currently still fill by many outsiders because previously such service are quite long hours till about 10am to 10pm so may be unattractive to locals . In the mist of such economic situation people got no choice but to take up such role even if working hours are not 8-5 . Singaporean probably have to change their mindset and get out of their comfort zones.As a Singaporean I want to suggest and provide some solutions to whatever ideas there can be as DPM did mentioned about listening feedbacks from the ground. The challenge is always the bridging and change that industries need to adapt to help Singaporean. Hope this can work and I can also benefit from it in the near future.

"Let’s have good inclusive schemes for the low-wage Singaporeans , not just sticking to old mind sets or western HR practices blindly ! We not only need to raise the low wages of our workers at the bottom but also have to remove the social stigma against them and give them the much needed respect and career advancement opportunities .  For example ，NEA may want to think out of the box and consider an innovative proposal to draw up a common public health -essential service professional workers scheme to attract Singaporeans to join and serve as a life long career in this essential public sector . Such common service scheme respects and treasures every worker right from the bottom as a cleaner up to the top as a public health manager or superintendent. Young and old Singaporeans regardless of their educational levels or English proficiency can be encouraged to join as public health workers doing the cleaner‘s job at a good starting salary of say $2000 pm for a headstart.The more positive and ambitious ones will be given ample on-the-job career training and development opportunities under the scheme to upgrade themselves to take up various higher job responsibilities ，such as truck driver， machine & tool workshop technician, auto-machine operator，plumber，foreman，supervisor，manager ， public health inspector ，public health trainer ， public health enforcement officer，public health supprintendant and even as a certified public health consultant or a licensed cleaning contractor or SME boss in this industry,as they gain more practical experiences, higher job skills and relevant job interests while working and growing from the bottom to the top and to the best of their ability and hard work. If this pilot scheme proves to be successful for the essential public sector , similar common and inclusive schemes can then be widely implemented for other low wage Singaporeans to bring them into the main stream of our entire workforce in every industry so that we dont depend too much on FW to keep Singapore clean ,healthy and staying  ahead of others as a great city within a garden! More importantly ,we don’t become panic and helpless if the FW for any future reason will not or cannot come to Singapore to work any more. Could NEA or any aspiring MP care to take up or look into this essential issue that is of great concern to Singaporeans?",25/6/20,388,Economic Measures,387,4,-11.40067923,47,18,4,2.958916414,0,0,1

Government task force please go and look at the recent BCA guidelines issued today 28th April 2020 forcing pet owners and residents taking a walk out onto public pavements and Parks to walk pets or exercise. This is going to cause major congestions on pathways in housing estates that are so narrow and only allow one person to walk pass at a time. How do you social distance with these ridiculous new measures.   It forces us out of the safety of our compound to add to the already crowded public areas? How is this logical? It’s also now putting us at unnecessary risk! I urge you to please look at these new guideline and do something about them as they are not practical. Condominiums should be able to exercise their own guidelines where rules like this are crazy and put residents in harms way unnecessarily. My dog is a puppy and was terrified to go on the street. We already try our best to be out quickly and come back but these rules force us to go further and so take longer times outside.   Please also check all BCA’s crazy guidelines that don’t make sense. There seem to be many since April 7 th that are putting residents in harms way unnecessarily.  Thank you,28/4/20,214,Economic Measures,214,4,-10.8277123,43,10,7,6.184503324,1,1,1

"Moving forward, after 2020 ends, I would want to know what is in store for PMETs and the SEPs or even the public in general when it comes to training. In this everchanging business climate, It's time for the government to change the same old approach of subsidizing courses only when the attendee passes a test. I want to attend higher level courses at subsidised rates with just a certificate of attendance so that I can receive quality training with little stress. The old mindset of subsidies only when I pass the test is a hindrance. It takes the joy out of learning. Having training allowance is a bonus, not a must. Not everyone is yao gui. There are individuals looking for upgrading of skills and knowledge who are, however, not exam savvy. Don't just do the paper chase. Do the skills chase.

If no major spike in infection, then let’s move to 35-40 for next 3 weeks and so on (same condition - shud not stay with elderlies). This probably will help in opening up the economy faster .. also in case anyone in that age group falls sick he may not require serious medical attention, hence less burden on the medical system. May be this approach can help open up. I understand compliance is an issue, but we can use the trace app to check and monitor.

"Dear Sir,   First of all, thank you for approving the Fortitude Budget. It must have been a really tough decision to make as it cuts deep into our GDP.   I too have lost my job in the digital banking sector as a MarTech Digital Analytics & Data Science specialist Singaporean. I am highly skilled.   During CB period, I’m taking global cyber security certification right now utilising my skillsfuture TOP up credit of $500. Thank you 🙏 😊 for that.   In fact, I was abruptly & unlawfully laid off by foreign talent senior managers/MDs in our own local Banks. I was new to the bank, last in, first out situation. Unfortunate or unlucky. Culture eats our livelihood for lunch!   However, we do need to cut back on our generosity and to stop giving our meals away now.   We need to stop 🛑 ✋ using globalisation as an excuse for massive FT hires with no proper screening of their competency for the roles offered in our country. MOM & SIR needs to step up on credentials validation.   Many of whom are employed with fake tech certifications laundered and layered into our workforce.   Is there a way of which we could measure the per capita income or success metric per Singaporean with these funds at a -20% deficit of our gross GDP?   As a Singaporean, it is immensely painful to have to dig deep into our reserves of which we’ve saved since our independence. My grandparents worked hard for these savings.    Earnestly, I hope these funds would really go into supporting jobs for Singaporeans as oppose to FTs who are over supplied in our current market’s macro economic situation.   With an over supply of FTs all vying for the same buffet of jobs in the Tech, AI, Data Science, Digital Banking, Analytics, Customer Experience, Agile Workflow...etc the list go on, Digital Transformation at scale type of jobs.  In comparison to FTs, Singaporeans are actually more well skilled, well travelled, well equipped as compared to many other FTs from neighbouring countries.   I do not believe the average graduate from our local universities would lack lustre in competencies as compared to those in other countries.   In fact, Singapore has TOP talents due to our education system as compared to the rest of the world.   When we create digital transformation jobs, we need to Ensure it is a Singaporean being offered the job.  I’ve personally witnessed Singaporean CVs being rejected as the senior MD or hiring managers are all from South Asia.   Is globalisation really doing Singaporeans justice in this economy or do we Singaporeans will have to resort to working overseas as FTs too and thus causing talent brain drain in our own homeland.   Yes we should and we must be inclusive in our society.   However, it must not come at the expanse of a Singaporean’s reason for being in this country, and contribution in many ways to this country of which we call,  home truly.   We really need to step up in protecting Singaporean jobs, both young and old. Constant offshoring and outsourcing of technology jobs to South Asia, isn’t growing our economy but other’s.   Many local employers cite Singaporeans being too expensive to hire.   However, FTs are even more expensive than Singaporeans with condo housing and car allowances in their total package, doing the same job function.   So why not hire a Singaporean as opposed to an entire Dept of FTs? Why isn’t the quota strictly adhered to?   I hope the Govt will look into each sector, industry and regulate the influx of FTs for the survival of our future economy, during and post covid.  Sincerely, I hope we can emerge stronger as a people and a nation of Singapore 🇸🇬 after this ordeal. #sgunited   Thank you Sir 🙏 😊 ",26/5/20,624,Economic Measures,618,4,-11.58223387,96,15,30,1.768316815,0,1,1

"A very good morning PM MR Lee, WHO is an important organization that is put in place for the well being of the world. It certainly has to seek funds from every member country to face the challenges of a pandemic. The current pandemic is worst than we could ever think of. It requires sincere effort from all nations. However, such a situation is difficult because some political  and religious leaders have their own ideals and differences. Some countries lack the resources and expertise which could make covid 19 an even bigger threat . Social behavior and mindset plays a crucial role in combating the situation. Covid 19 has crippled the world’s economies and has claimed the lives and livelihoods of many across the globe. Wonderful that Singapore is playing our part by pledging US $500,000 in response to an appeal by WHO. Personally, I feel that it is for a worthy cause , not only for us but for the rest of the world as well. Thank you and appreciate PM Mr Lee for acting in the best interest of Singaporeans.",24/3/20,178,Economic Measures,181,4,-10.32769167,27,6,6,6.115426429,1,0,1

This way, not only majority of the students will be away from the big crowd (since many parents either work from home or are stay-at-home parents), those whose kids needs to be in school will also feel safer with their kids being exposed to a smaller crowd. The teachers too won't be double-loaded with having to prepare materials for both physical and online learning (for those on loa) and they themselves won't be exposed to a big crowd too.  Please take a look at the kids at the bus stops, car waiting area, buses, trains etc. They are jammed packed!

There are hundreds or even thousands of people in these places during the Singapore or overseas horse racing days.  Based on my understanding, the betting centres are open everyday except Mondays.

"It is very telling to read posts by the foreigners who express their desire to have PM Lee n his cabinet ministers as their government.   Contrast this to the many brickbats thrown at our Singapore government by our very own citizens. No matter what the government does or does not do, it is wrong. Nothing pleases these people.   In life, we can choose our attitudes, responses and behaviours.   We can choose to be unhappy and angry complainers or to be grateful people.   It all boils down to personal choices.",20/2/20,89,Economic Measures,89,3,-10.64635645,17,4,3,15.83593141,2,0,1

"Sir, Good Day.  Happy Spore Budget 2020.  Pray for Spore. Quiet Lion City.  A good article to share for your reading while you travel on the road to the Parliament.  Enjoy this Sharing is Caring story from a China Pastor.  Topic : Quiet China. Pray for Wuhan.  Human caged and eat exotic animals. The cause and effect , Human quarantine Human in home cages worried abt CoronaVirus pandemic spreads across China. This is Chinese KARMA teachings !!   Find this article rather insightful-😷👍  “The hustle and bustle of China has finally halted , the restless society has calmed, and the busy Chinese people gradually nested down.  “The wild animals that were once cage by humans finally managed to keep humans in ""cages"".  “Humans now have  lowered their proud head and began to think quietly: Are we still the king of the earth?    “Mankind has come head to head with the power of nature once again.  “Facing the threat of death, human beings have begun to reflect seriously, only to realize that a lack of awe-inspiring social truths will lead to more harm and more risks.  “The greedy heart is being purified , and the mouth that loves to eat is being punished by the virus.   “The people who have been soaking in the bright red and green lights, all night have been driven home by the virus.  Go home.  “There are lesser people on the street, fewer cars on the roads but , the air is getting fresher, the haze has gone, the sky is turning bluer, the sun is getting brighter, and the family is drawing closer.    “Harmony has descended in people's hearts putting a value in relationships.  “People who have not read for many long years, have picked up books at home.   “Parents and children who have had no or almost no communication with each other, couples who find difficulty talking, have opened the lid of the conversation box.   “Children who do not know how to respect the elderly have begun to be filial.  “The virus taught human beings a vivid and profound lesson. It made them understand awe.   “It shouted to one’s ear, to realize what is called ""Good Times”, feel what is true love on earth. It brought us gradually to fall in love  saying “Return to the Road"".   “We should really be grateful for this ""enemy"".   “We need such an “enemy"" in our fragility to give us a “reminder"" to have ""empowerment"" once again.   The virus will not leave so quickly, until there is a “cultivation"" of good human habits, and it will not continue to rage because human love will gather more power to defeat this plague.   “Time will tell us everything, and prove what is right.  “I really like ""quiet China"", and I hope Chinese people will take the initiative to build a ""quiet China"" without the virus reminding them again.”           ""*Quiet China; good""*  Written by a Chinese pastor sent to a brother in Istanbul via friends in Singapore.(translated and edited for clarity )",20/2/20,492,Economic Measures,494,4,-11.01582275,105,21,8,2.384815142,0,1,1

"Dear PM Lee, Thank you. Yesterday was another historic day for Singapore.  Singapore delivered. Post budget speech, again, I went to sleep peacefully and work up early morning  peacefully. I know we we are safe and well loked after.  I am I am indebted to all who contribute, also as our scarce fiscal reserves are still safeguarded, unlike most countries in the world. We only know to well, having learned from global and regional contagion risks and crises, the importance of being prepared. Many countries have much to learn and emulate Singapore.  We also need to do our part and contribute. As for doing my part and making a humble contribution, I hope to leave to Pakistan to attend  an International Peace Conference, with the hope of learning about their peace process and peace dividends, to build relationships that will help to build stronger buisiness relationships between Singapore and 20 countries who are members of the International Peace Leaders Institute. And simultaneously, I am negotiating with many other economies and forums to partner, to achieve the same.  Many blessings for continued good health to your family, staff, and all teams fighting hard to protect the little red dot.  Singapore Special Voices also send their thanks and best wishe to all of you.  Three cheers to the World's best PM and PAP. You have my support and vote.

Singapore yearly budget is heavily dependent on NIRC provided from GIC & Temasek . Once in a while MAS will transfer extra funds to either GIC or Temasek to grow the NIRC contribution....is it wise for MAS to transfer funds to GIC instead of investing the funds by themselves ? GST should not be seen as the only tool to raise funding to use for government projects....if everything just increase GST....then there is no need for PAP to exist anymore....because any political parties can do that function too.  What PAP 4G ministers should do is to try to create more routes of revenue....just like what the pioneer generation of pap leaders did during the early years of independence.

"As a mature Singaporean, I could benefits from this initiative but it still depends on 3 factors; 1. HR department will have to override their existing hiring software used to screen through suitable jobs applicants and revert back to manual screening. Most would not bother as the process is time-consuming and they have to take on other duties like payrolls, training, etc. Hence they would just give excuses to MOM that they cannot find suitable candidate and still hire foreign workers. This is the sad local hiring culture! 2. Large portion of the people who are in the HR field are non Singaporean. Can't blame them if they preferred to look after their 'own' people.  3. The Chief Hiring Officers will not be doing their full diligence as they will be busy with office politics and getting certifications like ISO, Bizstar, etc, instead of checking how effectively their companies are in hiring locals. They just don't want to keep digging deeper and just treat the symptoms but not the root of the problem.

How to return the 53 billion taken from the reserve. Wage cut for those top earner working in the Govt sectors. Higher tax from those top earner both in the private or Govt sectors. Social tax on foreigners eg DPH.PR. Build and maintain only if necessary. Eg East coast MRT line can be delay until they have earn enough $$ from other MRT lines. EW and NS line interchange delay in building it. Raise up those low land coastal area first since the rate of raising sea level is small. Extend the lease of HDB flat without bring it down and rebuild.This save lot of cost for the residents. Do away those useless R and D which products or services are not sellable. Eg What can a robot dog do in a confine space in search and rescue operation. Cost cutting in all Govt sectors. Eg Since most students perfer poly route into university.Cut down PU from two years to one years . Pri sch cut down to one years.O level cut down to 3 years .Study smart .Do not study hard. Spend less than the tax collected. The tax collected depend on the number of residents in the workforce and the population number. With an aging population .They will be less residents in the workforce thus comsumer spending will be less .Thus less tax can be collected.Depending too much on the internal economic for tax  .The residents will get poorer.

I have always maintained that I'm neither pro-govt nor pro-opposition, but pro-Singaporean and all these measures I believe, only seek to help Singaporeans. Certainly, there will come a time in the near future, when the economy is strong enough, that some taxes will go up to replenish our reserves. That is to be expected and if done at a time of plenty, is a less bitter pill to swallow than if no assistance is rendered now.

"DPM Heng, What do you mean, 'Singapore's reserves are for rainy days, COVID-19 already a 'mighty storm'?   The latter is certainly more powerful and serious.  This means that the Singapore's reserves have been blown away by the mighty storm.   In plain language it is gone.    NO more cash flow, the cash flew!   Oh, now I understand.  Dear PEOPLE, the cat is out of the bag.   Bo Lwee Leow!   Whenever the Si Kwee Kia PM LHL calls the GE take the bold step and go for your life ......Vote PAP OUT!    Your lives will be better.   Fortune favours the brave.   Don't be kiasee, kisasu and kia chenghoo.   Most important:  Mm tang sio thum!  Or don't go for petty stuff (Hokkien).   Vote in the New Government.   Singapore will be RESTRUCTURED.  From the top down.   NO more wayang.  You will get The Real Deal that is truly beneficial.   P.S.  I'll reiterate:  The PM salary should be $600,000.00 a year.  NO further claim payable and NO bonus.  That's it.  All perks that go with the office stay.  The ministers will then get a proportional sum of what the PM earns.  Ordinary MPs to get $18,000.00 when first elected.  After serving one year they will be paid $20,000.00.  Monthly.   ALL politicians must work full time.  Absence from Parliament question time must be justified with a written excuse or doctor's certificate.  NO sleeping in Parliament.  Suspension if caught napping.  This is the beginning of The New Dawn.   RISE!   Be Responsible, Inclusive, Sagacious, Ethical.   More, more, more.  These are NOT thought bubbles that will ultimately burst and come to nothingness.   There must be details, details, details.   Just for brevity and to avoid tedium this is just a snapshot of things to come.

Asking LTA to ""think"" of help for Taxi Drivers is a Joke , they prefer to help PHVL because they are more easy to control ! Asking taxi drivers to become a bus driver because of current issue is like getting more people to get involved in accident, why because most taxi drivers are in their late 40ties , 50ties and 60ties. To ferry 4 pax in a taxi already take up lots of concentration on a 10 hrs shift, now he wants the poor Old man to ferry a bus load ! Does he know what's the work like of a bus captain? Did he go down and did a Practical test ? A bus captain have a time schedule from the bus company to follow, he can't be late nor too early to reach his destinations !

"To understand the origin of covid19, one has to look at viral genomes as they do not lie. Below study by three Chinese scientists and a scientist at St Louis University using global data is revealing. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2?fbclid=IwAR2CGS10WR9_5KUxmsWTfNBSD7W5_OXdgLR_Pts5EcW807oRyysMg3msF78  They discovered that there are two sources and Wuhan's source (Type II) was like a child virus and it inherited from a parent (Type I). So Type 1 source could spread itself or mutate itself to create child viruses just like the case in Wuhan. But there was no Type I in Wuhan so Type I was from a different location.  Their study makes sense because when one looks at the example of Italy. Italy has banned the Chinese on Jan 31 which is also what SG had done but Italy's measure was more stringent as they banned all flights from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau too. If one looks at the current outbreak, it happened from late Feb onwards. Given the 14 days of incubation period, the outbreak if spread by Chinese visitors shd have started in mid Feb. So its current outbreak could be due to Type II (a child virus just like Type I mutation in Wuhan) or directly from Type I which source is not from China.  Indeed, as reported in the Guardian https://bit.ly/3cG7OBt : ""....laboratory tests that isolated a strain of the virus from an Italian patient, which showed genetic differences compared with the original strain isolated in China and two Chinese tourists who became sick in Rome.""  The current global outbreak happens because the western countries believe that it is a Chinese disease (by eating wildlife) and they never look at their backyard that the source is actually there.",13/3/20,274,Economic Measures,279,4,-11.47303345,48,11,2,4.536420495,0,0,1

"I will try to explain my daughters’ condition to my best efforts. Hwee Suan was supposedly diagnosed with a chronic, lifelong condition called Short Bowel Syndrome  (SBS), more like similar treatment, she do not have an exact diagnosis yet). I had problems explaining her conditions earlier because She don't have an exact diagnosis yet Individuals with SBS suffer from mal-absorption, compromised immune systems; rely on IV nutrition because they can't absorb nutrients, always at risk for infections that could turn fatal in second, chronic diarrhea, electrolyte deficiency, oral aversion, etc. Hwee Suan has spent over half of her life, living in the hospital; she has had over 10 surgeries including peripheral line insertions. People think that because she ""looks"" good and has stayed out of the hospital, everything is ok. We are truly grateful she is out of the hospital and has been as healthy as She can be thank Guan Yin Ma, but this is our lives. Short Bowel Syndrome in INCURABLE. I've been fighting for over 7 years now and I will continue but just like everything else, some days are tougher than others, and her Mid-Sep14 days hospital admission with zero home leave was one of those days. I recall growing up watching NKF donation on TV and saw how many people moved to tears. It’s such a horrifying condition. Well that’s before I got to know about SBS and TPN For people with kidney failure, they need each hemodialysis treatment lasts about four hours and is done three times per week. TPN needs 14hours of infusion 3-4x a week on a cycling basis. While there are outpatient centers for Dialysis.  The difference is, there NO outpatient centers for TPN Both go long term and need a port/ peripheral line to run the treatment. Both sicknesses run the risk of running out of access when all the vessels collapsed and the patients lost their “lifelines” A kidney patient gets cured with a transplant. Some TPN patients need a transplant.  The difference is, Kidney transplant (usually one organ) is approved in Singapore BUT INTESTINE TRANSPLANT (usually need 2 organs – intestine and kidney from a living donor) IS NOT APPROVED IN SINGAPORE yet. Both Kidney dialysis and organ transplant patients are covered under medishield life extended outpatient treatments. I really really MOH will understand that TPN outpatient is really a treatment that they should support. CURRENT Criteria for Long-Term and Home PN for MediShield Life Coverage and MediSave The patient will require TPN for a minimum of 90 days. The reason is even dialysis treatment which was just 4hours therapy need not administered for 90days straight to be eligible for MOH outpatient claims for outpatient treatment. https://www.moh.gov.sg/.../medishield-life-coverage-extended The issue is TPN therapy needs a COMPULSORY break to alternate between TPN and glucose/premix infusion to prevent liver failure. It's medically dangerous to infuse TPN for 90days straight without breaks (we used to alternate between premix and glucose infusion) because 90 days straight infusion of TPN will cause liver failure and death. WE NEED SUPPORT. All of you out there who have helped or supported us even by sharing a post to spread awareness. Please help us write into MOH council for a review of the TPN policy.  we sincerely hope the policymakers will speak to the patients and the doctors before issuing any policys.  A wrong policy ruin lives. appreciate if you could help us write into MOH to appeal for a review of the TPN policy. The background to this request is the medishield council is seeking people's views on these ""preliminary recommendations"", with a public consultation held till Oct 20. https://www.straitstimes.com/.../medishield-life-to-offer...? 1. ACTION 1 - Read my post below and share my post. We appeal for a change of outpatient TPN 90days policy. We will greatly appreciate if MOH will seek the doctors on the serious side effects of 90days TPN continuous infusion. A wrong policy ruin cause liver failure and ruins lives. https://www.moh.gov.sg/.../medishield-life-coverage-extended 2.

ACTION 3 - Please help us lobby for MOH to approve pediatric intestine cum live transplant ( as it it’s a system), paediatric intestine is currently not approved in Singapore.

"Ministry of Health, Singapore  I was at Bedok Polyclinic a few days ago. The staff have started measuring temperature of everyone entering the polyclinic. A staff used a forehead thermometer while another used an ear thermometer. One must insert the ear thermometer properly into the ear in order to do an accurate reading. In addition, it takes longer for the staff to measure someone’s temperature using the ear thermometer, compared to a forehead thermometer. I would suggest the Polyclinic provides forehead thermometer to their staff instead of the ear thermometer so that they don’t have to come into too close contact with visitors and patients.   Next, it’s regarding water supply in the toilet inside the Bedok Polyclinic. In one of toilets, the water from the taps at the basins were flowing out so little and cut off so fast that it has become so difficult to do a proper hand washing. I am not sure if the same happens in the other toilets in Bedok Polyclinic, or even in other polyclinics. Is this done to cut cost? I think, the polyclinics should provide an environment to facilitate the public into practicing proper hygiene measures, especially in the current time of an epidemic event.   Hope the relevant authority will look into the matters so that  the staff in the polyclinics, together with the public, can protect themselves better in face of this COVID19 epidemic.",15/2/20,236,Economic Measures,233,4,-11.17257145,39,6,1,6.051820414,1,1,1
