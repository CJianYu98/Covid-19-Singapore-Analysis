26,29,"What should NTUC do for their members? Is insurance the answer? What else is missing? What did I write on this in 2011? ====== Forum: A good insurance plan can help the jobless, while avoiding pitfalls PUBLISHED6 HOURS AGO on 8th Marh 2021 in ST Forum FACEBOOKTWITTER The idea of implementing an unemployment insurance scheme in Singapore has been mooted several times over the years, and it was again discussed at a recent Parliament session. The pushback on its introduction has always been that such a scheme may lead to the unemployed not wanting to seek employment. However, implementing this scheme and encouraging the unemployed to actively seek employment need not be mutually exclusive if the insurance scheme is carefully thought out and calibrated to avoid unintended pitfalls. A potential unemployment insurance scheme could base its premium on policyholders' declared monthly income. In the event of verified unemployment, the monthly payout could be pegged at a certain percentage of the insured's last drawn monthly salary, subject to a maximum of 24 months' payout. The payout could be calibrated in such a way that it would not see the insured falling into immediate financial hardship, but yet not be lucrative enough to discourage the insured from actively seeking employment, since the payout would be only a fraction of his last drawn monthly salary, and will last for only a period of time. As the economy transforms and the employment landscape goes through structural changes, I believe more people will go through periods of unemployment during their career. Such a scheme will go a long way in helping individuals and families to weather periods of uncertainty in their lives. Luo Siao Ping",2021-03-08,274

1877,257,"Let‚Äôs have good inclusive schemes for the low-wage Singaporeans , not just sticking to old mind sets or western HR practices blindly ! We not only need to raise the low wages of our workers at the bottom but also have to remove the social stigma against them and give them the much needed respect and career advancement opportunities .  For example ÔºåNEA may want to think out of the box and consider an innovative proposal to draw up a common public health -essential service professional workers scheme to attract Singaporeans to join and serve as a life long career in this essential public sector . Such common service scheme respects and treasures every worker right from the bottom as a cleaner up to the top as a public health manager or superintendent. Young and old Singaporeans regardless of their educational levels or English proficiency can be encouraged to join as public health workers doing the cleaner‚Äòs job at a good starting salary of say $2000 pm for a headstart.The more positive and ambitious ones will be given ample on-the-job career training and development opportunities under the scheme to upgrade themselves to take up various higher job responsibilities Ôºåsuch as truck driverÔºå machine & tool workshop technician, auto-machine operatorÔºåplumberÔºåforemanÔºåsupervisorÔºåmanager Ôºå public health inspector Ôºåpublic health trainer Ôºå public health enforcement officerÔºåpublic health supprintendant and even as a certified public health consultant or a licensed cleaning contractor or SME boss in this industry,as they gain more practical experiences, higher job skills and relevant job interests while working and growing from the bottom to the top and to the best of their ability and hard work. If this pilot scheme proves to be successful for the essential public sector , similar common and inclusive schemes can then be widely implemented for other low wage Singaporeans to bring them into the main stream of our entire workforce in every industry so that we dont depend too much on FW to keep Singapore clean ,healthy and staying  ahead of others as a great city within a garden! More importantly ,we don‚Äôt become panic and helpless if the FW for any future reason will not or cannot come to Singapore to work any more.

Most would not bother as the process is time-consuming and they have to take on other duties like payrolls, training, etc. Hence they would just give excuses to MOM that they cannot find suitable candidate and still hire foreign workers. This is the sad local hiring culture! 2. Large portion of the people who are in the HR field are non Singaporean. Can't blame them if they preferred to look after their 'own' people.  3. The Chief Hiring Officers will not be doing their full diligence as they will be busy with office politics and getting certifications like ISO, Bizstar, etc, instead of checking how effectively their companies are in hiring locals. They just don't want to keep digging deeper and just treat the symptoms but not the root of the problem.

Social tax on foreigners eg DPH.PR. Build and maintain only if necessary. Eg East coast MRT line can be delay until they have earn enough $$ from other MRT lines. EW and NS line interchange delay in building it. Raise up those low land coastal area first since the rate of raising sea level is small. Extend the lease of HDB flat without bring it down and rebuild.This save lot of cost for the residents. Do away those useless R and D which products or services are not sellable. Eg What can a robot dog do in a confine space in search and rescue operation. Cost cutting in all Govt sectors. Eg Since most students perfer poly route into university.Cut down PU from two years to one years . Pri sch cut down to one years.O level cut down to 3 years .Study smart .Do not study hard. Spend less than the tax collected. The tax collected depend on the number of residents in the workforce and the population number. With an aging population .They will be less residents in the workforce thus comsumer spending will be less .Thus less tax can be collected.Depending too much on the internal economic for tax  .The residents will get poorer.

I have always maintained that I'm neither pro-govt nor pro-opposition, but pro-Singaporean and all these measures I believe, only seek to help Singaporeans. Certainly, there will come a time in the near future, when the economy is strong enough, that some taxes will go up to replenish our reserves. That is to be expected and if done at a time of plenty, is a less bitter pill to swallow than if no assistance is rendered now.  If you don't think DPM Heng or these measures his finance ministry came up with is deserving of a standing ovation, don't stand. No one is forcing you to. What are you trying to say when you give a standing ovation, but don't applaud? Who does that? If anyone knows of a current living culture/civilisation that practises standing ovations without applause, please enlighten me.

NO further claim payable and NO bonus.  That's it.  All perks that go with the office stay.  The ministers will then get a proportional sum of what the PM earns.

3983,2576,"To understand the origin of covid19, one has to look at viral genomes as they do not lie. Below study by three Chinese scientists and a scientist at St Louis University using global data is revealing. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2?fbclid=IwAR2CGS10WR9_5KUxmsWTfNBSD7W5_OXdgLR_Pts5EcW807oRyysMg3msF78  They discovered that there are two sources and Wuhan's source (Type II) was like a child virus and it inherited from a parent (Type I). So Type 1 source could spread itself or mutate itself to create child viruses just like the case in Wuhan. But there was no Type I in Wuhan so Type I was from a different location.  Their study makes sense because when one looks at the example of Italy. Italy has banned the Chinese on Jan 31 which is also what SG had done but Italy's measure was more stringent as they banned all flights from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau too. If one looks at the current outbreak, it happened from late Feb onwards. Given the 14 days of incubation period, the outbreak if spread by Chinese visitors shd have started in mid Feb. So its current outbreak could be due to Type II (a child virus just like Type I mutation in Wuhan) or directly from Type I which source is not from China.  Indeed, as reported in the Guardian https://bit.ly/3cG7OBt : ""....laboratory tests that isolated a strain of the virus from an Italian patient, which showed genetic differences compared with the original strain isolated in China and two Chinese tourists who became sick in Rome.""  The current global outbreak happens because the western countries believe that it is a Chinese disease (by eating wildlife) and they never look at their backyard that the source is actually there.",2020-03-13,274

The proportion of obese and overweight adults aged 18 to 69 years was 8.7% and 36.2% respectively in 2017. See: https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/resources-statistics/reports/executive-summary-nphs-2016_17.PDF  This compares very unfavourably with Japan, which has the lowest overweight and obese people at 23.8% among OECD countries, and South Korea coming second at 33.4% (data as of 2015).

4107,50,"I will try to explain my daughters‚Äô condition to my best efforts. Hwee Suan was supposedly diagnosed with a chronic, lifelong condition called Short Bowel Syndrome  (SBS), more like similar treatment, she do not have an exact diagnosis yet). I had problems explaining her conditions earlier because She don't have an exact diagnosis yet Individuals with SBS suffer from mal-absorption, compromised immune systems; rely on IV nutrition because they can't absorb nutrients, always at risk for infections that could turn fatal in second, chronic diarrhea, electrolyte deficiency, oral aversion, etc. Hwee Suan has spent over half of her life, living in the hospital; she has had over 10 surgeries including peripheral line insertions. People think that because she ""looks"" good and has stayed out of the hospital, everything is ok. We are truly grateful she is out of the hospital and has been as healthy as She can be thank Guan Yin Ma, but this is our lives. Short Bowel Syndrome in INCURABLE. I've been fighting for over 7 years now and I will continue but just like everything else, some days are tougher than others, and her Mid-Sep14 days hospital admission with zero home leave was one of those days. I recall growing up watching NKF donation on TV and saw how many people moved to tears. It‚Äôs such a horrifying condition. Well that‚Äôs before I got to know about SBS and TPN For people with kidney failure, they need each hemodialysis treatment lasts about four hours and is done three times per week. TPN needs 14hours of infusion 3-4x a week on a cycling basis. While there are outpatient centers for Dialysis.  The difference is, there NO outpatient centers for TPN Both go long term and need a port/ peripheral line to run the treatment. Both sicknesses run the risk of running out of access when all the vessels collapsed and the patients lost their ‚Äúlifelines‚Äù A kidney patient gets cured with a transplant. Some TPN patients need a transplant.  The difference is, Kidney transplant (usually one organ) is approved in Singapore BUT INTESTINE TRANSPLANT (usually need 2 organs ‚Äì intestine and kidney from a living donor) IS NOT APPROVED IN SINGAPORE yet. Both Kidney dialysis and organ transplant patients are covered under medishield life extended outpatient treatments. I really really MOH will understand that TPN outpatient is really a treatment that they should support. CURRENT Criteria for Long-Term and Home PN for MediShield Life Coverage and MediSave The patient will require TPN for a minimum of 90 days. The reason is even dialysis treatment which was just 4hours therapy need not administered for 90days straight to be eligible for MOH outpatient claims for outpatient treatment. https://www.moh.gov.sg/.../medishield-life-coverage-extended The issue is TPN therapy needs a COMPULSORY break to alternate between TPN and glucose/premix infusion to prevent liver failure. It's medically dangerous to infuse TPN for 90days straight without breaks (we used to alternate between premix and glucose infusion) because 90 days straight infusion of TPN will cause liver failure and death. WE NEED SUPPORT. All of you out there who have helped or supported us even by sharing a post to spread awareness. Please help us write into MOH council for a review of the TPN policy.  we sincerely hope the policymakers will speak to the patients and the doctors before issuing any policys.  A wrong policy ruin lives. appreciate if you could help us write into MOH to appeal for a review of the TPN policy. The background to this request is the medishield council is seeking people's views on these ""preliminary recommendations"", with a public consultation held till Oct 20. https://www.straitstimes.com/.../medishield-life-to-offer...? 1. ACTION 1 - Read my post below and share my post. We appeal for a change of outpatient TPN 90days policy. We will greatly appreciate if MOH will seek the doctors on the serious side effects of 90days TPN continuous infusion. A wrong policy ruin cause liver failure and ruins lives. https://www.moh.gov.sg/.../medishield-life-coverage-extended 2.  ACTION 2- Details on the preliminary recommendations can be viewed, and feedback submitted. https://www.moh.gov.sg/e-consultation/mshl2020 3. ACTION 3 - Please help us lobby for MOH to approve pediatric intestine cum live transplant ( as it it‚Äôs a system), paediatric intestine is currently not approved in Singapore. We hope for a change and need a change before some children runs out of ‚Äúlife lines‚Äù and lose their lives. So now, we speak up, the above will really help us and the other families who has a child with small bowel syndrome or medical conditions which require TPN. A big thank you to all for reading.

In addition, it takes longer for the staff to measure someone‚Äôs temperature using the ear thermometer, compared to a forehead thermometer.
