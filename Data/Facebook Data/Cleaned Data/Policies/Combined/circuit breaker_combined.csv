"COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES  PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money. The governments moon shot daily testing program will cost £100 Billion roughly two thirds of the annual NHS budget.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.

Widely reported asymptomatic incubation period was the critical blind spot that the MTF failed to address in Feb when the Wuhan couple started the church cluster resulting in unnecessary Circuit Breaker and drawing down more than necessary from our reserves.  2) There is a growing number of ""soveriegn"" public  who openly pull down their mask to expose their nose or mouth in public, neighbourhood shop area with zero enforcement from the authority.  3) A growing number who AFTER exercising and after cooling down, are not wearing mask walking relaxingly in public on their way home.

"The Flawed PCR Test You might have the virus, but so what? That doesn’t mean you’re sick!  * https://youtu.be/SjyfTvdr1_s Virology is Hoaxology: Viruses do not exist. Period.  Even if you strongly believe in germ theory, there are some serious problems with the generally accepted method of testing for a virus, it’s called the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test.  The PCR test amplifies a specific region of a DNA strand (the DNA target)—It is qualitative not quantitative; in other words, it can tell you if a virus is present or not, but it can’t tell you in what quantities, and it can’t make any accurate assessment about whether the presence of that virus or not is enough to cause disease.  The US CDC admits that a positive coronavirus COVID-19 test (using the PCR method) doesn’t mean the virus is causing the disease/symptoms you may have.  1. These are the actual words of the US CDC: “Positive [test] results are indicative of active infection with 2019-nCoV but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.”  2. These are the actual words of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and the Chapter of Infectious Disease Physicians, Academy of Medicine, Singapore, point no.5: https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf Microbiologic Data for Period of Infectivity and Viral RNA Shedding: ""It is important to note that viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus.""  So, what are testing centres actually testing and looking for besides SARS-CoV-2 virus?  A rhinovirus? An influenza virus? A dead cell? A coronavirus particle from past infection? An exosome? Alien contaminants? Unauthorised DNA harvesting?  This is the reason why majority of the people using this fraudulent PCR testing method will test positive again and again.  More fake science PCR testing will only escalate infectivity numbers creating fear and panic globally.  * https://youtu.be/xY8YHtJOanM Dr Stefan Lanka, biologist, virologist Viruses do not exist RT-PCR test and circular reasoning  It is interesting and extremely telling to note how fast BBC was to announce this damning verdict in 2015:  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31864218 while the appeals and two later verdicts, the last one in The German High Court in January 2017 where the measles skeptic WON FULL VICTORY and where the claimants were forced to pay all costs of the court-case, BBC so CONVENIENTLY IGNORED!   22.01.2017: Judges at the German Federal Supreme Court have CONFIRMED THAT THE MEASLES VIRUS DOES NOT EXIST, vindicating 'conspiracy theorists' who have said that no study has ever proven the existence of the virus.  The First Civil Senate of the BGH has confirmed the judgment by the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart (OLG) of the 16 February 2016. The sum of €100,000 which the biologist dr. Stefan Lanka had offered as a reward for scientific proof of the existence of the alleged measles virus does not have to be paid to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also was ORDERED TO BEAR ALL THE PROCEDURAL COSTS.  Five experts have been involved in the case and presented the results of scientific studies. All five experts, including Prof. Dr. Dr. Andreas Podbielski who had been appointed by the OLG Stuttgart as the preceding court, have consistently found that NONE of the six publications which have been introduced to the trial, contains scientific proof of the existence of the alleged measles virus. http://yournewswire.com/german-supreme-court-measles/  Is it strange that the commercial media is loosing credibility? Can BBC unjustly defame biologist dr. Stefan Lanka without any consequences?  * https://youtu.be/PWmRj1WWrSQ Dr Stefan Lanka  Measles Virus On Trial ",6/8/20,577,Circuit Breaker,587,4,-12.69752492,98,18,6,0.200727302,0,0,1

"Can MOH or the respective authority, ensure there is no 'Failure to Comply' of Safety Guidelines? Have witnessed several failures in enforcement not just from members of the public, but also from workers of malls and retail outlets, on the guidelines of safe distancing and proper mask-wearing. As it is, many are not wearing masks, and several more have them below their nostrils. I witnessed a Safety Ambassador speak to someone who wasn't wearing a mask in a Mall Basement buying food (the mask was tucked away deep in his large bag). There were no questions asked and the Ambassador walked away after her advise. The person continued to purchase food without any urgency to wear a mask! Furthermore, with no questioning done, could this person have roamed the mall with no mask prior to being seen? Also, why did the outlet serve the customer who blatantly breached the guidelines? 2 more were witnessed walking the malls with no mask on! They left the mall, with mall security looking perplexed as the person exited the doors, without stopping the individual to investigate or even advised to wear a mask! This person could have also roamed the mall for some time with no one even batting an eyelid! I can understand that authorities cannot be 2 places at one time, but guidelines are meant to be followed and any plan is useless if there is a failure to comply, by workers and establishments! Outlets should enforce refused service to anyone not wearing a mask properly until they do so, and not allow them to roam the premises with full ignorance! Any plan is useless if there is a 'Failure to Comply'. It's disheartening to witness this ignorance when the risk still exists. The more this complacency continues, the more a 'false sense of invincibility' grows, leading to less enforcement and more people turning a blind eye, since it was ok once, it will be ok once more.

"HIGH INFECTIVITY WITH LOW MORTALITY IS GOOD NEWS  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  BASIC UNDERSTANDING ON HOW OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM OPERATE  Everyone’s immune system is different but, as a general rule, as we expose to more pathogens, we develop more immunity.  Once an antibody has been produced, a copy remains in the body so that if the same antigen appears again, it can fight off more quickly.  That is why with some diseases, such as chickenpox, you only get it once as the body has a chickenpox antibody stored, ready and waiting to destroy it next time it arrives.  This is called immunity.  There are three types of immunity in humans called innate, adaptive, and passive:  Innate immunity: We are all born with some level of immunity to invaders. Human immune systems, similarly to those of many animals, will attack foreign invaders from day one. This innate immunity includes the external barriers of our body—the first line of defense against pathogens—such as the skin and mucous membranes of the throat and gut. This response is more general and non-specific. If the pathogen manages to dodge the innate immune system, adaptive or acquired immunity kicks in.  Adaptive immunity: This protect from pathogens develops as we go through life. As we are exposed to diseases or get vaccinated, we build up a library of antibodies to different pathogens. This is sometimes referred to as immunological memory because our immune system remembers previous enemies.  SUMMARY  The immune system is incredibly complicated and utterly vital for our survival.

"HIGH INFECTIVITY WITH LOW MORTALITY IS GOOD NEWS  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNDERSTANDING HOW OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM OPERATE Everyone’s immune system is different but, as a general rule, as we expose to more pathogens, we develop more immunity.  Once an antibody has been produced, a copy remains in the body so that if the same antigen appears again, it can fight off more quickly.  That is why with some diseases, such as chickenpox, you only get it once as the body has a chickenpox antibody stored, ready and waiting to destroy it next time it arrives.  This is called immunity.  There are three types of immunity in humans called innate, adaptive, and passive:  Innate immunity: We are all born with some level of immunity to invaders. Human immune systems, similarly to those of many animals, will attack foreign invaders from day one. This innate immunity includes the external barriers of our body—the first line of defense against pathogens—such as the skin and mucous membranes of the throat and gut. This response is more general and non-specific. If the pathogen manages to dodge the innate immune system, adaptive or acquired immunity kicks in.  Adaptive (acquired) immunity: This protect from pathogens develops as we go through life. As we are exposed to diseases or get vaccinated, we build up a library of antibodies to different pathogens. This is sometimes referred to as immunological memory because our immune system remembers previous enemies.  Passive immunity: This type of immunity is “borrowed” from another source, but it does not last indefinitely. For instance, a baby receives antibodies from the mother through the placenta before birth and in breast milk following birth. This passive immunity protects the baby from some infections during the early years of their life.  SUMMARY The immune system is incredibly complicated and utterly vital for our survival. Several different systems and cell types work in perfect synchrony (most of the time) throughout the body to fight off pathogens and clear up dead cells.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  PROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS Getting everyone infected during a virus outbreak to build immunity towards the virus—with special attention given to the vulnerable group—is the proven epidemiological and scientific model approach.  Majority of healthy individuals with a strong immune system can handle the virus with little to no symptoms or mortality.  That is why I mentioned high infectivity with low mortality is good news.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNPROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS Majority of countries i.e., Taiwan, Vietnam, etc., applied the unproven epidemiological and scientific approach by stopping their people from getting infected to build immunity towards the virus—with strict unproven lockdowns, wearing masks, social distancing and isolation, etc.—and waiting for the virus to die off is a risky unproven approach that will only prolong the pandemic leading to a 2nd wave.  The low infectivity and low mortality rate by applying the unproven epidemiological and scientific model will only look good on statistics and data.  What will happen in 3-6 months or a year from now if another coronavirus starts circulating again—and their people do not have immunity towards the virus?

"Economy Vs Lives  Why does Singapore have the highest rate of infection? Why are the infections largely in the dormitories?  Basic Science. Virus spreads more rapidly in densely populated cities and where people are in close contact.   Singapore is one of the most densely populated cities in the world and nigrant workers are living in crammed conditions  Solution: Stem the population and better living conditions for workers plus observing basic hygiene and morally responsible. If anyone is not well, even a slight flu, pls put on a mask and visit the doctor.  Can Singapore afford these solutions? The first part, stemming population would be a real challenge, economically  With lesser people, the economy will be limited, would not grow bigger than desired.   Housing costs will drop as lesser people will result to decrease in demands  However, if the population grows, the city becomes denser and another  pandemic flares, Singapore goes into partial lockdown again and the nation""s reserves may be used again  Stem the population because with lesser people, less densely populated, lives will not be at risk  Remember, virus mutates. Covid 19 is another variation of SARs. Its more infectious than SARS but not as lethal.

"Hi, may I know...Why are salons allowed to service customers who want to color their hair (which normally takes 1.5 to 4 hours, depending on the complexity of the coloring and hairstyling) but restrict TCM from treating their patients (acupuncture + guasha + cupping) to 45mins???   For the phase 1 circuit breaker, a TCM can only receive a patient at any one time and restricted treatment to 45mins.   Isn't it more dangerous to have customers who are strangers in the same salon for such a long period as compared to a husband and wife or family members staying together visiting the same TCM at the same time? A clinic and doctor definitely know how to handle and disinfect the equipment, areas that the patients use better than a salon, no?  Doesn't it makes more sense that the husband and wife or family member staying together scenario visiting and receiving treatment from the same clinic and same TCM doctor more safe than strangers sitting inside a salon for the duration of more than 2hours?

"As indicated on the above graphics - “Refrain from talking to prevent the spread of droplets”  -  Before June 2,  have witnessed people talking LOUDLY ACROSS the seats (opposite seat row) . Some even pulled down their masks to talk .  Yesterday, the first day of Phase 1 - all the Safety Distancing stickers were removed - people are sitting shoulder to shoulder; some engaging in conversation.  Peak hours - those standing are barely 1 metre apart - some were also talking away.  With masks on - they talk loudly - disturbing the peace during the ride.   Some pulled their masks below their noses, barely touching the lips and talking away.   Safety Ambassadors need to be MORE proactive;  Annoucements onboard trains/buses - reminding commuters to REFRAIN from talking  (pre-recorded announcement may already be in place; however it needs to be broadcasted REGULARLY and in ALL Languages).  It appears the MASSES have totally NO Concept on HOW THE VIRUS IS BEING SPREAD.   From the start, it has been the “ME, ME, ME, ME” mentality .  -  What’s wrong with ME talking ? -  What’s wrong with ME Not wearing my mask properly? -  What’s wrong with ME Not observing Safety Distancing? -  What’s wrong with ME taking my children &/or elders to the supermarket, food centre, park etc -  What’s wrong with ME sneaking a visit to my boyfriend’s or girlfriend’s home  (have witnessed such activities during the late hours ) -  IF I caught the virus - It’s MY PROBLEM !!!

My kid has a bad toothache and bleeding this morning and I called sch dental was told they r closed and called HPB and told all sch dental cannot open. Dental only for urgent case how would we assess what’s urgent what’s not. They ask us to go private dental or poly clinic and need to pay . Isn’t that increasing risk of getting virus? Shdnt we stay home as much as possible and yet now ask me to bring my kid here and there after school to fix her toothache . Why kids can still go sch but cannot go to the school dental within school premises if really in pain ? Isn’t it like telling ppl to exercise but clinics and hospital not open for u if you have a fall or injuried. Don’t understand why the easing of restrictions so weird one ?!?

Il m'a dit qu'il n'a pas besoin de mon argent mais il suffit juste que je paie l'argent des ingrédients pour produire ce portefeuille et m'a encore dit si j'ai les moyens de venir dans son propre palais mais j'étais dans la pauvreté donc j'ai dû faire ce travail de distance qui me produit 1.500.000 FCFA tout les vendredis de chaque semaine qui n'a pas d'inconvénient ni de sacrifice sur ma vie. C'est là que j'ai crû que le portefeuille magique existe vraiment. Frère et sœur arrêté d'envoyer vos sommes au profiteurs et aux faux marabout . *Maître KINIBO* est le seul marabout qui fait ce travail au Bénin et ce n'est pas seulement ce travail il fait quelques soit vos problèmes il pourra vous aider. *WhatsApp et Appel +229 98597620*,2/6/20,149,Circuit Breaker,195,4,-20.5554714,17,0,1,0.937103032,0,0,0

I have been wondering why do Singapore Authority had issued the enforcement for everyone to have a one-meter distance away from each other but have not heard any news until a period times, you can now hear the news to advise for everyone should wear a mouth mask when going out dating, shopping and other things you like to do. The PAP government had withdrawn money from the reserve is to first help the SIA from collapsing but I had been waiting a long time before I can hear the news to help and prevent the healthcare workers from collapsing. I had heard the news about Ho Chin had ordered the ST Engineers mouth mask manufacture to relocation from Taiwan back to Singapore because never knew our precious mouth masks can't be allowed spending back home. And what had happened, Why do the PAP government have negligence to provide enough mouth masks in this pandemic time. In the Sars situation, why do the PAP government had not to gain any experiences? And why do the PAP politicians can tell people, they are the right people who will always do the right things? I believe the PAP government should have helped to equip the CleanSpace Technology half-mask for the healthcare workers or evenly provide the service for the outpatients in hospitals and polyclinics when the patients have to see the doctor consultants. In these ways, many people will very happy to have more chances to buy mouth masks to protect themselves or helped to prevent the virus from spreading out more easily to others. And I had mentioned many times if the pandemic has become bad to worse because of the PAP government advice for not to wear a mouth mask if you are not ill or have shown any symptoms. I hope the PAP government will have the courage to apologize for not be really helpful.     ",11/4/20,347,Circuit Breaker,350,4,-10.67221865,84,13,5,0.943386302,0,1,1

Voicing our opinions are, most of the time, futile coz no one's gonna really walk the ground and truly understand the struggles of the average Singaporeans.

Bottom line is, the privileged are always going to continue to be the privileged lot and they are going to get their ways all the time anyway.

Year 2020 is really a very difficult year for many Singaporeans including myself due to Covid-19 pandemic. I'm really glad that 2020 is coming to an end. My condolence to families of those who have passed away due to Covid-19. May God bless their soul and they rejoice in the heavenly realm. The free Covid-19 vaccine from the Government is a God-sent gift of health to poor Singaporeans who want to be vaccinated but have no money and cannot afford it on their own. I am glad that our Government take care of this group of poor Singaporeans. 🍇,21/12/20,94,Circuit Breaker,98,3,-11.06377796,17,3,2,4.618820433,0,0,1

Will red dot encourage the UN and the WHO to do this:  the UN and WHO should get all countries to cooperate and shut down for 40 days and 40 nights to stamp out COVID-19?     The best of time is now for the countries in the northern hemisphere during this wintry period [Christmas, New Year 2021, and the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays] to shut down for 40 days [like in the olden days of the leprosy infection to quarantine the new arrivals until the all-clear signal to let them out]. Now is the time to do just that for the all-clear of infected persons to stamp out COVID-19 and force it to have a natural ending.  As for all other countries, those at the equator and those in the southern hemisphere [summer time], all should unite and comply to shut down too for 40s day to stamp out this disease well and good. Can the UN and WHO obtain this universal cooperation by all countries around the world to shut down this earth for 40 days and 40 nights at the same time? Time for the whole world to go into hibernation for 40 days.  If we don’t do we want to continue with the madness for another 400 or more days worldwide affecting the economy and all aspects of human lives.

Well tar is more difficult to clean up. It stays in our heart. I am a smoker and I have been going thru a tough time quitting it. Manage to cut from 20 to 10 now. Maybe ur leaders are smokers too and that’s why it’s difficult to ban it. I was in prison and I had no choice to not smoke it. But then the outside world isn’t that tempting but still I picked up the habit. Doing the right thing is important. I have done my part to cut down half. Can the government join us to help stop it?

What we do is deemed strict and too harsh in their eyes as freedom is put no 1 no matter what even if people die. Even wearing a mask is restricting their freedom 🤦 If Americans have any amount of respect for the 270k plus lives lost in the usa they will stop their selfish disgusting arrogant mindset and wear a mask,4/12/20,105,Circuit Breaker,107,4,-10.93302543,23,6,1,3.592315617,0,0,1

I guess one of the  main reasons  besides having more alternative voices is  PMET jobs expectations which I am considering it as a deep rooted issues amongst Singaporeans in the age group of 30 to 45 years old. This segment are losing job opportunities to foreigners. I have educated nieces and nephews ( master, honours degree and diploma holders from respectable and esteemed Singapore’s university and polytechnic)in the early thirties  and am afraid if MOM continues to bring in foreigners to fill those positions, am sure they will be greatly disappointed ! I reckon this age group falls on ‘swing voters’ category, hence please practise caution as they are feeling frustrated and  create job oppty for them and probably would I suggest ‘returning’ the job back to them and creating better oppty for SG future.

"Sir, I think the people in Sengkang must also have taken by surprise that the WP won because they took for granted that the PAP will always win and so they voted for WP without much thought of their capabilities.

Overall, I think it’s very dangerous a thing for many Singaporeans to have taken the PAP for granted, overheard a conversation that these youngsters keep voting for oppositions or for a change are playing with fire.

"Process: knowledge, skills, wisdom, and Enlightenment. How to learn? By massive action. You put the dots of knowledge, definition into mind. The more you use, the better you are until you do not know why you gain that. What needed? Love, support, understanding, patience encouragement from outside and inside. Then you will know Let all realize Key to human problems.  KEY:  Emotion comes from head, not heart Man search for feeling not meaning: house, car, ring, iPhone, Gucci, tattoos. Man's action is driven by NEEDS.  SLEEPNESS COME FROM WORRY OF THE DISEASES OF YOUR CHILD, THE ANGER OF THE WORKPLACE, THE FEAR OF YOUR FAULT MAY BE REVEALED. What's pill?  Do we forget? IT IS THE MIND  I doubt God and Holly: things changes constantly so no Constant ego after death. Jesu, Socrates, Gandhi, Luther King... was crucially killed. Lock, guards save the Pope  What is your name? What would be your name if your parents like another name? So if the name is a conditioned idea, do you think: religion, taboos, rituals CODED?  The living standard increases substantially but why the rate of mental illness, autism, ADHD, suicide, gunfire are soaring? Is there any hidden unknown philosophy may help?  The world is dependent, independent or interdependent? Do depression, autism, ADHD, violence, school problems and domestic problems, suicide, gunfire have hidden relation that we can effectively solve all?  And  The living standard increases substantially but why the rate of mental illness, autism, ADHD, suicide, gunfire are soaring?

"Life is art,  Life is simple, do not make it complicated.  Spirit can never measured by material.  Try to logical it, we will hit paradoxical world. Like paradoxical of Socrates. Like emptiness and egolessness when we try to find what life is. Like the way in Taosim.  Best of all, roots of all religions is love, kindness, compassion, virtues and principles. How do we know we are on the right way? Check the greed. Check the anger. If they have these, all words are cheatings. These come from Ingnorance. 8 Noble paths.  When we on the right way: we will free from greed, anger and ignorance. Then we can sense inner peace, peace of mind on a chaos life. Reach enlightenment, awaken with knowing nothing. Live with mindfulness. Peace in eating Peace in giving Peace in taking Peace in spending This life is touching, moved, inspired. They are our real friends, called Gods or great men in the history. To the healers: we are only repair the different fruits of same roots. Buddha taught: greed, anger and ignorance are the roots of all suffering.  I just have feeling that: autism, adhd, depression, stroke, addcition, violence, gunfire.... are the different names of suffering. Naming to know it, Not naming to seperate it as an seperation entity. You can never find real cause You can never find concrete cause. Because: the world have characters changing, and interdependent, nothing stay the same: we have Planck time. All we live under the hologram. Our 5 senses are too small, too little, too illusive to know what the world is. Just breathing, feel the breathing, calm the mind, feel the body, watch the thought, contemplate on things: we will find, life is miracle. Try to find the roots: then repair it. We will find it is astonishingly simple and astonishingly effective. This is the Tao This is the way of great men. They find earth is heaven! We are live on heavenly earth. Scientist can never find any place like earth in the distance of millions of light-year. . . . We will fail, if we help and still have full of Greed, Anger and Ignorance! No matter how Rich, Wealthy, Success, powerful we are, we may still suffer lots of these signs.  We may still suffer if we still the slave of greed. Greedy men have hundred wants a day, the will not be satisfied with half of that wants, it means they will anger,  or not happy, in other words, they may still suffer stress in Abundance living.  It is the mind, not the conditioned of living It is the combination of all senses make the eating, living, enjoying or suffering that we may not notice, but it still controls us unconsciously. Ex: will you pay $1000 for hearing a song played by a great violist in the subway? Will you pay $1000 for a delicious meal served on the dirty street sidewalk? Will you enjoy food in the restaurant in five star hotel when you know your kid ill or in danger? Why you need all hundred factors to enjoy a delicious meal in the five-star hotel: air, color, perfumes, waiters, waitress, customer services, cloth, forks, music...? Do you go for eating with mouth or what? Got it: all combine into a phenomenon, then from it, it makes the quality of feeling. Sorry, I see men just search for feeling. So it can make you what make kids poor in eating, sleeping, learning, and playing. It is the meeting of hundred phenomena, it is the illuminating of thousand phenomena or the hologram of millions of things.   The best way is to learn the lifestyle of great men in history, not rich men! If not, many people may have to take medicine for the months, years, decade or lifetime just to find the temporary relief. We maybe are wrongly coded about Rich or Money.  FORGOTTEN STRESS Stress cause insomnia Stress makes poor learning Stress make poor eating Stress makes we act unusually Stress reduces sexing Stress can break school and family. And Maybe  Autism, ADHD, depression, and suicide have the key of helping lies in the mechanism of medicine, lifestyle, love, anti-depression medicine, good communities, a good act, kind works; all have the same mechanism of creating happy hormones in the body: serotonin, oxytocin, and dopamine. Health comes from balancing.  REDEFINE OF STRESS The right definition of stress: human beings have basic human needs described by Abraham Maslow. Anything threatens of satisfying these needs will lead to Fight and Flight responses. If people cannot change the situation, threaten, they will be the victims of STRESS AND STRESS HORMONES. You will easily find the keys to all social phenomena in: ""Awaken You Wonderful We"" if you are familiar with the books of Malcolm Gladwell: Outlier, David and Goliath and Blink. These books give me a lot of question to ponder and find out the good answer by combining medicine, pharmacy, sociology, leadership, psychology, philosophy and religions.  It is in Mind.  Meditation, alternative therapies, NLP, Affirmation, love-hug-kindness can help to control and master the mind.  Science reaches to the fail of finding a single cause of the diseases from the mind: mental illness, thinking, and poor abilities.  Because the mind is not like body. The body will give away all you put in just in several hours or days according to its half-life: food, vegetable, medicines, chemical, additives, mercury, gold, nutrition. Even body can heal the small abnormal cause by X-ray.  But the mind keeps all in the conscious mind and subconscious mind. Millions of events, phenomena called Negative thinking, negative events, negative emotions and negative experiences compound into diseases in mind, brain, body, abilities, genes,  and health. It covers all terminologies in medical books. They are interdependent factors. How can Scientist figure out a single CAUSE?  ****************************** V. The reviews:  Văn Duy Đào well read article, i agree with it, some on here are assuming Autism is a disease or caused by pesticides, i have limited social skills as well as my boys,only downfall. assumptions like these are what keeps people looking at us like we are freaks, there is no cure and never will be, hate to say it but my parents had mental disorders my mom bipolar my dad OCD, maybe the cause all ik is i am unique therefore blessed, i can go through life wishing or i can go through life accepting and coping, i wish i could do alot others can like socialize, i wish my kids were like everyone elses, then i realize that all 3 of us are truly blessed with health, family and love, love for ourselves and others even those who judge us, you are a very intelligent individual and reading your comments has enlightened me, ty  ************ Thank You Duy. I am happy there are more people who know we are all humans and we can all heal.

Thank you for lifting some SD measures so the economy can restart to gear 1 again. But I must say that there are still many disobedient selfish residents who still disobey the previously imposed SD rules until today and the enforcement is very lacking even today when I visited Bedok Mall to buy some essentials I saw a person standing at the entrance exit of the mall eating and with mask on chin. He's probably very hungry but at least can eat in the car or some corner away from public. Nobody bother to stop him and no ambassador was in sight to advise him otherwise. I hope the authority can place more emphasis on enforcement and rid the society of these selfish people that will lengthen the CB period than it already had.,2/6/20,132,Circuit Breaker,134,4,-10.94299406,23,7,2,2.510750665,0,0,1

"Thank you Mr Lee. One of the allowable work post circuit breaker is for previously suspended renovation to resume. However, this is not happening easily, leaving many ID, contractors and home owners in a very frustrating and binding position. My family has been deeply affected. Our house don’t even have a main door due to sudden suspension of work. A home is the basic necessity of a family and with seniors as well as an infant in the home, we are living in uncertainty everyday. Thus far, the BCA procedure has been ineffective, confusing and very frustrating. While my ID has received approval, many of her sub contractors have not. In addition, there were insufficient slots for workers to sign up for the safety course and swap test that needs to be done before work can resume. This could take weeks or even months to complete. We need this procedure to be reviewed in order for the much needed suspended work to resume. It is meant to be prioritized right after circuit breaker so let’s make it a priority. Hope to receive your support in moving this work along. All we want, is a place to call home.",1/6/20,200,Circuit Breaker,198,4,-10.50561665,41,5,5,1.469426351,0,0,1

"To all those who said we should not remove sticker and markings on public transport, lets just say MRT, maybe you like to say how do you think it can be done to maintain 1 metre apart and leave 3 empty seats between passengers. During CB its possible becos only that limited number of essential people are out and running. Its common to see buses running empty and trains operating with so little people. But with Phase 1, dont even say Phase 3, with the opening to allow more people to go to work, maybe you can advise or suggest how possible is it to do it, rather than just say should still practice safe distancing in trains. Everyone knows, should. But how?? Your suggestions may not get a reply, i believe they are also trying to figure out a way on how to do it. Like what, from Pasir Ris once full with people at all markings and seats taken up with 3 empty seats between them, dont allow anymore people to board when reach Tampines? Doors dont open and continue to Simei? Or put up a bell to press like on buses to indicate you want to alight, so that from that door if 3 alight only 3 can board? Cmon, give suggestions for them to consider and think also. Its simply not possible. CB period can be done, cos not many people out there. Everyone knows it should be, safer to continue one more month, two more months, but how?? I also like to know how. Maybe out of 200,000 suggestions they can find 1 that works.",2/6/20,261,Circuit Breaker,271,4,-10.86357245,54,14,5,1.898665772,0,1,1

Dear Mr Lee  First I will like to express my sincere thanks to u n all the minister who really work hard to help the whole nation. I think spore govt handled v well.  By implementing the 3phase I think is a very good move.  But still we see alot pple not complying the rules so how can we help ??  By calling police ?  By telling them wear mask ?  By reminding them ???   I been highlight n cakes the police at least 10 times me n my neighbours that my BLK 678 hougang AVE 8 #01-519  everyday 530am to 6am  More than 15 pple are gathered to buy veg   No one came   So I'm quite disappointed to see such.  Here we are all working so hard n complying the rules but other such pple jus break it.   All elderly everyday they jus gathered to wait for the veg vendor to reach   I hope n urge Mr Lee pls assist   Thank you very much,1/6/20,152,Circuit Breaker,160,4,-12.23555198,34,2,9,2.756239748,0,0,1

"Dear Mr Lee  My house renovation works was stopped when the CB was implemented. I understand the need to do so.  However, today my renovation Contractors tell me that they cannot start work after 2 june on my 90% completed house because of bureaucracy and delay in getting their required certification and approval from the authorities even though they have made applications more an a week ago since the announcement by you were made.  The earliest they can start is in end June ( almost a month later)because they are allocated that timing for them to do the online test???   They all tell me they are ready and will follow the measures implemented but the timeline announced by the government is not realistic due to the current obstacles they are facing😓.  Please explain what is happening? Why make such optimistic announcements when on the ground it is not ready or possible to start. Hope you can look into this hiccups and bottlenecks with the relevant authorities.   We, home owners are suffering and being constantly being chased by Contractors and suppliers to deliver and complete their obligations as they are incurring holding and other cost and we are also incurring cost ourselves as we cannot shift into our homes.  We all understand the need to be cautious but why make such announcements when on the ground it is not helping us all. Some of the other homeowners that I spoke to express their frustrations too as our contractor are push around by the various departments when they try to expedite this process.   Please assist to address this in your coming discussions and next parliament session during this difficult time.

"Dear Sir, how about legalizing the ownership of cats in HDB flats? There has been an increase in people abandoning cats in HDB estates and also irresponsible ownership such as not neutering or spaying the cats, illegal breeding to sell and letting cats roam around, especially at dangerous places such as the ledge. As long as it remains illegal, many irresponsible owners of cats will continue to behave this way. It is in the humans and animal’s welfare to legalize it and enforce regulations on cat ownership in a responsible way, such as ensuring the cats are registered as pets like dogs, so as to be able to hold the owners responsible for abandonment. Animal welfare should not be limited to some species and not others. Singapore is a first world nation with 3rd world animal welfare considerations. I sincerely hope this will change soon!

"Thanks, PM Lee for sharing the lovely photo.  This is the Zouk otter family.  They originated from the Singapore River (near the former Zouk).  Zouk mum gave birth to 6 adorable otter pups at the Singapore Botanic Gardens in late 2019.  Sadly, only 2 of the 6 pups survived (see the link below).  This is the same family that appeared in the news lately at KK Hospital, Little India and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  As the pups are bigger now, they have been venturing around to look for a new home.  They went as far as Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park on 12 May, but were chased out by the Marina otter family.  Hope they could find a new home soon.  Agree that we should protect our native biodiversity and find ways to coexist with our local flora and fauna.   https://www.facebook.com/228574651250769/posts/793262941448601  For those who want to find out more about the otters in Singapore, do check out this informative interview with our local otter expert, Siva aka “Otterman”:  https://omny.fm/shows/money-fm-893/weekends-otters-in-singapore-with-otterman-n-sivas",29/5/20,160,Circuit Breaker,166,4,-12.49124735,25,3,3,1.639534625,0,1,1

So the elderly can have some form of companionship (thus, those without children can request for siblings or other relatives to visit)?

If it’s just for provision of companionship, then maybe those living with other relatives may not be allowed more guests to visit, as this may contribute to higher chances of cross-spreading due to big group gathering.

However I'd like to point out that it is confusing to say we're exiting circuit breaker when nothing much is really changing. People still aren't allowed to socialise, shops and gyms and public facilities are still closed. The first month was sensible, the second month was a safeguard, but why are we essentially extending lockdown for another month? Our community spread numbers are low and most people have been staying home for the past 2 months.  Some thought should be given to those who are literally earning zero income right now, eg. fitness instructors and personal trainers, freelance photographers, event organizers, and small business owners not allowed to open. How can they survive with bills to pay but 3 months of no income?   Why are children allowed to go back to school and visit their grandparents (the highest risk group), but siblings and significant others and friends are not allowed to visit?   More clarification would be most appreciated here, and hopefully further easing of CB measures similar to phase 2. And please don't say CB has been ""lifted"" or is ""ending"" because it most certainly is not.

"Personally, I am not comfortable with my girl returning to school when I am still working from home indefinitely. How is it possible that an organisation values the health and safety of its employees but MOE doesn't place the same importance for our children? There are examples abroad where the virus has spread among kids when schools reopened. Are you 100% confident that won't happen here? Not only do I have to worry about my girl getting infected, I live with an aged parent. So my concerns are VERY valid here since I have a vulnerable person living under my roof. And younger kids can't be trusted to maintain 100% social distancing on their own which means you are putting me in the position of having to walk by girl to and from school. More unnecessary trips outside the home than encouraged, am I right? Twice a day, 5 days a week? You also failed to get all the teachers and school staff to do the swab tests like the ones done for pre-school teachers. Just because schools closed for a month doesn't mean that none of them went out every other day or weekly for essentials like marketing and grocery runs. They could be asymptomatic and be a risk to our children. I think you've lost the plot if all these haven't been considered.

I am in the construction business and this recent covid crisis has created a heavy impact on our business across the board. Our profit margin is very small in view of competition and spiral cost increased over the years.  My foreign workers are seperated to live in different places to be in line with Mom requirements. Unfortunately one of the group stay in the dormitory contracted with covid virus. I have to shift them to a safe place to stay. In view of cost and easy management of my staff I gathered them to stay in the same place after medical check up to ensure they are all healthy while looking for another place for a group of 9 to stay. To my dismay most of the places like hotel which suggested by Mom rejected our application as they said if this group stay in a infected place before they will reject.   Even there are some landlords willing to let us rent they jack up their rental too high with no fault of ours. Mom staff has been giving us warning and I have written many letters to our MP and minister for help but no respond till now.   We are striving to survive in Singapore and we gave limited resources. Our profit margin from past and current projects are too leen for us to substantiate this unforseen cost.   We seek your help to provide solutions for us to survive and bring bread home for our family.

How do we know in our house hold one or two diagnosed with this virus without us knowing or they themselves know?  I think government should step up taking it's citizen's medical seriously.  Take batches to go for swab test. Community centres , padangs with tent or whatever it takes. Assigned team, issue citizen with appointment. Taking turn to take the test. We will definitely be more than happy to know if we are being taken care of rather than kept asking us to stay home/wear mask/social distancing etc.  Hopefully this will make an eye opener for ALL OF US that knowing that this virus can be a guest without us realising, is best to have all of us to take swab test.

"It is with disappointment to learn that for CB Exit, ""Phase 1 will take  at least 4 weeks"" & ""Phase 2 over a few months."" Almost 90+% or more cases were from FW dorms and as what our HM proudly declared, SG Covid-19 death rate is only 0.08%! Why can't Phase 1 be just 2 weeks & Phase 2 be 1 just month...!!! Businesses & workforce were already on WFH since 7 April and the longer the phases ride out, the more difficult will be the recovery challenges for SG businesses and our  economy to bounce back. Even if phases are speed up, businesses (primarily F&B, Retail & Travel) and the economy may not necessary pick up due to the new mandatory SOP i.e. safe distancing, etc...  China, South Korea and a few others are struggling to come back from lockdown as they cannot afford another lockdown despite the second waves!!!  With this second wave and the global travel restrictions still in force around the world, the respective countries' local retail trade consumption  not only did even resume but had dropped drastically as fear of global recession sets in amongst their workforces with many jittery over their job security and worldwide retrenchnent. MNCs around the world have gone bust within this short span of Q1 during the past 2-3 months, leaving a trail of declared bankruptcies in the wake... one after another!   Japan, one of the world's biggest economy is already in recession. The same cannot be said for SG... not only can we not afford a recession, we cannot survive a recession! So, please think twice before applying over cautious knee-jerk reactions simply for the sake of the emulating others in the play against Covid-19 number games.

"Dear government,  Under Phase 1 of the lifting of Circuit Breaker measures, hair salons will be allowed to offer all hair services, including rebonding, bleaching and colouring services that translate to customers spending long hours in the salon. It comes as a great surprise to me that the government feels that this is safe, while deciding that nail salons should not be allowed to reopen.   What makes nail salons less safe or less essential than hair salons?   Please do not get me wrong. My intention is not to petition for hair services to be suspended. My belief is that nail services are just as essential and can be conducted just as safely. As such, nail services should be allowed to resume at the same time as hair services.   Haircuts were deemed essential from the very beginning, and limited to one hour.   I strongly believe that manicures and pedicures are equally essential and can be kept to the same time limit. Ask anyone with ingrown toenails and they might tell you that pedicures are more a medical necessity than a vanity project. We are trained professionals who do not just beautify nails; we treat and we correct. We have many long-term clients who come to us regularly to help relieve the discomfort and pain of ingrown toenails.   Just as a haircut is necessary for basic grooming, so are manicures and pedicures. In a similar vein, extended hair services such as colouring and perms are similar to nail services like extensions and nail art. Not quite so necessary, but many might argue that they are essential for emotional and mental well-being. As the saying goes - if you look good, you feel good.  If hair salons are allowed to offer the full suite of services from 2 June onwards, why is it that nail salons are not allowed to open at all? Surely safety is not the reason.  Hair services can be done safely with social distancing measures and enhanced hygiene and disinfection protocols. The same can be said for nail services.  Even prior to COVID19, our nail technicians wore face masks at work. As the situation developed, we increased our precautionary steps and stepped up disinfection frequency, conducted temperature checks and had customers fill in health declaration forms, rearranged our furniture and reduced the number of workstations to ensure more than a 1 metre distance between clients, and also provided handwashing facilities, face masks, hand sanitizer, etc for our clients’ use.   At no point in time does the nail technician touch the client’s face. We only handle hands and feet, which are then washed and sanitized after the service. This makes us in fact even safer than a hair salon, where the hair stylist touches the hair, which is a lot closer to the client’s face than the hands are.  In fact, we go even further in implementing safety measures. During the Circuit Breaker, my salon already placed orders for safety equipment such as goggles and face shields, and table top barriers to minimize the chances of transmission via droplets in the air. We also plan to allow for greater buffer time between appointments to allow for thorough cleaning and disinfection of workstations.  It is a fact that nail services can be as safe, if not safer, than hair services, with all the measures as described above.    Yet, we are being relegated and overlooked, not allowed to resume business at the same time as our friends in the hair industry. In the meantime, the government tells us not to make manpower cuts or wage adjustments. Of course, we want to treat our staff well. Anyone who has the means would not choose to sacrifice their staff welfare or shutter for good. But please, tell me – how do you expect a nail salon to stay afloat when their income is through services, and not goods? We cannot rely on selling products to generate enough revenue to cover our staff salaries, rental, and other fixed costs. Every day that we stay closed means we bleed a little more. Any longer and we will haemorrhage to death.    Do you know how many workers are employed in the nail industry? That is the number of jobs that will be lost if you do not allow nail salons to resume business soon. It is a labour-intensive industry with low profit margins because our revenue is limited by our manpower. Our meagre profits do not afford us the luxury of waiting months before opening for business again.   If nail services were non-essential or compromised safety, I would not have said a word about having to stay shut.   I strongly urge you to reconsider and allow us to resume business from 2 June onwards.   We are just as safe and just as essential as hair services. Some might say we are more so.

And one main important thing for me personally, i have spoken more to my dad and done things together more in these 2 months than we ever had in the past 10 years. Seriously. I mean we are not exactly on bad terms. Just that i drive day, he drive night. The only times we talk is that splitting few minutes, if we meet. So not that i hope for the virus, but i can touch my heart and say thank you for this break in life, these slow 2 months to really reflect on my life.

"Dear PM, we Singaporeans are so fortunate to have a very caring PM & a team of dedicated Ministers. Thank you, Sirs! However I have observed that on the approvals of workers on-site for essential services, there seem to be a lack of coordination between Enterprise Singapore, MOM & MTI.  This has caused much inconvenience to the essential services industries. On another note, I hope that easing of CB restrictions should given priority to small companies with less than 10 employees or maybe less than 20 employees. These small companies are the worst hit & survival is critical to them if they are not given a lead start to resume their businesses. Appreciate if you could look into the above concern.

I have seen a number of messages in some Community Chat Groups asking for urgent help in finding alternative rental units during the CB period as their existing tenancy agreements are due to expire. Please pardon me for saying there is an apparent disconnect between permitting house moving but not (rental) property viewing during the CB period as residents cannot easily find replacement units without viewing.  I believe (rental) property viewing can be permitted with certain precautionary guidelines (e.g. compulsory mask wearing, social distancing, full record for future tracking, etc.) and on the basis that no large number of unknown parties will be involved in the process.  I hope the Government can look into this matter and take necessary actions accordingly.  Best regards, HUI Chi Shing",5/5/20,141,Circuit Breaker,141,4,-11.94609071,32,3,2,1.688435598,0,0,1

My above neighbour keep on holding gathering and having people come, stay, eat for hours in their house. Making noise for hours. From day 1 CB till to date it has been many times they have other people gather in their house. I had called the police to inform and they said will inform hdb when the hdb officers are now work from home. Others ask me submit case to One App, I did but till to date there is no action or authority to monitor them. On 6/5/2020 they had party in their house. Before that also they having guests coming to their house.  It just put us at uneasy feeling. We also want to have our family or friends to come over especially during this fasting month but as the rules did not allow we forget about it for the time being but why there is residents that simply break this law again & again. What did Housing & Development Board do about this kind of law breaker? How was the law that not allowing anyone not in same household to come to our house being implement? Imagine if their visitors those who have covid-19 without they know it, they will put all the residents in my block in ‘danger’. If those that did not wear mask, did not practice social distancing being punish and fine please do so to those who simply invite others and gather in their house during CB.

Assuming the 1 Jun 2020 extension meets all objectives, we will still only have a progressive rollback of measures over months as each COVID cycle is approx. 11-14 days.  If you as a business owner is holding out the hope of a quick return to normalcy on 1 Jun 2020, you are deluding yourself. A more accurate timeline is more likely to fall in July or August depending on your specific sector. The experts already know that a quick exit on a large aggregate of measures will risk a peak too high for the healthcare system to cope. The rollback of measures will probably start with the schools.  I hope this information is helpful as a data point to my fellow business owners navigating this storm.

"PM Lee, while we appreciate the migrant workers for their contribution to Singapore, we also need to be practical in the way we take care of them. I am not too sure the need to actively test them since in the beginning of the Covid-19, you said that we may not even take any action other than take care of those who succumb to the virus if the number get too big? Afterall, it really depnds on individual immunity. Is there a way to confine the worker to their dorms and sites, so long as they are not sick from Covid-19? Other countries are trying to move on by ringfencing the vulnerable post lockdown. Hence, post CCB, hope we could do the same by ringfencing the vulnerable so that the rest can resume their lives with the existing safety distancing, mask wearing etc. Hope that this can also apply to the migrant workers who are healthy whereby their movement is restricted to their construction site and the dorm. We should isolate the workers with underlying conditions as well as those of certain older age group. The rest should be allowed to work and have their movement restricted to sites and dorm. We can also provide entertainment such as movie nights etc for the dorm. This way, we can take care of both our economy as well as the workers who will appreciate not having to be quarantined.

"I fully agree with what Prof Tommy Koh said: “The way Singapore treats its foreign workers is not First World but Third World. The government has allowed their employers to transport them in flat bed trucks with no seats. They stay in overcrowded dormitories and are packed likes sardines with 12 persons to a room. The dormitories are not clean or sanitary. The dormitories were like a time bomb waiting to explode. They have now exploded with many infected workers. Singapore should treat this as a wake up call to treat our indispensable foreign workers like a First World country should and not in the disgraceful way in which they are treated now. I feel angry when I see foreign workers sitting on the ground eating their lunch. I see exhausted foreign workers stretched out on the ground to rest.” After the Covid-19 pandemic/CCB is over, the Sg Govt must do a thorough inquiry on why our MOM, NEA, BCA, dorms owners/operators n/or other relevant agencies had allowed the above poor living conditions to happen for so many years. They must be taken to task and take the blame for not able to do their job. Take away the license of the dorms operators/owners n impose a heavy penalty. In the mean time, all HDB 's elevators floors must be marked by tapes for safe distancing. Due to the small space in the elevators in the HDB estates, it should not allow for more than 4 persons in each of the elevator at any one time.

Many countries are adopting the 'wait till the cockroaches eventually start crawling out n resting on the bed' approach then their health care will then begin to deal with it and buying time for vaccines to intervene in due course..Our infected figures will be alarming for sure since with such aggressive testing but if our medical and MOH facilities and resources are able to substain then it is definitely a good move in a longer term so that even the vaccines will not be out this year we can still contain it . but if our medical facilities are totally exhausted because of the local transmission added to the infected rate,then the CB will have to be extend for another month probably to subdue the local transmission so our MOH and medical team can better focus on the foreign worker infected case.",18/4/20,208,Circuit Breaker,208,4,-11.10226756,36,10,3,1.954400763,0,0,1

"Dear Prime Minister,   I believe the circuit breaker can, to some extent, bring about some positive results. However, the rising numbers of new cases in the last few days do not bode well for Singapore and do shake the people's confidence that the situation is improving. You have explained the actions being taken by our noble health and medical team members whose efforts deserve everyone's applause. With concerted effort from everyone, I believe Singapore can overcome and drive away the dark cloud soon.  I do have a few comments though and seek your open heart and mind to listen. (1) Could the case numbers from the dormitories be preempted or at least mitigated? (2) Have the dormitory owners and operators not taken sufficient pre-emptive initiatives at the early stage when case numbers in Singapore were in the 2-digit range? (3) Nevertheless, when the Covid19 storm ends, hopefully soon, could the relevant government agencies work hard to set and monitor new guidelines to bring about better living conditions for the migrant workers who I respect for their contribution to our nation. (4) While existing dormitory standards may be considered decent, but Covid19 has revealed some deficiencies. I like to clarify that good dormitory standards do not just refer to the hardware. The way it is managed and monitored are equally important.  I am a retired Singaporean and am proud of our nation. I earnestly look forward to soon seeing the end of Covid19 and returning to my normal routines. I also suggest government agencies could retain some good practices implemented currently, such as more frequent cleaning of food centres, markets, public transports, public toilets, etc where people congregate out of necessity.

"The CB is good. Many people I observed are doing their part. But some leeway should be given to seniors who are above 65 years old. Allowed them to eat at foodcourts, hawker centres or coffeeshops. Put aside some tables and chairs with a notice to inform others that this condoned off area are for them only. And they must also  practice distancing. Reasons being at their age, some can't walk well and fast, am alone, have diabetes, high blood sugar and not very strong. If they are diabetic, their sugar can suddenly dropped and they can blackout. So they need to eat something. For those who are weak, walking home after buying their takeaway maybe difficult if they stay too far from the food centres. And being weak and alone, it is also difficult to carry their food.

World situation today. Jobs and projects w stopped. We should stop and cancel all unnecessary jobs and send off all unaffected workers back to their home country. When economy recovers it be sometime later and do employ locals or neighbor Malaysians that do not need Dorminatories facilities. Sending off cancel jobs workers free up space and clean space and use it for the infected to rest. As there are no vaccine.. Just like other countries  with huge now. They provide make shift non hospital stay area as care area.  Anyway economy w slow..

They themselves are not vulnerable and supposed to have little underlining disease; 2.       They are not living together with those vulnerable to covid-19; 3.       They pose little threat to overwhelming the health caring system of Singapore, as only 11 death by now, equivalent to 0.18% fatality rate lowest among any of the world, and 23 in ICU, equivalent to 0.5% of critical rate among the live cases, though several thousand new cases added by those living in dormitories. 4.       After the heard, they could resume working without worrying any more to spread covid-19 to those vulnerable of Singapore and resurgence within WP and SP holders living in dormitories should they not be herd.  The vaccines are still long way to go to help the herd immunity, which would be reached in most area of the world by resurgence of the outbreaks eventually. However, the dormitories could make this without posing high risks to themselves, to the neighbor communities and to the health care system.  Let’s have the herd in dormitories.

For education this part is it possible for childcare to conduct a online learning so that we parents are able to like more focus on work from home and not stressing out. I as a mother I can handle them but the situation right now that I have to work from home and complete my work with tight deadlines I am not able to help him out in terms of talking about being productive and husband have not patient with the kids. I understand that our government had done pretty much for us and I appreciate most of it but I hope the childcare can conduct online lesson maybe using zoom.

"Dear Sir  Lee Hsien LoongWhile we contain this virus, we should also weigh the risk of fears, media frenzy, and facts of how lethal this virus really is. Fear and panic are also contributors to the situation.  If we can get the public to be conscious of their hygiene, mature and sensitive against spreading their disease or sickness to others; we can faster get back to normality.  This is a great opportunity to drive home the importance of not coughing, sneezing, clearing their noses or throats in public without a mask when unwell and even suspecting unwell!   Drive home the wearing of mask when suspecting illness, unwell or sick! And to stay home and not work if unwell. More has to be done to enable this at the workplace especially for contingent workforce employers.  If we look at Taiwan and Japan; you will quickly realise that their Covid 19 situation is very much in control. Much due to their civic consciousness and responsibilities to others.

Please learn to listen, and always put your people #1.  #SGMALU  下次，将注意力集中在大流行上（不确定您和您的团队是否还有下一次机会）。 当我们的大流行会在很多方面摧毁您的国家和国家时，请不要担心获得新的授权，这些方面在健康，经济，社会等各个方面都将毁于一旦。 只是想让您知道，如果您在这场大流行期间致电GE-我不会为您的任何团队成员投票。 他们将必须加入George Yeo。 而且，我想您现在已经知道，人民已经向您明确表达了自己的观点-在大流行期间没有通用电气，无论您想采用哪种Wayang措施。 我们正在从第一世界转向第三世界。 一些第三世界国家在应对大流行方面要比新加坡更好。 请学会倾听，并始终将您的员工放在第一位。 #SGMALU  Lain kali, fokus pada pandemi (tidak pasti jika ada masa berikutnya untuk anda dan pasukan anda). Jangan repot-repot mendapatkan mandat baru ketika kita mengalami wabak penyakit yang akan memusnahkan negara dan negara anda di banyak bidang - kesihatan, ekonomi, sosial. Untuk memberitahu anda, jika anda menuntut PRU semasa wabak ini - saya tidak akan memilih mana-mana ahli pasukan anda. Mereka mesti menyertai George Yeo. Dan, saya rasa anda akan tahu sekarang, orang-orang telah menyatakan sentimen mereka kepada anda - Tidak ada PRU semasa wabak itu, tanpa mengira apa sahaja cara yang ingin anda laksanakan. Kami beralih dari Dunia Pertama ke Dunia Ketiga. Beberapa negara dunia ketiga menangani wabak itu lebih baik daripada SG.

"[1] the dorms configuration play a key factor in viral transmission. New PBDs have ensuite showers, toilet and kitchen. These have proven to be effective bulkheads. Recall that the first FW infections occurred in one of the newer dorms and that it did not spark a wider transmission. We shape our buildings, and afterwards, our buildings shape us.  [2] Dorm-config not the only contributor. In 2019-2020, I have visited multiple stations on the Thomson line, I have worked in Project Glory. PSSCOC style templates have safety policy mandates which are high risk in an epidemic. This includes -the safety management template for massed shift kickoffs, massing of water points, meal areas, toileting & washing areas coupled with synchronized meal times concentrated and massed construction workers at ""toolbox briefings"", safety inductions, meal areas, assembly points and pickup points.  [3]The construction safety officers - the risk experts - had no special understanding of epidemic risk. It was not significant on their standard checklist of construction hazards. Construction safety officers received no communication from MOH wrt to massing of workers in the context of existing capacities and standard safety practices as the epidemic approached.  [4] Air-conditioned buses have surface contact and high volume of return air as per design of Bus A/C. Open trucks have crowding. If it rained - side tarps were lowered and created an enclosed humid environment. Long commutes created a sustained risk exposure event.  [5] Hope observations wrt to the structure of special conditions at large worksite and common construction labour practices will support design of a sound and targeted response.  [6] Add oil.

"Gov. sg sent a message out today to remind people to respect our law enforcement officers and ambassadors.  I think we absolutely should give them the utmost respect they deserve. They are front line people who play an important role to safeguard our health while risking theirs. They have family too, and like many of us, they have a job to do.  I hope the Govt would understand why the people are angry and frustrated, some are even mentally distressed. Many small businesses are not going to survive, and many will lose their jobs and have their income substantially affected.   The people don’t have an outlet to vent their anger during this unprecedented time. Many have placed their trust in the government, but now this faith is severely being tested, and some have lost it completely.  The people don’t know how long this CB period would last, and privately, many people believe it won’t work and we haven’t even mentioned the double standards behaviour exhibited by the PAP MPs who walked the ground during this CB period.  My point being, people don’t see a closure to their anger. Some don’t know who to blame for their plight, and others who do, know there is no chance our PM and the ministerial taskforce would own up their mistakes.   All leaders make mistakes. To be human means we all have to mess up once in a while. If you messed up, admit it and own it. Then acknowledge your responsibility and move forward. Only insecure leaders are afraid of looking weak.  At this time, admitting your mistakes earns you the respect of the people you lead and makes your leadership human. Once you have done that, the relationship with the people would get stronger and you would regain the trust of the people to move forward.  That is the real mandate the govt is seeking, and not through methods of enforcement measures, fines, POFMA or gerrymandering. It’s about winning hearts and minds.  I think this is what we need to really unite the people to overcome the crisis, and together.",18/4/20,355,Circuit Breaker,348,4,-10.2989754,82,17,13,0.977491734,0,1,1
"Dear Mr Lee Hsien Loong ,   I am a faithful PAP supporter & a firm believer since Mr LKY time .   I am writing in as I am not sure who to write to in terms of ministry to over see this as I personally think it’s critical & the urgency to act .   The CV 19 over @ 40dorm with 200K foreign worker even though have been separated & on going testing to treat / isolate ; there is 1 possible big concern from me .   What if .. what if there is some worker due to unhappiness / self worry or someone creating unrest & spread to 2 bigger dorm then 3 then 4 & so on ...   1) Question links to homeland security now is are WE ( SPF , Task force from SPF , Army , MP from army ) equip to handle ?   2) Its the fast response team able to handle as we are talking abt 200K workers ?   3) As of now, on the group in that 15 or so isolation area / zone enough security personal to handle ?   4) We SG have never never see / think of this 200k workers of where they stay might post a sparking / starting point to spread CV19 in SG .    5) This is a global pandemic hence the scale of managing will be unprecedented.   The lesson learned from the past like little India riots ( 400 or less rioters ) expose the reality of SG not prepare  let alone now in 200k workers .   I know You & SG government have been really caring to all the workers & taking care of them ..   But what if the that someone just out to creat harm to SG ..   All your ministers are now working hard to take care of us the Singaporean & those staying in Singapore.   No sure any one think / worry of what I fear as the scale of 200k workers is very real ...   We take care of them ( the 200k worker ) but the what if have to be consider .  Thank you Mr Lee .

Tell people to show solidarity to the nurses and doctors risking their lives by wearing a mask as a totem of solidarity.   Wrt to saving plastic food containers.

However when i see one with the mask ,  i did drop a word to encourage them to put on the mask becos by doing is to help take care and protect of themselves , ourselves and others .

(2) why are we still silent about elderly workers going to work in essential services, (3) Can there be exceptions made to allow us to at least go to our parents house for childcare if we meet stringent conditions like we don’t go out of the homes (order food in), we only go to parents house in our own car. Hope the Task Force can consider this.  (4) Can the government or task force help explain why there is a flip flop of the rule on dropping kids with grandparents within a day.

"Today I encountered a selfish Singaporean couple in their sixties who walked by side along the stairs up a bridge and refused to give way to the others even when they were asked to be excused. Not only their attitude was bad, they even scolded others for squeezing through passed them. The disgusting thing about this couple is that their attitude changed completely and they became super polite and civil when they saw a social distancing ambassador who witnessed the incident, and even tried to explain that they were in their sixties and walked slowly. BTW, there was a lift at the bridge the couple could take. More importantly, if they are old they should not be even going out and about. Isn't this against what the government had advised - that the elderly should stay home and not venture out?  Apart from the circuit measures the government has introduced, it is also important for the government to educate our senior citizens on their manners and hygiene. Since I returned home around six years ago from overseas where I was based for more than a decade, I’ve encountered so many of our senior citizens who have this ‘I and old and am always right’ attitude with absolutely no concept of personal hygiene, coughing and sneezing openly and even spitting anywhere and whenever they like. At the end of the day, this boils down to one thing - their selfish attitude. Like what Dr Tommy Koh said, Singapore is a First World country with Third World citizens.

"Just urging people to stay home etc. isn't gonna work.  Gotta tell them about all the cases of young healthy people dying in other countries, the long term lung/brain damage even in survivors, China's data was an anomaly - young people get severe illness too and perfectly healthy ones are dying, the more widespread it becomes, the more death rate becomes 10% like SARS, It can spread just by BREATHING while asymptomatic, don't need to cough/sneeze, when air is still u can get infected just by walking past where someone was and breathing the air he/she exhaled, even sitting in a bus 6m apart you can get infected from someone else's breath, whatever other terrible news/videos you can find to show each other...  Follow the science!! Which says adoption of measures depends on perceived threat! We need to emphasise the threat to our family/friends etc. in concrete ways, for them to listen!

"Today I encountered a selfish Singaporean couple in their sixties who walked by side along the stairs up a bridge and refused to give way to the others even when they were asked to be excused. Not only was their attitude bad, they even scolded others for squeezing through them. The disgusting thing about this couple is that their attitude changed completely and became super polite when they saw a social distancing ambassador around who witnessed the incident, and  explained then that they were in their sixties and had to walk  slowly. BTW, there’s a lift which the couple could have used. More importantly, they are elderly and should stay home and not leave home if they can’t even walk normally.   Apart from the circuit measures that the government has introduced, it is also important for the government to educate our senior citizens on their manners and hygiene. Since I returned home from overseas where I was based for more than a decade, I’ve encountered so many of our senior citizens who have this ‘I and old and am always right’ attitude with no concept of personal hygiene at all, coughing and sneezing openly and even spitting anywhere and whenever they like.

"Prof. Knut Wittkowski, which has been an epidemiologist for 35 years and has been modeling epidemics for 35 years. He worked for 15 years with Klaus Dietz, a leading epidemiologist who coined the term “reproduction number”, on the Epidemiology of HIV before heading for 20 years the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at The Rockefeller University, New York.   He says: With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity. About 80% of the people need to have had contact with the virus, and the majority of them won’t even have recognized that they were infected, or they had very, very mild symptoms, especially if they are children. So, it’s very important to keep the schools open and kids mingling to spread the virus to get herd immunity as fast as possible, and then the elderly people, who should be separated, and the nursing homes should be closed during that time, can come back and meet their children and grandchildren after about 4 weeks when the virus has been exterminated…. We are experiencing all sorts of counterproductive consequences of not well-thought-through policy….  Well, we will see maybe a total of fewer cases—that is possible. However, we will see more cases among the elderly, because we have prevented the school children from creating herd immunity. And so, in the end, we will see more death because the school children don’t die, it’s the elderly people who die, we will see more death because of this social distancing….  If we had herd immunity now, there couldn’t be a second wave in autumn. Herd immunity lasts for a couple of years, typically, and that’s why the last SARS epidemic we had in 2003, it lasted 15 years for enough people to become susceptible again so that a new epidemic could spread of a related virus. Because typically, there is something that requires cross-immunity, so if you were exposed to one of the SARS viruses, you are less likely to fall ill with another SARS virus. So, if we had herd immunity, we wouldn’t have a second wave. However, if we are preventing herd immunity from developing, it is almost guaranteed that we have a second wave as soon as either we stop the social distancing or the climate changes with winter coming or something like that….  [Extreme reactions] cost the US taxpayer $2 trillion, in addition to everything else that it costs, but it also has severe consequences for our social life, and depression is definitely something that we will be researching. I can say for myself, walking through New York City right now is depressing….  We should be resisting, and we should, at least, hold our politicians responsible. We should have a discussion with our politicians. One thing we definitely need to do, and that would be safe and effective, is opening schools. Let the children spread the virus among themselves, which is a necessity to get herd immunity. That was probably one of the most destructive actions the government has done. We should focus on the elderly and separating them from the population where the virus is circulating. We should not prevent the virus from circulating among school children, which is the fastest way to create herd immunity…. And the final question and answer:  “So, is there anything else you want to say about this that—what’s been aggravating you the most? Or what would you like people to know?”  I think people in the United States and maybe other countries as well are more docile than they should be. People should talk with their politicians, question them, ask them to explain, because if people don’t stand up to their rights, their rights will be forgotten.  https://www.aier.org/article/stand-up-for-your-rights-says-professor-knut-m-wittkowski/",9/4/20,620,Circuit Breaker,622,4,-10.52495934,129,23,18,0.634009194,0,1,1

"Dear PM Lee, heartfelt thanks to you and your cabinet, in particular the task force in handling this virus pandemic. The thinking behind it, the calibrated measures taken to keep Singaporeans’ lives safe and bearable as much as possible and communicating them well is a challenging, balancing act. The decisiveness and speed of response in the form of the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budget within a short span of time is hugely commendable! More importantly the comprehensiveness and the broad reach of the budget and responsiveness in tweaking the schemes based on feedback from the ground is greatly appreciated! As a Singaporean it is very comforting that our government always plan and think Ahead and not just react to challenges. I hope the EXECUTION of the measures are carried out as intended so that we emerge from this pandemic with minimal loss of lives and begin gradual restoration of normalcy in our lives soon. Create a channel for people to work with the government to ensure companies and individuals follow the guidelines so that we get out of this pandemic quickly as one SGUnited! Take Care!

"Dear PM  You and your colleagues, our civil service, our healthcare workers, our cleaning/supply chain/food/transportation/etc workers, our volunteers, etc have all been working very hard during these challenging times. A plethora of containment, financial assistance, etc measures have been announced and implemented. Thank you.  Unfortunately, there are still people and organisations not complying with the measures. Whilst some may have very good reasons for doing what they did, there are those who were irresponsibly YOLOing, making the last buck, etc.  Enforcement is never easy. Proper investigations (that take up our already stressed resources) are needed. And there are social, political, etc implications in enforcement.  We trust that you and your team are already looking into taking to task those who acted wrongly or irresponsibly. There is a risk of the population seeing non-compliant or (where it is gray under the existing measures) irresponsible people and organisations ""escaping"" with it, and being swayed to follow the non-compliant or irresponsible acts.  Broad and repeated communications have been made. Warnings have been issued. It may well be time to quicken the step up to enforcement and prosecution, and firm discussions (where the act is gray under the existing measures, but clearly detrimental to management of the current crisis). And to communicate this to the population.  Not that any ill is deliberately wished on any person or organisation, or scapegoating is intended.",8/4/20,230,Circuit Breaker,232,4,-10.99159636,55,12,6,1.6212507,0,0,1

One big mistake was letting in Malaysians after their lockdown. Some of them could be carrying the virus when they came in and could be the cause of some of the clusters here. Now Malaysia is shirking all responsibility to allow them back. Sad for these people that their own country doesn't want them back.

"COVID-19: Take Circuit Breaker measures seriously Circuit Breaker measures take effect from today till 4 May ➕ May be extended if situation is not brought under control Stay at home Only go out if: 🌳 Exercising at parks at safe distance Dear PM Lee Sir, First day CB. Unfortunately some humans either don’t listen or don’t take the government recommendation seriously. Your consistency which covers Bishan Park, this evening was more crowded above the normal days and to made matters worst, a sudden heavy downpour has every person huddle into shelter like pack sardines. We know well an asymptomatic person can spread and to made matter worst there are no data or contact tracing at any parks or open space.  I hope I am wrong but will wait to see the crowd in Changi Beach this weekend. How many long queues at Hawker center to “ tapoa” food and seek the sun and water,open-air as long as it is not so crowded. The question is how one defines not so crowded.  All it takes is a few careless irresponsible to put an overload on your breaker. I hope your relevant office will consider an immediate Switch Board shutdown rather than a Circuit Breaker.

"Because this pandemic is causing economy to suffer heavily, all the more we should exercise better discipline and end this pandemic in our country AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  When this pandemic drags on, we will end up isolating ourselves from the rest of the world longer, and this will spell months of bad luck for us.   First, end our own pandemic. This means stay at home, break transmission links, observe personal hygiene. I think this budget is put in place to let businesses tide over the next three weeks.   When we are officially cleared of pandemic by the WHO, then we can start doing businesses with countries that have also recovered from the pandemic. There are countries now that have recovered and are still waiting to do businesses with us! BUT WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE ARE STILL BATTLING THIS CRISIS!  Once we have won this crisis, then we can offer to help other ASEAN countries to either cope with their pandemic or to help their economy recover. Either way a collective effort will always be more effective.   On the other hand if we are battling with the crisis, NO TOURISTS WILL EVER WANT TO COME. Think of Changi airport and SIA. And remember when companies like SQ goes bankrupt, there will no longer be another SQ. It will be gone forever.  THE VALUE OF THE SINGAPORE DOLLAR DEPENDS ON THE SERVICES WE CAN PROVIDE TO OURSELVES AND TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.   So while exercising circuit-breaking policies, think also how you can recover your businesses when this pandemic ends. Signal to the Chamber of Commerce or the ministry or any organisation your needs. The communication channels between the businesses and the government should all the more be open during this period because the government can help build and rebuild basic infrastructure so that companies can stand to benefit. THINK OF IT AS A LIGHTHOUSE FOR THE MISSING SHIPS AS THE STORM COMES SUDDENLY! THE LIGHTHOUSE WILL NOT HELP YOU IF YOU DO NOT SOUND YOUR DISTRESS!",7/4/20,335,Circuit Breaker,337,4,-12.45450378,58,20,16,0.603139084,0,1,1

"I like to share my view on how Singapore can get to normal after the circuit breaker.  I believe the simple solution which China has been showing the world is to wear mask.  They are getting back to work, socializing and sightseeing with masks.  The simple rationale which has been floating around for quite some time is that if mask can protect medical staffs who are in intimate contact with patients then it should work in working and social environment.  There is nothing complicated about the rationale of wearing mask.  The reason for government not advocating mask wearing was insufficient supply and that was true.  But the picture now is different.   It is clear that the current situation is going to persist for quite some time and our economy cannot afford to wait for vaccine or effective drug treatment.  The simple answer is therefore mass production of mask.  I believe Singapore has the engineering capabilities to just do that.

"Dear PM, I sincerely hope our government can imposed compulsory stay at home for all unless it’s for groceries and essential work, as well compulsory mask wearing when going out.  The reason for doing so is that although majority of Singaporeans will stand together and stay at home, there’s still minority of residences here whom will not co-operate without proper enforcement. This group of people are risk takers, thus they have a higher chance of getting infected and transmitting it to others. Without proper enforcement, we will be wasting this precious circuit breaker period, and eventually extending it, further disrupting our economy and this will increase our jobless rate. It will not be possible for our government to consistently support us with solidarity packages as this will eventually empty our reserves, we need to first stop the local transmissions, enhanced our immigration process - compulsory 14 days quarantine in dedicated hotels for all  coming into Singapore, which will be paid by themselves. Once we stop all local transmission, and prevent import transmission from spreading locally, we can then boost our economy by becoming a safe heaven and S.E.A command centre in fighting this virus.

Given the circuit breaker measures, most families would like to order provisions online, however most online services are now not able to service the demand as they are short of staff in their warehouses as well as for delivery. On the other hand, we have enterprises like Changi airport and SIA which have staff who are currently available. Can we consider redeploying some of the staff especially ground handling / baggage handling to help companies like Redmart etc to meet the surge in demand? We have been trying to order groceries online but no slots are ever available,  necessitating our going out to the supermarket in person, which exposes everyone to risk. If we can redeploy staff (facilitated by government) from businesses that have been disrupted to businesses that need more staff urgently like online groceries, it would be a win win for all. The Redmarts/Amazons will get the help they need in their warehouses and delivery networks to meet the surge in demand, the workers will get employment, and we consumers will be able to stay at home and tide over this period.",7/4/20,194,Circuit Breaker,194,4,-10.85407272,37,4,7,1.377043788,0,0,1

"I would like to suggest that the Singapore Goverment persuade the WHO under the leadership of UN, take the lead in commencing a World wide lock down of one month or an extension if necessary for all nations instead of individual nations or States planning their own lock down which could be counterproductive.  Nations or states  that have completed their lock down could still have imported cases of covid-19 because other nations or states have yet to lock down or are not in full lock down. A very good example is the US where different states are in different stages of lock down or some are yet to lock down. Those nations or states that have completed their lock down will be hit by second or more waves from imported cases because they have not got their act together .  The World should come together as one & fight the invisibel enemy. We must be prepared to have several lock downs until we have small clusters which can be managed by contact tracing. By doing so, we might slow down the rate of infection & mortality while waiting for the covid-19 vaccine to be ready.  Please spread the message, so that we can have a World 🌍 wide lock down for 1 month or so & save more lives from Covid-19 🙏🏼",7/4/20,215,Circuit Breaker,216,4,-10.74380114,42,11,4,2.039839678,0,1,1

"Decades ago, my Boss, then 2LT Barnard Tan Cheow Han, told me not to charge machine guns without having a good plan. He then made me do it again and again with my section - just so he would not have to convince me again.  I would like to know a good plan is in place before making a dash across open ground.  The mandatory closing of business premises across the economy w/o discrimination when the conditions are not yet in place for success seems like a call to line up firms to be machined gunned without a fair chance of success.  Let's be fair. Availability of bandages is not a good plan.  Closing of businesses is no auto-magical plan. It will take methodical organisation and monitoring of measures to operationalize the lowering of the R number by lowering the number of unsafe interactions - flattening the curve.  We how the Chinese gov operationalized their quarantine wrt to the limited number of times you get to go to the store to buy food with a mask and the registration of that person each time for each trip out via condo security and village committee.  Last Saturday ~50% of the people out exercising, buying food in scrums and using public transport were unmasked, they go home and marinate with their unprotected family in a close, trusted and intimate setting.  There are simplified SIR models wrt to central places and show big effects of small differences.  There are second-order effects when the asymptomatic family members take their turn going out to exercise using the same lifts or stairwells.  I have walked and inspected worker dorms and know the sights and smells well.  Prep the ground, get people to mask up in public then throw the ""close business premises"" breaker if still necessary.  We do not understand why do one w/o the other. Please explain to us so that we can understand the actions taken by the Gov.",6/4/20,320,Circuit Breaker,327,4,-11.13249541,55,15,7,0.674117243,0,0,1

"S$600 for all adult Singaporeans, and I asked why no option button for those who choose not to receive it?    Some did not understand why I had asked for the opt out button.     If some rich, generous, and kind hearted Singaporeans have the button to opt out, and let's.say some 100,000 rich persons opt out x S$600 = S$60m.    From this amount of S$60m not given out, it will mean the Govt has an additional S$60m to give to those in the lower-income groups.    But now with no button to press, the S$60m will be paid out.    No S$60m saved, it means the Govt does not have S$60m to give it to the lower-income groups.    MOF must have their reasons and for whatever reasons not to have the button to save the S$60m, and to give more to the lower-income groups.    I hope all can see the bigger picture that with this opt out button more dollars can flow in the down and down direction.",6/4/20,160,Circuit Breaker,175,4,-10.88785648,32,4,2,3.268719939,0,0,1

How will employers and dormitory operators be made accountable as well?  These are questions that are very relevant after this bad experience. The general public needs to know.

"I am a single mother, my son goes to school on the 2nd June but I can't work. I am currently renting a space from a hairsalon that has a shop front and partition to separate our space. As my business falls under Beauty they say i cannot open on the 2nd of June. I am a manicurist and I hope to open as I have clients who are in pain due to ingrown nail that can cause swelling and inflammation or under hard skin that causes cracked heels that will lead to bleeding. I am told they an go seek hospital to treat it but most of them have have been say they feel pain even more frequent or the doc will tell them to go for minor operation to remove the nail which is not necessary than when they see me as I can treat this problem if not servere. But it has been two months and most of my clients are feeling the pain and have made appt. I only need to open to do pedicure only to help these clients. Even if it's 2 or 3 days week at least to do Pedicure for the feet takes about an hour only. And I have ladies and gentlemen who have injured back and can't bend to cut the nails for the feet or diabetes who need nails short if not dangerous if the nail is too long and they bang into anything in the house. I work alone with no employee. Please consider my business as essential. Cause I don't understand hair salon can open to do full Services that can take a good 4-6hrs per client and I am only doing pedicure that is only an hour job. And my landlord says this month I have to start paying rent and that is a good $2000. So if business cannot open how do I pay next months rent. Am very worried please advise.

"During this Lock down. It comes with lots of challenges like lost marriages, lost love, financial and job problems and so many more, but still there has always been a solution to every challenges that we face in life. Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my boyfriend. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached his flat I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to his room. When I knocked, he allowed me to enter because he wasn't expecting me at the time, but when I opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in his house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, he followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away. I reached home and cried a lot until i told my best friend everything and she told me to fight for my man and not lose him to another woman. She gave Mama Shamirah contact(+27790792882) and told Mama Shamirah will bring back my boyfriend to me and love and only me. I contacted Mama Shamirah and told her everything and she made a love and binding prayers for me and in 1 day of the prayers my boyfriend came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again. The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby, he cried and smiled with joy and happiness. We are back together and so much in love and waiting for our baby to arrive. Thanks so much Mama Shamirah your prayers indeed work. You can call or whatsapp Mama Shamirah on +27790792882 incase you are passing through the same situation.

"I grew up surrounded by God and church members from the very beginning. Being risen by Christian home, I always followed through the motions of doing “Christian things” that I thought a Christian was supposed to do. I didn’t know GOD, I just knew about Him. I found myself searching for purpose and meaning in people and also in myself. Whether that was my friends or in relationships, I poured my whole heart into them. I became very consumed with what people thought of me and was living for the acceptance of the world. At my lowest point when I lost my lovely husband to a beautiful young girl I think we call slay queens these days, I was alone and afraid, I couldn’t concentrate at work not even at any other thing I could work on. Losing my concentration cost me so much that I ended up losing my job too and went back to staying at my parents’ house with my two kids. I can’t lie to you, it was always more hurting and annoying staying home because my mom’s friends used to almost come every day to visit and sit outside talking about their marriages’ and fun they had maybe like during the weekends’ and laugh, OMG, that laugh they used to give always killed me. After what friends showed me that year I admit I had turn into a jealous person. That year was a year I will never forget. I could wake up in the morning sit on the couch watch Isindigo, login Facebook and all those sorts of social Medias and cry the whole day with my mum nursing me until it reached a time that she was also getting fade with my sobbing. It was my daughter’s birthday and some few people turned up, many were my mums friends and actually my daughters friends none of my closest turned up and it was from then I noticed that “people will always love you and support you when its beneficial” out of my mums friends, I found myself initiated in a long and funny conversation with one of them after the party. I won’t forget the fact that her husband called almost like 10 times in a period of 5 minutes just to remind her how he loved her and wishing her to drive safe back home, believe me I had never had that experience with my man. Later on during the conversation, she saw me burst into tears and she asked me what was going on, I told her everything I was going through with my life. And it was from here that I got to know about Mama Morgan +27784502035 a very cunning woman I have ever met. She told me about her meeting with Mama Morgan and she actually never gave me her numbers but took me with her to Mama Morgan. Being a born Christian, believe me I had a very big challenge here. Like how am I going to mix these two things from growing up in a Christian home to starting to believe in African tradition, but I kept on consoling myself. I always kept on having dreams having money, living lavish, and snakes chasing me, falling in very deep holes, having sex with people I don’t even know, being shot, losing fights and many more dreams that didn’t make sense to me. One morning of a beautiful Saturday I went on and called this lady (my mums’ friend) and told her I was ready to meet Mama , she came home, picked me and we went to meet Mama Morgan . She asked me what she wanted to use and I gave her everything then she conducted her prayers. What surprised me was that she was using a BIBLE and mirror to conduct her prayers then after everything she asked me to go back home and wait on the results. It took me 5 days then the father of my kids came to my parents place and He was all in tears telling me that the young girl she had opt to stay with was using muthi on him and she was targeting his riches she even tried to poison him like the evening before he came home but he missed on the poison and the cat ate it instead and he had come to ask for forgiveness and that he saw me in the dream like two days back and he was kneeling begging me to come back in his life and that’s why he had drove home to ask for my forgiveness. Believe me I cried even more than before when he was telling me his story. After like a week, I got a call that Eskom needed me back to work after a period of a year and a half. You can reach Mama Morgan on Call/Whatsapp+27784502035 in case you need her assistance.",1/10/20,823,Circuit Breaker,819,4,-10.3794556,182,31,50,0.308582673,0,0,1

"1. Everytime there is a tighter measure such as closure,  naturally there are people crowding for their last dine in meal,  disco night,  MacDonald, bubble tea or pet shop purchase.  These behaviour is triggered by anxiety and fear of loss in basic needs temporary. Unknowingly,  it allows covid-19 to breed among crowds as some carriers may pass to others unknowingly,  with no symptoms.   2. Incremental measures are hard to enforce as it takes time for the entire Singapor population to abide and comply.  A one time hard measures,  though painful can help shorten the circuit breaker period.   3. The trick to reduce crowds now at wet market is to extend operation hours,  mandate mask,  and to offer staggered hours of visiting in batches. In another word,  from 8 to 9am,  only say 100 people with IC scanned are allowed. The next 100 people on queue will have their IC scan and receive SMS to come only after 9am to 10am (2nd staggered timing). They are ask to go home if their slot is not ready.  Their turn will not be lost if they come within the designated staggered hours. No queue allowed. Each visitor can only visit market once a day.   4.This is easier than having even and odd IC last digit numbers as there could be many even numbers on the same day.

"👍👍👍 Brilliant！  Measured, calibrated and community-driven.  There is no 1-size fit ALL.   The same measures that apply to dormitories cannot be applied everywhere.  There is no 100% testing daily or even hourly (to be sure).  It is normal sampling, tightened and relaxed sampling.  Skeptics and alarmists are helpful; they may be right at times.  Seriously  MOE, students should NOT be allowed back to school; education is lifelong - not essential and urgent services- but carry high risk of another super spreading cluster (pls CONSIDER- both for the child and educators; also family units themselves).  Plenty of collateral damage once students are allowed back to schools during this LAST MILE of the national CB.  Besides for unknown reasons, schools ban masks and ""discourage"" staffers from masking; up the COVID risk.  感恩！",3/5/20,125,Circuit Breaker,128,4,-12.38090682,21,8,0,2.166365929,0,1,1
I agree with NOT reopening schools at all and to wear masks at all times. I prefer they just stick to the CB until 1 June and we all just rough it out for 1 more month and hopefully it'll bring the numbers down even further.
