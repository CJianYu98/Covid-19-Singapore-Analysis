Today, when some other countries are facing another wave, having high community cases and planning to impose stricter measures, our Singapore is planning into phase 3. Why is this so?   Besides having a team of selfless and committed healthcare workers and other frontline heroes, another reason is due to we have a capable and competent gov with strong leadership. This is undeniably, the fact we see today. Thank you to our 4G leaders that never stop to make our Singapore safe for everyone here.

258,371,"COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES  PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money. The governments moon shot daily testing program will cost £100 Billion roughly two thirds of the annual NHS budget.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.

Widely reported asymptomatic incubation period was the critical blind spot that the MTF failed to address in Feb when the Wuhan couple started the church cluster resulting in unnecessary Circuit Breaker and drawing down more than necessary from our reserves.  2) There is a growing number of ""soveriegn"" public  who openly pull down their mask to expose their nose or mouth in public, neighbourhood shop area with zero enforcement from the authority.  3) A growing number who AFTER exercising and after cooling down, are not wearing mask walking relaxingly in public on their way home. In the first place, majority did not even hv a mask around their neck.  4) Many diners at F&B outlets are talking more than eating and most of the time with their mask pulled down.  We learnt from other countries that re-surgence of clusters mainly occurred in crowded and closed areas. As such, govt should have ZERO tolerance on non compliance to proper social distancing and wearing of facemask when we talk about further opening up. Setup easy and effective hotlines for public to report non compliances to follow up with fines and penalties.   Only ZERO tolerance, effective enforcement of Social distancing, mask wearing and measures to address the asymptomatic incubation blind spot could ensure that the previous costly  mishandling is not repeated.",2020-09-13,261

374,520,"The Flawed PCR Test You might have the virus, but so what? That doesn’t mean you’re sick!  * https://youtu.be/SjyfTvdr1_s Virology is Hoaxology: Viruses do not exist. Period.  Even if you strongly believe in germ theory, there are some serious problems with the generally accepted method of testing for a virus, it’s called the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test.  The PCR test amplifies a specific region of a DNA strand (the DNA target)—It is qualitative not quantitative; in other words, it can tell you if a virus is present or not, but it can’t tell you in what quantities, and it can’t make any accurate assessment about whether the presence of that virus or not is enough to cause disease.  The US CDC admits that a positive coronavirus COVID-19 test (using the PCR method) doesn’t mean the virus is causing the disease/symptoms you may have.  1. These are the actual words of the US CDC: “Positive [test] results are indicative of active infection with 2019-nCoV but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.”  2. These are the actual words of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and the Chapter of Infectious Disease Physicians, Academy of Medicine, Singapore, point no.5: https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf Microbiologic Data for Period of Infectivity and Viral RNA Shedding: ""It is important to note that viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus.""  So, what are testing centres actually testing and looking for besides SARS-CoV-2 virus?  A rhinovirus? An influenza virus? A dead cell? A coronavirus particle from past infection? An exosome? Alien contaminants? Unauthorised DNA harvesting?  This is the reason why majority of the people using this fraudulent PCR testing method will test positive again and again.  More fake science PCR testing will only escalate infectivity numbers creating fear and panic globally.  * https://youtu.be/xY8YHtJOanM Dr Stefan Lanka, biologist, virologist Viruses do not exist RT-PCR test and circular reasoning  It is interesting and extremely telling to note how fast BBC was to announce this damning verdict in 2015:  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31864218 while the appeals and two later verdicts, the last one in The German High Court in January 2017 where the measles skeptic WON FULL VICTORY and where the claimants were forced to pay all costs of the court-case, BBC so CONVENIENTLY IGNORED!   22.01.2017: Judges at the German Federal Supreme Court have CONFIRMED THAT THE MEASLES VIRUS DOES NOT EXIST, vindicating 'conspiracy theorists' who have said that no study has ever proven the existence of the virus.  The First Civil Senate of the BGH has confirmed the judgment by the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart (OLG) of the 16 February 2016. The sum of €100,000 which the biologist dr. Stefan Lanka had offered as a reward for scientific proof of the existence of the alleged measles virus does not have to be paid to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also was ORDERED TO BEAR ALL THE PROCEDURAL COSTS.  Five experts have been involved in the case and presented the results of scientific studies. All five experts, including Prof. Dr. Dr. Andreas Podbielski who had been appointed by the OLG Stuttgart as the preceding court, have consistently found that NONE of the six publications which have been introduced to the trial, contains scientific proof of the existence of the alleged measles virus. http://yournewswire.com/german-supreme-court-measles/  Is it strange that the commercial media is loosing credibility?

Have witnessed several failures in enforcement not just from members of the public, but also from workers of malls and retail outlets, on the guidelines of safe distancing and proper mask-wearing. As it is, many are not wearing masks, and several more have them below their nostrils. I witnessed a Safety Ambassador speak to someone who wasn't wearing a mask in a Mall Basement buying food (the mask was tucked away deep in his large bag). There were no questions asked and the Ambassador walked away after her advise. The person continued to purchase food without any urgency to wear a mask! Furthermore, with no questioning done, could this person have roamed the mall with no mask prior to being seen? Also, why did the outlet serve the customer who blatantly breached the guidelines? 2 more were witnessed walking the malls with no mask on! They left the mall, with mall security looking perplexed as the person exited the doors, without stopping the individual to investigate or even advised to wear a mask! This person could have also roamed the mall for some time with no one even batting an eyelid! I can understand that authorities cannot be 2 places at one time, but guidelines are meant to be followed and any plan is useless if there is a failure to comply, by workers and establishments! Outlets should enforce refused service to anyone not wearing a mask properly until they do so, and not allow them to roam the premises with full ignorance! Any plan is useless if there is a 'Failure to Comply'. It's disheartening to witness this ignorance when the risk still exists. The more this complacency continues, the more a 'false sense of invincibility' grows, leading to less enforcement and more people turning a blind eye, since it was ok once, it will be ok once more. For those who continue to adhere and follow the guidelines, I applaud their vigilance and hope they continue to do so regardless of those who choose to not comply.",2020-07-17,350

511,693,"HIGH INFECTIVITY WITH LOW MORTALITY IS GOOD NEWS  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  BASIC UNDERSTANDING ON HOW OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM OPERATE  Everyone’s immune system is different but, as a general rule, as we expose to more pathogens, we develop more immunity.  Once an antibody has been produced, a copy remains in the body so that if the same antigen appears again, it can fight off more quickly.  That is why with some diseases, such as chickenpox, you only get it once as the body has a chickenpox antibody stored, ready and waiting to destroy it next time it arrives.  This is called immunity.  There are three types of immunity in humans called innate, adaptive, and passive:  Innate immunity: We are all born with some level of immunity to invaders. Human immune systems, similarly to those of many animals, will attack foreign invaders from day one. This innate immunity includes the external barriers of our body—the first line of defense against pathogens—such as the skin and mucous membranes of the throat and gut. This response is more general and non-specific. If the pathogen manages to dodge the innate immune system, adaptive or acquired immunity kicks in.  Adaptive immunity: This protect from pathogens develops as we go through life. As we are exposed to diseases or get vaccinated, we build up a library of antibodies to different pathogens. This is sometimes referred to as immunological memory because our immune system remembers previous enemies.  SUMMARY  The immune system is incredibly complicated and utterly vital for our survival. Several different systems and cell types work in perfect synchrony (most of the time) throughout the body to fight off pathogens and clear up dead cells.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  PROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS  High Infectivity: Getting everyone infected during a respiratory flu virus outbreak to build natural immunity towards the virus—with special attention given to the vulnerable group—is the proven epidemiological and scientific model approach.  Low Mortality: 99% of healthy individuals with strong immune system can handle the virus with little to no flu symptoms or mortality.  This is why I mentioned high infectivity with low mortality is good news.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNPROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS  Majority of countries i.e., Taiwan, Vietnam, etc., applied the unproven epidemiological and scientific approach by stopping their people from getting infected to build natural immunity towards the virus—with strict unproven lockdowns, wearing masks, social distancing and isolation, etc.—and flattening the curve is a risky unproven approach that will only prolong the pandemic leading to a 2nd wave.  The low infectivity and low mortality rate by applying the unproven epidemiological and scientific model will only look good on statistics and data.  What will happen in 3-6 months or a year from now if another flu or coronavirus starts circulating again—and people do not have immunity towards the virus?  Start locking and shutting down the whole country again?  Bankrupting the people, the government and the whole country?  Thank you so much for reading!",2020-06-19,492
512,694,"Just like any other respiratory outbreak, the epidemiological and science model is to let healthy individuals mingle around—with special attention given to the vulnerable group—and build natural immunity towards the virus.  99% of healthy individuals will have no to little flu symptoms and can handle this SARS-COV-2 respiratory illness.  * https://youtu.be/hmiw3vhv1ec Dr. Fauci vs. Dr. Wittkowski | Endless Mitigations or Herd Immunity  Stress weakens the immune system—public health advisory should not be locking up the whole nation at home and spreading fear on TV/MSM by repeated media broadcasts sounding that the whole nation is going to get infected and die from SARS-COV-2 respiratory illness.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  TESTING: There is no epidemiological and scientific model that testing individuals for a respiratory virus can stop the spread.  What is the point of testing when there is no scientific evidence that PCR test machine is a gold standard test for virus?—unless it is for unauthorised human DNA harvesting.   Even the inventor of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) Dr. Kary Mullis, PhD Biochemist, Winner, 1993 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, stated that PCR cannot be use to identify a virus or particle.  RT-PCR testing (Reverse Transcript Polymerase Chain Reaction) machine cannot distinguish an infectious (harmful) viral particle versus a non-infectious (harmless) viral particle, as the rest simply detects any viral component even a dead cell or an exosome—up to 80% of false positive results reveals that RT-PCR testing are inaccurate—it will only escalate the infectivity numbers on statistics and data, and put fear on the people.

An average faca mask uses a 16 gauge mesh and has a pore size of 1.29 MILLIMETRES—an average size of a virus is 250 NANOMETERS (1 billionth nanometers = 1 metre)—how can we catch mosquitoes with a fishing net?—unless it is a symbol of obedience.

560,761,"HIGH INFECTIVITY WITH LOW MORTALITY IS GOOD NEWS  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNDERSTANDING HOW OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM OPERATE Everyone’s immune system is different but, as a general rule, as we expose to more pathogens, we develop more immunity.  Once an antibody has been produced, a copy remains in the body so that if the same antigen appears again, it can fight off more quickly.  That is why with some diseases, such as chickenpox, you only get it once as the body has a chickenpox antibody stored, ready and waiting to destroy it next time it arrives.  This is called immunity.  There are three types of immunity in humans called innate, adaptive, and passive:  Innate immunity: We are all born with some level of immunity to invaders. Human immune systems, similarly to those of many animals, will attack foreign invaders from day one. This innate immunity includes the external barriers of our body—the first line of defense against pathogens—such as the skin and mucous membranes of the throat and gut. This response is more general and non-specific. If the pathogen manages to dodge the innate immune system, adaptive or acquired immunity kicks in.  Adaptive (acquired) immunity: This protect from pathogens develops as we go through life. As we are exposed to diseases or get vaccinated, we build up a library of antibodies to different pathogens. This is sometimes referred to as immunological memory because our immune system remembers previous enemies.  Passive immunity: This type of immunity is “borrowed” from another source, but it does not last indefinitely. For instance, a baby receives antibodies from the mother through the placenta before birth and in breast milk following birth. This passive immunity protects the baby from some infections during the early years of their life.  SUMMARY The immune system is incredibly complicated and utterly vital for our survival. Several different systems and cell types work in perfect synchrony (most of the time) throughout the body to fight off pathogens and clear up dead cells.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  PROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS Getting everyone infected during a virus outbreak to build immunity towards the virus—with special attention given to the vulnerable group—is the proven epidemiological and scientific model approach.  Majority of healthy individuals with a strong immune system can handle the virus with little to no symptoms or mortality.  That is why I mentioned high infectivity with low mortality is good news.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNPROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS Majority of countries i.e., Taiwan, Vietnam, etc., applied the unproven epidemiological and scientific approach by stopping their people from getting infected to build immunity towards the virus—with strict unproven lockdowns, wearing masks, social distancing and isolation, etc.—and waiting for the virus to die off is a risky unproven approach that will only prolong the pandemic leading to a 2nd wave.  The low infectivity and low mortality rate by applying the unproven epidemiological and scientific model will only look good on statistics and data.  What will happen in 3-6 months or a year from now if another coronavirus starts circulating again—and their people do not have immunity towards the virus?  Start locking and shutting down the whole country again?  Bankrupting the people, the government and the whole country?  Thank you so much for reading!",2020-06-15,540

The first part, stemming population would be a real challenge, economically  With lesser people, the economy will be limited, would not grow bigger than desired.   Housing costs will drop as lesser people will result to decrease in demands  However, if the population grows, the city becomes denser and another  pandemic flares, Singapore goes into partial lockdown again and the nation""s reserves may be used again  Stem the population because with lesser people, less densely populated, lives will not be at risk  Remember, virus mutates.

For the phase 1 circuit breaker, a TCM can only receive a patient at any one time and restricted treatment to 45mins.   Isn't it more dangerous to have customers who are strangers in the same salon for such a long period as compared to a husband and wife or family members staying together visiting the same TCM at the same time? A clinic and doctor definitely know how to handle and disinfect the equipment, areas that the patients use better than a salon, no?  Doesn't it makes more sense that the husband and wife or family member staying together scenario visiting and receiving treatment from the same clinic and same TCM doctor more safe than strangers sitting inside a salon for the duration of more than 2hours?

Some even pulled down their masks to talk .  Yesterday, the first day of Phase 1 - all the Safety Distancing stickers were removed - people are sitting shoulder to shoulder; some engaging in conversation.  Peak hours - those standing are barely 1 metre apart - some were also talking away.  With masks on - they talk loudly - disturbing the peace during the ride.   Some pulled their masks below their noses, barely touching the lips and talking away.

My kid has a bad toothache and bleeding this morning and I called sch dental was told they r closed and called HPB and told all sch dental cannot open. Dental only for urgent case how would we assess what’s urgent what’s not. They ask us to go private dental or poly clinic and need to pay . Isn’t that increasing risk of getting virus? Shdnt we stay home as much as possible and yet now ask me to bring my kid here and there after school to fix her toothache . Why kids can still go sch but cannot go to the school dental within school premises if really in pain ? Isn’t it like telling ppl to exercise but clinics and hospital not open for u if you have a fall or injuried. Don’t understand why the easing of restrictions so weird one ?!? ",2020-06-02,171

Il m'a dit qu'il n'a pas besoin de mon argent mais il suffit juste que je paie l'argent des ingrédients pour produire ce portefeuille et m'a encore dit si j'ai les moyens de venir dans son propre palais mais j'étais dans la pauvreté donc j'ai dû faire ce travail de distance qui me produit 1.500.000 FCFA tout les vendredis de chaque semaine qui n'a pas d'inconvénient ni de sacrifice sur ma vie. C'est là que j'ai crû que le portefeuille magique existe vraiment. Frère et sœur arrêté d'envoyer vos sommes au profiteurs et aux faux marabout . *Maître KINIBO* est le seul marabout qui fait ce travail au Bénin et ce n'est pas seulement ce travail il fait quelques soit vos problèmes il pourra vous aider. *WhatsApp et Appel +229 98597620*,2020-06-02,149

The PAP government had withdrawn money from the reserve is to first help the SIA from collapsing but I had been waiting a long time before I can hear the news to help and prevent the healthcare workers from collapsing. I had heard the news about Ho Chin had ordered the ST Engineers mouth mask manufacture to relocation from Taiwan back to Singapore because never knew our precious mouth masks can't be allowed spending back home. And what had happened, Why do the PAP government have negligence to provide enough mouth masks in this pandemic time. In the Sars situation, why do the PAP government had not to gain any experiences? And why do the PAP politicians can tell people, they are the right people who will always do the right things? I believe the PAP government should have helped to equip the CleanSpace Technology half-mask for the healthcare workers or evenly provide the service for the outpatients in hospitals and polyclinics when the patients have to see the doctor consultants. In these ways, many people will very happy to have more chances to buy mouth masks to protect themselves or helped to prevent the virus from spreading out more easily to others. And I had mentioned many times if the pandemic has become bad to worse because of the PAP government advice for not to wear a mouth mask if you are not ill or have shown any symptoms. I hope the PAP government will have the courage to apologize for not be really helpful.     ",2020-04-11,347

And while we are here debating on the different phases of registration, there is still a small group of children who requires special education. These special individuals will benefit from true inclusion, i.e. curriculum that is catered to serve both neurotypical and children with special needs, not literal inclusion of placing a few in a class and declaring it inclusive.   Bottom line is, the privileged are always going to continue to be the privileged lot and they are going to get their ways all the time anyway. The average Singaporean children just have to work extra hard, that's all we can do.

The government is not going to make allowance for you if you have an entire village of people who needs to meet up.

I am a manicurist and I hope to open as I have clients who are in pain due to ingrown nail that can cause swelling and inflammation or under hard skin that causes cracked heels that will lead to bleeding. I am told they an go seek hospital to treat it but most of them have have been say they feel pain even more frequent or the doc will tell them to go for minor operation to remove the nail which is not necessary than when they see me as I can treat this problem if not servere. But it has been two months and most of my clients are feeling the pain and have made appt. I only need to open to do pedicure only to help these clients. Even if it's 2 or 3 days week at least to do Pedicure for the feet takes about an hour only. And I have ladies and gentlemen who have injured back and can't bend to cut the nails for the feet or diabetes who need nails short if not dangerous if the nail is too long and they bang into anything in the house. I work alone with no employee. Please consider my business as essential. Cause I don't understand hair salon can open to do full Services that can take a good 4-6hrs per client and I am only doing pedicure that is only an hour job.

It comes with lots of challenges like lost marriages, lost love, financial and job problems and so many more, but still there has always been a solution to every challenges that we face in life. Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my boyfriend. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached his flat I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to his room. When I knocked, he allowed me to enter because he wasn't expecting me at the time, but when I opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in his house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, he followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away. I reached home and cried a lot until i told my best friend everything and she told me to fight for my man and not lose him to another woman. She gave Mama Shamirah contact(+27790792882) and told Mama Shamirah will bring back my boyfriend to me and love and only me. I contacted Mama Shamirah and told her everything and she made a love and binding prayers for me and in 1 day of the prayers my boyfriend came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again. The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby, he cried and smiled with joy and happiness. We are back together and so much in love and waiting for our baby to arrive. Thanks so much Mama Shamirah your prayers indeed work. You can call or whatsapp Mama Shamirah on +27790792882 incase you are passing through the same situation. Don't be discouraged by what people may tell you that even don't know the situation you are going through, all that matters are the results so feel free to contact her on Call/Whatsapp +27790792882 0r Email: mamashamirahsince1970@gmail.com.

2313,199,"I grew up surrounded by God and church members from the very beginning. Being risen by Christian home, I always followed through the motions of doing “Christian things” that I thought a Christian was supposed to do. I didn’t know GOD, I just knew about Him. I found myself searching for purpose and meaning in people and also in myself. Whether that was my friends or in relationships, I poured my whole heart into them. I became very consumed with what people thought of me and was living for the acceptance of the world. At my lowest point when I lost my lovely husband to a beautiful young girl I think we call slay queens these days, I was alone and afraid, I couldn’t concentrate at work not even at any other thing I could work on. Losing my concentration cost me so much that I ended up losing my job too and went back to staying at my parents’ house with my two kids. I can’t lie to you, it was always more hurting and annoying staying home because my mom’s friends used to almost come every day to visit and sit outside talking about their marriages’ and fun they had maybe like during the weekends’ and laugh, OMG, that laugh they used to give always killed me. After what friends showed me that year I admit I had turn into a jealous person. That year was a year I will never forget. I could wake up in the morning sit on the couch watch Isindigo, login Facebook and all those sorts of social Medias and cry the whole day with my mum nursing me until it reached a time that she was also getting fade with my sobbing. It was my daughter’s birthday and some few people turned up, many were my mums friends and actually my daughters friends none of my closest turned up and it was from then I noticed that “people will always love you and support you when its beneficial” out of my mums friends, I found myself initiated in a long and funny conversation with one of them after the party. I won’t forget the fact that her husband called almost like 10 times in a period of 5 minutes just to remind her how he loved her and wishing her to drive safe back home, believe me I had never had that experience with my man. Later on during the conversation, she saw me burst into tears and she asked me what was going on, I told her everything I was going through with my life. And it was from here that I got to know about Mama Morgan +27784502035 a very cunning woman I have ever met. She told me about her meeting with Mama Morgan and she actually never gave me her numbers but took me with her to Mama Morgan. Being a born Christian, believe me I had a very big challenge here. Like how am I going to mix these two things from growing up in a Christian home to starting to believe in African tradition, but I kept on consoling myself. I always kept on having dreams having money, living lavish, and snakes chasing me, falling in very deep holes, having sex with people I don’t even know, being shot, losing fights and many more dreams that didn’t make sense to me. One morning of a beautiful Saturday I went on and called this lady (my mums’ friend) and told her I was ready to meet Mama , she came home, picked me and we went to meet Mama Morgan . She asked me what she wanted to use and I gave her everything then she conducted her prayers. What surprised me was that she was using a BIBLE and mirror to conduct her prayers then after everything she asked me to go back home and wait on the results. It took me 5 days then the father of my kids came to my parents place and He was all in tears telling me that the young girl she had opt to stay with was using muthi on him and she was targeting his riches she even tried to poison him like the evening before he came home but he missed on the poison and the cat ate it instead and he had come to ask for forgiveness and that he saw me in the dream like two days back and he was kneeling begging me to come back in his life and that’s why he had drove home to ask for my forgiveness. Believe me I cried even more than before when he was telling me his story. After like a week, I got a call that Eskom needed me back to work after a period of a year and a half. You can reach Mama Morgan on Call/Whatsapp+27784502035 in case you need her assistance.",2020-10-01,823

2432,356,"1. Everytime there is a tighter measure such as closure,  naturally there are people crowding for their last dine in meal,  disco night,  MacDonald, bubble tea or pet shop purchase.  These behaviour is triggered by anxiety and fear of loss in basic needs temporary. Unknowingly,  it allows covid-19 to breed among crowds as some carriers may pass to others unknowingly,  with no symptoms.   2. Incremental measures are hard to enforce as it takes time for the entire Singapor population to abide and comply.  A one time hard measures,  though painful can help shorten the circuit breaker period.   3. The trick to reduce crowds now at wet market is to extend operation hours,  mandate mask,  and to offer staggered hours of visiting in batches. In another word,  from 8 to 9am,  only say 100 people with IC scanned are allowed. The next 100 people on queue will have their IC scan and receive SMS to come only after 9am to 10am (2nd staggered timing). They are ask to go home if their slot is not ready.  Their turn will not be lost if they come within the designated staggered hours. No queue allowed. Each visitor can only visit market once a day.   4.This is easier than having even and odd IC last digit numbers as there could be many even numbers on the same day.

Seriously  MOE, students should NOT be allowed back to school; education is lifelong - not essential and urgent services- but carry high risk of another super spreading cluster (pls CONSIDER- both for the child and educators; also family units themselves).  Plenty of collateral damage once students are allowed back to schools during this LAST MILE of the national CB.
