Maybe u might think we r disturbing your peacefulness in ur country which I understand. But last thing we want is having to go through what our parents/grandparents went through for the last 60+ years again. We r fighting for our future for our children/grandchildren.

So, Thai protesters took the opportunity to voice out their grievances against government.

Before y'all priviledged people sitting in your cozy house start making judgements like ""oh but she could have voiced out..."" SHE COULDN'T. You guys just don't understand how evil 3rd world military dictators can be. If she spoke anything off the script, the coup would have come sooner. And it's obvious the smear campaign was successful because the west eats up whatever the media feed without thinking critically or doing any researching, stripping off the Nobel Prize and titles, making her the figurehead of the genocide.  ""Oh she was racist against muslims.."" Nope. Her right hand man was a burmese muslim who got assassinated by the military because he was in the process of drafting a new constitution that renders the military with less power. He was also a very respected man in the country. (Search U Ko Ni)  This coup is extremely bad. Before you know it, not only are the Rohingyas going to actually be ethnically cleansed, there will be Karens, Arakens, Shans and other ethnic minorities who will be genocided by the military . ASSK and the NLD was the best hope is uniting the country (and between the ethnic minorities). She was in the process of gaining more power so that she can work towards it. The military didn't like it.  So you guys saying uninformed statements like ""she is evil"" or ""karma"" is really ignorant and unhelpful in anyway. Please read and research more.

"Burmese people are frankly exhausted from trying to explain this to the ignorant people:  Now before all of you come in here saying ""the government deserve it because they're responsible for genocide"" NO. The ruling party is not. The military started the whole ethnic cleansing mess and Aung San Suu Kyi was forced to deal with it. She didn't have any real power either. Before y'all priviledged people sitting in your cozy house start making judgements like ""oh but she could have voiced out..."" SHE COULDN'T. You guys just don't understand how evil 3rd world military dictators can be. If she spoke anything off the script, the coup would have come sooner. And it's obvious the smear campaign was successful because the west eats up whatever the media feed without thinking critically or doing any researching, stripping off the Nobel Prize and titles, making her the figurehead of the genocide.  ""Oh she was racist against muslims.."" Nope. Her right hand man was a burmese muslim who got assassinated by the military because he was in the process of drafting a new constitution that renders the military with less power. He was also a very respected man in the country. (Search U Ko Ni)  This coup is extremely bad. Before you know it, not only are the Rohingyas going to actually be ethnically cleansed, there will be Karens, Arakens, Shans and other ethnic minorities who will be genocided by the military . ASSK and the NLD was the best hope is uniting the country (and between the ethnic minorities). She was in the process of gaining more power so that she can work towards it. The military didn't like it.  So you guys saying uninformed statements like ""she is evil"" or ""karma"" is really ignorant and unhelpful in anyway. Please read and research more.

"I have never  my voice against this matter since some are making their own accusations & assumptions. Firstly, we did not support any harms which happened to Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State. Media platforms (most of them affiliated with Military forces) did not state anything about it until the world found out.   Briefly, Madam Aung San Suu Kyi took all the blame after that & defended against the world to protect the civilians as well as the country. Indeed, she couldnt stop the genocide without any control power over the military. The world did have a bad image about Myanmar & the military forces make it worse again. It was the dirty trick which created by them to take control over this country while other countries are looking down on us regarding Rohingya matter. Moreover, our country has not only Rohingya Muslims (war refugees) in Rakhine State which caused by armed & dangerous people, accordingly; our ethnic groups from Multiple states are getting the same treatment. Heres also a brief explanation about Rohingya Muslims, lets go back to the beginning of the story. At first, the military officials illegally allowed them (without civilians knowledge) in order to gain human labors & make religious-related-riots here or there. Decades later, Rohingya Muslims requested for their own land with their own government so on & so on which messed things up. Even after all those thing happened, like I said, most of us still dont know about it until the world did. Thus, i think it is crystal clear that they are illegal migrants from wherever it is. Although they lived in Myanmar for generations, they cannot even speak Burmese at all which is unrealistic. Which is also why, some of us cant accept them as our citizens. In the end, the world thinks we all (civilians) are supported those people in killing people.  Helllllll noooo. It is so unfair to even think like that. Its Dictatorship, people. Millions are starving & getting killed with limited healthcare within the country. Limited access of internet in the rural areas.

As results of the 2020 general election, we will hold the third session of parliament and accept the appointment of a new government.  ·Äí·ÄÆ·ÄÄ·Äî·Ä±·Ä∑ ·ÄÄ·Ä¨·ÄÄ·ÄΩ·Äö·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä±·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·ÄÖ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫ ·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Ä°·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äú·Äæ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äî·Ä± ·Ä°·Äû·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Ä°·Äï·Ä∫·Äú·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äù·Äî·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äê·ÄΩ·Ä±·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Åã·ÄÑ·Ä´·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑·Äê·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äô·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äë·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äû·Äô·Äπ·Äô·Äê·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äõ·Ä¨·Äë·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äô·Äæ·Äî·Äæ·ÄØ·Äê·Ä∫·Äë·ÄΩ·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÖ·Ä±·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äõ·ÄÑ·Ä∫ ·Äï·Äº·Ää·Ä∫·Äë·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÖ·ÄØ·Äú·ÄΩ·Äæ·Äê·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äë·Ä≤·ÄÄ·Äî·Ä±·Äï·Ä≤ ·Ä°·ÄÅ·Äº·Ä±·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Ä•·Äï·Äí·Ä±·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äë·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äî·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äû·ÄΩ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äõ·Äô·Äæ·Ä¨·Äñ·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·Åã·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä°·ÄÅ·Äº·Ä±·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Ä•·Äï·Äí·Ä±·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äë·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äî·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äõ·ÄÑ·Ä∫ ·Äê·Äê·Ä≠·Äö·Ä°·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä≠·Äô·Ä∫·Äú·ÄΩ·Äæ·Äê·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Ä±·Ä´·Ä∫·Äï·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∑ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äû·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äô·Äæ·Äï·Ä≤ ·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äõ·Äæ·Ä≠·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äû·Äô·Äπ·Äô·Äê·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äõ·Ä¨·Äë·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äû·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äê·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·ÄÄ·ÄØ·Äî·Ä∫·Äú·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Äæ·Ä¨·Äñ·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·Åã ·ÄÑ·Ä´·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑·Äô·Äº·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Ä¨·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äõ·Äæ·Ä≠·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äû·Äô·Äπ·Äô·Äê·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äï·Ä≤·Äñ·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·Åã ·Äû·Äô·Äπ·Äô·Äê·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·Äô·Ä≠·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äô·Äü·ÄØ·Äê·Ä∫·Äò·Ä≤·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Ä°·Äõ·Ä±·Ä∏·Äï·Ä±·Ä´·Ä∫·Ä°·ÄÅ·Äº·Ä±·Ä°·Äî·Ä±·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä±·ÄÑ·Äº·Ä¨·ÄÅ·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Åä·Ä°·Ä¨·Äè·Ä¨·Äú·ÄΩ·Äæ·Ä≤·Äï·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Ä±·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äê·Äõ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äô·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Åã ·Äë·Äï·Ä∫·Äô·Ä∂·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Ä°·Äï·Ä∫·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äê·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Åã·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äû·Äò·Ä±·Ä¨·Äô·Äê·Ä∞·Äï·Ä´·Åã ·ÅÇ·ÅÄ·ÅÇ·ÅÄ·Ä°·Äë·ÄΩ·Ä±·Äë·ÄΩ·Ä±·Äõ·ÄΩ·Ä±·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äï·ÄΩ·Ä≤·ÄÄ·Äõ·Äõ·Äæ·Ä≠·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äô·Ä≤·Äõ·Äú·Äí·Ä∫·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏ ·Äê·Äê·Ä≠·Äö·Ä°·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä≠·Äô·Ä∫·Äú·ÄΩ·Äæ·Äê·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Äï·Äº·ÄØ·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äï·Ä±·Ä∏·Äï·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äû·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Ä°·Äï·Ä∫·Äê·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äï·Ä≤ ·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Äô·Äö·Ä∫·Åã·ÄÄ·Ä¨·ÄÄ·ÄΩ·Äö·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä±·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·ÄÖ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Ä°·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äú·Äæ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·Äô·Ä≠·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Ä°·Äï·Ä∫·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äê·ÄΩ·Ä±·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·ÄÜ·Äî·Äπ·Äí·Äô·Ä≤·Äï·Ä±·Ä∏·Äï·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÅ·ÄΩ·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äõ·Äæ·Ä≠·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äû·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äï·Äº·Ää·Ä∫·Äû·Ä∞·Äê·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Ä¶·Ä∏·Ä°·Äî·Ä±·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂ ·Äû·Äò·Ä±·Ä¨·Äô·Äê·Ä∞·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äú·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑ ·Äï·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·Åã  #Save #Myanmar üá≤üá≤  #Save #Burma üá≤üá≤  #Reject #the #Military !!! #We #need #democracy!!! #Help #us #and #support #our #Leader,  #Aung #San #Suu #Kyi #government!!!",2/2/21,80,Tracetogether,423,4,-21.57643511,14,2,3,1.266660732,0,0,0

As results of the 2020 general election, we will hold the third session of parliament and accept the appointment of a new government.  ·Äí·ÄÆ·ÄÄ·Ä±·Äî·Çî ·ÄÄ·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Äº·Äö·Äπ·Ä±·Äõ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·ÄÖ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Ä∫·Ä≥·Äï·Äπ ·Äô·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Ä±·Ä°·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äú·ÄΩ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÄ·Ä±·Äî ·Ä°·Äû·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·ÄÖ·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Ä°·Äï·Äπ·Äú·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äê·Äö·Äπ·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äù·Äî·Äπ·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä±·Äê·Äº·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Åã·ÄÑ·Ä´·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑·Äê·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä±·Äª·Äô·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äë·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Äû·Äô·Åº·Äê·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äª·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Äπ·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äõ·Ä¨·Äë·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äô·ÄΩ·Çè·ÄΩ·ÄØ·Äê·Äπ·Äë·Äº·ÄÄ·Äπ·Ä±·ÄÖ·ÄÅ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äê·Äö·Äπ·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äõ·ÄÑ·Äπ ·Äª·Äï·Ää·Äπ·Ä±·Äë·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÖ·ÄØ·Äú·Çä·Äê·Äπ·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Äë·Ä≤·ÄÄ·Ä±·Äî·Äï·Ä≤ ·Ä°·Ä±·Äª·ÄÅ·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Ä•·Äï·Ä±·Äí·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Äë·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Äî·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·Äô·Ä∫·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äû·Äº·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äõ·Äô·ÄΩ·Ä¨·Äª·Äñ·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Äπ·Åã·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·ÄÖ·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·Äï·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä°·Ä±·Äª·ÄÅ·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Ä•·Äï·Ä±·Äí·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Äë·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Äî·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äõ·ÄÑ·Äπ ·Äê·Äê·Ä≠·Äö·Ä°·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·Ä≠·Äô·Äπ·Äú·Çä·Äê·Äπ·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Ä±·ÄÅ·Åö·Åø·Äï·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Ä∑ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·Äû·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·ÄÖ·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·Åø·Äï·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äô·ÄΩ·Äï·Ä≤ ·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äõ·ÄΩ·Ä≠·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Äû·Äô·Åº·Äê·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äª·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Äπ·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äõ·Ä¨·Äë·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äû·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äê·Äô·Äπ·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·ÄÄ·ÄØ·Äî·Äπ·Äú·Äº·Äî·Äπ·Äô·ÄΩ·Ä¨·Äª·Äñ·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Äπ·Åã ·ÄÑ·Ä´·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑·Äª·Äô·Äî·Äπ·Äô·Ä¨·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äõ·ÄΩ·Ä≠·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Äû·Äô·Åº·Äê·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äª·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Äπ·Äï·Ä≤·Äª·Äñ·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Äπ·Åã ·Äû·Äô·Åº·Äê·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äª·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Äπ·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·Äô·Ä≠·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Äî·Ä≤·Çî·Äô·Äü·ÄØ·Äê·Äπ·Äò·Ä≤·Äî·Ä≤·Çî ·Ä°·Ä±·Äõ·Ä∏·Ä±·Äï·Åö·Ä°·Ä±·Äª·ÄÅ·Ä°·Ä±·Äî·Ä±·Åæ·ÄÄ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä¨·Äª·ÄÅ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Åä·Ä°·Ä¨·Äè·Ä¨·Äú·Çä·Ä≤·Ä±·Äª·Äï·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Ä±·Äï·Ä∏·Äª·ÄÅ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äô·Ä∫·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äê·Äõ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äô·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Åã ·Äë·Äï·Äπ·Äô·Ä∂·ÄÅ·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Ä°·Äï·Äπ·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äê·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Åã·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äû·Ä±·Äò·Ä¨·Äô·Äê·Ä∞·Äï·Ä´·Åã ·ÅÇ·ÅÄ·ÅÇ·ÅÄ·Ä°·Ä±·Äë·Äº·Ä±·Äë·Äº·Ä±·Äõ·Äº·Ä∏·Ä±·ÄÄ·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äï·Äº·Ä≤·ÄÄ·Äõ·Äõ·ÄΩ·Ä≠·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äô·Ä≤·Äõ·Äú·Äí·Äπ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏ ·Äê·Äê·Ä≠·Äö·Ä°·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·Ä≠·Äô·Äπ·Äú·Çä·Äê·Äπ·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä¨·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äï·Äª·Äï·Ä≥·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Ä±·Äï·Ä∏·Åø·Äï·ÄÆ·Ä∏ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·Äû·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·ÄÖ·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Ä°·Äï·Äπ·Äê·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äï·Ä≤ ·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Äô·Äö·Äπ·Åã·ÄÄ·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Äº·Äö·Äπ·Ä±·Äõ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·ÄÖ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Ä∫·Ä≥·Äï·Äπ·Äô·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Ä±·Ä°·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äú·ÄΩ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·Äô·Ä≠·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Äî·Ä≤·Çî ·ÄÅ·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Ä°·Äï·Äπ·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä±·Äê·Äº·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·ÄÜ·Çè·Åµ·Äô·Ä≤·Ä±·Äï·Ä∏·Äï·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÅ·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Äπ·Äõ·ÄΩ·Ä≠·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äû·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äª·Äï·Ää·Äπ·Äû·Ä∞·Äê·ÄÖ·Äπ·Ä¶·Ä∏·Ä°·Ä±·Äî·Äî·Ä≤·Çî ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂ ·Äû·Ä±·Äò·Ä¨·Äô·Äê·Ä∞·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äú·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑ ·Ä±·Äª·Äï·Ä¨·ÄÅ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Äπ·Åã  #Save #Myanmar üá≤üá≤  #Save #Burma üá≤üá≤  #Reject #the #Military !!! #We #need #democracy!!! #Help #us #and #support #our #Leader,  #Aung #San #Suu #Kyi #government!!!·ÅÄ",2/2/21,80,Tracetogether,414,4,-21.47629108,25,2,3,1.266660732,0,0,0

"""The EU√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s General Data Protection Regulation is one of the better known, and strictest, frameworks - increasingly becoming a model for other countries to follow. ""  As someone who has just developed his website following EU's GDPR framework, it is a good practice but the onus is on the website owner as it requires some self-declaration. The owner might not be technically competent to access the risks on all the software he uses and so it might not be a comprehensive solution to address security risks.  I took a look at China's proposal ""Global Initiative on Data Security"" (√•‚Ä¶¬®√ß¬ê∆í√¶‚Ä¢¬∞√¶¬ç¬Æ√•¬Æ‚Ä∞√•‚Ä¶¬®√•‚Ç¨¬°√®¬Æ¬Æ) highlighted in the above news article which unfortunately is short of details. The English translation is attached.  Some technical details look promising. For e.g., the Initiative highlights :  ""States should encourage companies to abide by laws and regulations of the State where they operate. States should not request domestic companies to store data generated and obtained overseas in their own territory.""  So user data would be stored in the country where they are collected and thus would not be stored in overseas servers.   One tweak I would like to see though is that companies could house their data regionally in trusted countries like SG as it is uneconomical if data have to be localised in every country. This would help to promote job growth for SG as a regional data centre.  https://language.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202009/09/WS5f58364da310675eafc586ee.html",16/9/20,224,Tracetogether,237,4,-11.65866485,46,8,1,0.825876621,0,1,1

"As we bid adieu to the year of Rat üêÄ, which has been challenging and unprecedented in more than one way, here‚Äôs something positive to look out for a Oxcipious new year.  There are 20 strokes in Áñ´ÊÉÖÔºåthe Chinese characters for pandemic.  There are 20 strokes in ÁóõËã¶, the Chinese characters for pain/hardship.  There are 20 strokes in ÁñæÁóÖ, the Chinese characters for illness/disease.  There are 20 strokes in ÁîüÊ≠ªÂ≠ò‰∫°, the Chinese characters for life and death, survival and demise.  2020 is gone. And so we hope that pandemic, hardships, diseases and death will also be gone.  On the other hand:  There are 21 strokes in ÂÅ•Â∫∑, the Chinese characters for health.  There are 21 strokes in Âπ∏Á¶èÔºåthe Chinese characters for happiness.  There are 21 strokes in ÂØåË¥µÔºåthe Chinese characters for wealth.  There are 21 strokes in ÂíåÁù¶, the Chinese characters for harmony.  There are 21 strokes in Âã§Â•ãÔºåthe Chinese characters for industry.  There are 21 strokes in Â¥õËµ∑, the Chinese characters for ascendancy.  And so it seems 2021 will be a year of HEALTH and HAPPINESS.  Taking this opportunity to wish all the hero‚Äôs both in front line, backend and the resolute Singaporeans during these difficult times, a very Happy New Year. Gong Xi Fa Cai.

"Dear Sir  Its time that SG Govt formulate new entry permit rules for SG based professionals, both local and expat, so that business travel cud resume.    Such an arrangement shud now be based on the fact that travelers can be, and shud be, Vaccinated on priority. I will go to the extent of asking SG govt to charge vaccination fee for such people.   2. Such travellers shud be allowed to travel seemlessly without entry permits and  3.  If there is  mandatory SHN requiement for such people, it shud be in the confines of their home rather than hotels.    It must be acknowledged that this disease is not going to go away in a hurry and it cud be 4-5 years before everythingnis back to 2019 days.  In fact there may be no 2019 again for our generation.

"Without a vaccine or an effective treatment, many governments are looking for effective ways of subduing and suppressing COVID19 spread.  This is difficult for two reasons (1) the virus can spread without any symptoms in some patients and clusters form before you know it, (2) long term lockdown is not sustainable and its economic impact can be too harsh for some countries.  With the help of technology, people can work from home or even study from home.  Restrictions can be put in place, like wearing of masks, social distancing, etc.  Not to forget the efforts of our frontline workers.
