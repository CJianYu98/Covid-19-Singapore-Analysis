601,633,"‼️To The Straits Time‼️ You need to look at your facts straight before posting something controversy at this critical moment of Myanmar.  Yesterday, the peaceful protests of Myanmar citizens happened in front of Myanmar Embassy in Thailand. Many Thai citizens and Thai pro-democracy activists also joined this movement as they recognize the pain of oppressive military junta( if you follow the news, there were huge uprisings all over the Thailand in past few months against Junta Dictatorship). And yesterday, Thai police came to the scene and tried to break the crowd by force. That's when Thai citizens in the crowd and Thai police had a clash. NOT WITH MYANMAR PROTESTERS. We are not stupid, why would we fight with Thai police while we are residing in their country? During these few weeks, Thai people are also not pleased with government way of handling Covid 19 and delay of vaccination. So, Thai protesters took the opportunity to voice out their grievances against government. Meanwhile, Thai protesters helped Myanmar protesters to leave the scene by blocking and confronting the police force. The lady in the 1st pic is also Thai citizen who was complaining about the Government's Covid19 response.  All of my information come from localThai news sites who keep updated at the scene yesterday from Bangkok.  We Myanmar citizens are now having a very hard time and please do not make it worse by false news and accusations.",2021-02-02,231

728,762,"I have never  my voice against this matter since some are making their own accusations & assumptions. Firstly, we did not support any harms which happened to Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State. Media platforms (most of them affiliated with Military forces) did not state anything about it until the world found out.   Briefly, Madam Aung San Suu Kyi took all the blame after that & defended against the world to protect the civilians as well as the country. Indeed, she couldnt stop the genocide without any control power over the military. The world did have a bad image about Myanmar & the military forces make it worse again. It was the dirty trick which created by them to take control over this country while other countries are looking down on us regarding Rohingya matter. Moreover, our country has not only Rohingya Muslims (war refugees) in Rakhine State which caused by armed & dangerous people, accordingly; our ethnic groups from Multiple states are getting the same treatment. Heres also a brief explanation about Rohingya Muslims, lets go back to the beginning of the story. At first, the military officials illegally allowed them (without civilians knowledge) in order to gain human labors & make religious-related-riots here or there. Decades later, Rohingya Muslims requested for their own land with their own government so on & so on which messed things up. Even after all those thing happened, like I said, most of us still dont know about it until the world did. Thus, i think it is crystal clear that they are illegal migrants from wherever it is. Although they lived in Myanmar for generations, they cannot even speak Burmese at all which is unrealistic. Which is also why, some of us cant accept them as our citizens. In the end, the world thinks we all (civilians) are supported those people in killing people.  Helllllll noooo. It is so unfair to even think like that. Its Dictatorship, people. Millions are starving & getting killed with limited healthcare within the country. Limited access of internet in the rural areas. We still has difficulties with transportation system, hygiene food, clear water & etc., as well. We all are on the same boat. Thus, do not ever say on this matter through googling shits online.   (Ps- My bad if its too long.)",2021-02-02,377

The owner might not be technically competent to access the risks on all the software he uses and so it might not be a comprehensive solution to address security risks.  I took a look at China's proposal ""Global Initiative on Data Security"" (å…¨çƒæ•°æ®å®‰å…¨å€¡è®®) highlighted in the above news article which unfortunately is short of details. The English translation is attached.  Some technical details look promising. For e.g., the Initiative highlights :  ""States should encourage companies to abide by laws and regulations of the State where they operate. States should not request domestic companies to store data generated and obtained overseas in their own territory.""  So user data would be stored in the country where they are collected and thus would not be stored in overseas servers.   One tweak I would like to see though is that companies could house their data regionally in trusted countries like SG as it is uneconomical if data have to be localised in every country. This would help to promote job growth for SG as a regional data centre.  https://language.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202009/09/WS5f58364da310675eafc586ee.html",2020-09-16,224
