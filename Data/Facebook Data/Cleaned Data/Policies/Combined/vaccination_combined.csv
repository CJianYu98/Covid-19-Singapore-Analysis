57,78,"These vaccines astrazeneca, moderna, pfizer, coronavac, sinovac, sputnik they all used mRNA of a virus and some genetically modified.  The character of a virus is to inject its RNA/genetic code to a host cell in the body. RNA is a single strand, that means there is no cross checking. The fighter cells thinks it's harmless because the virus disguise itself in the host cells.  The DNA (humans) is hard to copy because it has double strands, it means there is a cross checker. That's very difficult to replicate. If you inject these vaccines, aren't they making the body as virus factories?  Fatalities may rise since the priorities are the senior citizens and the vulnerable (those who has underlying sickness). If they die (God forbids) it's easy to cover it up or mask the cause of death since they will make old age and their underlying sickness as an excuse.  These vaccines are rushed and even the clinical trials. It may be good on paper but human trials are different.  Now, we must monitor rise of deaths related to the vaccinated people. We do not really know the severity of its side effecs as it may take years to come. There are reports of people dying from nursing homes in different countries after the injection.  There are also doctors and nurses who had a severe side effect and who had died. It's worrisome because the priorities of these vaccines are also the frontliners, if they die (God forbids) what's gonna happen to us?

85,110,"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,2021-03-11,479

Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my husband. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached home, I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to our bedroom. I didn't knock the door because i wanted to surprise him because he wasn't expecting me at the time,But when i opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in our house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, He followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away.Out of shame my husband stopped picking my calls and finally blocked me. I used to cry day and night not until i had to explain everything to my best friend where had gone to have a peace of mind. she told me to fight for my man and not lose him to another woman. She gave me contact of Mama Sarah 603764121 and told me Mama Sarah +27603764121 will bring back my husband to me and love only me. So i contacted Mama Sarah +27603764121 and told her everything, she made a love and binding prayers for me and in just 3 days of the prayers my husband came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again. The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby,He cried and smiled with joy and happiness. We are back together and so much in love and waiting for our baby to arrive. Thanks so much Mama Sarah +27603764121 your prayers indeed work.

Any form of coercion must be thoroughly investigated and the relevant party taken to task. This will also act to safeguard organizations potentially if something unfortunate happens and an employee decides to falsely accuse the employer of forcing the vaccine upon staff.

What actually happened:  1. Democratically elected politicians who were supposed to meet up, got kidnapped, by the military.  2. Citizens and public figures such as singers and writer got kidnapped for using their right of free speech to speak in favour of democracy.  3. Phone signals got cut off around 3 am in Naypyidaw.  4. The rest of the country followed.  5. Tv, radio and some internet providers got cut off. 6. Road to the airport got blocked.  7. ATMs and all banks are closed.  8. MWD announced that Myint Swe is the new President 9. The coup is official, and the country is in an emergency rule and the military will have full control over the country for at least one year.

At the same time, we fully support what they stand for and we are praying for them and also taking notes on how to become a great leader without fear.

He said that he never wanted to stay with me again and that she no longer loved me. So he unpacked he bags and caused severe pain to me and my children. I tried every possible way to get him back after much begging, but to no avail and he confirmed that he had made a decision and never wanted to see me again. When I got home from work on Tuesday, I met an old friend who asked about my husband. I explained everything to him, so he told me that the only way to get my husband back was to visit a magic diffuser that helped him get through difficult times. I've never believed in spells, but I have no choice but to take your advice. the pitcher assured me that I will get my husband back the next day. What an amazing statement! I never believed, so he spoke to me and told me everything I had to do, and the next morning, surprisingly, my husband, who had not called me for the last 7 months, called to let me know he would be back. So awesome !! So he came back the same day, with much love and joy, apologizing for his mistake and for the pain he had caused me and our children. As of today our relationship is stronger than before, thanks to the help of a pitcher.

1430,2027,Expected this to happen to SIA. Are all the staff include the cabin crew and pilot being tested every time they travelled back to Singapore?,2020-12-31,25
1431,2028,Undoing the good work done by the population. Never learn the mistakes in HK several months back where they allowed ferry crew to move around and spread.   Creating a false sense of security to allow the crew to move around.  What makes the crew totally safe on the aircraft? Toilets or meals etc.....,2020-12-30,53
1432,2029,"Someone blasted at me when I mentioned crew should also go through sahn to keep us safe. And that someone said that we should believe the air  crew will adhere to the stringent measures when they are overseas. Fact is: The hotel staff/people around them there may also be infected so even if they really stay in the rooms, they may also be infected. Better safe than to be sorry and hope they really think for the rest of us in Singapore when they open the skies.",2020-12-30,88
1433,2030,Air crew should receive vaccines they fly with the imported infected cases daily.,2020-12-30,13
1434,2031,"Those who worry about daily numbers should just get vaccinated and move on with life. Now that a vaccine is readily available, everyone aged 21 yrs & above should get vaccinated, mandated by law so that we can just move on as a nation. Quit the reporting of these daily stats. Is there any point to this click bait?",2020-12-30,57
1435,2032,Kinda silly that gahmen is strict  with those breaking SD n drinking after 1030pm in eateries when it’s been zero cases in community but so lax in allowing the bigger danger of letting  air crew coming in without quarantine just bcoz it’s too troublesome n tedious for the airline n staff. Obviously whatever the reasons for doing so isn’t working.,2020-12-31,62
1436,2033,Why SQ never learn what happen in EVA Air 🤨,2020-12-30,9

1439,2036,"Why worries as we can test if vacines are effective as by mid Jan,key person inoculated.Remembered we have huge migrants pool to let our medical do the testing and developing .If we asked the local to donate blood or do the vacine testing in masses,we will have huge complaints.So welcome guests and to test if Pfizer vaccines effective ..timming 😂",2020-12-30,59
1440,2037,"In my opinion, the strict itinerary that air crew goes through when overseas is a false sense of security. Making sure air crew take designated ground transfer and stay in their hotel away from city centre - what does it help if on the plane already you are in close contact with Covid positive passengers? Even the cups and eating utensils, the toilet cubicles are contaminated   Don’t get me wrong. Strict itinerary overseas is critical. So is quarantine when crew flies back home.",2020-12-30,83

In my humble personal opinion and most urgent plea - Air crew should not be running around after flights. #21DaysQuarantine. If Singapore go into another lockdown. Imagine what the economy will be like. Air Crew are not the only ones who need work. We all also need to work and earn a living, kids need to go to school. Possible to put air crew second in priority after NCID for vaccination? Safer for their families as well. Please advise them not to go gym or exercise, jogging without masks please. Think about it. If this continues Singapore Airlines reputation also gone. See Philippines also close door to Singapore now. It goes to show the perception this has created",2020-12-30,130

Just want to point out... please be considerate lah... elderly patient in life threatening condition already went through 2 swabs and visitor is spouse of high risk personnel still insists on visiting. Just raising an awareness and hope people will be more considerate in everyday life matters. I was put in a difficult position how to say No? Please do not put our medical frontliners as well as patients and caregivers at risk.#BeConsiderate",2020-12-30,128

This is because,  most people will take phase 3 as pre covid-19 situation and we can celebrate. There is no phase 4 and thus, it is easily mistaken,  it is all under controlled and be complacent.  This is a bad mistake.  2. This is the mental misconception which gives covid-19 more chance to grow silently even before vaccines are already injected. The war with covid-19 is not over with Asian countries having multiple waves.    3. The moment we let our guard down and focus to open up too soon, we will suffer longer. Now we must acknowledge that covid-19 is more severe and hard to break compared to SARS,  MERS,  EBOLA,  H1N1 or other coronovirus.   4.

If they inoculate 10K dose per day x 300 days is 3 million dose a year , their population is 30million , so it will take 10 years for the first dose.... second dose, yearly booster dose, PM change, Ruling party change .....so if you consider all this factors, god knows how many decades more or this will not end in our generation. .",2021-03-10,69
2077,18,Spending some money to make the community safe. Isnâ€™t it benefiting for the society at large? More money had already been spent on securing vaccines at an early stage even before trial results are out. Money went into the drain for vaccines with results that did not reach the standard. So it is nothing to compare with giving it to them for free.   Looking far sighted and long term is what our govt have been doing. Priority should really be given to people who come into contact with larger group of people a day.   It make sense to vaccinate Malaysia delivery driver and accompany personnel looking at the high covid rate there. This will keep Singaporean in contact with them safe and in turn prevent spread of covid to locals or forming of a covid cluster thru them. ,2021-03-09,138

However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual.

This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,2021-03-11,479

2197,160,"Netizens and experts are calling for the US government to release information on the suspension of an infectious disease research lab under the US Army, as a petition on the White House website listed coincident events between the closure and the outbreak of COVID-19, urging the US government to clarify whether the lab was related to the deadly virus.   While the origin of the novel coronavirus is still unknown and conspiracy theories have caused widespread panic, experts said that timely information disclosure to the public would benefit global unity and cooperation against the pandemic, which had infected more than 150,000 people and killed 5,400 around the world as of Saturday.    The Fort Detrick laboratory that handles high-level disease-causing material, such as Ebola, in Fredrick, Maryland was shut after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a cease and desist order to the organization in July, 2019 according to local media.  The suspension was due to multiple causes, including failure to follow local procedures and a lack of periodic recertification training for workers in the biocontainment laboratories. The wastewater decontamination system of the lab also failed to meet standards set by the Federal Select Agent Program, media reported.  The lab, which was closed more than half a year ago, recently caught public attention as a petition submitted to the White House website on March 10 listed some coincidences in time between the closure and the COVID-19 outbreak.   For example, ""a large-scale 'influenza' killed more than 10,000 people"" in the US in August 2019 following the closure; and the COVID-19 epidemic broke out globally in February 2020 after the US organized Event 201 - A Global Pandemic Exercise - in October 2019.   The petition also noted that many English-language news reports about the closure of Fort Detrick were deleted amid the worsening COVID-19 pandemic, raising suspicions over the lab's relationship with the novel coronavirus.   Petitioners urged the US government to publish the real reason for the lab's closure and to clarify whether the lab was related to the novel coronavirus and whether there was a virus leak.   ""It's not a small issue, the truth should be published,"" an internet user commented.   ""The world deserves to know the truth,"" said another.   Ni Feng, a deputy director of the Institute of American Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, called on the US government to increase transparency in the COVID-19 pandemic related issues in response to wide-spread doubts.     The origin of the virus should be decided according to scientific research, but the urgent issue at the current stage is to cooperate in the global battle against the pandemic, Ni noted.",2021-03-09,420

However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual.

Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,2021-03-11,479

Also surprised that I haven't seen this old news.  Between saving more lives by reducing vaccine hesitancy, and reaping in more profits from increased demand, what could be preventing them from getting vaccinated early?  Still waiting for news of them taking the vaccine. It's probably reasonable to assume they have not yet gotten themselves vaccinated.  Surely the Pfizer executives would have the best information to weigh risk-benefit? Why should Singaporeans believe benefits outweigh risks, when Pfizer executives haven't demonstrated belief in their own product, in America with much higher covid risks?  For people that still think ""not cutting the line"" is a valid excuse, consider that they've sold vaccines to Singapore, which should be at the very back of the line, due to how well covid is controlled, compared to most other nations.  "" our company ran a lot of polls to see what would take people to believe it. And one of the highest ranking â€“ even higher than if Joe Biden takes it, even higher than if the other presidents take it, is if the CEO of the company takes it. So with that in mind, Iâ€™m trying to find a way that I will get vaccinated despite if it is not my time just to demonstrate the confidence of the company.

He went on to say that Sinovac had denied reports that Brazil would get a similar vaccine at a much lower price of $1.96 per dosage. â€œThe $1.96 price per dosage price is incorrect, because the shipping cost alone is at least $2 per dosage. Sinovac is currently seeking the origins of this report,â€ he added. Honesti said the decision to set the potential vaccine price was based on the amount of investment put into phase three of the clinical trials and the efficacy test.  https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/10/13/covid-19-vaccine-to-be-priced-at-rp-200000-per-dosage-bio-farma.html",2021-03-04,162

In simple terms, those who have the disease are definitely infected by the virus, but those who are infected by the virus may not necessarily get the disease.

Preventing new outbreaks has the (popular) zero risk sound to it.   Getting the population vaccinated largely makes sense and speeding up would even be better.   â€œThe world having the virus under controlâ€ is a meaningless phrase unless itâ€™s qualified by what risks are to be prevented. Otherwise itâ€™s very easy to drift into zero risk territory again.   Itâ€™s very populistic to stay in the abstract and have an external catch all condition that means all and nothing.

Just look at the method or approach used. West vaccine is new method, which is not proven. Just a trial, which they inject the virus (unharmful amount) and let your body build immunity to the virus. So, question, what happens if your body didnâ€™t react to it? So, what happens to this amount of virus? Will it mutate to a new string? Will it create a new disease? East method, which is similar to BCG vaccine. It kills the virus to a certain amount n your body picks it up n build immunity to it. It is a proven method for decades.... if u have no virus in your body, basically nothing happens. So, why would u say it is more harmful for the east method?

2930,1115,"Did you know only 94 people were selected for 'tests before approval of Pfizer vaccine ?Talk about a quickie..  Dr Julian Tang, Honorary Associate Professor in Respiratory Sciences and Clinical Virologist, University of Leicester, said:  â€œThe results for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine are encouraging â€“ but it is so far based on the outcomes of only 94 participants.   â€œIf the 90% â€˜efficacyâ€™ was based on the analysis of 10,000 participants, along with similar safety data, this would be much more reassuring.  â€œOther practical problems still need to be addressed â€“ how will GPs and other providers deal with the -70C storage?  How long can the defrosted vaccine remain useable (up to 5 days?) â€“ so there will be inevitably some wastage if a certain number of doses are defrosted that are then just not used in time?  â€œAlso this is a new vaccine design â€“ we donâ€™t have any other routinely used licensed viral vaccines based on this mRNA technology.  So how will the vaccine perform if repeated boosts are needed if the duration of the vaccine-induced immunity is relatively short?  â€œAnd how will the vaccine perform in the elderly and those with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and other chronic heart, lung, kidney disease that make them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19?  â€œWhat about the performance if the vaccine in those who have already had COVID-19 and have circulating antibodies?  â€œWhat is the reason for those who fail to respond to this vaccine?  And will this also be a problem for other COVID-19 vaccines for those individuals?  â€œHopefully more data will be forthcoming to give us more reassurance about the efficacy and safety of this new Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine â€“ and help us understand and perhaps even predict, to some extent, the responses to the other COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in development.â€  Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham, said:  â€œItâ€™s great news that the Pfizer vaccine is reported to be 90% effective, but itâ€™s important to understand what that means.  For a vaccine to be truly effective it needs to protect those most vulnerable from suffering severe COVID-19 or prevent those less vulnerable from becoming infected and then transmitting the virus to others.

It is characterised by a fusion of technologies â€“ such as artificial intelligence, gene editing and advanced robotics â€“ that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological worlds. It will disrupt nearly every industry in every country, creating new opportunities and challenges for people, places and businesses to which we must respond. ]  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulation-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution  [ PROCUREMENT PROCESS Three vaccines soon looked viable - Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac. The first two vaccines use the new messenger RNA technology. Sinovac is a traditional inactivated virus vaccine.  mRNA vaccines teach our cells to make a protein that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. This is different from traditional vaccines that put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies.  The group made its first advance purchase agreement with Moderna in June, securing it with a down payment. In August, it bought the Sinovac vaccine and advanced talks with Pfizer-BioNTech.  Though Moderna appeared to be the frontrunner, the US Food and Drug Administration gave its stamp of approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine earlier, on Dec 11.  Singapore followed suit, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announcing in a televised address on Dec 15 that the Health Sciences Authority had approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. ] https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-covid-19-vaccine-shipment-edb-shortlist-negotiate-13823698  [ Recognizing the broad potential of mRNA science, we set out to create an mRNA technology platform that functions very much like an operating system on a computer. It is designed so that it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs.

This should help publicise Singapore as being a safer city to conduct business.  This indicator must be updated daily and available on all main stream media.  2.  Like NEWATER, where ministers YAM SENG to the newater bottle, similarly, all Ministers, Mayors, MPs, the Expert Committee can do the same to lead by example and show the world we don't talk but do.  By default, all Superscale officers must lead by having vaccination.  How do we otherwise achieve herd mentality where the leaders at the top just say charge and stay behind the troops.  3.  There could be an app ( perhaps and extension of TraceTogether ) which gives you a virtual passport that you have been vaccinated.  With vaccination comes privileges, perhaps the privilege for travel.  4.  All front line medical staff. including Safety Distancing Ambassdors, must be part of the wave.  Healthcare workers from Head of Departments, Doctors and nurses must go take the vaccination.  How do we achieve 70% vaccination when our healthcare workers are not even 100%.  Teachers who interact with students must be vaccinated.  In fact, while it's voluntary, make it a criteria for getting bonus.  In the 70s, ligation was used to provide benefits for mothers who wanted to stop at 2 and was highly successful.     5.  The currently announced ""staging plan"" looked skimpy.  There must be more meat.    6.  Have competition to show which constituency is leading the vaccination penetration.    Let's do this the Uniquely Singapore way.  It's the execution that counts.

The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.  ..........  Page 39 â€œDetection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.â€  â€œSince no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/Î¼L) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.â€  Budâ€™s comments:  The PCR test has multiple probes designed insilico (i.e. in a computer) from the GenBank sequence database based on the N gene, not from isolated and validated sequence of SARS CoV-2.  The N gene sequence codes for the glycoprotein coating that encapsulates and protects the RNA in the virus from nucleases in the body which would break apart the RNA sequence of the virus.   The CDC document is very concerning.  Without validation against isolated, filtered virus using either standard Kochâ€™s or Riversâ€™ postulates (methods which have been used to validate cause for every other pandemic including SARS CoV-1 from the 2002-2004 pandemic), vaccines are being created based on synthetic sequence designed to cause invivo human cells in the living, healthy patient to produce one or more proteins from the S-spike protein on the virus, but neither this sequence nor the protein it produces has been validated against the sequence of the S-spike protein on isolated SARS CoV2.

The truth is there is no vaccine yet that has been carefully studied n research which need years to do it. Rushing a vaccine out is totally irresponsible n dangerous. Wait n see approach with masks n precautions plus keeping immunity high is the best n only approach now. Don't make the same mistake as masks, it is that obvious to wear mask but our gov miss it. Now it is very obvious vaccine is premature.

3247,1549,"Just providing an alternative perspective, to be cautious when looking at the COVID-19 vaccine... Adverse Reactions During Vaccine Trials The media appears to have played down the severity of adverse reactions from vaccine trials. However, the results are actually quite worrying. Take, for example, the genetically engineered mRNA vaccine from Moderna. Its Phase I trial involved 45 subjects (between 18 and 55 years of age), divided into three groups of 15, each group receiving two inoculations, one month apart, each at three dose levels, 25 Âµg, 100 Âµg and 250 Âµg.  Every single test subject on the highest and on the preferred intermediate dose suffered some kind of adverse reaction. At the lowest dose, 1 out of the 13 subjects became so sick that he or she had to be hospitalized, with 7 out of 13 (54%) having adverse events. 80% of those on the intermediate dose suffered a moderately severe adverse reaction (with the other 20% suffering mild adverse reactions). At the highest dose, all 14 subjects experienced adverse events with 21% (3 out of 14) of subjects suffering â€œone or more severe adverse eventsâ€. The trial was based on exclusionary volunteer selection â€“ in other words, the healthiest volunteers were selected to be test subjects for the trial, and not those who were immunocompromised. Individuals who were pregnant, overweight, smokers, suffering from respiratory problems, have a history of seizures in the family, suffering from autoimmune diseases and so forth were excluded.

3250,1553,"No Long-Term Safety Studies Of mRNA Vaccines Modernaâ€™s vaccine candidate, as well as the Duke-NUS vaccine candidate, are mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines are a new invention and have never been administered on anyone (save the volunteers currently involved in trials), let alone on the entire population. Therefore, there has not been any long-term studies on the safety of mRNA vaccines. Antibody-Dependent Response of Vaccines Not Tested â€“ Likely to Result in Deaths of Those Vaccinated Since the first SARS outbreak in 2003, scientists have been trying to develop a vaccine for SARS. However, the development of an effective vaccine for SARS has proven to be very problematic. One study is indicative. Ferrets were injected with experimental vaccines and then exposed to the live SARS virus. When examined, the ferrets were found to have developed severe hepatitis indicating liver damage.  This is due to an effect known as Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). ADE occurs when a vaccine produces binding antibodies instead of neutralizing antibodies. The binding antibodies help the viruses to enter the cells of organs more easily. A dengue vaccine introduced into the Philippines was halted and recalled in 2017 after at least 130 children died from ADE caused by the vaccine, despite the vaccine having been already approved by the World Health Organization as being safe.  Since administering a challenge test (exposure to the actual virus) is deemed to be unethical in human trials, it will not be known whether the COVID-19 vaccines currently in trials will cause ADE in humans.

3253,1557,"Virus Interference Could Cause The Vaccinated To Be More Susceptible to Future COVID-19 Virus Mutations There is already evidence showing that the current COVID-19 strains are mutating. How confident can we be that the vaccines that are currently being developed will still be effective by the time they are released into the market? If the current COVID-19 strains are mutating, we may face problems in future if we are currently vaccinated for one particular strain of the COVID-19 virus. Studies show that after administration of the flu vaccine, there is a 440% increase in the likelihood of being infected by other non-flu viruses.  This phenomenon, known as virus interference, may cause those vaccinated with the current COVID-19 vaccines to be more susceptible to infection by future mutations of the COVID-19 virus.   Pharmaceutical Companies Likely Immune From Legal Liability, Liability Likely To Be Borne By Governments The pharmaceutical companies creating the COVID-19 vaccines have already sought immunity from liability for harm caused by the vaccines.  If these vaccines cause harm, the financial liability is likely to fall on the governments which mandate them. This will not be the first time that governments have to bear liability. For instance, the United Kingdom government paid out Â£60 million to 60 individuals who suffered brain damage from the swine flu vaccine in 2014.  Immunity from liability, plus the potential to earn billions of dollars from the COVID-19 vaccines being developed, is a recipe for temptation that may lead pharmaceutical companies to cut corners and rush the vaccines into the market instead of taking adequate time to ensure the safety of these vaccines.

Should this happen, the non-neutralizing antibodies could enhance viral entry into cells and viral replication and end up worsening infection instead of offering protection. ""if the gun is jumped, and a vaccine is widely distributed that is disease enhancing, that would be worse than actually not doing any vaccination at all.â€  Vaccines typically take at least 7 years for development.

I was bewildered, if you have expected weekends to be so crowded and tedious waiting, why set these seniors appointments on Saturday? Not to mention young people are also allowed to register during this period which I thought is supposed to prioritize the seniors... if not for the staff to suggest we could collect a queue tix, leave for dinner and come back 2 hrs later to take the jab, I would be more annoyed.

3606,129,"THE PFIZER–BIONTECH AND MODERNA mRNA VACCINES ARE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA).  IN CLINICAL TRIALS, BOTH WERE FOUND TO BE 95 PERCENT EFFECTIVE AFTER GETTING THE BOOSTER DOSE.  BUT WE NEED 100% VACCINES NOT 95% AS OUR DEATH RATES ARE VERY LOW.  mRNA VACCINES DO NOT CONTAIN A WEAKENED OR INACTIVE FORM OF THE VIRUS ITSELF.  INSTEAD, THEY USE MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) TO TEACH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RECOGNISE AND REACT TO A COMPONENT OF THE VIRUS THAT IS KEY TO ITS ABILITY TO MAKE US SICK.  VIRUSES CAN’T REPRODUCE THEMSELVES, THEY NEED A HOST—THE CORONAVIRUS USES A SPIKE PROTEIN TO GAIN ENTRY INTO THE CELLS AND START THE REPLICATION PROCESS THAT MAKES US SICK.  IN DEVELOPING mRNA VACCINES, SCIENTISTS ZEROED IN ON A UNIQUE SPIKE PROTEIN THAT IS FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE VIRUS.  ON ITS OWN, THIS SPIKE PROTEIN IS INCAPABLE OF CAUSING COVID-19.  THE mRNA VACCINES WORK BY RELAYING A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO BUILD THIS PROTEIN, WITH THE GOAL OF TEACHING YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HOW TO DISARM IT.  AFTER INJECTION, THE VACCINE PARTICLES COME INTO CONTACT WITH IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS AND DELIVER THE mRNA MESSAGE.  YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS SPIKE PROTEIN, AND HERE’S HOW—AS THE VACCINATED CELLS START CHURNING OUT THE SPIKE PROTEIN, OTHER IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS REALISE THAT THE PROTEIN SHOULD NOT BE THERE, THAT’S WHEN THE BATTLE BEGINS.  THE IMMUNE SYSTEM STARTS BUILDING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE AND MAKING ANTIBODIES.  YOUR BODY CONTINUES TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL ALL THE SPIKE PROTEINS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.  AT THE END OF THIS NATURAL IMMUNE PROCESS, YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS THE KNOWLEDGE IT NEEDS TO RECOGNISE THE SPIKE PROTEIN AND FEND OFF FUTURE EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS.  SO IF THE VIRUS ENTERS THE BODY, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL IDENTIFY AND ATTACK IT.  COVID-19 mRNA VACCINES ARE GIVEN IN THE UPPER ARM MUSCLE—ONCE THE INSTRUCTIONS (mRNA) ARE INSIDE THE IMMUNE CELLS, THE CELLS USE THEM TO MAKE THE PROTEIN PIECE.  AFTER THE PROTEIN PIECE IS MADE, THE CELL BREAKS DOWN THE INSTRUCTIONS AND GETS RID OF THEM.  NEXT, THE CELL DISPLAYS THE PROTEIN PIECE ON ITS SURFACE.  TWO DOSES, SEPARATED BY THREE TO FOUR WEEKS, IS THE TRIED-AND-TRUE APPROACH TO GENERATE AN EFFECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE THROUGH VACCINATION.  THE FIRST DOSE PRIMES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND INTRODUCES THE BODY TO THE GERM OF INTEREST—THIS ALLOWS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO PREPARE ITS DEFENSE.  THE SECOND DOSE, OR BOOSTER, PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RAMP UP THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF THE ANTIBODIES USED TO FIGHT THE VIRUS.  IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO SPREAD THE VIRUS AFTER BEING VACCINATED, SO MASKING UP AND SOCIAL DISTANCING REMANS CRITICAL.  PFIZER AND MODERNA VACCINES USE MESSENGER RNA THAT ENCODES THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN. UPON INJECTION OF THE VACCINE, THE MRNA ENTERS INTO IMMUNE CELLS CALLED DENDRITIC CELLS.   THE DENDRITIC CELLS USE THE INSTRUCTIONS WRITTEN IN THE mRNA TO SYNTHESISE THE HALLMARK SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN, WHICH CHARACTERISES THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THESE IMMUNE CELLS THEN SHOW THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN TO B-CELLS, WHICH THEN MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES.  THE mRNA VACCINES ARE UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF INDUCING A SPECIAL KIND OF IMMUNE CELL (CALLED A T-FOLLICULAR HELPER CELL) TO HELP B-CELLS PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  THE T-CELLS DO THIS THROUGH DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE B-CELLS AND BY SENDING CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT TELL THE B-CELLS TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  IT IS THIS HELP IN ANTIBODY PRODUCTION THAT MAKES THESE VACCINES EFFECTIVE.  BUT NOT ALL B-CELLS ARE THE SAME.  THERE ARE TWO KINDS THAT MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES—LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS AND MEMORY B-CELLS.  THE LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS, AS THEIR NAME IMPLIES, LIVE IN THE BONE MARROW FOR YEARS AFTER VACCINATION, CONTINUOUSLY CHURNING OUT ANTIBODY (IN THIS CASE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODY), THESE LONG-LIVED B-CELLS DO NOT NEED TO BE BOOSTED.  THE MEMORY B-CELLS, ON THE OTHER HAND, LIVE IN A STATE AKIN TO HIBERNATION.  THEY DO NOT PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL STIMULATED BY A BOOSTER OF THE VACCINE, OR ARE EXPOSED TO INFECTION WITH THE CORONAVIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THAT IS THE REASON WE NEED THAT SECOND DOSE—TOGETHER THESE TWO TYPES OF B-CELLS PROVIDE A CONSTANT LEVEL OF PROTECTION.  THAT BOOSTER SHOT IS NECESSARY FOR THE T-CELLS TO STIMULATE THE MEMORY B-CELLS TO PRODUCE MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES.  IF THE BOOSTER ISN’T GIVEN WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE WINDOW, LOWER QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES WILL BE PRODUCED THAT MAY NOT PROVIDE AS POWERFUL PROTECTION FROM THE VIRUS.  mRNA STANDS FOR MESSENGER RNA, WHICH IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR MAKING PROTEINS.  DNA, WHICH LIVES IN THE NUCLEUS OF CELLS, MAKES mRNA AND SHIPS IT OUTSIDE THE NUCLEUS TO THE SURROUNDING CELL CYTOPLASM.  ONCE IN THE CYTOPLASM, mRNA IS TRANSLATED INTO A HOST OF CELL PROTEINS AND ENZYMES.  BECAUSE OUR CELLS MAKE PROTEINS ALL THE TIME, THEY ALSO MAKE mRNA ALL THE TIME.  SOON AFER MAKING PROTEINS, mRNA BREAKS DOWN.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtprX4KcBws  IT IS A LIE OF EVIL KOSHER PHARMA THAT mRNA VACCINES CANNOT ENTER THE NUCLEUS OF THE CELL, SO IT CANNOT CHANGE YOUR DNA.  IF ANY DOCTOR TELLS THE TRUTH, HE WILL BE DE-FROCKED AND BLACK BALLED FOR LIFE.  LISTEN !!  mRNA VACCINES IN THE REALM OF IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY—IT HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED BEFORE.  THE BULLCRAP EVIL KOSHER VACCINE LOBBY GIVES IS THAT EVEN IF mRNA DID ENTER THE NUCLEUS, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONVERTED TO DNA.  THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ENZYME CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE, WHICH THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN.  THAT THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN AN ENZYME CALLED INTEGRASE, WHICH WOULD ALSO BE NEEDED FOR mRNA TO INSERT ITSELF INTO THE DNA—mRNA VACCINES LACK ALL OF THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ALTER DNA.  THAT THEY REMAIN IN THE CELL CYTOPLASM FOR JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THEY ARE DESTROYED.  BRAAAYYYYYYYYYY !  REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE IS AN RNA-DEPENDENT DNA POLYMERASE THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN MANY RETROVIRUSES SUCH AS HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV).  HIV, HAS AN ENZYME, CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE THAT COPIES THE VIRUS’S GENETIC MATERIAL BACK INTO THE GENOME.  VIRUSES LIKE THE SARS-CoV-2 OR INFLUENZA DON’T HAVE THIS ENZYME THE SCIENTISTS VOUCH.  FOR 40 YEARS TOP SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN WAXING ELOQUENT ABOUT AIDS / HIV—THE VACCINE IS STILL “ABSCONDING”.  THEY DON’T EVEN KNOW THAT HIV IS MADE IN THE LAB !",2021-02-04,1007

3629,157,"It is good to have gotten the vaccine quickly as there would be a long queue later on. However all these vaccines are cleared for emergency use which is NOW, but it also means many unknowns or 'use at own risk'. Hence SGGGOVT's advisory that getting vaccinated is not 'mandatory'. That is very nice but it is unkind (and still being pushy) to warn that those who decide against it when offered may not (I read that as shall not) get the vaccine free of charge when they decide later to have it. For the over-70 Elderlies of which I am one, that is very nasty irresponsible and a demonstration of unfilial love (I wonder if they treat their own family elders in the same way) besides our worry that our golden years to enjoy our family and this country may be at risk.  The reason that the Elderlies should be given the vaccine early because they are a higher risk of COVID-19 infection group and this will give them protection. That is a very kind and noble decision if not for the fact that if the situation gets bad, the Elderlies would get infected quickly and overcome health services to the detriment of everyone else younger. But it is still a sensible decision.  But coming back to this another kind offer to reimburse costs for serious side effects due to getting a vaccination, I believe that is provided by vaccine  manufacturers to people who agree to be used as guinea pigs in the vaccine testing. So getting a vaccination is like becoming a volunteer in the vaccine testing programs of the vaccine manufacturers. I suppose it's a bohpian when buying vaccines approved for emegency use. Whether the Expert Panel will be kindly in their verification of cases and decisions is another thing bearing in mind SG's very prudent hands on the national wallet.  It's not easy to make good decisions especially decisions to save the lives and livelihood of 6 million people. So far so good, well done  SGGOVT.

Do you get ""extra marks "" for registration to be ""neat and tidy "". Spreadsheets can do it for you. So what's the problem? You don't need only staff nurses to do injections. Diabetes patients on insulin can do it. Student nurses and medical students can do it. Have a 2-shift program.  If you're waiting for  2nd doses to arrive,  tell us, the public. Don't waste resource visiting homes.  Do it only if and after more than 50% reject vaccination. Let them queue again after everyone else (who want it) have had their turn.  Get logistical advice from Israel or even Indonesia.  Don't be shy.  We did get advice and help (of a different kind) for a few cohorts in NS. These countries CAN plan. 30% vaccinated.  Injections into ARMS within 24 or was it 48 hours of vaccine arrival.  Possibly from tarmac of airport?  India even had a dry run. But we ALREADY had dry runs of some sort . Remember the masks distribution? Get the same group to help you set up the logistics, control the crowd entry of ic numbers.  No need to explain the same instructions,  advice again and again.  Get the TV to do it everyday in the 4 languages.  And at the venues itself.  Use technology,  not use the mouths.  That spreads covid!",2021-01-29,245

3907,573,"BREAKING NEWS Global news      Italy conducts autopsy of the coronavirus patient, massive revelation ensues.      Italy became the first country in the world to perform an autopsy.  (Autopsy) on the corpse of Covid-19 and after extensive research, it was found that Covid-19 does not exist as a virus.  But very large  It's a global scam, people have died from ""Amplified Global 5G Electromagnetic Radiation (Poison)"".       Doctors in Italy have violated the World Health Organization (WHO) law, which does not allow autopsies.  (Autopsy) on the corpses of those who have died from the corona virus to search after scientific discovery.  It cannot be assumed that it is not a virus, but rather the fatal bacteria that cause blood clots in the blood vessels, such as blood clots in the veins and nerves formed by these bacteria, and are the patients who cause death.      Italy beat the virus, stating that  ""Nothing else is hardening of the arteries in atherosclerosis  (Thromboembolism) and the way to deal with it is to cure it. ""      Antibiotic      Anti-inflammatory and      Taking an anticoagulant (aspirin) will treat it.      And it shows that a cure for the disease is possible, exciting news for the world, was provided by an Italian doctor with an autopsy.  (Post-mortem) of the coronavirus, according to many Italian scientists  People do not need a ventilator and an intensive care unit (ICU) .The protocol for this has been published in Italy.      CHINA already knows this.  But never made public      Please share this information with your family, neighbors, acquaintances, friends, coworkers, so they can escape the fear of Covid-19 and understand that this is not a virus.  Rather, it is a bacteria that is only exposed to 5G radiation, the cause is very dangerous for people with low immunity.  This radiation can also cause inflammation and lack of oxygen.  Victims should take Asprin-100mg and Apronix or Paracetamol 650mg. Why… ??? क. Since it has been proven that COVID-19 causes blood clots which cause blood clots in humans and cause blood clots.  Tonnes in the veins and because the brain, heart and lungs are unable to receive oxygen because of the difficult illness and people  Quickly died of breathing difficulties      Doctors in Italy failed to comply with WHO procedures and performed an autopsy of the COVID-19 death.Doctors opened up the limbs and other parts of the body, and after proper examination and examination, the blood vessels were dilated and the blood vessels were filled.  With thromboembolism, which often stops the blood from flowing  It also reduces the flow of oxygen into the body, which can lead to death.  Upon learning of this research, the Italian Ministry of Health immediately changed the Covid-19 treatment protocol and gave patients 100mg positive aspirin and started Empromax.As a result, patients began to recover and their health began to improve.  Italy's health ministry eliminated more than 14,000 patients in a single day and sent them home.     Source: Italian Ministry of Health",2021-01-08,473

That the scientists in the WIV had co-written articles published in scientific academic journals that talked about how they modified SARS-CoV in horseshoe bats to make it infectious to humans, as seen here (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20567988/) and here (https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985?fbclid=IwAR0zURTp9xVeNpBXB5kp9TIwX3V64fqIcjjE6aqxsxc1hDbXuvSMStHK0ns), with the Pasteur Institute's Simon Wain-Hobson flagging out the dangerous nature of these experiments as seen here (https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787 ). The correction/clarification notices to some of these articles does not take away or refute the fact that the WIV was involved in work on SARS CoV viruses to make them infectious to humans and the lab should be the subject of forensic investigations. Its really time that the Singapore govt join in calls pushes to 1) investigate the WIV lab forensically and 2) to call on China to release information on the virus over calling links to it a ""conspiracy theory"" and/or choose the path of Sinophilia and/or fear.

Every Scary Things You're Being Told Depends On The Unreliable PCR Test https://youtu.be/6ny9nNFHQsY  ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE, NATIONAL CENTRE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf  Sars-CoV-2 virus has not been isolated and purified. What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been purified and isolated, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?",2020-12-31,341

Every Scary Things You're Being Told Depends On The Unreliable PCR Test https://youtu.be/6ny9nNFHQsY  ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE, NATIONAL CENTRE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf  Sars-CoV-2 virus has not been isolated and purified. What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been purified and isolated, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?",2020-12-30,330

4350,1425,"On recent CNA with Gov.sg, sponsored news article on Assoc Prof Tan and also regarding yesterday MOH released news of recommendation of vaccination I have comments and questions as following:  In respect to Assoc Prof Tan and thank her for her tireless research work for our nation.   I'm concern and would like to ask base on that article written.  I didnt see any collaboration of vaccine mentioned in the article.  -In regards to Sars or Covid 19 virus-vaccine, and regarding the 2 vaccines from Pifzer and Moderna using the new mRNA technology compared to traditional vaccine,   The mentioned were as abstracted in [.] brackets from article:  1. [This information was used by several international research groups in their studies of biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients, helping us understand how the virus spreads to different organs and causes complications in some patients.]  2. [discussions with some colleagues in the engineering field on how their technologies could be adapted for developing diagnostic procedures for COVID-19 as well as other infectious diseases.]  3. [colleagues from fields such as pathology, cancer and immunology use their expertise to study COVID-19 in different ways. Combining their knowledge with innovative technologies helped us gain new knowledge of the virus quickly.]  4. [We also assisted some local companies in developing diagnostic kits that can be used at point-of-care settings, and more importantly, help to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers.]   One heartened mentioned in this article saw was, [ ] abstracted:  [ In another collaboration, we detected strong virus-specific T cell immunity in people who have recovered from COVID-19 and SARS. Interestingly, those who had SARS 17 years ago still harboured T cells from their earlier infection, and those same T cells could also recognise COVID-19. This finding may be useful for the design and testing of COVID-19 vaccines. ]   Questions: 1. I would like to ask Gov taskforce, Ministry of Health, given since the Sars outbreak in 2002-2004, and no Sars vaccine was created that period of time, and people have been travelling around the world since, aren't the people developed T-cell immunity also?   From MOH website on the status of Covid19 local situation as of 27/12/2020: https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 53,870 were Discharged  0 Hospitalised (Critical)  29 Death   On the 29 death, base on the news reported for local Singapore, most of the death the covid patients were caused by having pre existing conditions.   Q1. If 53,870 were previously diagnosed having covid 19 virus, can we say that these people had gotten the T-cell immunity of covid19  Q2. Since after phase 2 and till current date 27/12/20, the people can go out to malls, dine, shopping, the local community inflection numbers were very low, many days can be zero. Most were imported cases. Can we say that the local people had gotten herd immunity?   Q3. The safety of the 2 vaccines Pifzer and Moderna using mRNA technology - teach Human DNA cells, different from traditional method of using weakened virus, to naturally activate body immune system cells to fight the weakend virus.   Abstracted [The mRNA technology contains instructions for human cells to make proteins that mimic part of the coronavirus, and is used in vaccines from Moderna as well as from Pfizer and BioNTech.]  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-starts-work-on-plant-for-mrna-based-covid-19-vaccine-13816686?cid=FBcna  Aren't this new technology - giving instruction - have high risk to human DNA cells. Human DNA cells - is like a code of instruction designed by GOD for growth.  Animals, birds and plants of different species of have their set of DNA cells.  the high risk of this technologies      1. Autoimmune diesases     2. Aftecting the natural DNA cells, risking deformity in future offspring.   US CDC website on active surveillance of the status of people after vaccination, show that on 18/12/2020, approx 30% were hospitalised.  How is Singapore Gov taskforce and MOH still recommend frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable elderly with existing medical conditions and vascular condition to take these vaccine?  https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-19/05-COVID-CLARK.pdf  I do not have the latest update of US CDC website on active surveillance of the status of people after vaccination.  I really appreciate if Singapore Gov Taskforce, Ministry of Health, can publicly and transparently share these data, to let the People know these safety status data of people in other countries vaccination.  I also want to ask on the liabilities for compensations from these pharmaceutical companies of these 2 vaccines introduced, for any adverse reactions, side effects and long term conditions to the People , and also if MOH endorsing these vaccines. Kindly please address publicly to the people.  Last note:  Fomer Vice-president of Pifzer, Mike Yeadon mentioned the notion of having millions of healthy, fit people is ridiculous quoted below, he also shared his knowledge and reasoning in his video: [Yeadon states this notion is “ridiculous because while SARS-CoV-2 is indeed novel, coronaviruses are not. There’s no such thing as an ‘ancestor-less virus’.” Indeed, he points out, there are at least “four, endemic, common-cold inducing coronaviruses … [which] circulate freely in UK and elsewhere.” Those who have been infected by “one or more of these endemic, common-cold producing coronaviruses in the past, have a long-lived and robust [T-cell] immunity, not only to those viruses, but to closely related viruses. SARS-CoV-2 is one such closely-related virus.”] https://lbry.tv/Mike-Yeadon-Unlocked:0  A doctor whom gathered info regarding the vaccines using new technologies mRNA also shared her view: https://www.stopworldcontrol.com/madej/",2020-12-28,821

What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been purified and isolated, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?

So long as this virus is alive on earth among human beings, no place is safe. . ....................... Mask-wearing and safe distancing ….do we see the bigger picture to prevent community transmission of the virus?  The vaccine is not a cure but a preventive measure.Will red dot encourage the UN and the WHO to do this: the UN and WHO should get all countries to cooperate and shut down for 40 days and 40 nights to stamp out COVID-19?  The best of time is now for the countries in the northern hemisphere during this wintry period [Christmas, New Year 2021, and the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays] to shut down for 40 days [like in the olden days of the leprosy infection to quarantine the new arrivals until the all-clear signal to let them out].Now is the time to do just that for the all-clear of infected persons to stamp out COVID-19 and force it to have a natural ending.  As for all other countries, those at the equator and those in the southern hemisphere [summer time], all should unite and comply to shut down too for 40s day to stamp out this disease well and good. Can the UN and WHO obtain this universal cooperation by all countries around the world to shut down this earth for 40 days and 40 nights at the same time? Time for the whole world to go into hibernation for 40 days. If we don’t, do we want to continue with the madness for another 400 or more days worldwide affecting the economy and all aspects of human lives?

Stop spreading misleading news & don't panic with unfounded hoaxes. Covid-19 vaccination  help prevent the virus from spreading. There's new vaccines coming out & they were already tested on volunteers. Rule is all vaccines must always go on clinical trial test first before the vaccine be out. Which explain why you recently hear the news mentioned there's 3 different kinds of vaccines (different manufacturers) will be out soon .. the news mentioned 96 percent or 93 percent success rate & they still testing it further.

I agree that SIA and the airport must survive which is why SIA is now so gracious to attracting Singaporeans than foreign visitors, with so many innovations, dinners on board planes, sales of liquors, tours etc..

4826,2626,"Speech by SMS Lam -  31.          I am glad to update that the Integrated Youth Service will be starting in Woodlands this year.  Care Corner will reach out to youths at-risk and raise awareness on mental well-being and resilience. They will also provide individualised emotional support, needs identification and peer support services, and refer those who require further intervention to appropriate health and social services.  32.          Moving forward, we will continue to take a whole-of-society approach and work with other ministries to address youth mental health needs. This includes MOE, the Ministry for Social and Family Development (MSF), and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), including their National Youth Council (NYC), on the recently announced Youth Mental Well-being Network.  > I'm fine with the IMH offshoot located outside of IMH, but what are the details to the IYS such that it does not become another stigma-spot?

4827,2627,"Speech by Minister Gan -  7.         Ms Sylvia Lim asked about using blood plasma for treatment. We are indeed planning to do so and NCID is collecting blood plasma from patients, but there are limitations and constraints. It may take some time before effective treatments and vaccines become available. As the global situation evolves, many countries may become infected. It will become increasingly difficult to stop the virus at our borders as we cannot ban visitors from every country and shut ourselves out from the world.  > Can there be more details on the ""limitations and constraints""? My sense is that you are saying immune cells isolation and monoclonal lab reproduction will not be in time to treat the currently critically ill, so how about the sourcing of suitable donor for wholesale transfusion as last resort, in which case you might have to open the call for local self-suspected subclinical cases or foreign authorities? I mean, MOH might as well make the open call as part of a comprehensive epidemiological study.",2020-03-05,167
