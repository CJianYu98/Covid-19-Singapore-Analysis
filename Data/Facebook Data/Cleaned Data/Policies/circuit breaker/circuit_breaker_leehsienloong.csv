Will red dot encourage the UN and the WHO to do this:  the UN and WHO should get all countries to cooperate and shut down for 40 days and 40 nights to stamp out COVID-19?     The best of time is now for the countries in the northern hemisphere during this wintry period [Christmas, New Year 2021, and the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays] to shut down for 40 days [like in the olden days of the leprosy infection to quarantine the new arrivals until the all-clear signal to let them out]. Now is the time to do just that for the all-clear of infected persons to stamp out COVID-19 and force it to have a natural ending.  As for all other countries, those at the equator and those in the southern hemisphere [summer time], all should unite and comply to shut down too for 40s day to stamp out this disease well and good. Can the UN and WHO obtain this universal cooperation by all countries around the world to shut down this earth for 40 days and 40 nights at the same time? Time for the whole world to go into hibernation for 40 days.  If we don’t do we want to continue with the madness for another 400 or more days worldwide affecting the economy and all aspects of human lives. Choose wisely to have a suffering of 40 or 400 days physically, mentally, economically and socially, or do we want more than 400?",2020-12-15,259

Save a lot of money on health care, save our money. People will live longer. And I know it’s a individual effort. See chewing gum was difficult to clean up the environment so ur dad banned it. Well tar is more difficult to clean up. It stays in our heart. I am a smoker and I have been going thru a tough time quitting it. Manage to cut from 20 to 10 now. Maybe ur leaders are smokers too and that’s why it’s difficult to ban it. I was in prison and I had no choice to not smoke it. But then the outside world isn’t that tempting but still I picked up the habit. Doing the right thing is important. I have done my part to cut down half. Can the government join us to help stop it?

1311,"Agree with you PM sir! One shouldn’t feel offended when approached to wear the mask properly. For their own safety and community’s.   Sometimes, we do genuinely forget to wear our masks. I encountered a few times in the lift, when my neighbour, happily chatting with me and had forgotten to put their mask on till I gently reminded them. Haha.  And it’s usually the elderly. So SDA, pls be gentle and do not shame them if they are caught without mask or not putting them on properly. Good job to you guys!  ♥️👏💪👍",2020-12-04,95

It is not to say that we should tolerate inconsiderate people intentionally pull down their masks for own conveniences at other risks; it is necessary to have a sensible and reasonable judgement call for these safe distancing ambassadors. They are after all human beings who also mingling in their own groups and not keeping safe distancing while walking in not so crowded places.",2020-12-04,106

In Hong Kong, it is free of charge for those preventive testing for resident and cost only about S$45 (HKD240) for those with a report for traveling.

I guess one of the  main reasons  besides having more alternative voices is  PMET jobs expectations which I am considering it as a deep rooted issues amongst Singaporeans in the age group of 30 to 45 years old. This segment are losing job opportunities to foreigners. I have educated nieces and nephews ( master, honours degree and diploma holders from respectable and esteemed Singapore’s university and polytechnic)in the early thirties  and am afraid if MOM continues to bring in foreigners to fill those positions, am sure they will be greatly disappointed ! I reckon this age group falls on ‘swing voters’ category, hence please practise caution as they are feeling frustrated and  create job oppty for them and probably would I suggest ‘returning’ the job back to them and creating better oppty for SG future.  God bless MP Lee and the future of Singaporean! ",2020-07-14,172

2140,"Sir, I think the people in Sengkang must also have taken by surprise that the WP won because they took for granted that the PAP will always win and so they voted for WP without much thought of their capabilities.  Don’t think it’s because that they are younger or more able to relate to the younger residents in Sengkang because the WP candidates - the two women are not married yet. Overall, I think it’s very dangerous a thing for many Singaporeans to have taken the PAP for granted, overheard a conversation that these youngsters keep voting for oppositions or for a change are playing with fire.

3843,"Process: knowledge, skills, wisdom, and Enlightenment. How to learn? By massive action. You put the dots of knowledge, definition into mind. The more you use, the better you are until you do not know why you gain that. What needed? Love, support, understanding, patience encouragement from outside and inside. Then you will know Let all realize Key to human problems.  KEY:  Emotion comes from head, not heart Man search for feeling not meaning: house, car, ring, iPhone, Gucci, tattoos. Man's action is driven by NEEDS.  SLEEPNESS COME FROM WORRY OF THE DISEASES OF YOUR CHILD, THE ANGER OF THE WORKPLACE, THE FEAR OF YOUR FAULT MAY BE REVEALED. What's pill?  Do we forget? IT IS THE MIND  I doubt God and Holly: things changes constantly so no Constant ego after death. Jesu, Socrates, Gandhi, Luther King... was crucially killed. Lock, guards save the Pope  What is your name? What would be your name if your parents like another name? So if the name is a conditioned idea, do you think: religion, taboos, rituals CODED?  The living standard increases substantially but why the rate of mental illness, autism, ADHD, suicide, gunfire are soaring? Is there any hidden unknown philosophy may help?  The world is dependent, independent or interdependent? Do depression, autism, ADHD, violence, school problems and domestic problems, suicide, gunfire have hidden relation that we can effectively solve all?  And  The living standard increases substantially but why the rate of mental illness, autism, ADHD, suicide, gunfire are soaring? Is there any hidden unknown philosophy may help?",2020-06-17,253
3844,"Life is art,  Life is simple, do not make it complicated.  Spirit can never measured by material.  Try to logical it, we will hit paradoxical world. Like paradoxical of Socrates. Like emptiness and egolessness when we try to find what life is. Like the way in Taosim.  Best of all, roots of all religions is love, kindness, compassion, virtues and principles. How do we know we are on the right way? Check the greed. Check the anger. If they have these, all words are cheatings. These come from Ingnorance. 8 Noble paths.  When we on the right way: we will free from greed, anger and ignorance. Then we can sense inner peace, peace of mind on a chaos life. Reach enlightenment, awaken with knowing nothing. Live with mindfulness. Peace in eating Peace in giving Peace in taking Peace in spending This life is touching, moved, inspired. They are our real friends, called Gods or great men in the history. To the healers: we are only repair the different fruits of same roots. Buddha taught: greed, anger and ignorance are the roots of all suffering.  I just have feeling that: autism, adhd, depression, stroke, addcition, violence, gunfire.... are the different names of suffering. Naming to know it, Not naming to seperate it as an seperation entity. You can never find real cause You can never find concrete cause. Because: the world have characters changing, and interdependent, nothing stay the same: we have Planck time. All we live under the hologram. Our 5 senses are too small, too little, too illusive to know what the world is. Just breathing, feel the breathing, calm the mind, feel the body, watch the thought, contemplate on things: we will find, life is miracle. Try to find the roots: then repair it. We will find it is astonishingly simple and astonishingly effective. This is the Tao This is the way of great men. They find earth is heaven! We are live on heavenly earth. Scientist can never find any place like earth in the distance of millions of light-year. . . . We will fail, if we help and still have full of Greed, Anger and Ignorance! No matter how Rich, Wealthy, Success, powerful we are, we may still suffer lots of these signs.  We may still suffer if we still the slave of greed. Greedy men have hundred wants a day, the will not be satisfied with half of that wants, it means they will anger,  or not happy, in other words, they may still suffer stress in Abundance living.  It is the mind, not the conditioned of living It is the combination of all senses make the eating, living, enjoying or suffering that we may not notice, but it still controls us unconsciously. Ex: will you pay $1000 for hearing a song played by a great violist in the subway? Will you pay $1000 for a delicious meal served on the dirty street sidewalk? Will you enjoy food in the restaurant in five star hotel when you know your kid ill or in danger? Why you need all hundred factors to enjoy a delicious meal in the five-star hotel: air, color, perfumes, waiters, waitress, customer services, cloth, forks, music...? Do you go for eating with mouth or what? Got it: all combine into a phenomenon, then from it, it makes the quality of feeling. Sorry, I see men just search for feeling. So it can make you what make kids poor in eating, sleeping, learning, and playing. It is the meeting of hundred phenomena, it is the illuminating of thousand phenomena or the hologram of millions of things.   The best way is to learn the lifestyle of great men in history, not rich men! If not, many people may have to take medicine for the months, years, decade or lifetime just to find the temporary relief. We maybe are wrongly coded about Rich or Money.  FORGOTTEN STRESS Stress cause insomnia Stress makes poor learning Stress make poor eating Stress makes we act unusually Stress reduces sexing Stress can break school and family. And Maybe  Autism, ADHD, depression, and suicide have the key of helping lies in the mechanism of medicine, lifestyle, love, anti-depression medicine, good communities, a good act, kind works; all have the same mechanism of creating happy hormones in the body: serotonin, oxytocin, and dopamine. Health comes from balancing.  REDEFINE OF STRESS The right definition of stress: human beings have basic human needs described by Abraham Maslow. Anything threatens of satisfying these needs will lead to Fight and Flight responses. If people cannot change the situation, threaten, they will be the victims of STRESS AND STRESS HORMONES. You will easily find the keys to all social phenomena in: ""Awaken You Wonderful We"" if you are familiar with the books of Malcolm Gladwell: Outlier, David and Goliath and Blink. These books give me a lot of question to ponder and find out the good answer by combining medicine, pharmacy, sociology, leadership, psychology, philosophy and religions.  It is in Mind.  Meditation, alternative therapies, NLP, Affirmation, love-hug-kindness can help to control and master the mind.  Science reaches to the fail of finding a single cause of the diseases from the mind: mental illness, thinking, and poor abilities.  Because the mind is not like body. The body will give away all you put in just in several hours or days according to its half-life: food, vegetable, medicines, chemical, additives, mercury, gold, nutrition. Even body can heal the small abnormal cause by X-ray.  But the mind keeps all in the conscious mind and subconscious mind. Millions of events, phenomena called Negative thinking, negative events, negative emotions and negative experiences compound into diseases in mind, brain, body, abilities, genes,  and health. It covers all terminologies in medical books. They are interdependent factors. How can Scientist figure out a single CAUSE?  ****************************** V. The reviews:  Văn Duy Đào well read article, i agree with it, some on here are assuming Autism is a disease or caused by pesticides, i have limited social skills as well as my boys,only downfall. assumptions like these are what keeps people looking at us like we are freaks, there is no cure and never will be, hate to say it but my parents had mental disorders my mom bipolar my dad OCD, maybe the cause all ik is i am unique therefore blessed, i can go through life wishing or i can go through life accepting and coping, i wish i could do alot others can like socialize, i wish my kids were like everyone elses, then i realize that all 3 of us are truly blessed with health, family and love, love for ourselves and others even those who judge us, you are a very intelligent individual and reading your comments has enlightened me, ty  ************ Thank You Duy. I am happy there are more people who know we are all humans and we can all heal. As you might have read, I already healed part of my 'autism' �� And still integrating more towards oneness with all of myself and with all that is. I am so thankful for this experience and happy to share this with the world. Because I have been there I can show the world it is possible!! And yes, I'm into meditation, healing, energy work. Many experiences of Oneness/Dao /Source... We all are one... thank you for your offer, and your message, You also are doing great work for humankind! Love, Els **********************",2020-06-17,1227

4131,Thank you for lifting some SD measures so the economy can restart to gear 1 again. But I must say that there are still many disobedient selfish residents who still disobey the previously imposed SD rules until today and the enforcement is very lacking even today when I visited Bedok Mall to buy some essentials I saw a person standing at the entrance exit of the mall eating and with mask on chin. He's probably very hungry but at least can eat in the car or some corner away from public. Nobody bother to stop him and no ambassador was in sight to advise him otherwise. I hope the authority can place more emphasis on enforcement and rid the society of these selfish people that will lengthen the CB period than it already had.,2020-06-02,132

MOE did little little to high classroom density (1:35 teacher to child ratio) to futureproof against future covid-X attacks.  In contrast, MOM does more for dormitory workers.  High classroom density does not make sound safe-distancing sense.  As parents , we hope more sustainable and permanent efforts to reduce the high classroom density.

4294,"Thank you Mr Lee. One of the allowable work post circuit breaker is for previously suspended renovation to resume. However, this is not happening easily, leaving many ID, contractors and home owners in a very frustrating and binding position. My family has been deeply affected. Our house don’t even have a main door due to sudden suspension of work. A home is the basic necessity of a family and with seniors as well as an infant in the home, we are living in uncertainty everyday. Thus far, the BCA procedure has been ineffective, confusing and very frustrating. While my ID has received approval, many of her sub contractors have not. In addition, there were insufficient slots for workers to sign up for the safety course and swap test that needs to be done before work can resume. This could take weeks or even months to complete. We need this procedure to be reviewed in order for the much needed suspended work to resume. It is meant to be prioritized right after circuit breaker so let’s make it a priority. Hope to receive your support in moving this work along. All we want, is a place to call home.",2020-06-01,200

4306,"To all those who said we should not remove sticker and markings on public transport, lets just say MRT, maybe you like to say how do you think it can be done to maintain 1 metre apart and leave 3 empty seats between passengers. During CB its possible becos only that limited number of essential people are out and running. Its common to see buses running empty and trains operating with so little people. But with Phase 1, dont even say Phase 3, with the opening to allow more people to go to work, maybe you can advise or suggest how possible is it to do it, rather than just say should still practice safe distancing in trains. Everyone knows, should. But how?? Your suggestions may not get a reply, i believe they are also trying to figure out a way on how to do it. Like what, from Pasir Ris once full with people at all markings and seats taken up with 3 empty seats between them, dont allow anymore people to board when reach Tampines? Doors dont open and continue to Simei? Or put up a bell to press like on buses to indicate you want to alight, so that from that door if 3 alight only 3 can board? Cmon, give suggestions for them to consider and think also. Its simply not possible. CB period can be done, cos not many people out there. Everyone knows it should be, safer to continue one more month, two more months, but how?? I also like to know how. Maybe out of 200,000 suggestions they can find 1 that works.",2020-06-02,261

4361,Dear Mr Lee  First I will like to express my sincere thanks to u n all the minister who really work hard to help the whole nation. I think spore govt handled v well.  By implementing the 3phase I think is a very good move.  But still we see alot pple not complying the rules so how can we help ??  By calling police ?  By telling them wear mask ?  By reminding them ???   I been highlight n cakes the police at least 10 times me n my neighbours that my BLK 678 hougang AVE 8 #01-519  everyday 530am to 6am  More than 15 pple are gathered to buy veg   No one came   So I'm quite disappointed to see such.  Here we are all working so hard n complying the rules but other such pple jus break it.   All elderly everyday they jus gathered to wait for the veg vendor to reach   I hope n urge Mr Lee pls assist   Thank you very much,2020-06-01,152

4558,"Dear Mr Lee  My house renovation works was stopped when the CB was implemented. I understand the need to do so.  However, today my renovation Contractors tell me that they cannot start work after 2 june on my 90% completed house because of bureaucracy and delay in getting their required certification and approval from the authorities even though they have made applications more an a week ago since the announcement by you were made.  The earliest they can start is in end June ( almost a month later)because they are allocated that timing for them to do the online test???   They all tell me they are ready and will follow the measures implemented but the timeline announced by the government is not realistic due to the current obstacles they are facing😓.  Please explain what is happening? Why make such optimistic announcements when on the ground it is not ready or possible to start. Hope you can look into this hiccups and bottlenecks with the relevant authorities.   We, home owners are suffering and being constantly being chased by Contractors and suppliers to deliver and complete their obligations as they are incurring holding and other cost and we are also incurring cost ourselves as we cannot shift into our homes.  We all understand the need to be cautious but why make such announcements when on the ground it is not helping us all. Some of the other homeowners that I spoke to express their frustrations too as our contractor are push around by the various departments when they try to expedite this process.   Please assist to address this in your coming discussions and next parliament session during this difficult time.   Hope to obtain a favourable reply soon ",2020-06-01,283

4591,希望PM Lee Hsien Loong能探讨一些雇主拖欠员工的薪水的问题。员工去MOM得不到帮助转去TADM. TADM也帮不了 最后到ECT State Courts. 最后拿到了Order of Tribunal命令雇主还钱。期限到了 雇主推仍不还钱 ECT需要员工再付$300来要 issue Writ of Summons. 员工一直付费 最后还是没拿到拖欠的薪水 反而花了一大堆费用。请问天理何在?,2020-06-06,9

5156,"Dear Sir, how about legalizing the ownership of cats in HDB flats? There has been an increase in people abandoning cats in HDB estates and also irresponsible ownership such as not neutering or spaying the cats, illegal breeding to sell and letting cats roam around, especially at dangerous places such as the ledge. As long as it remains illegal, many irresponsible owners of cats will continue to behave this way. It is in the humans and animal’s welfare to legalize it and enforce regulations on cat ownership in a responsible way, such as ensuring the cats are registered as pets like dogs, so as to be able to hold the owners responsible for abandonment. Animal welfare should not be limited to some species and not others. Singapore is a first world nation with 3rd world animal welfare considerations. I sincerely hope this will change soon!

5295,"Thanks, PM Lee for sharing the lovely photo.  This is the Zouk otter family.  They originated from the Singapore River (near the former Zouk).  Zouk mum gave birth to 6 adorable otter pups at the Singapore Botanic Gardens in late 2019.  Sadly, only 2 of the 6 pups survived (see the link below).  This is the same family that appeared in the news lately at KK Hospital, Little India and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  As the pups are bigger now, they have been venturing around to look for a new home.  They went as far as Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park on 12 May, but were chased out by the Marina otter family.  Hope they could find a new home soon.  Agree that we should protect our native biodiversity and find ways to coexist with our local flora and fauna.   https://www.facebook.com/228574651250769/posts/793262941448601  For those who want to find out more about the otters in Singapore, do check out this informative interview with our local otter expert, Siva aka “Otterman”:  https://omny.fm/shows/money-fm-893/weekends-otters-in-singapore-with-otterman-n-sivas",2020-05-29,160

Or inclusive of those living with other relatives like children and grandchildren? Technically speaking, siblings are not suppose to visit each other. What is the rationale behind the move? So the elderly can have some form of companionship (thus, those without children can request for siblings or other relatives to visit)? Or just so they can have some physical contacts with their immediate descendants? Pardon me for asking, as different rationale may lead to different answer to my first question. If it’s just for provision of companionship, then maybe those living with other relatives may not be allowed more guests to visit, as this may contribute to higher chances of cross-spreading due to big group gathering. My intention is not to create issue but rather to have a more informed understanding of this new rule.",2020-05-20,158

5429,"Dear PM Lee,  Thank you for being empathetic and sensible during these crazy times. However I'd like to point out that it is confusing to say we're exiting circuit breaker when nothing much is really changing. People still aren't allowed to socialise, shops and gyms and public facilities are still closed. The first month was sensible, the second month was a safeguard, but why are we essentially extending lockdown for another month? Our community spread numbers are low and most people have been staying home for the past 2 months.  Some thought should be given to those who are literally earning zero income right now, eg. fitness instructors and personal trainers, freelance photographers, event organizers, and small business owners not allowed to open. How can they survive with bills to pay but 3 months of no income?   Why are children allowed to go back to school and visit their grandparents (the highest risk group), but siblings and significant others and friends are not allowed to visit?   More clarification would be most appreciated here, and hopefully further easing of CB measures similar to phase 2. And please don't say CB has been ""lifted"" or is ""ending"" because it most certainly is not.  Really appreciate what the govt has done for Singapore so far, but these recent events have been honestly confusing. Hope this feedback is helpful. Thank you.",2020-05-20,220

Pls consider, thanks. I know I speak on behalf of a lot of people who aren’t living in the same household as their loved ones and have been feeling the strain as we are the ones who have been abiding by the laws, and not trying to meet them in parks, public places, supermarkets or their homes secretly.

How is it possible that an organisation values the health and safety of its employees but MOE doesn't place the same importance for our children? There are examples abroad where the virus has spread among kids when schools reopened. Are you 100% confident that won't happen here? Not only do I have to worry about my girl getting infected, I live with an aged parent. So my concerns are VERY valid here since I have a vulnerable person living under my roof. And younger kids can't be trusted to maintain 100% social distancing on their own which means you are putting me in the position of having to walk by girl to and from school. More unnecessary trips outside the home than encouraged, am I right? Twice a day, 5 days a week? You also failed to get all the teachers and school staff to do the swab tests like the ones done for pre-school teachers. Just because schools closed for a month doesn't mean that none of them went out every other day or weekly for essentials like marketing and grocery runs. They could be asymptomatic and be a risk to our children. I think you've lost the plot if all these haven't been considered.

5537,I am in the construction business and this recent covid crisis has created a heavy impact on our business across the board. Our profit margin is very small in view of competition and spiral cost increased over the years.  My foreign workers are seperated to live in different places to be in line with Mom requirements. Unfortunately one of the group stay in the dormitory contracted with covid virus. I have to shift them to a safe place to stay. In view of cost and easy management of my staff I gathered them to stay in the same place after medical check up to ensure they are all healthy while looking for another place for a group of 9 to stay. To my dismay most of the places like hotel which suggested by Mom rejected our application as they said if this group stay in a infected place before they will reject.   Even there are some landlords willing to let us rent they jack up their rental too high with no fault of ours. Mom staff has been giving us warning and I have written many letters to our MP and minister for help but no respond till now.   We are striving to survive in Singapore and we gave limited resources. Our profit margin from past and current projects are too leen for us to substantiate this unforseen cost.   We seek your help to provide solutions for us to survive and bring bread home for our family.  Fire mechanical engineering pte ltd,2020-05-21,251

Luckily they took the initiative to have the swab test on them. If not? So now, what about the rest of us? How do we know in our house hold one or two diagnosed with this virus without us knowing or they themselves know?  I think government should step up taking it's citizen's medical seriously.  Take batches to go for swab test. Community centres , padangs with tent or whatever it takes. Assigned team, issue citizen with appointment. Taking turn to take the test. We will definitely be more than happy to know if we are being taken care of rather than kept asking us to stay home/wear mask/social distancing etc.  Hopefully this will make an eye opener for ALL OF US that knowing that this virus can be a guest without us realising, is best to have all of us to take swab test.

As air travel will soon be relaxed in other countries, please ensure that we do not import foreign cases by air travel or via the land checkpoints. This circuit breaker has been a big inconvenience to Singaporeans... thanks to failure to anticipate the major outbreak here!  Please lift the restriction to wear masks. Singapore is very warm and humid and it's not suitable to wear masks here... I can certainly understand why some people are flouting this rule. Please provide free Wifi, since we have to use apps now for tracing purposes. Not everyone has unlimited data; I have to increase my monthly data now due to this circuit breaker. Please also allow dine-in asap.  I very much doubt that this virus will go away. It has been around for some time and it's everywhere (not only Wuhan) or it wouldn't have cause outbreaks all over the world. We should consider herd immunity, like Sweden, just protect and educate the elderly and weak.

5608,"It is with disappointment to learn that for CB Exit, ""Phase 1 will take  at least 4 weeks"" & ""Phase 2 over a few months."" Almost 90+% or more cases were from FW dorms and as what our HM proudly declared, SG Covid-19 death rate is only 0.08%! Why can't Phase 1 be just 2 weeks & Phase 2 be 1 just month...!!! Businesses & workforce were already on WFH since 7 April and the longer the phases ride out, the more difficult will be the recovery challenges for SG businesses and our  economy to bounce back. Even if phases are speed up, businesses (primarily F&B, Retail & Travel) and the economy may not necessary pick up due to the new mandatory SOP i.e. safe distancing, etc...  China, South Korea and a few others are struggling to come back from lockdown as they cannot afford another lockdown despite the second waves!!!  With this second wave and the global travel restrictions still in force around the world, the respective countries' local retail trade consumption  not only did even resume but had dropped drastically as fear of global recession sets in amongst their workforces with many jittery over their job security and worldwide retrenchnent. MNCs around the world have gone bust within this short span of Q1 during the past 2-3 months, leaving a trail of declared bankruptcies in the wake... one after another!   Japan, one of the world's biggest economy is already in recession. The same cannot be said for SG... not only can we not afford a recession, we cannot survive a recession! So, please think twice before applying over cautious knee-jerk reactions simply for the sake of the emulating others in the play against Covid-19 number games. Covid-19 is here to stay and life must go on. Period. Let's just bite the bullet, get up and push on with life before life gets ahead of us... without us!  😓😓😓",2020-05-20,301

5611,"Thank you Sir and thanks also to all authorities for the hard work and care for Singaporeans. I would like to draw attention to many people who are living alone (eg. Singles) and have not been allowed to socialise with anyone and it is uncertain when they can do so. This leads to enormous mental strain due to living alone and feeling cooped up. Like for families, can we have a provision for them to meet with safeguards like 2 metre distancing etc?",2020-05-21,82
5613,"Dear government,  Under Phase 1 of the lifting of Circuit Breaker measures, hair salons will be allowed to offer all hair services, including rebonding, bleaching and colouring services that translate to customers spending long hours in the salon. It comes as a great surprise to me that the government feels that this is safe, while deciding that nail salons should not be allowed to reopen.   What makes nail salons less safe or less essential than hair salons?   Please do not get me wrong. My intention is not to petition for hair services to be suspended. My belief is that nail services are just as essential and can be conducted just as safely. As such, nail services should be allowed to resume at the same time as hair services.   Haircuts were deemed essential from the very beginning, and limited to one hour.   I strongly believe that manicures and pedicures are equally essential and can be kept to the same time limit. Ask anyone with ingrown toenails and they might tell you that pedicures are more a medical necessity than a vanity project. We are trained professionals who do not just beautify nails; we treat and we correct. We have many long-term clients who come to us regularly to help relieve the discomfort and pain of ingrown toenails.   Just as a haircut is necessary for basic grooming, so are manicures and pedicures. In a similar vein, extended hair services such as colouring and perms are similar to nail services like extensions and nail art. Not quite so necessary, but many might argue that they are essential for emotional and mental well-being. As the saying goes - if you look good, you feel good.  If hair salons are allowed to offer the full suite of services from 2 June onwards, why is it that nail salons are not allowed to open at all? Surely safety is not the reason.  Hair services can be done safely with social distancing measures and enhanced hygiene and disinfection protocols. The same can be said for nail services.  Even prior to COVID19, our nail technicians wore face masks at work. As the situation developed, we increased our precautionary steps and stepped up disinfection frequency, conducted temperature checks and had customers fill in health declaration forms, rearranged our furniture and reduced the number of workstations to ensure more than a 1 metre distance between clients, and also provided handwashing facilities, face masks, hand sanitizer, etc for our clients’ use.   At no point in time does the nail technician touch the client’s face. We only handle hands and feet, which are then washed and sanitized after the service. This makes us in fact even safer than a hair salon, where the hair stylist touches the hair, which is a lot closer to the client’s face than the hands are.  In fact, we go even further in implementing safety measures. During the Circuit Breaker, my salon already placed orders for safety equipment such as goggles and face shields, and table top barriers to minimize the chances of transmission via droplets in the air. We also plan to allow for greater buffer time between appointments to allow for thorough cleaning and disinfection of workstations.  It is a fact that nail services can be as safe, if not safer, than hair services, with all the measures as described above.    Yet, we are being relegated and overlooked, not allowed to resume business at the same time as our friends in the hair industry. In the meantime, the government tells us not to make manpower cuts or wage adjustments. Of course, we want to treat our staff well. Anyone who has the means would not choose to sacrifice their staff welfare or shutter for good. But please, tell me – how do you expect a nail salon to stay afloat when their income is through services, and not goods? We cannot rely on selling products to generate enough revenue to cover our staff salaries, rental, and other fixed costs. Every day that we stay closed means we bleed a little more. Any longer and we will haemorrhage to death.    Do you know how many workers are employed in the nail industry? That is the number of jobs that will be lost if you do not allow nail salons to resume business soon. It is a labour-intensive industry with low profit margins because our revenue is limited by our manpower. Our meagre profits do not afford us the luxury of waiting months before opening for business again.   If nail services were non-essential or compromised safety, I would not have said a word about having to stay shut.   I strongly urge you to reconsider and allow us to resume business from 2 June onwards.   We are just as safe and just as essential as hair services. Some might say we are more so.

However I have observed that on the approvals of workers on-site for essential services, there seem to be a lack of coordination between Enterprise Singapore, MOM & MTI.  This has caused much inconvenience to the essential services industries. On another note, I hope that easing of CB restrictions should given priority to small companies with less than 10 employees or maybe less than 20 employees. These small companies are the worst hit & survival is critical to them if they are not given a lead start to resume their businesses. Appreciate if you could look into the above concern.

Both documents require company endorsement. I would like to ask during CB, no company is allowed to open and how can an employee get such document? Also, for low income job, it is pretty hard to ask HR to get such letter after retrenchment. So, if a company refuse to or dragging in providing such document, the retrenched employee will be stucked. Imagine this group of people who have to support family but failed to get documentation will be very difficult.  Why can’t the criteria be a bit flexible such as the ability to provide Cpf contribution history as a document proof- such as no contribution for X months then can tab on to the grant? Hope you can kindly consider. ",2020-05-19,146

I have seen a number of messages in some Community Chat Groups asking for urgent help in finding alternative rental units during the CB period as their existing tenancy agreements are due to expire. Please pardon me for saying there is an apparent disconnect between permitting house moving but not (rental) property viewing during the CB period as residents cannot easily find replacement units without viewing.  I believe (rental) property viewing can be permitted with certain precautionary guidelines (e.g. compulsory mask wearing, social distancing, full record for future tracking, etc.) and on the basis that no large number of unknown parties will be involved in the process.  I hope the Government can look into this matter and take necessary actions accordingly.  Best regards, HUI Chi Shing",2020-05-05,141

My above neighbour keep on holding gathering and having people come, stay, eat for hours in their house. Making noise for hours. From day 1 CB till to date it has been many times they have other people gather in their house. I had called the police to inform and they said will inform hdb when the hdb officers are now work from home. Others ask me submit case to One App, I did but till to date there is no action or authority to monitor them. On 6/5/2020 they had party in their house. Before that also they having guests coming to their house.  It just put us at uneasy feeling. We also want to have our family or friends to come over especially during this fasting month but as the rules did not allow we forget about it for the time being but why there is residents that simply break this law again & again. What did Housing & Development Board do about this kind of law breaker? How was the law that not allowing anyone not in same household to come to our house being implement? Imagine if their visitors those who have covid-19 without they know it, they will put all the residents in my block in ‘danger’. If those that did not wear mask, did not practice social distancing being punish and fine please do so to those who simply invite others and gather in their house during CB.

6485,"TIL lockdowns in epidemics are removed progressively over a few observation cycles as the standard exit strategy in the outbreak playbook.  When the lockdown was announced from 7 April 2020 to 4 May 2020 in Singapore, we knew there was no chance the lockdown would be completely lifted on 4 May 2020.  Assuming the 1 Jun 2020 extension meets all objectives, we will still only have a progressive rollback of measures over months as each COVID cycle is approx. 11-14 days.  If you as a business owner is holding out the hope of a quick return to normalcy on 1 Jun 2020, you are deluding yourself. A more accurate timeline is more likely to fall in July or August depending on your specific sector. The experts already know that a quick exit on a large aggregate of measures will risk a peak too high for the healthcare system to cope. The rollback of measures will probably start with the schools.  I hope this information is helpful as a data point to my fellow business owners navigating this storm.

6742,"PM Lee, while we appreciate the migrant workers for their contribution to Singapore, we also need to be practical in the way we take care of them. I am not too sure the need to actively test them since in the beginning of the Covid-19, you said that we may not even take any action other than take care of those who succumb to the virus if the number get too big? Afterall, it really depnds on individual immunity. Is there a way to confine the worker to their dorms and sites, so long as they are not sick from Covid-19? Other countries are trying to move on by ringfencing the vulnerable post lockdown. Hence, post CCB, hope we could do the same by ringfencing the vulnerable so that the rest can resume their lives with the existing safety distancing, mask wearing etc. Hope that this can also apply to the migrant workers who are healthy whereby their movement is restricted to their construction site and the dorm. We should isolate the workers with underlying conditions as well as those of certain older age group. The rest should be allowed to work and have their movement restricted to sites and dorm. We can also provide entertainment such as movie nights etc for the dorm. This way, we can take care of both our economy as well as the workers who will appreciate not having to be quarantined. ",2020-04-23,237
6743,"I personally agree with Pope Francis. I will add more. There are European Union, OIC, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China. You should all have many countries help them like South Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, many countries in Africa etc. Support for them because if everyone including them is healthy & wealthy live, they will give all this when this suffering is removed in the future As well as the production of various products and their workers should be able to have access to employment of this countries 100millions workers, employment needs them, because in many ways it is one simple solution to all of the state will be get more benefit by them.

7973,"Unfortunately we are already nearing the halfway mark of the circuit breaker and there are still people who think lightly of the situation or are actively thinking of ways to ""game"" or ""get around"" the system to continue to meet up or socialize. There comes a point in time where these people cannot be considered to be ill-informed but must be considered to be willfully uncaring of the consequences of their actions. If fines cannot make them do the right thing, perhaps enforced solitary confinement will.  ",2020-04-18,85

7981,"Thank you dear PM sir. I just wish more of our SGians will be as patient as some of us are. We really want to break this and I believe we can if everyone makes an effort and not judge and blatantly defy decisions made by yourself and the cabinet ministers - which in my opinion is sound. The instruction is so simple- stay home, wear mask when going out. Elderly need to take care. You are not asking for anything more. What else do they want? I fail to understand. God be with you and guide you and the ministers in your decision making. Thank you once again. We got your back Sir.",2020-04-18,113

No one method works for a pandemic like this, you have try all ways, even thou it might not be perfect always, but at least to me and my family, we trust you had done the best!

I can see that you are all very focused and I think that adjusting the measures are we go along is to be expected and should not be regarded as a sign of previous error.  I have no doubt that we will succeed and then looking back we can see if there are any lessons to be learned and prepare ourselves even better next time. Meanwhile know that a lot of us are behind you guys all the way. ,2020-04-18,100
7996,"A very good article/analysis of what has been done and what is required to be done. Definitely, absolute compliance is needed to clear all the community cases. As your kind self mentioned that though it’s early but there are signs of a slower viral community spread, which will give healthcare system more bandwidth to deal with the cases appearing each day....  I am very blessed to be in Singapore during this critical time specially the leadership your government and singapore people have shown in dealing with the lockdown, running essential business and dealing with “non-compliance”.  The fight is far from over, it’s a long marathon and will require lot of stamina to deal with it financially and emotionally.   Last but not least we should never underestimate the emotional/mental pressure it has on everyone. We all are in this and we need to play our part - “stay home”... ",2020-04-18,150

It has shown that the circuit breaker has prevented spikes in the community and I am really happy that Singaporeans from abroad have been brought home safely. The circuit breaker has seen great changes to work, schools and families but it’s all worthwhile to protect our lives. We thank you for preparing Singapore for a needed circuit breaker and ensuring that our basic needs especially food supplies are readily available. Personally, I feel that if the circuit breaker needs to be extended, many of us will support the idea, to ensure that covid 19 is really under control and that it will be safe for us to step out of the circuit breaker gradually, still observing social distancing, taking care of our health and seek professional consultation from doctors if we are unwell, and the use of surgical masks to protect ourselves and others.   I hope we will reach a “0” new cases one day, soon, and the zero is maintained for say, 2 - 3 weeks at least before the circuit breaker ends so that we won’t risk having another wave 🌊.

The dormitories are not clean or sanitary. The dormitories were like a time bomb waiting to explode. They have now exploded with many infected workers. Singapore should treat this as a wake up call to treat our indispensable foreign workers like a First World country should and not in the disgraceful way in which they are treated now. I feel angry when I see foreign workers sitting on the ground eating their lunch. I see exhausted foreign workers stretched out on the ground to rest.” After the Covid-19 pandemic/CCB is over, the Sg Govt must do a thorough inquiry on why our MOM, NEA, BCA, dorms owners/operators n/or other relevant agencies had allowed the above poor living conditions to happen for so many years. They must be taken to task and take the blame for not able to do their job. Take away the license of the dorms operators/owners n impose a heavy penalty.

Non-vulnerable groups can easily beat the coronavirus through. These work permit holders as non-vulnerable groups lower the fatality rate and ICU number to very a very safe level.

I hope this natural remedy can be something to be looked into and not just the western medicines or the western way of treatment. For all you know, this may be a great remedy for the serious cases to bring the inflammation down quickly and hopefully, we will have no more deaths in Singapore due to COVID19.",2020-04-19,126

Without an effective treatment for covid-19, everyone has the chance of getting infected, falling sick, and suffering physically and even financially.  I applaud the government's recent efforts on the foreign worker dormitories. The workers may have insufficient knowledge of the dangers of the virus, and may delay getting medical attention when not feeling well. These increase the risks of further spreading the disease within the dormitory and into the community.  Enhancing the dissemination of information is key, especially to those workers who have underlying medical conditions.  The work of the inter-agency task force is vital to slowing the spread by identifying those with symptoms and isolating them from the others, setting up quarantine facilities so that the sick can get the care to recover from the disease in peace, as well as providing correct health/medical advice and information.",2020-04-19,146

Many countries are adopting the 'wait till the cockroaches eventually start crawling out n resting on the bed' approach then their health care will then begin to deal with it and buying time for vaccines to intervene in due course..Our infected figures will be alarming for sure since with such aggressive testing but if our medical and MOH facilities and resources are able to substain then it is definitely a good move in a longer term so that even the vaccines will not be out this year we can still contain it . but if our medical facilities are totally exhausted because of the local transmission added to the infected rate,then the CB will have to be extend for another month probably to subdue the local transmission so our MOH and medical team can better focus on the foreign worker infected case.",2020-04-18,208

Because I m confused, in the past when haze struck SG, psi hit the unhealthy mark, no one dare to go out w/out mask or even exercise at Park. Now tis virus is of no smell but is highly infectious, ppl go exercise or out w/out mask. Will they fall sick or grow fat from not exercising for a month, they can conduct home exercising. Maybe sir, you shd put a stop on outdoor exercise w/out mask. Bcoz if they catch the virus or spread it, more will get sick, and they will get fat once been isolated, they will be fed 3meals day lying on the bed till they recovered. Lastly, a lot of us is thankful for the given $600, majority of us need it, but to some, they can't use it, bcoz of their stubbornness for not wearing mask when they r out.

8281,"Dear Prime Minister,   I believe the circuit breaker can, to some extent, bring about some positive results. However, the rising numbers of new cases in the last few days do not bode well for Singapore and do shake the people's confidence that the situation is improving. You have explained the actions being taken by our noble health and medical team members whose efforts deserve everyone's applause. With concerted effort from everyone, I believe Singapore can overcome and drive away the dark cloud soon.  I do have a few comments though and seek your open heart and mind to listen. (1) Could the case numbers from the dormitories be preempted or at least mitigated? (2) Have the dormitory owners and operators not taken sufficient pre-emptive initiatives at the early stage when case numbers in Singapore were in the 2-digit range? (3) Nevertheless, when the Covid19 storm ends, hopefully soon, could the relevant government agencies work hard to set and monitor new guidelines to bring about better living conditions for the migrant workers who I respect for their contribution to our nation. (4) While existing dormitory standards may be considered decent, but Covid19 has revealed some deficiencies. I like to clarify that good dormitory standards do not just refer to the hardware. The way it is managed and monitored are equally important.  I am a retired Singaporean and am proud of our nation. I earnestly look forward to soon seeing the end of Covid19 and returning to my normal routines. I also suggest government agencies could retain some good practices implemented currently, such as more frequent cleaning of food centres, markets, public transports, public toilets, etc where people congregate out of necessity.

Sending off cancel jobs workers free up space and clean space and use it for the infected to rest. As there are no vaccine.. Just like other countries  with huge now. They provide make shift non hospital stay area as care area.  Anyway economy w slow..

They themselves are not vulnerable and supposed to have little underlining disease; 2.       They are not living together with those vulnerable to covid-19; 3.       They pose little threat to overwhelming the health caring system of Singapore, as only 11 death by now, equivalent to 0.18% fatality rate lowest among any of the world, and 23 in ICU, equivalent to 0.5% of critical rate among the live cases, though several thousand new cases added by those living in dormitories. 4.       After the heard, they could resume working without worrying any more to spread covid-19 to those vulnerable of Singapore and resurgence within WP and SP holders living in dormitories should they not be herd.  The vaccines are still long way to go to help the herd immunity, which would be reached in most area of the world by resurgence of the outbreaks eventually. However, the dormitories could make this without posing high risks to themselves, to the neighbor communities and to the health care system.  Let’s have the herd in dormitories.

My kids are all very young age 4, 2 and 5 months old. Helper can only look after young baby while husband will be looking after 2 elder one.Husband is now consider jobless as freelancer and young children are not going to school as I decided to keep them at home but with this current situation I am forced to work from home and I think there is a issue with husband handling young kids. For education this part is it possible for childcare to conduct a online learning so that we parents are able to like more focus on work from home and not stressing out. I as a mother I can handle them but the situation right now that I have to work from home and complete my work with tight deadlines I am not able to help him out in terms of talking about being productive and husband have not patient with the kids. I understand that our government had done pretty much for us and I appreciate most of it but I hope the childcare can conduct online lesson maybe using zoom. Not sure if possible but I hope things will change and turn better so that my husband can focus on things he want to do and not stressing out otherwise with crcuit breaker extended by 4 weeks many parents will have difficulties especially for parents with more than 2 kids.

Let’s close more Food courts shall we? 🙄   Dear PM, after this Pandemic, we need justification on who overlooked at the dorm and cost us so much for the CB. Many of us here don know what billion look like but many of us here suffered due to official overlooked. No one see a cluster forming at all?? Do you really believe that?   Job lost, families suffered. Ppl are feeling depressed and moody. Some citizen are breaking the law because they cannot handle the stress at all. Who can handle 12 days at home with no money... no work... wife and children are crying and nagging? These ppl are the one that suffered. Not the ppl who comment in facebook saying good job Govt. Keep up the CB. 😔  The CB was man made. In Singapore, we really need to make sure ppl who made the wrong decision and cause the country to lose that amount of money be replaced by others who can do the job. It’s a simple request. Rotate the task force that was assigned to look at the pandemic in SG. This might bring improvement.",2020-04-18,251

8516,"Dear Sir  Lee Hsien LoongWhile we contain this virus, we should also weigh the risk of fears, media frenzy, and facts of how lethal this virus really is. Fear and panic are also contributors to the situation.  If we can get the public to be conscious of their hygiene, mature and sensitive against spreading their disease or sickness to others; we can faster get back to normality.  This is a great opportunity to drive home the importance of not coughing, sneezing, clearing their noses or throats in public without a mask when unwell and even suspecting unwell!   Drive home the wearing of mask when suspecting illness, unwell or sick! And to stay home and not work if unwell. More has to be done to enable this at the workplace especially for contingent workforce employers.  If we look at Taiwan and Japan; you will quickly realise that their Covid 19 situation is very much in control. Much due to their civic consciousness and responsibilities to others.  We ought to do the same, starting now.  If Covid 19 is to stay with us; this civic consciousness and self hygiene has to be reinforced and driven to clearly to all in Singapore!   And this is the best time to drive home this message.",2020-04-19,208

8518,"Next time, focus on the pandemic (not sure if there is a next time for you and your team). Don't bother about getting a fresh mandate when we have a pandemic that will destroy your nation and country on many fronts - health, economic, social fronts.  Just to let you know, if you call for a GE during this pandemic - I won't be voting for any of your team members. They will have to join George Yeo. And, I think you would know by now, the people have made their sentiments clear to you - No GE during the pandemic, regardless of whatever wayang measures you want to introduce.  We are turning from First World to Third World. Some third world countries are handling the pandemic better than SG.  Please learn to listen, and always put your people #1.  #SGMALU  下次，将注意力集中在大流行上（不确定您和您的团队是否还有下一次机会）。 当我们的大流行会在很多方面摧毁您的国家和国家时，请不要担心获得新的授权，这些方面在健康，经济，社会等各个方面都将毁于一旦。 只是想让您知道，如果您在这场大流行期间致电GE-我不会为您的任何团队成员投票。 他们将必须加入George Yeo。 而且，我想您现在已经知道，人民已经向您明确表达了自己的观点-在大流行期间没有通用电气，无论您想采用哪种Wayang措施。 我们正在从第一世界转向第三世界。 一些第三世界国家在应对大流行方面要比新加坡更好。 请学会倾听，并始终将您的员工放在第一位。 #SGMALU  Lain kali, fokus pada pandemi (tidak pasti jika ada masa berikutnya untuk anda dan pasukan anda). Jangan repot-repot mendapatkan mandat baru ketika kita mengalami wabak penyakit yang akan memusnahkan negara dan negara anda di banyak bidang - kesihatan, ekonomi, sosial. Untuk memberitahu anda, jika anda menuntut PRU semasa wabak ini - saya tidak akan memilih mana-mana ahli pasukan anda. Mereka mesti menyertai George Yeo. Dan, saya rasa anda akan tahu sekarang, orang-orang telah menyatakan sentimen mereka kepada anda - Tidak ada PRU semasa wabak itu, tanpa mengira apa sahaja cara yang ingin anda laksanakan. Kami beralih dari Dunia Pertama ke Dunia Ketiga. Beberapa negara dunia ketiga menangani wabak itu lebih baik daripada SG.

8519,"[1] the dorms configuration play a key factor in viral transmission. New PBDs have ensuite showers, toilet and kitchen. These have proven to be effective bulkheads. Recall that the first FW infections occurred in one of the newer dorms and that it did not spark a wider transmission. We shape our buildings, and afterwards, our buildings shape us.  [2] Dorm-config not the only contributor. In 2019-2020, I have visited multiple stations on the Thomson line, I have worked in Project Glory. PSSCOC style templates have safety policy mandates which are high risk in an epidemic. This includes -the safety management template for massed shift kickoffs, massing of water points, meal areas, toileting & washing areas coupled with synchronized meal times concentrated and massed construction workers at ""toolbox briefings"", safety inductions, meal areas, assembly points and pickup points.  [3]The construction safety officers - the risk experts - had no special understanding of epidemic risk. It was not significant on their standard checklist of construction hazards. Construction safety officers received no communication from MOH wrt to massing of workers in the context of existing capacities and standard safety practices as the epidemic approached.  [4] Air-conditioned buses have surface contact and high volume of return air as per design of Bus A/C. Open trucks have crowding. If it rained - side tarps were lowered and created an enclosed humid environment. Long commutes created a sustained risk exposure event.  [5] Hope observations wrt to the structure of special conditions at large worksite and common construction labour practices will support design of a sound and targeted response.  [6] Add oil.

8523,"Gov. sg sent a message out today to remind people to respect our law enforcement officers and ambassadors.  I think we absolutely should give them the utmost respect they deserve. They are front line people who play an important role to safeguard our health while risking theirs. They have family too, and like many of us, they have a job to do.  I hope the Govt would understand why the people are angry and frustrated, some are even mentally distressed. Many small businesses are not going to survive, and many will lose their jobs and have their income substantially affected.   The people don’t have an outlet to vent their anger during this unprecedented time. Many have placed their trust in the government, but now this faith is severely being tested, and some have lost it completely.  The people don’t know how long this CB period would last, and privately, many people believe it won’t work and we haven’t even mentioned the double standards behaviour exhibited by the PAP MPs who walked the ground during this CB period.  My point being, people don’t see a closure to their anger. Some don’t know who to blame for their plight, and others who do, know there is no chance our PM and the ministerial taskforce would own up their mistakes.   All leaders make mistakes. To be human means we all have to mess up once in a while. If you messed up, admit it and own it. Then acknowledge your responsibility and move forward. Only insecure leaders are afraid of looking weak.  At this time, admitting your mistakes earns you the respect of the people you lead and makes your leadership human. Once you have done that, the relationship with the people would get stronger and you would regain the trust of the people to move forward.  That is the real mandate the govt is seeking, and not through methods of enforcement measures, fines, POFMA or gerrymandering. It’s about winning hearts and minds.  I think this is what we need to really unite the people to overcome the crisis, and together.",2020-04-18,355
8524,"Dear Mr Lee Hsien Loong ,   I am a faithful PAP supporter & a firm believer since Mr LKY time .   I am writing in as I am not sure who to write to in terms of ministry to over see this as I personally think it’s critical & the urgency to act .   The CV 19 over @ 40dorm with 200K foreign worker even though have been separated & on going testing to treat / isolate ; there is 1 possible big concern from me .   What if .. what if there is some worker due to unhappiness / self worry or someone creating unrest & spread to 2 bigger dorm then 3 then 4 & so on ...   1) Question links to homeland security now is are WE ( SPF , Task force from SPF , Army , MP from army ) equip to handle ?   2) Its the fast response team able to handle as we are talking abt 200K workers ?   3) As of now, on the group in that 15 or so isolation area / zone enough security personal to handle ?   4) We SG have never never see / think of this 200k workers of where they stay might post a sparking / starting point to spread CV19 in SG .    5) This is a global pandemic hence the scale of managing will be unprecedented.   The lesson learned from the past like little India riots ( 400 or less rioters ) expose the reality of SG not prepare  let alone now in 200k workers .   I know You & SG government have been really caring to all the workers & taking care of them ..   But what if the that someone just out to creat harm to SG ..   All your ministers are now working hard to take care of us the Singaporean & those staying in Singapore.   No sure any one think / worry of what I fear as the scale of 200k workers is very real ...   We take care of them ( the 200k worker ) but the what if have to be consider .  Thank you Mr Lee .  Yours sincerely  Alvin lim",2020-04-18,303

I picked three pcs and as I was about to walk away, ts lady was coughing, although she did turn away as she coughed but she coughed into the hand holding onto a pc of lemon. I stood on, just to make sure she didn't put back that pc of contaminated lemon.  2nd n last item: a pkt of dried noodles, a lady in her 40s' carrying a shopping basket kept saying ""excuse me, excuse me!"" as the lane was quite narrow. I was stooping to pick up my item, so when I heard her, I stood up to give way but to my astonishment! she couldn't wait but squeezed through having a direct body contact with me. She just brushed off w/o even apologising 😠 I sincerely appeal to all supermarkets to monitor the traffic flow n get shoppers to put on mask b4 they enter and also maintain 1m distance even while picking their items; if not, all the stipulated measures to keep the disease down will not be effective!😬",2020-04-09,230

9338,"Dear PM Lee,  Your next wave of covid-19 infections will be coming from the preschool teachers.  Teachers are being made to return to school unnecessarily. The frequency could be from 3 days a week to every day. We teachers are also human beings and we deserve to be treated the same as everyone else.  There are many centres which are milking the most that they can from their teachers by making them commute to work just to do cleaning and conduct online lessons in the centre.  We try to practice social distancing as much as possible but we share common spaces and as much as we try to take precautions, we still breathe the same air in the air-conditioned centre.  Many of us are also mothers and we have elderlies at home. By making us leave our house unnecessarily, we are also being put at risk and sometimes we can't help but wonder if we have made the right career choice.  We have tried to reach out to relevant authorities for help but they simply told us that that's the centres arrangement and they cannot intervene.  I just want to raise to your attention that many centres are looking into the loopholes from the advisory and trying to find a way around it.  Please help us as we are already at our wits end.",2020-04-09,220

9353,It’s sad to have so many people still so oblivious of the possible harm they can bring to others and themselves.  Haven’t they read about the outbreaks in nursing home for elderly and at the workers’ dormitories?  I strongly recommend that the government put in one new rule: 1) mandatory to wear mask in public places   I think it will have a strong psychological impact on people’s behaviour when they r constantly reminded that they have to put on mask 😷 to prevent themselves from spreading COVid-19  to others unknowingly each time they go out.   It’s time that we learn to constantly think for others.,2020-04-09,107

It further defeats the purpose if we continue to allow dependents of LT pass holders to be admitted at this juncture when globally people are exercising (and as we are as well here in Singapore) to restrain from even meeting our loved ones. So the benefit at this stage to the country vis-a-vis the risks we are importing does not quite add up. Should we not consider further tightened custom control? As an example,I was somewhat surprised to learn that we still have inbound flights   coming in from Chennai, Mumbai and New Delhi today (total pax size of 600), of which there are numerous old folks and kids when India is in the midst of a lock-down and our country into the first week of heightened measures.

The old adage monkey see monkey do is at work here....one sees a guy jogging or walking with his partner and thinks....why am I stuck here when they are out getting fresh air...so he goes down and does the same....so now you have people interacting, using lifts, stairwells etc...touching handrails etc....hence cross spreading.

9458,"Dear Sir, I think a lot of people still don't see the seriousness of the whole situation. I am a regular jogger at Punggol Park. I  have tried to change and reduce my jogging routine in the park lately. It was very surprising to see so many people in the park recently and even this morning. The regular faces (the older uncles and aunties) were not seen. Those who went were mostly new faces, mostly young adults, some parents brought young children out, some adults brought their old parents. Most people walked in the park, some jogged, some meditated and some did different styles of exercising. Those who came as a whole family walked side by side, making it difficult for others to keep a safe distance as we walked or jogged past them. It seems that the number of people there is more than that at the NTUC Supermarket! I felt very worried for this situation and have decided not to exercise in the park for the time being. It gave me the feeling that the park has become one of the most vulnerable places for the virus to spread. I sincerely encourage your team to check out the different parks across the country. This is not a holiday, this is not the time to bring children and elderly out for fun. I understand that it may be difficult to stay at home all the time but this is for the benefit of everyone and for the entire Nation. I hope that Singaporeans can just bear with this for 4 weeks. Our pioneers had gone through the toughest time during the World Wars and our independence period, this is small case compared to then.

Companies also take opportunity to suspend payment of transport allowance for april but still insist sales staff should visit clients using Grab or claim by milage and stated that transport allowance may be changed to reimbursement in the coming months.

When politicians demand the citizens to sacrifice for the sake of greater good, the amount demanded is never equal - The wealthy can give up a car or two and still live comfortably, but what about the rest of us?  Just how many of us live in 800 sq. ft. housings with breathing space to exercise? It's not as though we want to sit packed like sardines in the kitchens. Not all of us have dedicated wi-fi at home either, and have to rely on mobile data plans that charge us exorbitant amounts for overuse. As if that is not enough, we get fined for not wearing masks when we go outside (... after being handed a measly piece of cloth), scarcely 1 week after being told EXPLICITLY not to buy masks so that the hospitals would have enough. In fact, just 2 days ago, the police patrols on the MRT were not even wearing masks on their round, so much for legitimacy.  The very fact that I am connected to the internet and can gripe here means that I am one of the luckier ones; what about the rest of us out here don't even have that luxury?

Focus the Gov machinery on over-communicating on stay-home and mask-wearing. Blanket the airwaves. Sound the air raid siren every day. Tell people to show solidarity to the nurses and doctors risking their lives by wearing a mask as a totem of solidarity.   Wrt to saving plastic food containers.

(2) why are we still silent about elderly workers going to work in essential services, (3) Can there be exceptions made to allow us to at least go to our parents house for childcare if we meet stringent conditions like we don’t go out of the homes (order food in), we only go to parents house in our own car. Hope the Task Force can consider this.  (4) Can the government or task force help explain why there is a flip flop of the rule on dropping kids with grandparents within a day.

Is there another APP to book a timing to avoid crowding? Now the numbers of infections is growing over each day. The only way is get everyone to self sentence themself to another jail term at home.

9950,"Today I encountered a selfish Singaporean couple in their sixties who walked by side along the stairs up a bridge and refused to give way to the others even when they were asked to be excused. Not only their attitude was bad, they even scolded others for squeezing through passed them. The disgusting thing about this couple is that their attitude changed completely and they became super polite and civil when they saw a social distancing ambassador who witnessed the incident, and even tried to explain that they were in their sixties and walked slowly. BTW, there was a lift at the bridge the couple could take. More importantly, if they are old they should not be even going out and about. Isn't this against what the government had advised - that the elderly should stay home and not venture out?  Apart from the circuit measures the government has introduced, it is also important for the government to educate our senior citizens on their manners and hygiene. Since I returned home around six years ago from overseas where I was based for more than a decade, I’ve encountered so many of our senior citizens who have this ‘I and old and am always right’ attitude with absolutely no concept of personal hygiene, coughing and sneezing openly and even spitting anywhere and whenever they like. At the end of the day, this boils down to one thing - their selfish attitude. Like what Dr Tommy Koh said, Singapore is a First World country with Third World citizens. I can now understand why Dr Koh had said this.",2020-04-10,264

10108,"Today I encountered a selfish Singaporean couple in their sixties who walked by side along the stairs up a bridge and refused to give way to the others even when they were asked to be excused. Not only was their attitude bad, they even scolded others for squeezing through them. The disgusting thing about this couple is that their attitude changed completely and became super polite when they saw a social distancing ambassador around who witnessed the incident, and  explained then that they were in their sixties and had to walk  slowly. BTW, there’s a lift which the couple could have used. More importantly, they are elderly and should stay home and not leave home if they can’t even walk normally.   Apart from the circuit measures that the government has introduced, it is also important for the government to educate our senior citizens on their manners and hygiene. Since I returned home from overseas where I was based for more than a decade, I’ve encountered so many of our senior citizens who have this ‘I and old and am always right’ attitude with no concept of personal hygiene at all, coughing and sneezing openly and even spitting anywhere and whenever they like. Like what Dr Tommy Koh had said “Singapore is a First World country with Third World citizens”. I can now see where Dr Koh is coming from.",2020-04-10,232

10157,"Prof. Knut Wittkowski, which has been an epidemiologist for 35 years and has been modeling epidemics for 35 years. He worked for 15 years with Klaus Dietz, a leading epidemiologist who coined the term “reproduction number”, on the Epidemiology of HIV before heading for 20 years the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at The Rockefeller University, New York.   He says: With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity. About 80% of the people need to have had contact with the virus, and the majority of them won’t even have recognized that they were infected, or they had very, very mild symptoms, especially if they are children. So, it’s very important to keep the schools open and kids mingling to spread the virus to get herd immunity as fast as possible, and then the elderly people, who should be separated, and the nursing homes should be closed during that time, can come back and meet their children and grandchildren after about 4 weeks when the virus has been exterminated…. We are experiencing all sorts of counterproductive consequences of not well-thought-through policy….  Well, we will see maybe a total of fewer cases—that is possible. However, we will see more cases among the elderly, because we have prevented the school children from creating herd immunity. And so, in the end, we will see more death because the school children don’t die, it’s the elderly people who die, we will see more death because of this social distancing….  If we had herd immunity now, there couldn’t be a second wave in autumn. Herd immunity lasts for a couple of years, typically, and that’s why the last SARS epidemic we had in 2003, it lasted 15 years for enough people to become susceptible again so that a new epidemic could spread of a related virus. Because typically, there is something that requires cross-immunity, so if you were exposed to one of the SARS viruses, you are less likely to fall ill with another SARS virus. So, if we had herd immunity, we wouldn’t have a second wave. However, if we are preventing herd immunity from developing, it is almost guaranteed that we have a second wave as soon as either we stop the social distancing or the climate changes with winter coming or something like that….  [Extreme reactions] cost the US taxpayer $2 trillion, in addition to everything else that it costs, but it also has severe consequences for our social life, and depression is definitely something that we will be researching. I can say for myself, walking through New York City right now is depressing….  We should be resisting, and we should, at least, hold our politicians responsible. We should have a discussion with our politicians. One thing we definitely need to do, and that would be safe and effective, is opening schools. Let the children spread the virus among themselves, which is a necessity to get herd immunity. That was probably one of the most destructive actions the government has done. We should focus on the elderly and separating them from the population where the virus is circulating. We should not prevent the virus from circulating among school children, which is the fastest way to create herd immunity…. And the final question and answer:  “So, is there anything else you want to say about this that—what’s been aggravating you the most? Or what would you like people to know?”  I think people in the United States and maybe other countries as well are more docile than they should be. People should talk with their politicians, question them, ask them to explain, because if people don’t stand up to their rights, their rights will be forgotten.  https://www.aier.org/article/stand-up-for-your-rights-says-professor-knut-m-wittkowski/",2020-04-09,620

We are too dependent on the fws across the board, SG will not be sustainable or grow without them, we need a NATIONAL CONTINUITY PLAN ASAP and this must include the NSmen as linchpins of society, not just soldiers. Hence very IMPORTANTLY SAF needs to realise we need at most 3 in-camp training for NSmen (who are indispensable as fathers, sons and resources to our economy and survival) for them to be operationally effective. Mindef needs to think and plan effectively and efficiently, more money and more training don't equate to effectiveness, we are citizen soldiers not professional ones.

The thinking behind it, the calibrated measures taken to keep Singaporeans’ lives safe and bearable as much as possible and communicating them well is a challenging, balancing act. The decisiveness and speed of response in the form of the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budget within a short span of time is hugely commendable! More importantly the comprehensiveness and the broad reach of the budget and responsiveness in tweaking the schemes based on feedback from the ground is greatly appreciated! As a Singaporean it is very comforting that our government always plan and think Ahead and not just react to challenges. I hope the EXECUTION of the measures are carried out as intended so that we emerge from this pandemic with minimal loss of lives and begin gradual restoration of normalcy in our lives soon. Create a channel for people to work with the government to ensure companies and individuals follow the guidelines so that we get out of this pandemic quickly as one SGUnited! Take Care!

The oppositions are undermining the security and social safety net during this critical time and we must not let them thrive.

10786,"Dear PM  You and your colleagues, our civil service, our healthcare workers, our cleaning/supply chain/food/transportation/etc workers, our volunteers, etc have all been working very hard during these challenging times. A plethora of containment, financial assistance, etc measures have been announced and implemented. Thank you.  Unfortunately, there are still people and organisations not complying with the measures. Whilst some may have very good reasons for doing what they did, there are those who were irresponsibly YOLOing, making the last buck, etc.  Enforcement is never easy. Proper investigations (that take up our already stressed resources) are needed. And there are social, political, etc implications in enforcement.  We trust that you and your team are already looking into taking to task those who acted wrongly or irresponsibly. There is a risk of the population seeing non-compliant or (where it is gray under the existing measures) irresponsible people and organisations ""escaping"" with it, and being swayed to follow the non-compliant or irresponsible acts.  Broad and repeated communications have been made. Warnings have been issued. It may well be time to quicken the step up to enforcement and prosecution, and firm discussions (where the act is gray under the existing measures, but clearly detrimental to management of the current crisis). And to communicate this to the population.  Not that any ill is deliberately wished on any person or organisation, or scapegoating is intended.",2020-04-08,230

10790,"I have always been supportive of your leadership and will continue to do so. However we should reflect on our mistakes and improve upon them. One big mistake was letting in Malaysians after their lockdown. Some of them could be carrying the virus when they came in and could be the cause of some of the clusters here. Now Malaysia is shirking all responsibility to allow them back. Sad for these people that their own country doesn't want them back. We provide jobs for them and now have to bear the costs whether we keep them here or return them. Dealing with Malaysia has always been very problematic, but we have to firm with them. I am fed up with Malaysia for always taking advantage of us. Hope a win-win solution can be reached.",2020-04-08,132

10794,"COVID-19: Take Circuit Breaker measures seriously Circuit Breaker measures take effect from today till 4 May ➕ May be extended if situation is not brought under control Stay at home Only go out if: 🌳 Exercising at parks at safe distance Dear PM Lee Sir, First day CB. Unfortunately some humans either don’t listen or don’t take the government recommendation seriously. Your consistency which covers Bishan Park, this evening was more crowded above the normal days and to made matters worst, a sudden heavy downpour has every person huddle into shelter like pack sardines. We know well an asymptomatic person can spread and to made matter worst there are no data or contact tracing at any parks or open space.  I hope I am wrong but will wait to see the crowd in Changi Beach this weekend. How many long queues at Hawker center to “ tapoa” food and seek the sun and water,open-air as long as it is not so crowded. The question is how one defines not so crowded.  All it takes is a few careless irresponsible to put an overload on your breaker. I hope your relevant office will consider an immediate Switch Board shutdown rather than a Circuit Breaker. There is only a hope for such sickness and that is to take the bitter pill of a 100% 14 days stay home for non-essentail activities.  A Singaporean at heart.",2020-04-07,228
10795,"Let's hope the public places can get quieter as the days go by. Hope all these can work out successfully. Pls don't let this one month circuit breaker go down the drain.

10802,"Because this pandemic is causing economy to suffer heavily, all the more we should exercise better discipline and end this pandemic in our country AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  When this pandemic drags on, we will end up isolating ourselves from the rest of the world longer, and this will spell months of bad luck for us.   First, end our own pandemic. This means stay at home, break transmission links, observe personal hygiene. I think this budget is put in place to let businesses tide over the next three weeks.   When we are officially cleared of pandemic by the WHO, then we can start doing businesses with countries that have also recovered from the pandemic. There are countries now that have recovered and are still waiting to do businesses with us! BUT WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE ARE STILL BATTLING THIS CRISIS!  Once we have won this crisis, then we can offer to help other ASEAN countries to either cope with their pandemic or to help their economy recover. Either way a collective effort will always be more effective.   On the other hand if we are battling with the crisis, NO TOURISTS WILL EVER WANT TO COME. Think of Changi airport and SIA. And remember when companies like SQ goes bankrupt, there will no longer be another SQ. It will be gone forever.  THE VALUE OF THE SINGAPORE DOLLAR DEPENDS ON THE SERVICES WE CAN PROVIDE TO OURSELVES AND TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.   So while exercising circuit-breaking policies, think also how you can recover your businesses when this pandemic ends. Signal to the Chamber of Commerce or the ministry or any organisation your needs. The communication channels between the businesses and the government should all the more be open during this period because the government can help build and rebuild basic infrastructure so that companies can stand to benefit. THINK OF IT AS A LIGHTHOUSE FOR THE MISSING SHIPS AS THE STORM COMES SUDDENLY! THE LIGHTHOUSE WILL NOT HELP YOU IF YOU DO NOT SOUND YOUR DISTRESS!",2020-04-07,335

11106,"I like to share my view on how Singapore can get to normal after the circuit breaker.  I believe the simple solution which China has been showing the world is to wear mask.  They are getting back to work, socializing and sightseeing with masks.  The simple rationale which has been floating around for quite some time is that if mask can protect medical staffs who are in intimate contact with patients then it should work in working and social environment.  There is nothing complicated about the rationale of wearing mask.  The reason for government not advocating mask wearing was insufficient supply and that was true.  But the picture now is different.   It is clear that the current situation is going to persist for quite some time and our economy cannot afford to wait for vaccine or effective drug treatment.  The simple answer is therefore mass production of mask.  I believe Singapore has the engineering capabilities to just do that. ",2020-04-07,159

11408,PM Lee you are not alone ... We are all in this together from Singapore to Tobago.. and in-between..,2020-04-06,17
11409,"Dear PM, I sincerely hope our government can imposed compulsory stay at home for all unless it’s for groceries and essential work, as well compulsory mask wearing when going out.  The reason for doing so is that although majority of Singaporeans will stand together and stay at home, there’s still minority of residences here whom will not co-operate without proper enforcement. This group of people are risk takers, thus they have a higher chance of getting infected and transmitting it to others. Without proper enforcement, we will be wasting this precious circuit breaker period, and eventually extending it, further disrupting our economy and this will increase our jobless rate. It will not be possible for our government to consistently support us with solidarity packages as this will eventually empty our reserves, we need to first stop the local transmissions, enhanced our immigration process - compulsory 14 days quarantine in dedicated hotels for all  coming into Singapore, which will be paid by themselves. Once we stop all local transmission, and prevent import transmission from spreading locally, we can then boost our economy by becoming a safe heaven and S.E.A command centre in fighting this virus. ",2020-04-06,195
11410,"Yes totally agree.  Please help to spread and remind Singaporean to do their part.  Govt already help us alot and we only need to do little to keep all healthy and fight Covid -19 together.

However if the government can also impose regulation to prevent employers to take advantage of the current Circuit breaker  to freeze the salary of employees , that will definitely ease a lot of employee’ worries &  fear of losing their monthly income  . 🙏🏻 with today’s new Budget to help the employers with 75% of their first 4.6k wage, the employer should also do their part to support their employees too & not simply throw the full responsibility to the government .",2020-04-06,102

11471,"Dear PM Lee, I had a suggestion for your consideration. Given the circuit breaker measures, most families would like to order provisions online, however most online services are now not able to service the demand as they are short of staff in their warehouses as well as for delivery. On the other hand, we have enterprises like Changi airport and SIA which have staff who are currently available. Can we consider redeploying some of the staff especially ground handling / baggage handling to help companies like Redmart etc to meet the surge in demand? We have been trying to order groceries online but no slots are ever available,  necessitating our going out to the supermarket in person, which exposes everyone to risk. If we can redeploy staff (facilitated by government) from businesses that have been disrupted to businesses that need more staff urgently like online groceries, it would be a win win for all.

11603,"I would like to suggest that the Singapore Goverment persuade the WHO under the leadership of UN, take the lead in commencing a World wide lock down of one month or an extension if necessary for all nations instead of individual nations or States planning their own lock down which could be counterproductive.  Nations or states  that have completed their lock down could still have imported cases of covid-19 because other nations or states have yet to lock down or are not in full lock down. A very good example is the US where different states are in different stages of lock down or some are yet to lock down. Those nations or states that have completed their lock down will be hit by second or more waves from imported cases because they have not got their act together .  The World should come together as one & fight the invisibel enemy. We must be prepared to have several lock downs until we have small clusters which can be managed by contact tracing. By doing so, we might slow down the rate of infection & mortality while waiting for the covid-19 vaccine to be ready.  Please spread the message, so that we can have a World 🌍 wide lock down for 1 month or so & save more lives from Covid-19 🙏🏼",2020-04-07,215

11752,"Decades ago, my Boss, then 2LT Barnard Tan Cheow Han, told me not to charge machine guns without having a good plan. He then made me do it again and again with my section - just so he would not have to convince me again.  I would like to know a good plan is in place before making a dash across open ground.  The mandatory closing of business premises across the economy w/o discrimination when the conditions are not yet in place for success seems like a call to line up firms to be machined gunned without a fair chance of success.  Let's be fair. Availability of bandages is not a good plan.  Closing of businesses is no auto-magical plan. It will take methodical organisation and monitoring of measures to operationalize the lowering of the R number by lowering the number of unsafe interactions - flattening the curve.  We how the Chinese gov operationalized their quarantine wrt to the limited number of times you get to go to the store to buy food with a mask and the registration of that person each time for each trip out via condo security and village committee.  Last Saturday ~50% of the people out exercising, buying food in scrums and using public transport were unmasked, they go home and marinate with their unprotected family in a close, trusted and intimate setting.  There are simplified SIR models wrt to central places and show big effects of small differences.  There are second-order effects when the asymptomatic family members take their turn going out to exercise using the same lifts or stairwells.  I have walked and inspected worker dorms and know the sights and smells well.  Prep the ground, get people to mask up in public then throw the ""close business premises"" breaker if still necessary.  We do not understand why do one w/o the other. Please explain to us so that we can understand the actions taken by the Gov.",2020-04-06,320

If some rich, generous, and kind hearted Singaporeans have the button to opt out, and let's.say some 100,000 rich persons opt out x S$600 = S$60m.    From this amount of S$60m not given out, it will mean the Govt has an additional S$60m to give to those in the lower-income groups.    But now with no button to press, the S$60m will be paid out.    No S$60m saved, it means the Govt does not have S$60m to give it to the lower-income groups.    MOF must have their reasons and for whatever reasons not to have the button to save the S$60m, and to give more to the lower-income groups.
