24,This offence is not justified in a country that hardly practices safe distancing ..and so yes we must be in a group of 8 and not more or we must be this and that but at the end of the day everyone is still walking pass each other by the hundreds in the malls a d shopping centers .. so what's a another 2 extra persons on a yacht ..they are more safe distanced being only 10 people on a yacht then the thousands of families that are out in malls ..just go to Ngee Ann city basement where the food court is and try justifying safe distancing  or look at the 6 or 7 people who walked into the lift wheres the safe distancing... Even though there is one table gap in hawker centers people are still mask free when they are eating and there are hundreds of them there eating and one table gap away is not that safe without a mask ..so i think such laws should use more discretion ..if you're talking about a bar or restaurant having indoors gatherings then maybe yes but 10 people on a boat away from everyone else ???
