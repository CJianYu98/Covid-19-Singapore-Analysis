44,"When covid-19 (or coronavirus as it was named) first started, the gov was slow to react and even advised that wearing of face mask was not required then.  Even though there is a decreased in number of cases here in SG, there are still transmissions happening, especially in the dormitories. And the number of daily transmissions around the world is still very high. Yes, numbers are low here. Yes, there are screening at all our borders to prevent inbound infections. Yes, there are having safe distancing rules. Yes, there are laws to punish those who do not follow the rules. So what! Are all this measures full proof? No it's not. The situation is still in the pandemic stage across the world. Until the number of transmissions are reduced, the chances of transmissions are still high.

50,"I think the change on wearing mask adjusted from 2yo to 6yo may need to review again. At 6yo, kids are practically attending K2. Most centers grouped their K1 & K2 in the same center....from my personal encounter. Which means these K2 kids may be wearing mask while the K1 kids do not need to do so. It may be a measure tough for centers to adhere. May i suggest that this measure be either adjusted from 2yo to 5yo or 7yo. Then it’s either all kindergartens kids to wear or not to wear mask. This will also help centers from encountering issues where some parents arguing abt age for kids whose birthdays are around end of year.",2020-09-23,108
52,"I think Ministry of Health, Singapore should review restrictions for incoming travelers from India. Why does It takes so long for you to implement this measure when you ban China pretty early? I thought i read that they are supposed to be tested covid free before departure but apparently seems not so. And Does the covid cert now helps? There are so many fake certs made in India as your media reported. Wondering if you will relook at it if there is better way? Thank you 🙏 ",2020-09-23,86

66,Thank you for a near lockdown.... Very well planned and thought of.  Thank you,2020-04-03,14
67,"Ministry of Health, Singapore Good job . Any new measures is most welcomed at this most crucial phase to fight this stubborn virus.   However I feel we are having a missed opportunity here in curbing the number of imported cases. Although , the number of imported cases have steadily dropped, there is still a few cases Everyday . At the moment , we must drill that mindset that even one case is one too many.   Thus , I had hoped the recently announced circuit breaker measures would have included a semi closure of air travel into Singapore for a period of time. We could have used this measure to stop the number of imported cases to zero , so that we could fully concentrate on bringing the number of local infections down.   I do hope the officials will consider also suspending all passenger arrivals and departures for this one month and to only allow cargo flights to operate. This timeframe would help our medical resources to fully concentrate on all local cases. ",2020-04-03,166

78,"We thank Minister Wong and Gan for finally making the correct decision to encourage wearing mask in public. The communication should be more focus on stopping the spreaders rather than keeping one safe. As long as we can mitigate virus droplets flying, we have succeeded. Scream, if you see someone not wearing mask in crowded and enclosed places, like market, shopping mall, buses and MRT. Peer pressure is the most effective.

88,"FOREIGN VIRUS HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO SPREAD FROM AIRPORTS TO CITIES, TO HOMES !  HEALTH MINISTER HAS MESSED IT UP !  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-pm-lee-urges-returning-travellers-to-stay-home-isolate-12575938  LET ME REVEAL THE MEANING OF QUARANTINE !  EXAMPLE: IMAGINE YOU GO TO A COUNTRY WHICH IS BRANDED AS A PLACE FOR YELLOW FEVER PANDEMIC.  AFTER THAT, SAY, YOU GO TO VENICE.  YOU CANNOT ENTER THE NEXT COUNTRY AND WILL BE PUT IN A ""QUARANTINE ISOLATION"" OUTSIDE THAT COUNTRY.  ONLY AFTER THE INCUBATION PERIOD IS OVER, THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WILL CHECK EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE QUARANTINED.  ONLY THEN ARE YOU ALLOWED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY.  WE IN SINGAPORE BROUGHT IN THE CORONAVIRUS VIA AIRPORTS, CHECKPOINTS, PORTS, ETC..  SINGAPORE DID NOT CARE ABOUT ACCEPTED QUARANTINE PROCEDURES !  SINGAPORE ALLOWED ALL PASSENGERS TO DISEMBARK AND GO TO THEIR HOMES !  WHAT IS ALL THIS ?  ONLY PEOPLE WITH FEVER WERE DETAINED FOR QUARANTINE.  HULLO HEALTH MINISTER, STOP YOUR BULLSHIT AND DO YOUR JOB PROPERLY !  FLU VACCINATION WHICH HEALTH MINISTERS LOVE (KOSHER EVIL PHARMA DONATIONS) IMPOSED ON BABIES IS USELESS; AS FLU VIRUSES MUTATE EVERY SEASON.  A VIRUS IS REPLICATED ONLY INSIDE THE LIVING CELLS OF AN ORGANISM.  VIRUSES CAN INFECT ALL TYPES OF LIFE FORMS, INCLUDING BACTERIA.  THERE ARE MILLIONS OF TYPES OF VIRUSES IN THE ENVIRONMENT.  HUMAN BODY CAN PROVIDE IMMUNITY UNLESS THESE VIRUSES ARE CULTURED IN THE LAB ON A PERTI DISH BY HUMANS.  CORONAVIRUSES ARE SIMILAR TO INFLUENZA VIRUSES IN THAT THEY BOTH CONTAIN SINGLE STRANDS OF RNA.  CORONAVIRUS (SARS-COV-2) WAS DETECTABLE IN AEROSOLS FOR UP TO THREE HOURS, UP TO FOUR HOURS ON COPPER.  IT SHOWS THAT COVID-19 IS MAN MADE FOR BIOLOGICAL WARFARE.  COVID-19 PANDEMIC DEMANDS THAT ALL AC AIR DUCTS (CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONING) MUST HAVE SPECIAL AIR DUCT FILTERS WHICH MUST HAVE A PLANNED MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE, RECORDED BY VIDEO.  MAINTENANCE OF SYSTEMS AND FILTRATION HAS AN IMPACT ON HOW CONTAMINANTS FLOW THROUGH THE AIR, SO BUILDINGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PROPERLY SERVICED TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE CIRCULATION, FILTRATION, HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER AMOUNTS OF MICROORGANISMS MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEMS.  THIS EXPLAINS WHY NEW YORK IS AN EPICENTER FOR COVID-19.  THE ONLY WAY VIRUSES GROW ARE WITHIN BODIES, WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO BRING THE GERMS INTO YOUR BODY; OFTEN VIA TOUCHING YOUR FACE, IN ORDER TO GET SICK.  WE ASK HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO INSPECT ALL OFFICERS OF LARGE COMPANIES...  CHECK IF DIRECT SUNLIGHT (NOT FILTERED THROUGH GLASS) IS PROVIDED TO THE EMPLOYEES AT THEIR DESKS.  IN WUHAN THERE ARE MANY CHINESE DOCTORS WHO HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS.  ASYMPTOMATIC CASES REMAIN UNDIAGNOSED AND THEREFORE UNQUARANTINED.  WE STILL DON'T HAVE SERUM TESTS TO TEST SUCH SLEEPER PASSIVE CARRIERS.  UNDETECTED, ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS COULD CREATE FRESH TRANSMISSION ROUTES ONCE LOCKDOWNS ARE EASED.  WE ARE IN FOR A LONG HAUL !  DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP OUTBREAK SHOWED THAT 35 OF THE 104 INFECTED PASSENGERS REMAINED ASYMPTOMATIC EVEN AFTER AN AVERAGE OF 10 DAYS OF OBSERVATION AT THE SELF-DEFENCE FORCES CENTRAL HOSPITAL IN JAPAN.  ON MARCH 23 2020, THE HEALTH MINISTRY IN THE SOUTHWESTERN CHINESE CITY OF CHONGQING, SAID 18% OF PATIENTS WERE ASYMPTOMATIC.  EXISTENCE OF PRE-ASYMPTOMATIC (ASYMPTOMATIC) PATIENTS MEANT THAT SCREENING PROCEDURES AT AIRPORTS AND OTHER POINTS OF ENTRY WERE INSUFFICIENT TO PREVENT THE CORONAVIRUS FROM SPREADING.  THIS IS WHY THERE MUST BE ESTABLISHED QUARANTINE PROCEDURES AT AIRPORTS, CHECKPOINTS, PORTS, ETC., FROM WHICH COVID-19 GAVE ENTRY.  JUST ONE TWO SECOND TEMPERATURE CHECK IS NOT ENOUGH !  CHILDREN WHO EAT GOOD ORGANIC FOOD ARE LESS SICK FROM COVID-19, BUT MAY STILL SPREAD THE CORONAVIRUS.  THIS CHILD CAN SPREAD THE DISEASE TO A MALNOURISHED FEEBLE CLASSMATE.  CHILDREN WORLDWIDE RARELY HAVE SEVERE SYMPTOMS WHEN INFECTED BY COVID-19.  TRUE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS IN U.S.A. (MANY WITH MILD OR NO SYMPTOMS) IS FAR HIGHER THAN ESTABLISHED.  AGAIN, AN ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIER (HEALTHY CARRIER OR JUST CARRIER) IS A PERSON OR OTHER ORGANISM THAT HAS BECOME INFECTED WITH A PATHOGEN, BUT THAT DISPLAYS NO SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS.  ALTHOUGH UNAFFECTED BY THE PATHOGEN, CARRIERS CAN TRANSMIT IT TO OTHERS, HOW CERTAIN PATHOGENS CAN REMAIN DORMANT IN A HUMAN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.  A COMMON PRINCIPLE IN EPIDEMIOLOGY, THE 80–20 RULE, SPECULATES THAT 80% OF THE DISEASE TRANSMISSION IS CONDUCTED BY ONLY 20% OF PEOPLE IN A POPULATION.  WE WATCH !",2020-04-03,679

Some GPs may simply issue MC for this reason juz to be ‘kiasu’ but the condition of the patient is otherwise. Staying a distance is not applicable to public transport. The latest measure is outside of work and school gathering. The purpose of this measure is to minimise gathering of 10. Public transport may still be crowded n ppl with flu symptoms or suspected virus may spread. Public library may also have ppl though short of gathering sort. The virus spread nay happen.

114,"Hello, would like to ask what are you going to advise on people who does not have a lot of medical leaves? If they do not have a lot and yet employers do not offer alternatives except that they either no pay, how are you going to advise them then? Will there be any mandate or rules for employers too on this matter?  I feel that the new rule on medical leave is going to back fire as many will no longer go and see the doctor for slight symptoms and wait until their symptoms get serious then they go see doctor. Now people may go see doctor if the symptoms are slight since mc will not be enforced, but if mc are to be enforced, there will be more people who will not see doctor for slight symptoms anymore due to the fact that many do not want to loose their jobs during this difficult times.  No point telling us about the resilience budget cos covid-19 is not going to go away anytime soon. It may run longer than SARS and people need to put food on the table too.  If you are going to enforce anything, please enforce in full cycle and not halfway, enforce at employees' end and yet not enforcing it on the employers' end.  PS: Doctors now give MCs as if it is free, as long as you cough a little, running nose a little, also give 5 days MC. Then ask you to see them again and again. 5 days MC given consequently without any other remedy like sending to hospital for test or anything. Just keep giving people 5 days MC again and again.

There are even people removing their masks to cough before putting their masks back on. 3. I witnessed a 70+ y.o. man digging both nostrils with his finger then held the bus metal pole with the same hand!  Such socially irresponsible and unhygienic behaviour is so rampant that they are the weakest link in our INTERNAL fight against Covid-19 even as we try so hard to control imported cases.
