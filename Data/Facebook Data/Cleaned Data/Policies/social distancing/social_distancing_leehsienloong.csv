483,"Somehow Mr. Lee, I fear that many will not necessarily follow these simple and sensible requirements. The gov has provided a safe space for us all, too safe, so much so, too many take it all for granted. We cannot and must not go the way of our neighbors and our friends even in Korea that had it all under control. Somewhere and somehow, the gov needs to address these folks that think the gov is to blame for allowing limited travel to Singapore. I understand why we need it and the reasonable risks we need to take, but I think many do not, or don't want to hear anything else, unless it aligns with what they think is the best way. We have done well. I hope and pray we will continue to do well. Stay the course and we will prevail...",2021-01-23,142
484,"One problem is smoking corner.  Smokers obviously have to remove their masks and stand close together to smoke coz it’s usually crowded.  And sometimes passing around lighters.

486,"Fatigue is setting in. Citing major upcoming events and positive case(s) detected in this group of visitors, please consider keeping meeting attendees at the Expo Hotel and meeting venue whilst piloting MICE events again. Also all entering and transferring thru Singapore should present a vaccination cert or a negative test result from approved overseas institutions. They should still be subjected to prevailing measures at all entry points. The more safeguards in place the better we can manage and protect the interests of the population.",2021-01-23,85

491,"I agree that additional measures over the Chinese New Year period is necessary to prevent further outbreaks in the community. We have seen that the new COVID19 variants from three different continents has complicated the situation in several countries a little more.  It is great that Singapore is staying on top of the pandemic with the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine, and adjusting public health measures to keep new community cases low. It is great to know that the vaccine is being provided to frontline workers and the elderly as priority. Hopefully, the vaccine is also effective against the new variants, otherwise the time, money and resources committed may be wasted.",2021-01-24,111

494,Haha be Safe while still can enjoy doing the CNY preparation,2021-01-23,11
495,Shldn't we tightened on the number of imported cases 1st instead of pushing the blame and restricting the local community. We have visitors who do not even need to be quarantine and there are already cases that are negatives when 1st tested and later tested positive. They could be the one that spreads it to our community.,2021-01-23,54
496,Please take steps as well to review condition in Mrt as there are many close contacts due to crowded trains.,2021-01-24,20
497,"Plugging the loop holes from imports  is very important and urgent  It is proven 14 days quarantine for imports may not be enough , we should increase to 21 days or more .

501,What I can say is singapore still the best!👍,2021-01-23,9
502,People should learn to shut up their mouth when commuting via bus or rail. There's not enough posters reminding people about this and it can also empower others to tell people to shut up for safety reason.,2021-01-23,36
503,Technology can help: Just 2 suggestions  We can record the auspicious words and playback on Bluetooth speakers on restaurant tables.  Or record a sound clip in our phones and play them in unison during the tossing.  Please consider. ,2021-01-23,37
504,"Thanks Premier Lee & team for the vigilant watch & new measures. Lately, most people hv become quite complacent and lax & seem to be flouting rules openly. While SG has managed to sort of control the situation, neighbouring country has shot way up the C-19 tally table. Hope our people will continue to be vigilant & take cautionary measures at all times to prevent any rise in new cases during the festive period 🙏",2021-01-23,70

510,"Good afternoon sir but a funny thing happened at Changi airport last night, we arrived from Sydney on 24jan 7.30pm but we were not tested although we have already paid for co.19 tests at Sg airlines counter over in Aust. even though we have bought tickets home, policy was no payment no boarding pass! Arrived at Changi we kept on asking about tests, was given bracelets packs at immigration, told to go home quarantine and wait for few days later for information to go and get tests, go online get refund because tests are free. Dangerous situation as well as confusion. 20 passengers arrive on Sg airlines, some transfer to other airlines, you never know who got co.19 but not showing symptoms. We will stay home for at least 2weeks ourselves be responsible persons. Wish you and family have a happy reunion dinner and happy Chinese New Year holidays.",2021-01-25,146

516,We all have been enjoying this pandemic. No addition effort nor sacrifice. The pandemic has made life better ,2021-01-23,18
517,"If we do not take this pandemic seriously, I really worry that we may see an uncontrollable spike-up in infections after CNY, much like what Ireland experienced in January when they became complacent during the Christmas holidays.  We can ill-afford another costly budget should the situation become bad again. Setting quota on the number of visits and visitors is a good start but the risks of complacency still linger. Hopefully, we all will bear in mind the severity of the consequences and watch what we do during CNY. Wear a mask when visiting except when eating or drinking; do not dig into food or snacks directly with your chopsticks or bare hands, practise social distancing when there are guests; avoid coughing, shouting or singing karaoke at home, and practise  good hygiene to keep everyone safe. I hope brochures can be handed to every household and be posted in the house to remind everyone of such measures during CNY.",2021-01-25,156

A day that we would gather with our family & relatives to strenghten the bond.  Despite the restriction, we still embrace Hari Raya with open heart & mind & celebrate within the capacity of the situation.   We baked/ bought Hari Raya goodies & cakes & cooked/ ordered Hari Raya dishes. We spring-cleaned our homes, decorate it to be raya-ready. We even put on our Baju Kurung, Baju Melayu, Baju Muslimah etc, regardless new or recycled. We still get ready, dressed up and give our best. We posed & take pictures.   Unlike previous years, we sat at our family sofa or any area in the comfort of our own home & meet our family, relatives & friends via Zoom, Google Meet or any other video-conferencing app.   We made this huge sacrifice to ensure we stay safe & able to see one another again.

1520,"*GRATITUDE*   As we prepare for and continue onwards into the lockdown, let’s say a little prayer of thanks.  I’m thankful that I have a house to lock myself in.  I’m thankful that I have food, medicines, water to drink, water to bathe in.   I’m thankful that I’m comfortable and staying in my own home, surrounded by my comforts and the people I love.  I’m thankful for electricity and WiFi, for my books and music. I’m grateful I can entertain myself.   I’m grateful I have the means to support my part time help, driver, etc., (as and where relevant) as they quarantine themselves too.  I’m thankful for the time and mental capacity to connect with my family members wherever.  I’m thankful that my family, friends and I are safe and healthy.  I pray that the daily wage labourer and anyone whose livelihood depends on daily work are supported and receive the aid they deserve.  I pray that all those away from their families and homes are well and safe.  I extend my prayers and thanks to the doctors, nurses, health practitioners, government officials, scientists and everyone else working tirelessly and at the risk to their own health to trace and treat every possible case and to do all they can to find a cure, curb the spread and eradicate the threat.  I pray that all those infected by the virus find the strength to fight and overcome it.   I pray for the atma of all those whose bodies have succumbed to the attack.  I pray that a solution is found soon and the virus disappears.   I pray we all come out of this, stronger and may we recognise, appreciate and respect everyday life.  I pray I am able to contribute in some way whatsoever, in whatever small or large way, other than following official instructions, to alleviate the sufferings of others and in supporting the efforts in any which way possible or called-upon to, to get a grip on the situation and defeat the looming threat to mankind.  May healing light of *Mother Nature* surround us all! 🙏🙏",2020-05-24,355

MOST EFFECTIVE AND SAFE DRUG TO CURE COVID 19 IN JUST THREE (3) DAYS MAY 24, 2020 PLEASE MANUFACTURE THE INGREDIENTS OR COMPONENTS OF FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION OR F.A.I. IN YOUR COUNTRY OF SINGAPORE  AND USE THIS DRUG TO CURE COVID 19 IN JUST THREE (3) DAYS!!! NOBODY WILL DIE IN SINGAPORE DUE TO COVID 19 IF SINGAPORE WILL USE FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION (FAI) TO CURE PEOPLE WITH COVID 19. THE COMPONENTS OR INGREDIENTS OF THIS F.A.I. DRUG ARE WRITTEN AND INDICATED IN THESE THREE (3) WEBSITES AND SINGAPORE CAN MANUFACTURE THE INGREDIENTS OR COMPONENTS OF THIS DRUG FOR COVID 19: 1. https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Aj85f-XIISPoJ%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Flibres.uncg.edu%2Fir%2Funcg%2Ff%2FElbourakadi_uncg_0154D_10788.pdf+&cd=2&hl=fil&ct=clnk&gl=ph 2. https://patents.google.com/patent/US6172053B1/en 3. https://patents.google.com/patent/US5492901A/en We must NOT stop at just testing if a person is positive for Covid 19 or not. We must provide all people the fastest and cheapest way to get rid, totally and completely, of the viruses inside his/her body in just three (3) days. Dr. El Bourakadi conducted this study about Fabunan Antiviral Injection (FAI) under the direction of the so-called ""Rock Star and Grandfather of All Drug Designers in the World"" - Dr. Ethan Will Taylor. This Fabunan Anti-viral Injection is the only true drug for Covid 19. In this study, which used the most advanced facilities, equipment, methods and techniques of the University of North Carolina in Greensboro or UNCG (""the drug research and development capital of the world""), it has been established that FAI not only inhibits the growth of virus-infected cells but KILLS virus-infected cells through ""Apoptosis."" It has likewise been established in this study that only FAI can KILL the drug-resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus. According to the Nobel-prize winning scientist who discovered and identified the HIV AIDS virus, Dr. Luc Montagnier,the Covid 19 virus is very similar to the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus. (Interviewed on the CNews channel in France, Montagnier asserted that the Covid 19 virus had been designed by molecular biologists, stating that it contains genetic elements of HIV, and that its characteristics could not have arisen naturally. Montagnier said that ""he didn’t know who had done it, or why, ""but suggested that possibly the goal had been to make an AIDS vaccine."") This is why no drug and no vaccine on earth can deal effectively with the Covid 19 virus just as no drug and no vaccine on earth can deal effectively with the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus EXCEPT FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION ONLY. As per the study of the UNCG on Fabunan Anti-viral Injection or F.A.I., only F.A.I. can KILL (not just inhibit the growth of) the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus. Therefore, if the Covid 19 virus is very similar to the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus, and only F.A.I. can kill, through Apoptosis, these drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus (as per UNCG study), then only F.A.I. can kill the thousands upon thousands of strains of the Covid 19 virus. This study of the UNC in Greensboro or UNCG (""the drug research and development capital of the world"") also shows without a doubt that Fabunan Anti-Viral Injection or F.A.I. attacks and KILLS only virus-infected cells and does NOT attack nor kill the GOOD cells of the body, through a mechanism called by scientists as ""selective toxicity"" or ""seltox."" This means that F.A.I. is safe for use even in INFANTS with Covid 19 as F.A.I. has indeed already been used to treat (in just 3 days) the Dengue of a nine months old patient without any side effect to the baby (see Note A hereunder)! What has the ""Rock Star and Grandfather of All Drug Designers in the World"" - Dr. Ethan Will Taylor - has to say about Fabunan Anti-viral Injection? Dr. Ethan Will Taylor, PhD, Principal HIV/AIDS investigator at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, stated “currently there is only one drug combination in the universe that we are aware of that possesses this rare pharmacologic activity and Fil-Am Tech., Inc. holds the patent on that combination.” ELBOURAKADI, NAJOUA, Ph.D. A Novel Method For The Selective Elimination Of HIV Infected Cells: Dexamethasone And Procaine As A C ELBOURAKADI, NAJOUA, Ph.D. A Novel Method For The Selective Elimination ... Note A -- Case Number 2; Dengue Fever K. P., nine months old, a female, infant child, from San Marcelino, Zambales, Philippines was accompanied by her mother for consultation at the Fabunan Medical Clinic on Sep. 22, 1996 due to intermittent fever (T=38° C.), with skin rashes, itchiness, and loss of appetite. Tourniquet test was positive with presence of petechial hemorrhage indicative of dengue fever. The patient was treated with intramuscular injections containing 15 mg procaine hydrochloride (0.75 ml of a 20 mg per ml solution) combined with 1 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (0.25 ml of a 4 mg per ml solution) (Denguevir-Fabunan Injection, child dosage) to make a total volume of 1 ml of injectable solution administered twice daily at more than a two hour interval for three days and coupled with supplemental oral rehydration solution. The patient had an improved appetite, all other signs and symptoms gradually disappeared and on the third day as an outpatient, the patient was discharged from the clinic fully recovered. Before going to the websites below, please first download and read from cover to cover the scientific study of the University of North Carolina in Greensboro (UNCG) about Fabunan Anti-viral Injection (FAI) in which Dr. Fabunan did not spend a single centavo because it is the UNCG which took care of ALL the expenses in the said scientific study conducted by the UNCG using UNCG's top-of-the-line facilities, equipment, methods, techniques, and the best scientists that UNCG has in its roster of drug researchers and developers. It is important to note that if you are a drug company and want your drug to be studied at the UNCG, you have to pay millions, if not billions, of US dollars before UNCG will accept your request. But for FAI of Dr. Fabunan, the UNCG took care of ALL the expenses.

2760,"Happy Vesak Day! 🌈Vesak Day is a significant day in the local Buddhist calendar.  🙏Let’s commemorate Vesak Day today by reaffirming our vow as Buddhists to strive for the peace and happiness in our world, our lives and that of others just before his passing, Shakyamuni Buddha urged his disciples to regard his teachings as their teacher because only the truth,the Law of life, is eternal . 💁‍♀️  He stressed that the way to pay homage to him was not merely by offering flowers, incense, and lights, but by truly and sincerely striving to follow his teachings. 🙏  The Essence of Shakyamuni’s teachings is contained in his highest teaching, the Lotus Sutra, which states that Buddhahood , a condition of absolute happiness and freedom from all fear and illusions, is inherent in all life, and is eternal.  👉This means that “ the Buddha” is nothing other than an ordinary person who is aware of this state in his or her life. The development of this inner life state can enable all people to overcome their problem and live a fulfilled and active life, engaging fully with others and society. ✨After Shakyamuni’s death, Buddhism spread in two main forms, the Theravada and the Mahayana. The sutras were translated into different languages and teachings were adopted and merged into different cultures in Asia- the origin of the great variety and diversity of the Buddhist teachings that exist today. 🙏  Great Buddhist Teachers like. T’ien-t’ai and Chang-an confirmed the Lotus Sutra as the greatest of the Buddha’s teachings, because of its teaching that everyone can manifest the Buddha state in their lives. Buddhism later reached Japan in many different schools. 🙏  Nichiren Daishonin after years of research, because convinced that the key to transforming people’s suffering and enabling society to flourish lay in the Lotus Sutra, and particularly its title,  Myoho Renge kyo. He declared that the correct Buddhist practice in this age is to chant Nam Myoho Renge kyo, which enables everyone to manifest one’s innate Buddhahood, gaining life force and wisdom to challenge any adverse circumstances, attaining enlightenment and true happiness throughout their lives.  🇷🇴 💙💛❤️The spirit is expressed in the objective of the SGI, as explained by President Ikeda states: “ Our goals is become happy not only ourselves, but to enable others to become happy as well. It is to bring harmony to local communities and to help our nations flourish and bring peace to the whole world. The lives of those who pray and work to achieve these goals pulse with faith dedicated to realising kosenrufu .”  🇷🇴As we commemorate Vesak Day today, let us reaffirm this spirit and the conviction that the practical philosophy of Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism teaches individual empowerment and inner transformation, which at the same time contribute to global peace.",2020-05-08,463

3012,"There is hope with US$8b [initiated by French prexy Macron] pledged by many countries and rich individuals to find a vaccine soon.   Trump is out on his own.   Sad, the UN and the WHO have no ability to unite humankind to bring the best scientific brains under one roof to find a medical cure, vaccine and a reliable and efficient COVID-19 test kit soon.   Time is the essence.   The world will lose even more when many companies, economy, and countries go bust.   Hundreds and thousands of billions would be wiped off compared to the US$8b.
