257,483,"Somehow Mr. Lee, I fear that many will not necessarily follow these simple and sensible requirements. The gov has provided a safe space for us all, too safe, so much so, too many take it all for granted. We cannot and must not go the way of our neighbors and our friends even in Korea that had it all under control. Somewhere and somehow, the gov needs to address these folks that think the gov is to blame for allowing limited travel to Singapore. I understand why we need it and the reasonable risks we need to take, but I think many do not, or don't want to hear anything else, unless it aligns with what they think is the best way. We have done well. I hope and pray we will continue to do well. Stay the course and we will prevail...",2021-01-23,142

265,491,"I agree that additional measures over the Chinese New Year period is necessary to prevent further outbreaks in the community. We have seen that the new COVID19 variants from three different continents has complicated the situation in several countries a little more.  It is great that Singapore is staying on top of the pandemic with the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine, and adjusting public health measures to keep new community cases low. It is great to know that the vaccine is being provided to frontline workers and the elderly as priority. Hopefully, the vaccine is also effective against the new variants, otherwise the time, money and resources committed may be wasted.",2021-01-24,111

Arrived at Changi we kept on asking about tests, was given bracelets packs at immigration, told to go home quarantine and wait for few days later for information to go and get tests, go online get refund because tests are free. Dangerous situation as well as confusion. 20 passengers arrive on Sg airlines, some transfer to other airlines, you never know who got co.19 but not showing symptoms.

290,517,"If we do not take this pandemic seriously, I really worry that we may see an uncontrollable spike-up in infections after CNY, much like what Ireland experienced in January when they became complacent during the Christmas holidays.  We can ill-afford another costly budget should the situation become bad again. Setting quota on the number of visits and visitors is a good start but the risks of complacency still linger. Hopefully, we all will bear in mind the severity of the consequences and watch what we do during CNY. Wear a mask when visiting except when eating or drinking; do not dig into food or snacks directly with your chopsticks or bare hands, practise social distancing when there are guests; avoid coughing, shouting or singing karaoke at home, and practise  good hygiene to keep everyone safe. I hope brochures can be handed to every household and be posted in the house to remind everyone of such measures during CNY.",2021-01-25,156

I cannot for the life of me understand how we can continue to allow short term visits from some of the most afflicted countries in the region - does the committee/MOH really have confidence in the veracity of the tests dun in places where things can b ""bought""?  It is also shocking that the committee did not make it a requirement for all the visitors to b financially able shld they need medical attention here - such as the purchase of insurance. Is $30k enuff ? - until recently.  Who foots the bill for folks who can't pay up???  Both quarantine at hotel as well as hospital stay??  Truly amazing these things cld b overlooked!

We baked/ bought Hari Raya goodies & cakes & cooked/ ordered Hari Raya dishes. We spring-cleaned our homes, decorate it to be raya-ready. We even put on our Baju Kurung, Baju Melayu, Baju Muslimah etc, regardless new or recycled. We still get ready, dressed up and give our best. We posed & take pictures.   Unlike previous years, we sat at our family sofa or any area in the comfort of our own home & meet our family, relatives & friends via Zoom, Google Meet or any other video-conferencing app.   We made this huge sacrifice to ensure we stay safe & able to see one another again.

957,1520,"*GRATITUDE*   As we prepare for and continue onwards into the lockdown, let’s say a little prayer of thanks.  I’m thankful that I have a house to lock myself in.  I’m thankful that I have food, medicines, water to drink, water to bathe in.   I’m thankful that I’m comfortable and staying in my own home, surrounded by my comforts and the people I love.  I’m thankful for electricity and WiFi, for my books and music. I’m grateful I can entertain myself.   I’m grateful I have the means to support my part time help, driver, etc., (as and where relevant) as they quarantine themselves too.  I’m thankful for the time and mental capacity to connect with my family members wherever.  I’m thankful that my family, friends and I are safe and healthy.  I pray that the daily wage labourer and anyone whose livelihood depends on daily work are supported and receive the aid they deserve.  I pray that all those away from their families and homes are well and safe.  I extend my prayers and thanks to the doctors, nurses, health practitioners, government officials, scientists and everyone else working tirelessly and at the risk to their own health to trace and treat every possible case and to do all they can to find a cure, curb the spread and eradicate the threat.  I pray that all those infected by the virus find the strength to fight and overcome it.   I pray for the atma of all those whose bodies have succumbed to the attack.  I pray that a solution is found soon and the virus disappears.   I pray we all come out of this, stronger and may we recognise, appreciate and respect everyday life.  I pray I am able to contribute in some way whatsoever, in whatever small or large way, other than following official instructions, to alleviate the sufferings of others and in supporting the efforts in any which way possible or called-upon to, to get a grip on the situation and defeat the looming threat to mankind.  May healing light of *Mother Nature* surround us all! 🙏🙏",2020-05-24,355

MOST EFFECTIVE AND SAFE DRUG TO CURE COVID 19 IN JUST THREE (3) DAYS MAY 24, 2020 PLEASE MANUFACTURE THE INGREDIENTS OR COMPONENTS OF FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION OR F.A.I. IN YOUR COUNTRY OF SINGAPORE  AND USE THIS DRUG TO CURE COVID 19 IN JUST THREE (3) DAYS!!! NOBODY WILL DIE IN SINGAPORE DUE TO COVID 19 IF SINGAPORE WILL USE FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION (FAI) TO CURE PEOPLE WITH COVID 19. THE COMPONENTS OR INGREDIENTS OF THIS F.A.I. DRUG ARE WRITTEN AND INDICATED IN THESE THREE (3) WEBSITES AND SINGAPORE CAN MANUFACTURE THE INGREDIENTS OR COMPONENTS OF THIS DRUG FOR COVID 19: 1. https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Aj85f-XIISPoJ%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Flibres.uncg.edu%2Fir%2Funcg%2Ff%2FElbourakadi_uncg_0154D_10788.pdf+&cd=2&hl=fil&ct=clnk&gl=ph 2. https://patents.google.com/patent/US6172053B1/en 3. https://patents.google.com/patent/US5492901A/en We must NOT stop at just testing if a person is positive for Covid 19 or not. We must provide all people the fastest and cheapest way to get rid, totally and completely, of the viruses inside his/her body in just three (3) days. Dr. El Bourakadi conducted this study about Fabunan Antiviral Injection (FAI) under the direction of the so-called ""Rock Star and Grandfather of All Drug Designers in the World"" - Dr. Ethan Will Taylor. This Fabunan Anti-viral Injection is the only true drug for Covid 19. In this study, which used the most advanced facilities, equipment, methods and techniques of the University of North Carolina in Greensboro or UNCG (""the drug research and development capital of the world""), it has been established that FAI not only inhibits the growth of virus-infected cells but KILLS virus-infected cells through ""Apoptosis."" It has likewise been established in this study that only FAI can KILL the drug-resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus. According to the Nobel-prize winning scientist who discovered and identified the HIV AIDS virus, Dr. Luc Montagnier,the Covid 19 virus is very similar to the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus. (Interviewed on the CNews channel in France, Montagnier asserted that the Covid 19 virus had been designed by molecular biologists, stating that it contains genetic elements of HIV, and that its characteristics could not have arisen naturally. Montagnier said that ""he didn’t know who had done it, or why, ""but suggested that possibly the goal had been to make an AIDS vaccine."") This is why no drug and no vaccine on earth can deal effectively with the Covid 19 virus just as no drug and no vaccine on earth can deal effectively with the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus EXCEPT FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION ONLY. As per the study of the UNCG on Fabunan Anti-viral Injection or F.A.I., only F.A.I. can KILL (not just inhibit the growth of) the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus. Therefore, if the Covid 19 virus is very similar to the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus, and only F.A.I. can kill, through Apoptosis, these drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus (as per UNCG study), then only F.A.I. can kill the thousands upon thousands of strains of the Covid 19 virus. This study of the UNC in Greensboro or UNCG (""the drug research and development capital of the world"") also shows without a doubt that Fabunan Anti-Viral Injection or F.A.I. attacks and KILLS only virus-infected cells and does NOT attack nor kill the GOOD cells of the body, through a mechanism called by scientists as ""selective toxicity"" or ""seltox."" This means that F.A.I. is safe for use even in INFANTS with Covid 19 as F.A.I. has indeed already been used to treat (in just 3 days) the Dengue of a nine months old patient without any side effect to the baby (see Note A hereunder)! What has the ""Rock Star and Grandfather of All Drug Designers in the World"" - Dr. Ethan Will Taylor - has to say about Fabunan Anti-viral Injection? Dr. Ethan Will Taylor, PhD, Principal HIV/AIDS investigator at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, stated “currently there is only one drug combination in the universe that we are aware of that possesses this rare pharmacologic activity and Fil-Am Tech., Inc. holds the patent on that combination.” ELBOURAKADI, NAJOUA, Ph.D. A Novel Method For The Selective Elimination Of HIV Infected Cells: Dexamethasone And Procaine As A C ELBOURAKADI, NAJOUA, Ph.D. A Novel Method For The Selective Elimination ... Note A -- Case Number 2; Dengue Fever K. P., nine months old, a female, infant child, from San Marcelino, Zambales, Philippines was accompanied by her mother for consultation at the Fabunan Medical Clinic on Sep. 22, 1996 due to intermittent fever (T=38° C.), with skin rashes, itchiness, and loss of appetite. Tourniquet test was positive with presence of petechial hemorrhage indicative of dengue fever. The patient was treated with intramuscular injections containing 15 mg procaine hydrochloride (0.75 ml of a 20 mg per ml solution) combined with 1 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (0.25 ml of a 4 mg per ml solution) (Denguevir-Fabunan Injection, child dosage) to make a total volume of 1 ml of injectable solution administered twice daily at more than a two hour interval for three days and coupled with supplemental oral rehydration solution. The patient had an improved appetite, all other signs and symptoms gradually disappeared and on the third day as an outpatient, the patient was discharged from the clinic fully recovered. Before going to the websites below, please first download and read from cover to cover the scientific study of the University of North Carolina in Greensboro (UNCG) about Fabunan Anti-viral Injection (FAI) in which Dr. Fabunan did not spend a single centavo because it is the UNCG which took care of ALL the expenses in the said scientific study conducted by the UNCG using UNCG's top-of-the-line facilities, equipment, methods, techniques, and the best scientists that UNCG has in its roster of drug researchers and developers. It is important to note that if you are a drug company and want your drug to be studied at the UNCG, you have to pay millions, if not billions, of US dollars before UNCG will accept your request. But for FAI of Dr. Fabunan, the UNCG took care of ALL the expenses.

1638,2760,"Happy Vesak Day! 🌈Vesak Day is a significant day in the local Buddhist calendar.  🙏Let’s commemorate Vesak Day today by reaffirming our vow as Buddhists to strive for the peace and happiness in our world, our lives and that of others just before his passing, Shakyamuni Buddha urged his disciples to regard his teachings as their teacher because only the truth,the Law of life, is eternal . 💁‍♀️  He stressed that the way to pay homage to him was not merely by offering flowers, incense, and lights, but by truly and sincerely striving to follow his teachings. 🙏  The Essence of Shakyamuni’s teachings is contained in his highest teaching, the Lotus Sutra, which states that Buddhahood , a condition of absolute happiness and freedom from all fear and illusions, is inherent in all life, and is eternal.  👉This means that “ the Buddha” is nothing other than an ordinary person who is aware of this state in his or her life. The development of this inner life state can enable all people to overcome their problem and live a fulfilled and active life, engaging fully with others and society. ✨After Shakyamuni’s death, Buddhism spread in two main forms, the Theravada and the Mahayana. The sutras were translated into different languages and teachings were adopted and merged into different cultures in Asia- the origin of the great variety and diversity of the Buddhist teachings that exist today. 🙏  Great Buddhist Teachers like. T’ien-t’ai and Chang-an confirmed the Lotus Sutra as the greatest of the Buddha’s teachings, because of its teaching that everyone can manifest the Buddha state in their lives. Buddhism later reached Japan in many different schools. 🙏  Nichiren Daishonin after years of research, because convinced that the key to transforming people’s suffering and enabling society to flourish lay in the Lotus Sutra, and particularly its title,  Myoho Renge kyo. He declared that the correct Buddhist practice in this age is to chant Nam Myoho Renge kyo, which enables everyone to manifest one’s innate Buddhahood, gaining life force and wisdom to challenge any adverse circumstances, attaining enlightenment and true happiness throughout their lives.  🇷🇴 💙💛❤️The spirit is expressed in the objective of the SGI, as explained by President Ikeda states: “ Our goals is become happy not only ourselves, but to enable others to become happy as well. It is to bring harmony to local communities and to help our nations flourish and bring peace to the whole world. The lives of those who pray and work to achieve these goals pulse with faith dedicated to realising kosenrufu .”  🇷🇴As we commemorate Vesak Day today, let us reaffirm this spirit and the conviction that the practical philosophy of Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism teaches individual empowerment and inner transformation, which at the same time contribute to global peace.",2020-05-08,463

It may be a measure tough for centers to adhere. May i suggest that this measure be either adjusted from 2yo to 5yo or 7yo. Then it’s either all kindergartens kids to wear or not to wear mask. This will also help centers from encountering issues where some parents arguing abt age for kids whose birthdays are around end of year.",2020-09-23,108

However I feel we are having a missed opportunity here in curbing the number of imported cases. Although , the number of imported cases have steadily dropped, there is still a few cases Everyday . At the moment , we must drill that mindset that even one case is one too many.   Thus , I had hoped the recently announced circuit breaker measures would have included a semi closure of air travel into Singapore for a period of time. We could have used this measure to stop the number of imported cases to zero , so that we could fully concentrate on bringing the number of local infections down.   I do hope the officials will consider also suspending all passenger arrivals and departures for this one month and to only allow cargo flights to operate. This timeframe would help our medical resources to fully concentrate on all local cases. ",2020-04-03,166

1817,88,"FOREIGN VIRUS HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO SPREAD FROM AIRPORTS TO CITIES, TO HOMES !  HEALTH MINISTER HAS MESSED IT UP !  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-pm-lee-urges-returning-travellers-to-stay-home-isolate-12575938  LET ME REVEAL THE MEANING OF QUARANTINE !  EXAMPLE: IMAGINE YOU GO TO A COUNTRY WHICH IS BRANDED AS A PLACE FOR YELLOW FEVER PANDEMIC.  AFTER THAT, SAY, YOU GO TO VENICE.  YOU CANNOT ENTER THE NEXT COUNTRY AND WILL BE PUT IN A ""QUARANTINE ISOLATION"" OUTSIDE THAT COUNTRY.  ONLY AFTER THE INCUBATION PERIOD IS OVER, THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WILL CHECK EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE QUARANTINED.  ONLY THEN ARE YOU ALLOWED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY.  WE IN SINGAPORE BROUGHT IN THE CORONAVIRUS VIA AIRPORTS, CHECKPOINTS, PORTS, ETC..  SINGAPORE DID NOT CARE ABOUT ACCEPTED QUARANTINE PROCEDURES !  SINGAPORE ALLOWED ALL PASSENGERS TO DISEMBARK AND GO TO THEIR HOMES !  WHAT IS ALL THIS ?  ONLY PEOPLE WITH FEVER WERE DETAINED FOR QUARANTINE.  HULLO HEALTH MINISTER, STOP YOUR BULLSHIT AND DO YOUR JOB PROPERLY !  FLU VACCINATION WHICH HEALTH MINISTERS LOVE (KOSHER EVIL PHARMA DONATIONS) IMPOSED ON BABIES IS USELESS; AS FLU VIRUSES MUTATE EVERY SEASON.  A VIRUS IS REPLICATED ONLY INSIDE THE LIVING CELLS OF AN ORGANISM.  VIRUSES CAN INFECT ALL TYPES OF LIFE FORMS, INCLUDING BACTERIA.  THERE ARE MILLIONS OF TYPES OF VIRUSES IN THE ENVIRONMENT.  HUMAN BODY CAN PROVIDE IMMUNITY UNLESS THESE VIRUSES ARE CULTURED IN THE LAB ON A PERTI DISH BY HUMANS.  CORONAVIRUSES ARE SIMILAR TO INFLUENZA VIRUSES IN THAT THEY BOTH CONTAIN SINGLE STRANDS OF RNA.  CORONAVIRUS (SARS-COV-2) WAS DETECTABLE IN AEROSOLS FOR UP TO THREE HOURS, UP TO FOUR HOURS ON COPPER.  IT SHOWS THAT COVID-19 IS MAN MADE FOR BIOLOGICAL WARFARE.  COVID-19 PANDEMIC DEMANDS THAT ALL AC AIR DUCTS (CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONING) MUST HAVE SPECIAL AIR DUCT FILTERS WHICH MUST HAVE A PLANNED MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE, RECORDED BY VIDEO.  MAINTENANCE OF SYSTEMS AND FILTRATION HAS AN IMPACT ON HOW CONTAMINANTS FLOW THROUGH THE AIR, SO BUILDINGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PROPERLY SERVICED TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE CIRCULATION, FILTRATION, HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER AMOUNTS OF MICROORGANISMS MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEMS.  THIS EXPLAINS WHY NEW YORK IS AN EPICENTER FOR COVID-19.  THE ONLY WAY VIRUSES GROW ARE WITHIN BODIES, WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO BRING THE GERMS INTO YOUR BODY; OFTEN VIA TOUCHING YOUR FACE, IN ORDER TO GET SICK.  WE ASK HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO INSPECT ALL OFFICERS OF LARGE COMPANIES...  CHECK IF DIRECT SUNLIGHT (NOT FILTERED THROUGH GLASS) IS PROVIDED TO THE EMPLOYEES AT THEIR DESKS.  IN WUHAN THERE ARE MANY CHINESE DOCTORS WHO HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS.  ASYMPTOMATIC CASES REMAIN UNDIAGNOSED AND THEREFORE UNQUARANTINED.  WE STILL DON'T HAVE SERUM TESTS TO TEST SUCH SLEEPER PASSIVE CARRIERS.  UNDETECTED, ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS COULD CREATE FRESH TRANSMISSION ROUTES ONCE LOCKDOWNS ARE EASED.  WE ARE IN FOR A LONG HAUL !  DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP OUTBREAK SHOWED THAT 35 OF THE 104 INFECTED PASSENGERS REMAINED ASYMPTOMATIC EVEN AFTER AN AVERAGE OF 10 DAYS OF OBSERVATION AT THE SELF-DEFENCE FORCES CENTRAL HOSPITAL IN JAPAN.  ON MARCH 23 2020, THE HEALTH MINISTRY IN THE SOUTHWESTERN CHINESE CITY OF CHONGQING, SAID 18% OF PATIENTS WERE ASYMPTOMATIC.  EXISTENCE OF PRE-ASYMPTOMATIC (ASYMPTOMATIC) PATIENTS MEANT THAT SCREENING PROCEDURES AT AIRPORTS AND OTHER POINTS OF ENTRY WERE INSUFFICIENT TO PREVENT THE CORONAVIRUS FROM SPREADING.  THIS IS WHY THERE MUST BE ESTABLISHED QUARANTINE PROCEDURES AT AIRPORTS, CHECKPOINTS, PORTS, ETC., FROM WHICH COVID-19 GAVE ENTRY.  JUST ONE TWO SECOND TEMPERATURE CHECK IS NOT ENOUGH !  CHILDREN WHO EAT GOOD ORGANIC FOOD ARE LESS SICK FROM COVID-19, BUT MAY STILL SPREAD THE CORONAVIRUS.  THIS CHILD CAN SPREAD THE DISEASE TO A MALNOURISHED FEEBLE CLASSMATE.  CHILDREN WORLDWIDE RARELY HAVE SEVERE SYMPTOMS WHEN INFECTED BY COVID-19.  TRUE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS IN U.S.A. (MANY WITH MILD OR NO SYMPTOMS) IS FAR HIGHER THAN ESTABLISHED.  AGAIN, AN ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIER (HEALTHY CARRIER OR JUST CARRIER) IS A PERSON OR OTHER ORGANISM THAT HAS BECOME INFECTED WITH A PATHOGEN, BUT THAT DISPLAYS NO SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS.  ALTHOUGH UNAFFECTED BY THE PATHOGEN, CARRIERS CAN TRANSMIT IT TO OTHERS, HOW CERTAIN PATHOGENS CAN REMAIN DORMANT IN A HUMAN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.  A COMMON PRINCIPLE IN EPIDEMIOLOGY, THE 80–20 RULE, SPECULATES THAT 80% OF THE DISEASE TRANSMISSION IS CONDUCTED BY ONLY 20% OF PEOPLE IN A POPULATION.  WE WATCH !",2020-04-03,679

If they do not have a lot and yet employers do not offer alternatives except that they either no pay, how are you going to advise them then? Will there be any mandate or rules for employers too on this matter?  I feel that the new rule on medical leave is going to back fire as many will no longer go and see the doctor for slight symptoms and wait until their symptoms get serious then they go see doctor. Now people may go see doctor if the symptoms are slight since mc will not be enforced, but if mc are to be enforced, there will be more people who will not see doctor for slight symptoms anymore due to the fact that many do not want to loose their jobs during this difficult times.  No point telling us about the resilience budget cos covid-19 is not going to go away anytime soon. It may run longer than SARS and people need to put food on the table too.  If you are going to enforce anything, please enforce in full cycle and not halfway, enforce at employees' end and yet not enforcing it on the employers' end.  PS: Doctors now give MCs as if it is free, as long as you cough a little, running nose a little, also give 5 days MC. Then ask you to see them again and again. 5 days MC given consequently without any other remedy like sending to hospital for test or anything. Just keep giving people 5 days MC again and again.

Regarding the chaos of the world, rebellion will occur. Therefore, a country with talents will prosper, and a country without talents will decline. How do you know this is the case? Those who are also exaggerated and act in real action will not be able to realize their ideals after all. This is the inevitable end of those who love fame and exaggeration, but do not govern the country and love the people.  Didnâ€™t it say in the Book of Changes, â€˜Iâ€™m in a high position without the corresponding virtues and talents? 'So those who donâ€™t do practical work and like to deceive and advertise their reputations will become weaker and weaker. Those who do not have morals but pray for happiness will inevitably end up in poverty and embarrassment. Those who have no credit but enjoy their salary will inevitably suffer Insult and suffer disaster.  Since there is today, why did you do this? There is no international law, really deserved, these are known to be self-inflicted. A must watch! Wuhan chemical Covid-19 virus in china is the root of all heartache.

Perhaps Singapore could consider similar measures, that would minimise the risk of imported cases leading to subsequent local transmission, and sabotaging our local containment/mitigation efforts?  Also, can Singapore create a mobile app where people can opt-in to allow precise-tracking of their movements? This would allow efficient contact-tracing and quarantining of at-risk individuals. Hopefully everyone will opt-in (unless we want to make it mandatory). Also provide in the app a function for recording of key details like times/dates of onset of various symptoms.  In recent days, unlinked cases have been emerging consistently. Perhaps with better contact-tracing enhanced by technology, we'd be able to eliminate the virus from local circulation, and swiftly contain any outbreak caused by imported cases too.  This way, we can increase the likelihood that we will never come to a point where we would need to step-up social-distancing to catch-up with a runaway outbreak that we failed to prevent.",2020-03-11,156
