493,As a normally frequent business visitor to SG I praise the response of your government. But like all economies there has to be a time to open up but with sensible precautions. I am visiting Dubai in November from the UK and it is their approach which is an example on how travel can be handled. I have to provide a negative Covid test certificate taken within 96 hours of flying but can go about my business when I arrive in Dubai without quarantine. When leaving I have to once again provide a negative test before getting on the plane. Is Singapore considering similar approaches to business travellers? ,2020-10-06,107

516,"Moving forward, after 2020 ends, I would want to know what is in store for PMETs and the SEPs or even the public in general when it comes to training. In this everchanging business climate, It's time for the government to change the same old approach of subsidizing courses only when the attendee passes a test. I want to attend higher level courses at subsidised rates with just a certificate of attendance so that I can receive quality training with little stress. The old mindset of subsidies only when I pass the test is a hindrance. It takes the joy out of learning. Having training allowance is a bonus, not a must. Not everyone is yao gui. There are individuals looking for upgrading of skills and knowledge who are, however, not exam savvy. Don't just do the paper chase. Do the skills chase. Be relevant to our needs.",2020-10-09,145

Instead  I would like to suggest that they be allowed to use debit cards like the Kopitiam Card or Passion Card. All they have to do is TAP on machines located at hawker stalls & be given a receipt.

If no major spike in infection, then let’s move to 35-40 for next 3 weeks and so on (same condition - shud not stay with elderlies). This probably will help in opening up the economy faster .. also in case anyone in that age group falls sick he may not require serious medical attention, hence less burden on the medical system. May be this approach can help open up. I understand compliance is an issue, but we can use the trace app to check and monitor.  We can release the rest of the population once we have confidence that others outside do not have infection.   Just sharing a thought for your kind consideration. ",2020-05-28,139

1477,"Dear Sir,   First of all, thank you for approving the Fortitude Budget. It must have been a really tough decision to make as it cuts deep into our GDP.   I too have lost my job in the digital banking sector as a MarTech Digital Analytics & Data Science specialist Singaporean. I am highly skilled.   During CB period, I’m taking global cyber security certification right now utilising my skillsfuture TOP up credit of $500. Thank you 🙏 😊 for that.   In fact, I was abruptly & unlawfully laid off by foreign talent senior managers/MDs in our own local Banks. I was new to the bank, last in, first out situation. Unfortunate or unlucky. Culture eats our livelihood for lunch!   However, we do need to cut back on our generosity and to stop giving our meals away now.   We need to stop 🛑 ✋ using globalisation as an excuse for massive FT hires with no proper screening of their competency for the roles offered in our country. MOM & SIR needs to step up on credentials validation.   Many of whom are employed with fake tech certifications laundered and layered into our workforce.   Is there a way of which we could measure the per capita income or success metric per Singaporean with these funds at a -20% deficit of our gross GDP?   As a Singaporean, it is immensely painful to have to dig deep into our reserves of which we’ve saved since our independence. My grandparents worked hard for these savings.    Earnestly, I hope these funds would really go into supporting jobs for Singaporeans as oppose to FTs who are over supplied in our current market’s macro economic situation.   With an over supply of FTs all vying for the same buffet of jobs in the Tech, AI, Data Science, Digital Banking, Analytics, Customer Experience, Agile Workflow...etc the list go on, Digital Transformation at scale type of jobs.  In comparison to FTs, Singaporeans are actually more well skilled, well travelled, well equipped as compared to many other FTs from neighbouring countries.   I do not believe the average graduate from our local universities would lack lustre in competencies as compared to those in other countries.   In fact, Singapore has TOP talents due to our education system as compared to the rest of the world.   When we create digital transformation jobs, we need to Ensure it is a Singaporean being offered the job.  I’ve personally witnessed Singaporean CVs being rejected as the senior MD or hiring managers are all from South Asia.   Is globalisation really doing Singaporeans justice in this economy or do we Singaporeans will have to resort to working overseas as FTs too and thus causing talent brain drain in our own homeland.   Yes we should and we must be inclusive in our society.   However, it must not come at the expanse of a Singaporean’s reason for being in this country, and contribution in many ways to this country of which we call,  home truly.   We really need to step up in protecting Singaporean jobs, both young and old. Constant offshoring and outsourcing of technology jobs to South Asia, isn’t growing our economy but other’s.   Many local employers cite Singaporeans being too expensive to hire.   However, FTs are even more expensive than Singaporeans with condo housing and car allowances in their total package, doing the same job function.   So why not hire a Singaporean as opposed to an entire Dept of FTs? Why isn’t the quota strictly adhered to?   I hope the Govt will look into each sector, industry and regulate the influx of FTs for the survival of our future economy, during and post covid.  Sincerely, I hope we can emerge stronger as a people and a nation of Singapore 🇸🇬 after this ordeal. #sgunited   Thank you Sir 🙏 😊 ",2020-05-26,624

It certainly has to seek funds from every member country to face the challenges of a pandemic. The current pandemic is worst than we could ever think of. It requires sincere effort from all nations. However, such a situation is difficult because some political  and religious leaders have their own ideals and differences. Some countries lack the resources and expertise which could make covid 19 an even bigger threat . Social behavior and mindset plays a crucial role in combating the situation. Covid 19 has crippled the world’s economies and has claimed the lives and livelihoods of many across the globe. Wonderful that Singapore is playing our part by pledging US $500,000 in response to an appeal by WHO. Personally, I feel that it is for a worthy cause , not only for us but for the rest of the world as well.

This way, not only majority of the students will be away from the big crowd (since many parents either work from home or are stay-at-home parents), those whose kids needs to be in school will also feel safer with their kids being exposed to a smaller crowd. The teachers too won't be double-loaded with having to prepare materials for both physical and online learning (for those on loa) and they themselves won't be exposed to a big crowd too.  Please take a look at the kids at the bus stops, car waiting area, buses, trains etc. They are jammed packed!  Once they have come into contact with so many, and someone were to sneeze, it doesn't matter if the rest of the day they are sitting a mile from the rest.

I have heard people complaining about the high salaries of our Ministers.   A good worker is worthy of his hire. Why begrudge them of their salaries?   They work very hard behind the scenes. Their hair turns white very fast. To accuse them of receiving high salaries and not doing anything much is most erroneous.  There is no perfect government in this world. Ours is already the best that one can get.   We who live here in Singapore are very blessed people. Recognise this fact and you will be a happier person.

2321,"Dear Mr Lee, during my trip in BKK in year 2018, when I visited the foodcourt in Terminal 21, there is a cutlery station inside the foodcourt where one can sterilize their cutleries before they take their meals... wonder would it be a good idea to adopt this practice in all the foodcourts/eating places in Singapore? Probably MOH or relevant authority can look into this or implement this in all Foodcourts across S’pore. Especially, during this period of Co-VID19 - people who dines outside are very careful ... I saw them using disposable cutleries instead. See pic taken in Pier 21 BKK ... a pot of slow-cooker with hot boiling water for dipping. 😊",2020-02-20,107

The cause and effect , Human quarantine Human in home cages worried abt CoronaVirus pandemic spreads across China. This is Chinese KARMA teachings !!   Find this article rather insightful-😷👍  “The hustle and bustle of China has finally halted , the restless society has calmed, and the busy Chinese people gradually nested down.  “The wild animals that were once cage by humans finally managed to keep humans in ""cages"".  “Humans now have  lowered their proud head and began to think quietly: Are we still the king of the earth?    “Mankind has come head to head with the power of nature once again.  “Facing the threat of death, human beings have begun to reflect seriously, only to realize that a lack of awe-inspiring social truths will lead to more harm and more risks.  “The greedy heart is being purified , and the mouth that loves to eat is being punished by the virus.   “The people who have been soaking in the bright red and green lights, all night have been driven home by the virus.  Go home.  “There are lesser people on the street, fewer cars on the roads but , the air is getting fresher, the haze has gone, the sky is turning bluer, the sun is getting brighter, and the family is drawing closer.    “Harmony has descended in people's hearts putting a value in relationships.  “People who have not read for many long years, have picked up books at home.   “Parents and children who have had no or almost no communication with each other, couples who find difficulty talking, have opened the lid of the conversation box.   “Children who do not know how to respect the elderly have begun to be filial.  “The virus taught human beings a vivid and profound lesson. It made them understand awe.   “It shouted to one’s ear, to realize what is called ""Good Times”, feel what is true love on earth. It brought us gradually to fall in love  saying “Return to the Road"".   “We should really be grateful for this ""enemy"".   “We need such an “enemy"" in our fragility to give us a “reminder"" to have ""empowerment"" once again.   The virus will not leave so quickly, until there is a “cultivation"" of good human habits, and it will not continue to rage because human love will gather more power to defeat this plague.   “Time will tell us everything, and prove what is right.  “I really like ""quiet China"", and I hope Chinese people will take the initiative to build a ""quiet China"" without the virus reminding them again.”           ""*Quiet China; good""*  Written by a Chinese pastor sent to a brother in Istanbul via friends in Singapore.(translated and edited for clarity )",2020-02-20,492

We also need to do our part and contribute. As for doing my part and making a humble contribution, I hope to leave to Pakistan to attend  an International Peace Conference, with the hope of learning about their peace process and peace dividends, to build relationships that will help to build stronger buisiness relationships between Singapore and 20 countries who are members of the International Peace Leaders Institute. And simultaneously, I am negotiating with many other economies and forums to partner, to achieve the same.  Many blessings for continued good health to your family, staff, and all teams fighting hard to protect the little red dot.
