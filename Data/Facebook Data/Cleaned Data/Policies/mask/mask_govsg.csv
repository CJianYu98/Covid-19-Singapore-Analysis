Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay.

From single digits to double digits to triple digits and more?  Don't get me wrong. The measures are good long awaited for. Better late than never. But have some sense on the matter.

From single digits to double digits to triple digits and more?  Don't get me wrong. The measures are good long awaited for. Better late than never. But have some sense on the matter.

Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

Do read the excellent article Joyce Tan shared.   https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/coronavirus-runners-can-infect-you-with-covid19-even-if-youre-2m-away/news-story/b916247fa481018bae6ce75925654ed1?utm_source=News.com.au&utm_campaign=EditorialSF&utm_medium=Facebook&utm_content=SocialFlow",2020-04-14,95
2826,"The government took a gamble asking Singapore residents to wear mask only when one is sick. This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

If not the more stringent measures that you say will be futile. When the rest of Sg are abiding. All it takes is for these exemptions to spread the virus. From single digits to double digits to triple digits and more?  Don't get me wrong. The measures are good long awaited for. Better late than never. But have some sense on the matter. These exemptions actively breaths, pant. If they are carriers. It is as bad as coughing and sneezing everywhere they went. All that cross their path gets infected and infect those they go back to.

Please bring spare dry masks if you run longer so you can use the fresh one when you enter the lifts and public area.   For some of us exercise is key to being healthy.

Why must insist on jogging and joggers expel so much droplets when they run. If they have the virus how? Also they draw in a lot of oxygen too. They could be inhaling deeply those infected aerosol particles. For the love of your family and your own life, stay home. A run is not worth dying for. If it is so, one‚Äôs life is meaningless.

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

From single digits to double digits to triple digits and more?  Don't get me wrong. The measures are good long awaited for. Better late than never. But have some sense on the matter. These exemptions actively breaths, pant. If they are carriers. It is as bad as coughing and sneezing everywhere they went. All that cross their path gets infected and infect those they go back to.

Why must insist on jogging and joggers expel so much droplets when they run. If they have the virus how? Also they draw in a lot of oxygen too.

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

From single digits to double digits to triple digits and more?  Don't get me wrong. The measures are good long awaited for. Better late than never. But have some sense on the matter. These exemptions actively breaths, pant. If they are carriers. It is as bad as coughing and sneezing everywhere they went. All that cross their path gets infected and infect those they go back to.

If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3.

If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3.

If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3. Not sure how breathable the waterproof totebag side can be üòÖ I just tried putting a waterproof totebag over my nose and mouth - I can‚Äôt breathe at all üòÇ  Cute initiative though!

If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3.

If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3. Not sure how breathable the waterproof totebag side can be üòÖ I just tried putting a waterproof totebag over my nose and mouth - I can‚Äôt breathe at all üòÇ  Cute initiative though!
