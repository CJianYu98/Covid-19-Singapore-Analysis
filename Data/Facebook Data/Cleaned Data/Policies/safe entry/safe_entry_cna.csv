1,Thank God you had recovered. Stay healthy...And thank you for your hard work here in my country. Thank you very much once again.,2020-06-14,24
2,The numbers are those detected. I am just saying that the numbers will never be zero as many now are asymptomatic cases. Not trying to make the issue small. Take the numbers into perspective as well. How many have recovered? How many in ICU? How many in care facilities? How many of the new infections are from existing clusters?   It is not about putting our guard down either. It is about being responsible and do what we have to do to ensure as much as possible we are keeping one another safe.  This is really a balancing act between public health and the economy. It is tough.,2020-06-14,107
3,Thank you very much healthcare workers in Singapore for taking good care of everyone in Singapore.,2020-06-14,16

6,"I think we gotta accept that COVID is here to stay with us for the long run. It's not an issue of who will get infection, but when, Just like H1NI and H5N1 flu. We don't know who has it and who doesn't, or perhaps those who have it might have been able to get better from it by themselves over time. I guess in the meantime is about taking the necessary precautions yet moving on with life. And pray for the vaccine to quickly come into fruition.",2020-06-14,83

Change your way of living with hygiene, don wait for someone to change it for you. Some how it's a good sign that we see the figure rise and deflate and at a consistent level, Not a sudden surge in the open community. This also show how effective our system works. As long as the virus not contained globally. Don be too happy with zero figure. Lockdown, circuit Breaker etc will not do us good at all. Economy must move on... We must live and move on like usual with a little bit changes. Rotting at home will not do us good. When you are out of money, out of job, out of food, you will know covid is not the worst.

As one  MP mentioned we do not have the luxurious of benefits of hindsight resulting in Singaporean being grounded months by CB and till today we are still into hundreds of â€œisolated casesâ€ So are we really ready to ease our measures into phase 2 now? Are we ready to let in FWs from neighbouring countries to kickstart many stalled projects? Most importantly are Singaporean ready to face the consequences of backfiring if things donâ€™t go as planned. Can we survive another round of CB? Answer is an obvious NO. Let nots ignore the facts that the infections arounds the world are still on the high side. The fatality rates are into hundreds and thousands. Many countries are showing signs of second wave outbreaks. We are being blessed that our fatality rate are low but letâ€™s not overcount our blessing just yet. Do remember that other countries can lockdown towns by towns or states by states to contain the infections but Singapore being a small and dense population countries, once there is wide spread we do not have the luxuries of doing that and will have to lockdown our whole island again.
