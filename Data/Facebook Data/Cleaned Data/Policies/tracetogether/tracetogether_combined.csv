601,633,"‼️To The Straits Time‼️ You need to look at your facts straight before posting something controversy at this critical moment of Myanmar.  Yesterday, the peaceful protests of Myanmar citizens happened in front of Myanmar Embassy in Thailand. Many Thai citizens and Thai pro-democracy activists also joined this movement as they recognize the pain of oppressive military junta( if you follow the news, there were huge uprisings all over the Thailand in past few months against Junta Dictatorship). And yesterday, Thai police came to the scene and tried to break the crowd by force. That's when Thai citizens in the crowd and Thai police had a clash. NOT WITH MYANMAR PROTESTERS. We are not stupid, why would we fight with Thai police while we are residing in their country? During these few weeks, Thai people are also not pleased with government way of handling Covid 19 and delay of vaccination. So, Thai protesters took the opportunity to voice out their grievances against government. Meanwhile, Thai protesters helped Myanmar protesters to leave the scene by blocking and confronting the police force. The lady in the 1st pic is also Thai citizen who was complaining about the Government's Covid19 response.  All of my information come from localThai news sites who keep updated at the scene yesterday from Bangkok.  We Myanmar citizens are now having a very hard time and please do not make it worse by false news and accusations.",2021-02-02,231

728,762,"I have never  my voice against this matter since some are making their own accusations & assumptions. Firstly, we did not support any harms which happened to Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State. Media platforms (most of them affiliated with Military forces) did not state anything about it until the world found out.   Briefly, Madam Aung San Suu Kyi took all the blame after that & defended against the world to protect the civilians as well as the country. Indeed, she couldnt stop the genocide without any control power over the military. The world did have a bad image about Myanmar & the military forces make it worse again. It was the dirty trick which created by them to take control over this country while other countries are looking down on us regarding Rohingya matter. Moreover, our country has not only Rohingya Muslims (war refugees) in Rakhine State which caused by armed & dangerous people, accordingly; our ethnic groups from Multiple states are getting the same treatment. Heres also a brief explanation about Rohingya Muslims, lets go back to the beginning of the story. At first, the military officials illegally allowed them (without civilians knowledge) in order to gain human labors & make religious-related-riots here or there. Decades later, Rohingya Muslims requested for their own land with their own government so on & so on which messed things up. Even after all those thing happened, like I said, most of us still dont know about it until the world did. Thus, i think it is crystal clear that they are illegal migrants from wherever it is. Although they lived in Myanmar for generations, they cannot even speak Burmese at all which is unrealistic. Which is also why, some of us cant accept them as our citizens. In the end, the world thinks we all (civilians) are supported those people in killing people.  Helllllll noooo. It is so unfair to even think like that. Its Dictatorship, people. Millions are starving & getting killed with limited healthcare within the country. Limited access of internet in the rural areas. We still has difficulties with transportation system, hygiene food, clear water & etc., as well. We all are on the same boat. Thus, do not ever say on this matter through googling shits online.   (Ps- My bad if its too long.)",2021-02-02,377

The English translation is attached.  Some technical details look promising. For e.g., the Initiative highlights :  ""States should encourage companies to abide by laws and regulations of the State where they operate. States should not request domestic companies to store data generated and obtained overseas in their own territory.""  So user data would be stored in the country where they are collected and thus would not be stored in overseas servers.   One tweak I would like to see though is that companies could house their data regionally in trusted countries like SG as it is uneconomical if data have to be localised in every country. This would help to promote job growth for SG as a regional data centre.  https://language.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202009/09/WS5f58364da310675eafc586ee.html",2020-09-16,224

1624,3,"Thank you PM Sir. On a separate subject, I am puzzled that nobody in JTC is aware of the clearing of the Kranji woodland until after only about 3 weeks later. Surely someone in the higher up ranks at JTC must be not doing his job well. Clearing of a forest is unlike clearing of rubbish at rubbish chutes that may take just 10 mins to complete the job. Clearing of a forest takes weeks if not months to complete. Meanwhile where is the oversight, supervision and communication by JTC with the contractors, I wonder? Honestly it is quite akin to security agencies illegally leaving the protection of an installation for weeks without anyone higher-ups knowing it. ",2021-02-17,114

There are 20 strokes in 疫情，the Chinese characters for pandemic.  There are 20 strokes in 痛苦, the Chinese characters for pain/hardship.  There are 20 strokes in 疾病, the Chinese characters for illness/disease.  There are 20 strokes in 生死存亡, the Chinese characters for life and death, survival and demise.  2020 is gone. And so we hope that pandemic, hardships, diseases and death will also be gone.  On the other hand:  There are 21 strokes in 健康, the Chinese characters for health.  There are 21 strokes in 幸福，the Chinese characters for happiness.  There are 21 strokes in 富贵，the Chinese characters for wealth.  There are 21 strokes in 和睦, the Chinese characters for harmony.  There are 21 strokes in 勤奋，the Chinese characters for industry.  There are 21 strokes in 崛起, the Chinese characters for ascendancy.  And so it seems 2021 will be a year of HEALTH and HAPPINESS.

Such travellers shud be allowed to travel seemlessly without entry permits and  3.  If there is  mandatory SHN requiement for such people, it shud be in the confines of their home rather than hotels.    It must be acknowledged that this disease is not going to go away in a hurry and it cud be 4-5 years before everythingnis back to 2019 days.  In fact there may be no 2019 again for our generation.

2047,696,"MOH booklet (given after vaccination) says... *Please refer to photo* It is a good reference and informative. However, it does not address the immediate 48 hours. Only if side effects get worse or fever persist after 48 hours.. Than SEE A DOCTOR. If the person takes MC within the 48 hours, is it covered under ""Covid vaccination MC"" or deduct from the 14 days annual medical? In revenue bus service companies, the number of MCs taken is peg to Yearly Performance. For Taxis and PHV drivers, they will be more worried about vehicle rental if they fall sick after vaccination. Part timers or ""hand to mouth"" workers will be worried about salary if they fall sick after vaccination. MOH should address or work with the relevant authorities to sort this out and ""TRY"" to assist as much as possible.  Else it ""MIGHT"" discourage affected Singaporeans to get vaccinated.",2021-02-01,144

After watching videos of a staff nurse collapse after Vaccinated and there are people who've got infected after getting vaccination with covid infection and all that,  but we know how reliable our government is.  We sincerely believe our government will always do thier best for all Singaporeans.   This videos maybe rumours or true story we don't know.  A friend of mine got vaccinated in one of the Singapore's hospital for front line workers but the rest of the staffs did not volunteer to get vaccinated  just because  they got no clear picture of our vaccination.  For now after your speech I hope whole of Singaporeans will get vaccinated.  I'll be the first for sure.  Thank you sir for all the support you've given us.  God bless you always",2021-01-27,143

3208,3062,"Please, I share your post. Thanks",2021-01-08,6
3209,3068,"Great that our healthcare workers are having this added protection first. There have often been comments on how the spotlight and adulation are always focused on them. Well it is fully justifiable.  Even during pre-Covid 19 times, the doctors and nurses are overwhelmed with work and yet they are still dedicated, caring and professional towards their patients, sometimes working beyond their shift hours. At times can really see that they literally work non-stop. Thus they fully deserve every accolade and praise heaped on them.  Stay safe and wishing everyone a healthy and blessed year ahead.",2020-12-30,92
3210,3069,"The front line workers are unsung heroes. Priority should be given to them. Thereafter, the pioneers and seniors.   We must thank our government for the free vaccinations and grateful to the leaders and officials who worked hard to secure vaccines for our citizens.",2020-12-30,43
3211,3070,PM Sir believe the challenge is even as free vaccines are progressively available for 🇸🇬 however as it's on voluntary basis hopefully many Singaporeans and eligible long term residents will go for vaccination. No one is safe unless everyone is really safe.,2020-12-30,40
3212,3071,Thank you sir for all the efforts in bringing in vaccines early here 🙏🏼,2020-12-30,13

3214,3073,"As a Singaporean n fellow human being, I would advise u against taking the vaccine as u hv preexisting health n medical conditions.  Let your colleagues n the last-line-of-defence medical health care personnel, vulnerable groups n essential workers hv their jabs, if they so wish. The clinical trial results r not 100% n the results fr actual field vaccination exercises r the real deal.  Bless Singapore.",2020-12-30,64
3215,3074,Thank you PM Lee for bringing the vaccines so fast. Many good years ahead,2020-12-30,14
3216,3075,"GREAT START!!! One request - How about 5million vaccinations in 50 days? (Biden has promised 100million in 100 days).  Benefits Changi can open up  faster!

3218,3077,Still do the health protocols despite getting vaccinated. Staying clean alwAys is key to getting rid of the virus ,2020-12-31,19
3219,3078,"Instead of a testing regime, government should urgently look into inoculations of the frontline workers who are exposed to foreigners or foreign entities - namely the aviation (air crews) and marine sectors (engineers who board foreign entities docked in Singapore etc); not just looking at vaccinating the frontline workers of the healthcare sectors. With the access to protective gears, adequate knowledge and experience, healthcare workers are less vulnerable than those workers of the aviation and marine sectors, who also will not know if they are in contact with infected persons or contanminated objects. Please think out of the box.",2020-12-31,98
3220,3079,Good to have vaccines for now but we must improve the strength of the vaccines thus more investment is needed. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are only 95% effective. There is another 5% in which the virus might have a chance to mutate and form a even more deadly virus in future so we should not be celebrating yet.,2021-01-01,56

3226,3085,"Well Stated Lee Hsien Loong ! It is important to use N95 Masks , which are used during Haze. Wash Hands as Regularly as Necessary And if in doubt, then Wash Your Hands Anyway! And also Keep Social Distance.   Remember, the Corona Virus Pandemic has a New More infectious Variant which First Surfaced in The South East Of England at Approximately just before Christmas 2020.

3681,4031,"The facts can be discussed later on as data will surface in time, IF the educated wants protection when traveling abroad the vaccines are available. A layman gets masks up, sanitises often when at work may find vaccines useful for NOW. It makes sense to protect working class families. Do what is best for your situation 😌😷😇",2020-12-15,56
3682,4032,"Thank you, Sir for taking good care of us. However, I wonder how long the vaccine will remain good for? Is one shot of the vaccine good forever? Or does one have to take it every few years? Or every year, like the flu vaccine? The article states the following, but then it's still not clear how long this vaccine is good for.  ""It’s possible that in the months after vaccination, the number of antibodies and killer T-cells will drop. But the immune system also contains special cells called memory B-cells and memory T-cells that might retain information about the coronavirus for years or even decades.""       The ""It's possible"", ""might"" sounds so tentative...",2020-12-15,109

3685,4035,Thank you PM Lee for including us long term residents in getting free vaccine.Hoping 2021 will be safer for everyone.,2020-12-15,18
3686,4036,""". This will not only protect you, but those around you as well."" – LHL   Vaccination definitely does not prevent transmission. Your statement implies the loved ones of people who get the vaccines, will be v protected if they don't get vaccinated.  From many vaccine experts, those vaccinated still have to wear masks and social distance.",2020-12-15,53
3687,4037,"Thank you Sir, for the informative article. I fully support and applaud the decisions of the government. We are indeed very fortunate to have a responsible and competent government helming our country. The sterling political leadership enabled Singapore to overcome a very difficult period during the lockdown period with minimal casualties. We must not forget that the global pandemic is still a major problem in many countries. Singaporeans must never be complacent because we are not yet out of the woods. The situation can deteriorate very rapidly for Singapore if there is any let up in our measures and preventive safeguards that have been put in place. Let us all continue to stay vigilant and prudent. We have a responsibility to keep ourselves and our own families safe.  ",2020-12-15,128
3688,4038,"Singapore with the recent record of 0 local community transmission is definitely commendable. Assuming that  Singapore citizen starts taking up the vaccination, the risk from vaccination is somehow misplaced. Nevertheless, we will never know what the future beholds, I still think the higher risk segment such as front line workers has to be mandated part of the vaccination program.",2020-12-18,58
3689,4039,"Like all medicines and vaccines there will always be side effects or long term harms. The truth is in the short term if many refuse to be vaccinated the dangers of Covid infections will continue to ravage society socially and economically. Noble act by the leaders to take the first steps. I suggest creating vaccination passports for those vaccinated so that they will be allowed more freedom to travel and resume normalcy. For those who choose not to be vaccinated, well its your choice to continue with restricted movement measures. ",2020-12-16,90

3691,4041,"In life, there's no 100% guarantee. Paracetamol (Panadol) has been around for ages. People take them for years and some do develop allergy to it after years of taking. For me, I rather risk having the vaccine than catch covid. If time to die, time to die. I suppose each human dna is different. So we will react differently.",2020-12-15,57

3694,4044,"Sorry Sir, I beg to differ. As far as I know, these vaccines have no studies done on long term effects and it does not promise that the vaccinated will eliminate the possibility of transmission. So I do not see how it is a way to protect oneself and others for a disease with 99.97% survival rate and most do not even know they have it. According to research, asymptomatics are also not a driver of the pandemic. I do not see any logic of why life cannot go on as per pre-CB without vaccines.",2020-12-15,93
3695,4045,I cannot wait to be vaccinated! ,2020-12-15,6
3696,4046,Thank you PM Lee. Hope our children of Singapore will get a safe vaccine too soon. ,2020-12-15,16
3697,4047,"There are groups who talk about ""faith"" in the vaccine. Of course websites that focus and highlight the 6 people who died in the test of this vaccine. Actually it was only 2, but found to be unrelated to the vaccine. The other 4 did not even get the vaccine, they only got the placebo. The key issue is a great study in motivation. Consider if say, after getting this vaccine, the person can go back to pre COVID-19 status. Means, go anywhere, no need to wear mask, no social distancing, no limit of people to be with. Then everyone will queue up for it. The thing is after getting this vaccine, things remain the same, with all the measures that we have to adhere to. ",2020-12-15,123
3698,4048,Let people know each vaccine prices and they can decide for themselves.,2020-12-16,12
3699,4049,"Years ago, frequent travellers were advised strongly to get the 'flu vaccine' jabs by medical centres, etc. However, there are people who did not get the jab, and are fine. Covid19 is very contagious, we can see the effects. But its not mandatory unlike measles vaccination. Health minister Gan ky gave the example of mandatory vaccine is measles when someone asked 'why covid19 vaccine is not made mandatory?'",2020-12-15,68

3719,4069,"A virus infects a cell and directs the cell to make more virus copies, killing the cell eventually. For the vaccine, the mRNA package enters the cell and directs it to make spike proteins, which present themselves on the cell membrane, or they or their fragments might exit the cell. The immune system reacts to the spike proteins, learning how to inactivate them as they mount an immune response.  It is new technology. This application as a vaccine will probably not give us The Handmaid's Tale or Umbrella Corporation. I would be more concerned about future applications that could be more sinister.",2020-12-15,101

3733,4084,"But i dont see how in the article is there any scientific evidence that it is safe. We dont base facts on just what a article reports, without putting up proper studies and evidences, right?  There is a good chance of non specific illnesses/disorders arising as a result of mutation of virus, or when the vaccine binds the target but does not eliminate it successfully. This may lead to cytokine storms which may be worse than the virus itself. The article nor vaccine trials seem to have NOT provided evidence that these ADE (aka disease enhancements) will not be observed.

3840,4269,"Without a vaccine or an effective treatment, many governments are looking for effective ways of subduing and suppressing COVID19 spread.  This is difficult for two reasons (1) the virus can spread without any symptoms in some patients and clusters form before you know it, (2) long term lockdown is not sustainable and its economic impact can be too harsh for some countries.  With the help of technology, people can work from home or even study from home.  Restrictions can be put in place, like wearing of masks, social distancing, etc.  Not to forget the efforts of our frontline workers.  However, as we slowly reopen and talk about travel bubbles, I think most important is continuous education on the public knowledge of the coronavirus, personal hygiene and social etiquette for the new normal.",2020-11-17,130
