0,The thing that pisses me off is they mention specifically that you can't choose the type of vaccine they inject into your body. So even if they run out of Pfizer and start using China-made ones... good luck to all of us.,2021-02-19,40
1,"Ministry of Health, Singapore... it is not stated in the letter to my mum (seniors above 70) that she has to bring the letter even though I had registered for her and got the confirmation. The registration booth at Canberra CC had requested for the letter though eventually she was accepted to proceed w/o the letter. Pls review your process to reduce unnecessary anxiety caused.

3,Go Singapore!  Both my elderly parents have had the vaccine!  They have had no side effects except my mums arm was a bit sore for a day. Like when she had flu jab. They had it a few weeks ago.  As soon as I and my family are offered the vaccine we are definitely going for it.  I trust this government.  One of the best In the world for looking after us all in covid! Singaporeans must be v proud! ,2021-02-20,80

Are there people who went for injection without booking? 2. Did the booking system block dates or timing if it is full? Or is it due to lack of staffs?

47,"Dear MOH, is it MOH intention or SOP to make elderly wait for at least 3 hours for vaccination?   Me, my hubby and kid went all the way from the south to the north to fetch my mum from Yishun to Woodlands Galaxy CC on Saturday 27 Feb. My mum waited 1 hr for a queue number ticket. The PA staff (I assume) advised the crowd to return home, register for a new date again and come back another day. Some were dismayed and argued with the staff, some feedbacked they don‚Äôt know technology. I told the staff that ‚Äúthis is last thing I wanna hear after coming all the way here‚Äù.  I was bewildered, if you have expected weekends to be so crowded and tedious waiting, why set these seniors appointments on Saturday? Not to mention young people are also allowed to register during this period which I thought is supposed to prioritize the seniors... if not for the staff to suggest we could collect a queue tix, leave for dinner and come back 2 hrs later to take the jab, I would be more annoyed. He has provided an App to show the queue status.

Regarding these volunteers who came to my door... How could MOH release / divulge my dad's personal data to them?  It wasn't a random knock on each residence, but they specifically came to look up my dad because they were given his name and address, and not sure what other data.  These are volunteers... Not MOH staff.. How could they be authorised to handle personal data?   Would this be considered a breach of PDPA?  And we have had cases of scammers/pranksters going around carrying out their act of deceit in the name of MOH during this pandemic.  It is unnerving to get strangers coming to one's doorstep without being first informed by MOH regarding this form of enthusiastic outreach towards the elderlies.

129,"THE PFIZER‚ÄìBIONTECH AND MODERNA mRNA VACCINES ARE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA).  IN CLINICAL TRIALS, BOTH WERE FOUND TO BE 95 PERCENT EFFECTIVE AFTER GETTING THE BOOSTER DOSE.  BUT WE NEED 100% VACCINES NOT 95% AS OUR DEATH RATES ARE VERY LOW.  mRNA VACCINES DO NOT CONTAIN A WEAKENED OR INACTIVE FORM OF THE VIRUS ITSELF.  INSTEAD, THEY USE MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) TO TEACH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RECOGNISE AND REACT TO A COMPONENT OF THE VIRUS THAT IS KEY TO ITS ABILITY TO MAKE US SICK.  VIRUSES CAN‚ÄôT REPRODUCE THEMSELVES, THEY NEED A HOST‚ÄîTHE CORONAVIRUS USES A SPIKE PROTEIN TO GAIN ENTRY INTO THE CELLS AND START THE REPLICATION PROCESS THAT MAKES US SICK.  IN DEVELOPING mRNA VACCINES, SCIENTISTS ZEROED IN ON A UNIQUE SPIKE PROTEIN THAT IS FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE VIRUS.  ON ITS OWN, THIS SPIKE PROTEIN IS INCAPABLE OF CAUSING COVID-19.  THE mRNA VACCINES WORK BY RELAYING A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO BUILD THIS PROTEIN, WITH THE GOAL OF TEACHING YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HOW TO DISARM IT.  AFTER INJECTION, THE VACCINE PARTICLES COME INTO CONTACT WITH IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS AND DELIVER THE mRNA MESSAGE.  YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS SPIKE PROTEIN, AND HERE‚ÄôS HOW‚ÄîAS THE VACCINATED CELLS START CHURNING OUT THE SPIKE PROTEIN, OTHER IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS REALISE THAT THE PROTEIN SHOULD NOT BE THERE, THAT‚ÄôS WHEN THE BATTLE BEGINS.  THE IMMUNE SYSTEM STARTS BUILDING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE AND MAKING ANTIBODIES.  YOUR BODY CONTINUES TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL ALL THE SPIKE PROTEINS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.  AT THE END OF THIS NATURAL IMMUNE PROCESS, YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS THE KNOWLEDGE IT NEEDS TO RECOGNISE THE SPIKE PROTEIN AND FEND OFF FUTURE EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS.  SO IF THE VIRUS ENTERS THE BODY, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL IDENTIFY AND ATTACK IT.  COVID-19 mRNA VACCINES ARE GIVEN IN THE UPPER ARM MUSCLE‚ÄîONCE THE INSTRUCTIONS (mRNA) ARE INSIDE THE IMMUNE CELLS, THE CELLS USE THEM TO MAKE THE PROTEIN PIECE.  AFTER THE PROTEIN PIECE IS MADE, THE CELL BREAKS DOWN THE INSTRUCTIONS AND GETS RID OF THEM.  NEXT, THE CELL DISPLAYS THE PROTEIN PIECE ON ITS SURFACE.  TWO DOSES, SEPARATED BY THREE TO FOUR WEEKS, IS THE TRIED-AND-TRUE APPROACH TO GENERATE AN EFFECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE THROUGH VACCINATION.  THE FIRST DOSE PRIMES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND INTRODUCES THE BODY TO THE GERM OF INTEREST‚ÄîTHIS ALLOWS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO PREPARE ITS DEFENSE.  THE SECOND DOSE, OR BOOSTER, PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RAMP UP THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF THE ANTIBODIES USED TO FIGHT THE VIRUS.  IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO SPREAD THE VIRUS AFTER BEING VACCINATED, SO MASKING UP AND SOCIAL DISTANCING REMANS CRITICAL.  PFIZER AND MODERNA VACCINES USE MESSENGER RNA THAT ENCODES THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN. UPON INJECTION OF THE VACCINE, THE MRNA ENTERS INTO IMMUNE CELLS CALLED DENDRITIC CELLS.   THE DENDRITIC CELLS USE THE INSTRUCTIONS WRITTEN IN THE mRNA TO SYNTHESISE THE HALLMARK SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN, WHICH CHARACTERISES THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THESE IMMUNE CELLS THEN SHOW THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN TO B-CELLS, WHICH THEN MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES.  THE mRNA VACCINES ARE UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF INDUCING A SPECIAL KIND OF IMMUNE CELL (CALLED A T-FOLLICULAR HELPER CELL) TO HELP B-CELLS PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  THE T-CELLS DO THIS THROUGH DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE B-CELLS AND BY SENDING CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT TELL THE B-CELLS TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  IT IS THIS HELP IN ANTIBODY PRODUCTION THAT MAKES THESE VACCINES EFFECTIVE.  BUT NOT ALL B-CELLS ARE THE SAME.  THERE ARE TWO KINDS THAT MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES‚ÄîLONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS AND MEMORY B-CELLS.  THE LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS, AS THEIR NAME IMPLIES, LIVE IN THE BONE MARROW FOR YEARS AFTER VACCINATION, CONTINUOUSLY CHURNING OUT ANTIBODY (IN THIS CASE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODY), THESE LONG-LIVED B-CELLS DO NOT NEED TO BE BOOSTED.  THE MEMORY B-CELLS, ON THE OTHER HAND, LIVE IN A STATE AKIN TO HIBERNATION.  THEY DO NOT PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL STIMULATED BY A BOOSTER OF THE VACCINE, OR ARE EXPOSED TO INFECTION WITH THE CORONAVIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THAT IS THE REASON WE NEED THAT SECOND DOSE‚ÄîTOGETHER THESE TWO TYPES OF B-CELLS PROVIDE A CONSTANT LEVEL OF PROTECTION.  THAT BOOSTER SHOT IS NECESSARY FOR THE T-CELLS TO STIMULATE THE MEMORY B-CELLS TO PRODUCE MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES.  IF THE BOOSTER ISN‚ÄôT GIVEN WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE WINDOW, LOWER QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES WILL BE PRODUCED THAT MAY NOT PROVIDE AS POWERFUL PROTECTION FROM THE VIRUS.  mRNA STANDS FOR MESSENGER RNA, WHICH IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR MAKING PROTEINS.  DNA, WHICH LIVES IN THE NUCLEUS OF CELLS, MAKES mRNA AND SHIPS IT OUTSIDE THE NUCLEUS TO THE SURROUNDING CELL CYTOPLASM.  ONCE IN THE CYTOPLASM, mRNA IS TRANSLATED INTO A HOST OF CELL PROTEINS AND ENZYMES.  BECAUSE OUR CELLS MAKE PROTEINS ALL THE TIME, THEY ALSO MAKE mRNA ALL THE TIME.  SOON AFER MAKING PROTEINS, mRNA BREAKS DOWN.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtprX4KcBws  IT IS A LIE OF EVIL KOSHER PHARMA THAT mRNA VACCINES CANNOT ENTER THE NUCLEUS OF THE CELL, SO IT CANNOT CHANGE YOUR DNA.  IF ANY DOCTOR TELLS THE TRUTH, HE WILL BE DE-FROCKED AND BLACK BALLED FOR LIFE.  LISTEN !!  mRNA VACCINES IN THE REALM OF IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY‚ÄîIT HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED BEFORE.  THE BULLCRAP EVIL KOSHER VACCINE LOBBY GIVES IS THAT EVEN IF mRNA DID ENTER THE NUCLEUS, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONVERTED TO DNA.  THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ENZYME CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE, WHICH THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN.

But there are a small number of elderlies who may have some underlying health problems. Making the way to the jabbing stations may be a strain on them. I'm glad that the gov did not make it compulsory, but the way they are saying free vaccination is like implying they may not get it free again. This is a form of stress. I'm very stressful too. The government should extend the vaccines as free for elderly people even if they reject it the first time. That will alleviate the stress we have. ",2021-01-29,148

157,"It is good to have gotten the vaccine quickly as there would be a long queue later on. However all these vaccines are cleared for emergency use which is NOW, but it also means many unknowns or 'use at own risk'. Hence SGGGOVT's advisory that getting vaccinated is not 'mandatory'. That is very nice but it is unkind (and still being pushy) to warn that those who decide against it when offered may not (I read that as shall not) get the vaccine free of charge when they decide later to have it. For the over-70 Elderlies of which I am one, that is very nasty irresponsible and a demonstration of unfilial love (I wonder if they treat their own family elders in the same way) besides our worry that our golden years to enjoy our family and this country may be at risk.  The reason that the Elderlies should be given the vaccine early because they are a higher risk of COVID-19 infection group and this will give them protection. That is a very kind and noble decision if not for the fact that if the situation gets bad, the Elderlies would get infected quickly and overcome health services to the detriment of everyone else younger. But it is still a sensible decision.  But coming back to this another kind offer to reimburse costs for serious side effects due to getting a vaccination, I believe that is provided by vaccine  manufacturers to people who agree to be used as guinea pigs in the vaccine testing. So getting a vaccination is like becoming a volunteer in the vaccine testing programs of the vaccine manufacturers. I suppose it's a bohpian when buying vaccines approved for emegency use. Whether the Expert Panel will be kindly in their verification of cases and decisions is another thing bearing in mind SG's very prudent hands on the national wallet.  It's not easy to make good decisions especially decisions to save the lives and livelihood of 6 million people. So far so good, well done  SGGOVT.

But very large  It's a global scam, people have died from ""Amplified Global 5G Electromagnetic Radiation (Poison)"".       Doctors in Italy have violated the World Health Organization (WHO) law, which does not allow autopsies.  (Autopsy) on the corpses of those who have died from the corona virus to search after scientific discovery.  It cannot be assumed that it is not a virus, but rather the fatal bacteria that cause blood clots in the blood vessels, such as blood clots in the veins and nerves formed by these bacteria, and are the patients who cause death.      Italy beat the virus, stating that  ""Nothing else is hardening of the arteries in atherosclerosis  (Thromboembolism) and the way to deal with it is to cure it. ""      Antibiotic      Anti-inflammatory and      Taking an anticoagulant (aspirin) will treat it.

Victims should take Asprin-100mg and Apronix or Paracetamol 650mg. Why‚Ä¶ ??? ‡§ï. Since it has been proven that COVID-19 causes blood clots which cause blood clots in humans and cause blood clots.  Tonnes in the veins and because the brain, heart and lungs are unable to receive oxygen because of the difficult illness and people  Quickly died of breathing difficulties      Doctors in Italy failed to comply with WHO procedures and performed an autopsy of the COVID-19 death.Doctors opened up the limbs and other parts of the body, and after proper examination and examination, the blood vessels were dilated and the blood vessels were filled.  With thromboembolism, which often stops the blood from flowing  It also reduces the flow of oxygen into the body, which can lead to death.  Upon learning of this research, the Italian Ministry of Health immediately changed the Covid-19 treatment protocol and gave patients 100mg positive aspirin and started Empromax.As a result, patients began to recover and their health began to improve.

What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness ‚Äî SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been purified and isolated, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‚Äògold standard‚Äô against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‚Äòcases‚Äô are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government‚Äôs report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections ‚Äì not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people‚Äôs bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus ‚Äî PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?",2020-12-31,341

What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness ‚Äî SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been purified and isolated, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‚Äògold standard‚Äô against which to check them. The virus has not been purified.

1425,"On recent CNA with Gov.sg, sponsored news article on Assoc Prof Tan and also regarding yesterday MOH released news of recommendation of vaccination I have comments and questions as following:  In respect to Assoc Prof Tan and thank her for her tireless research work for our nation.   I'm concern and would like to ask base on that article written.  I didnt see any collaboration of vaccine mentioned in the article.  -In regards to Sars or Covid 19 virus-vaccine, and regarding the 2 vaccines from Pifzer and Moderna using the new mRNA technology compared to traditional vaccine,   The mentioned were as abstracted in [.] brackets from article:  1. [This information was used by several international research groups in their studies of biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients, helping us understand how the virus spreads to different organs and causes complications in some patients.]  2. [discussions with some colleagues in the engineering field on how their technologies could be adapted for developing diagnostic procedures for COVID-19 as well as other infectious diseases.]  3. [colleagues from fields such as pathology, cancer and immunology use their expertise to study COVID-19 in different ways. Combining their knowledge with innovative technologies helped us gain new knowledge of the virus quickly.]  4. [We also assisted some local companies in developing diagnostic kits that can be used at point-of-care settings, and more importantly, help to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers.]   One heartened mentioned in this article saw was, [ ] abstracted:  [ In another collaboration, we detected strong virus-specific T cell immunity in people who have recovered from COVID-19 and SARS. Interestingly, those who had SARS 17 years ago still harboured T cells from their earlier infection, and those same T cells could also recognise COVID-19. This finding may be useful for the design and testing of COVID-19 vaccines. ]   Questions: 1. I would like to ask Gov taskforce, Ministry of Health, given since the Sars outbreak in 2002-2004, and no Sars vaccine was created that period of time, and people have been travelling around the world since, aren't the people developed T-cell immunity also?   From MOH website on the status of Covid19 local situation as of 27/12/2020: https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 53,870 were Discharged  0 Hospitalised (Critical)  29 Death   On the 29 death, base on the news reported for local Singapore, most of the death the covid patients were caused by having pre existing conditions.   Q1. If 53,870 were previously diagnosed having covid 19 virus, can we say that these people had gotten the T-cell immunity of covid19  Q2. Since after phase 2 and till current date 27/12/20, the people can go out to malls, dine, shopping, the local community inflection numbers were very low, many days can be zero. Most were imported cases. Can we say that the local people had gotten herd immunity?   Q3. The safety of the 2 vaccines Pifzer and Moderna using mRNA technology - teach Human DNA cells, different from traditional method of using weakened virus, to naturally activate body immune system cells to fight the weakend virus.   Abstracted [The mRNA technology contains instructions for human cells to make proteins that mimic part of the coronavirus, and is used in vaccines from Moderna as well as from Pfizer and BioNTech.]  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-starts-work-on-plant-for-mrna-based-covid-19-vaccine-13816686?cid=FBcna  Aren't this new technology - giving instruction - have high risk to human DNA cells. Human DNA cells - is like a code of instruction designed by GOD for growth.  Animals, birds and plants of different species of have their set of DNA cells.  the high risk of this technologies      1. Autoimmune diesases     2. Aftecting the natural DNA cells, risking deformity in future offspring.   US CDC website on active surveillance of the status of people after vaccination, show that on 18/12/2020, approx 30% were hospitalised.  How is Singapore Gov taskforce and MOH still recommend frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable elderly with existing medical conditions and vascular condition to take these vaccine?  https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-19/05-COVID-CLARK.pdf  I do not have the latest update of US CDC website on active surveillance of the status of people after vaccination.  I really appreciate if Singapore Gov Taskforce, Ministry of Health, can publicly and transparently share these data, to let the People know these safety status data of people in other countries vaccination.  I also want to ask on the liabilities for compensations from these pharmaceutical companies of these 2 vaccines introduced, for any adverse reactions, side effects and long term conditions to the People , and also if MOH endorsing these vaccines. Kindly please address publicly to the people.  Last note:  Fomer Vice-president of Pifzer, Mike Yeadon mentioned the notion of having millions of healthy, fit people is ridiculous quoted below, he also shared his knowledge and reasoning in his video: [Yeadon states this notion is ‚Äúridiculous because while SARS-CoV-2 is indeed novel, coronaviruses are not. There‚Äôs no such thing as an ‚Äòancestor-less virus‚Äô.‚Äù Indeed, he points out, there are at least ‚Äúfour, endemic, common-cold inducing coronaviruses ‚Ä¶ [which] circulate freely in UK and elsewhere.‚Äù Those who have been infected by ‚Äúone or more of these endemic, common-cold producing coronaviruses in the past, have a long-lived and robust [T-cell] immunity, not only to those viruses, but to closely related viruses.

1501,Surprised there are Singaporeans do not appreciate the hard work the government and the civil service peoples have done to secure the vaccines early for us. There is always risk in everything. Even when you walk out of your home there is too. We can pray to God for blessing but in reality we still need medical treatment for illness. I am surprised there are many medical experts here claiming all kinds of risks from the vaccines. There is side effects on any medical treatment whether taking a pill or having an operation. I am confident our MOH will not approve any medical treatment that will harm us. Anyway the cabinet will be taking the vaccines first before offering to Singaporeans. If there is any risk they will be the ones to get it first. So let's have faith and trust in our MOH. But please do not politicise this.

Mask-wearing and safe distancing ‚Ä¶.do we see the bigger picture to prevent community transmission of the virus?  The vaccine is not a cure but a preventive measure.Will red dot encourage the UN and the WHO to do this: the UN and WHO should get all countries to cooperate and shut down for 40 days and 40 nights to stamp out COVID-19?  The best of time is now for the countries in the northern hemisphere during this wintry period [Christmas, New Year 2021, and the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays] to shut down for 40 days [like in the olden days of the leprosy infection to quarantine the new arrivals until the all-clear signal to let them out].Now is the time to do just that for the all-clear of infected persons to stamp out COVID-19 and force it to have a natural ending.  As for all other countries, those at the equator and those in the southern hemisphere [summer time], all should unite and comply to shut down too for 40s day to stamp out this disease well and good. Can the UN and WHO obtain this universal cooperation by all countries around the world to shut down this earth for 40 days and 40 nights at the same time? Time for the whole world to go into hibernation for 40 days. If we don‚Äôt, do we want to continue with the madness for another 400 or more days worldwide affecting the economy and all aspects of human lives? Choose wisely to have a suffering of 40 or 400 days physically, mentally, economically and socially, or do we want more than 400?",2020-12-22,311

Care Corner will reach out to youths at-risk and raise awareness on mental well-being and resilience. They will also provide individualised emotional support, needs identification and peer support services, and refer those who require further intervention to appropriate health and social services.  32.          Moving forward, we will continue to take a whole-of-society approach and work with other ministries to address youth mental health needs. This includes MOE, the Ministry for Social and Family Development (MSF), and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), including their National Youth Council (NYC), on the recently announced Youth Mental Well-being Network.  > I'm fine with the IMH offshoot located outside of IMH, but what are the details to the IYS such that it does not become another stigma-spot?

It will become increasingly difficult to stop the virus at our borders as we cannot ban visitors from every country and shut ourselves out from the world.  > Can there be more details on the ""limitations and constraints""? My sense is that you are saying immune cells isolation and monoclonal lab reproduction will not be in time to treat the currently critically ill, so how about the sourcing of suitable donor for wholesale transfusion as last resort, in which case you might have to open the call for local self-suspected subclinical cases or foreign authorities?
