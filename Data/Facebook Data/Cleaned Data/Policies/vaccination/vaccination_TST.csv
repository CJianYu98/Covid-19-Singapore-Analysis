61,"By right, vaccines are only approved AFTER the trials have been completed.   But for the Covid vaccines, the trials are still ongoing till 2023. That’s why these Covid vaccines approved for Emergency Use ONLY.   So those willing to be vaccinated are actually volunteering to be part of the ongoing study for the drug companies. Everybody responds or reacts differently to the vaccination.  This is the reason why they can’t confirm: how long the these vaccines will ”protect” you especially if the virus mutates or whether you can still transmit the virus if infected.   Hence, masks and social distancing and the usual hygiene steps are still required even after being vaccinated.",2021-03-10,111

78,"These vaccines astrazeneca, moderna, pfizer, coronavac, sinovac, sputnik they all used mRNA of a virus and some genetically modified.  The character of a virus is to inject its RNA/genetic code to a host cell in the body. RNA is a single strand, that means there is no cross checking. The fighter cells thinks it's harmless because the virus disguise itself in the host cells.  The DNA (humans) is hard to copy because it has double strands, it means there is a cross checker. That's very difficult to replicate. If you inject these vaccines, aren't they making the body as virus factories?  Fatalities may rise since the priorities are the senior citizens and the vulnerable (those who has underlying sickness). If they die (God forbids) it's easy to cover it up or mask the cause of death since they will make old age and their underlying sickness as an excuse.  These vaccines are rushed and even the clinical trials. It may be good on paper but human trials are different.  Now, we must monitor rise of deaths related to the vaccinated people. We do not really know the severity of its side effecs as it may take years to come. There are reports of people dying from nursing homes in different countries after the injection.  There are also doctors and nurses who had a severe side effect and who had died. It's worrisome because the priorities of these vaccines are also the frontliners, if they die (God forbids) what's gonna happen to us? We'll have a shortage of doctors expert in their fields and nurses, security personnels and other frontliners.",2021-03-09,263

110,"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,2021-03-11,479

My parents had mobility issues and ended up changing his appointment time (after a 45min queue at the counter for enquiries) but a neighbor who persisted with the whole process ended up getting his jab only at 830.   5 hours after the designated appointment time, much of it spent in close proximity with minimal/no safe distancing among high risk groups.

Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my husband. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached home, I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to our bedroom. I didn't knock the door because i wanted to surprise him because he wasn't expecting me at the time,But when i opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in our house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, He followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away.Out of shame my husband stopped picking my calls and finally blocked me. I used to cry day and night not until i had to explain everything to my best friend where had gone to have a peace of mind. she told me to fight for my man and not lose him to another woman. She gave me contact of Mama Sarah 603764121 and told me Mama Sarah +27603764121 will bring back my husband to me and love only me. So i contacted Mama Sarah +27603764121 and told her everything, she made a love and binding prayers for me and in just 3 days of the prayers my husband came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again. The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby,He cried and smiled with joy and happiness. We are back together and so much in love and waiting for our baby to arrive. Thanks so much Mama Sarah +27603764121 your prayers indeed work.

What actually happened:  1. Democratically elected politicians who were supposed to meet up, got kidnapped, by the military.  2. Citizens and public figures such as singers and writer got kidnapped for using their right of free speech to speak in favour of democracy.  3. Phone signals got cut off around 3 am in Naypyidaw.  4. The rest of the country followed.  5. Tv, radio and some internet providers got cut off. 6. Road to the airport got blocked.  7. ATMs and all banks are closed.  8. MWD announced that Myint Swe is the new President 9. The coup is official, and the country is in an emergency rule and the military will have full control over the country for at least one year.   We are worried about where they took our heroes such as our president and our grandma Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all the other politicians and public figures. At the same time, we fully support what they stand for and we are praying for them and also taking notes on how to become a great leader without fear.   We would like to encourage especially students to step up and scream for those who cant speak for such a time as this.    We do not know when they will cut off the internet in all part of the country and close the borders, but we still believe that together we can work towards a more sustainable future for Myanmar and see Myanmar become democratic.

A person who follows the Lord Jesus Christ has to do what pleases God instead of what pleases himself or any other person such the parents, the spouse, the children and all other people.  We must love one another and forgive each other because all of us are far from being perfect.  Let us remember to love one another so that everyone can live peacefully together.",2021-01-30,147

I tried every possible way to get him back after much begging, but to no avail and he confirmed that he had made a decision and never wanted to see me again. When I got home from work on Tuesday, I met an old friend who asked about my husband. I explained everything to him, so he told me that the only way to get my husband back was to visit a magic diffuser that helped him get through difficult times. I've never believed in spells, but I have no choice but to take your advice. the pitcher assured me that I will get my husband back the next day. What an amazing statement! I never believed, so he spoke to me and told me everything I had to do, and the next morning, surprisingly, my husband, who had not called me for the last 7 months, called to let me know he would be back. So awesome !! So he came back the same day, with much love and joy, apologizing for his mistake and for the pain he had caused me and our children.

His mother passed away and due to the nature of his work he could not visit her and didn’t get to say the last goodbye?   First, we applaud and honour the heroic self-sacrifice of our frontliners.   Next, we have those dependent, short term visit pass holders jetting around, as well as students returning for a one month school holiday from high risk countries putting the whole nation at risk.   Ironical in my personal opinion. Is fairness one area we need to work on for the next 4-5 years? Pilot test with this. Are we fair to our medical frontliners for their self-sacrifice?",2021-01-26,117

All thanks to the government to open the border too soon to infest the community with the virus.

2028,Undoing the good work done by the population. Never learn the mistakes in HK several months back where they allowed ferry crew to move around and spread.   Creating a false sense of security to allow the crew to move around.  What makes the crew totally safe on the aircraft? Toilets or meals etc.....,2020-12-30,53
2029,"Someone blasted at me when I mentioned crew should also go through sahn to keep us safe. And that someone said that we should believe the air  crew will adhere to the stringent measures when they are overseas. Fact is: The hotel staff/people around them there may also be infected so even if they really stay in the rooms, they may also be infected.

Making sure air crew take designated ground transfer and stay in their hotel away from city centre - what does it help if on the plane already you are in close contact with Covid positive passengers?

If Singapore go into another lockdown. Imagine what the economy will be like. Air Crew are not the only ones who need work. We all also need to work and earn a living, kids need to go to school. Possible to put air crew second in priority after NCID for vaccination? Safer for their families as well. Please advise them not to go gym or exercise, jogging without masks please. Think about it.

Just want to point out... please be considerate lah... elderly patient in life threatening condition already went through 2 swabs and visitor is spouse of high risk personnel still insists on visiting. Just raising an awareness and hope people will be more considerate in everyday life matters. I was put in a difficult position how to say No?

2545,"1. It will be better if restriction is lifted in phase 2, and delay phase 3 till Jun 2021, when almost 60% population are vaccinated and trace together hit 90%. This is because,  most people will take phase 3 as pre covid-19 situation and we can celebrate. There is no phase 4 and thus, it is easily mistaken,  it is all under controlled and be complacent.  This is a bad mistake.  2. This is the mental misconception which gives covid-19 more chance to grow silently even before vaccines are already injected. The war with covid-19 is not over with Asian countries having multiple waves.    3. The moment we let our guard down and focus to open up too soon, we will suffer longer. Now we must acknowledge that covid-19 is more severe and hard to break compared to SARS,  MERS,  EBOLA,  H1N1 or other coronovirus.   4. Covid-19 is the king cobra,  deadly and easy to transmit when crowds gather and vapour float around.  Washing hands and personal hygiene is not a past and must remain a habit forever.",2020-12-14,166
