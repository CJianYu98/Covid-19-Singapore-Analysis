235,I have mentioned and highlighted on this sector quite a while ago that retail are reasonably desirable jobs for local but currently still fill by many outsiders because previously such service are quite long hours till about 10am to 10pm so may be unattractive to locals . In the mist of such economic situation people got no choice but to take up such role even if working hours are not 8-5 . Singaporean probably have to change their mindset and get out of their comfort zones.As a Singaporean I want to suggest and provide some solutions to whatever ideas there can be as DPM did mentioned about listening feedbacks from the ground. The challenge is always the bridging and change that industries need to adapt to help Singaporean. Hope this can work and I can also benefit from it in the near future. Thanks ,2020-10-13,138

257,"Let‚Äôs have good inclusive schemes for the low-wage Singaporeans , not just sticking to old mind sets or western HR practices blindly ! We not only need to raise the low wages of our workers at the bottom but also have to remove the social stigma against them and give them the much needed respect and career advancement opportunities .  For example ÔºåNEA may want to think out of the box and consider an innovative proposal to draw up a common public health -essential service professional workers scheme to attract Singaporeans to join and serve as a life long career in this essential public sector . Such common service scheme respects and treasures every worker right from the bottom as a cleaner up to the top as a public health manager or superintendent. Young and old Singaporeans regardless of their educational levels or English proficiency can be encouraged to join as public health workers doing the cleaner‚Äòs job at a good starting salary of say $2000 pm for a headstart.The more positive and ambitious ones will be given ample on-the-job career training and development opportunities under the scheme to upgrade themselves to take up various higher job responsibilities Ôºåsuch as truck driverÔºå machine & tool workshop technician, auto-machine operatorÔºåplumberÔºåforemanÔºåsupervisorÔºåmanager Ôºå public health inspector Ôºåpublic health trainer Ôºå public health enforcement officerÔºåpublic health supprintendant and even as a certified public health consultant or a licensed cleaning contractor or SME boss in this industry,as they gain more practical experiences, higher job skills and relevant job interests while working and growing from the bottom to the top and to the best of their ability and hard work. If this pilot scheme proves to be successful for the essential public sector , similar common and inclusive schemes can then be widely implemented for other low wage Singaporeans to bring them into the main stream of our entire workforce in every industry so that we dont depend too much on FW to keep Singapore clean ,healthy and staying  ahead of others as a great city within a garden! More importantly ,we don‚Äôt become panic and helpless if the FW for any future reason will not or cannot come to Singapore to work any more. Could NEA or any aspiring MP care to take up or look into this essential issue that is of great concern to Singaporeans?",2020-06-25,388

This is going to cause major congestions on pathways in housing estates that are so narrow and only allow one person to walk pass at a time. How do you social distance with these ridiculous new measures.   It forces us out of the safety of our compound to add to the already crowded public areas? How is this logical? It‚Äôs also now putting us at unnecessary risk! I urge you to please look at these new guideline and do something about them as they are not practical. Condominiums should be able to exercise their own guidelines where rules like this are crazy and put residents in harms way unnecessarily. My dog is a puppy and was terrified to go on the street. We already try our best to be out quickly and come back but these rules force us to go further and so take longer times outside.
