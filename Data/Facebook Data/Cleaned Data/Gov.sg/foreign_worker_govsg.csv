It is really time to relook our employment and economic models to treat and pay those that really matter. Security guards, cleaners, hospital staff, transport people etc. We can see clearly now who are the essential people in our system. Stop increasing the top and start paying more to the bottom.

415,"Have to thank the Task Force, frontliners, contact teams and all those working tirelessly day in day out to make these measures work. Especially the patience and tolerance in allowing the citizens to still have a way of life, though limiting. Yet, be demoralized day after day by irresponsible behaviour. Even if there is to be full blown restrictions, many will still disobey and try their luck. No idea which part of this pandemic do they not understand. The fact that someone not showing symptoms can possibly infect another? The possibility of contracting pneumonia and being isolated in hospital hooked up to a ventilator to help you breath? The possibility that it can get critical and no loved ones can be with you? When all it takes is to stay home, only buy whats needed, keep a distance and come home immediately. Do the authorities have to detail everything out or even make it more strict to keep people at home? Just because last week they didnt wear a mask and nothing happened doesnt mean it cant this week. To these irresponsible people who are practically demoralizing the authorities, healthcare workers, putting them at more risk, having to chase after you, putting other citizens who want to be responsible at risk, is inappropriate. And then complain the Gov has no control? When no matter what is done, they still dont bother? People out there have familes, children and loved ones who dont want this, and neither does the Gov who is trying to protect us all. Stupidity doesnt account for bravery when risks are involved. Neither does heroism if you survive",2020-04-05,271

If ok, they can go back to work and be monitored and no mixing. They go to work by a bus and they come back by the same bus. No mixing. This is forced work routine.  Those test positive, remain in shelters and when numbers are clear, they group into one shelter or move to hospital if need be. Dorms get cleaned so that by another time, the ok workers move back. But during the next month until the virus is gone, these workers go through a managed routine. Dorm workers are time bombs. Unfortunately, they cannot be let loose until the virus is dead.

432,"I appreciate the efforts of the joint-ministries task force. A big thank you to all our medical, healthcare & other frontline staff (the police, contact tracing team & researchers etc.) who have helped Singapore in our fight against COVID-19.  The plans to manage the huge dormitory clusters are quite comprehensive but there is something more that can be done to halt the transmission of COVID-19 amongst the dormitory residents. Run more COVID-19 detection tests on all close contacts of current dormitory confirmed cases now, within capacity that our lab team can currently cope & run them now. Because simply confining the dormitory workers in their crammed dormitory will not prevent further COVID-19 transmission amongst the dormitory workers especially if they continue to stay together in the high density crammed conditions, now that we can almost be certain of  asymptomatic carriers who unintentionally infect others as they do not realized they are sick.  The bigger clusters is a result of dormitories having higher density   crammed. Enclosed space and closed proximity has remain the constant theme for transmission. It would be ideal if density at these dormitories are reduced significantly. But even doing so is not enough against insidious spread of COVID-19.  More can be done now to ""actively attack"" the virus transmissions at these dormitories, the top priority now is to identify & isolate any more potential infected carriers especially asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who may not realized they are carrier. Most men(which the bulk of these dormitories workers are, would probably have been more busy with their work at workplaces previously)& will tend to be less fastidious about COVID-19 prevention measures like safe distancing with others in dormitories & enhanced hygiene measures, so health officials may need to come out with programs to educate & emphasize to them the importance of personal hygiene(not touching face without thorough washing of hands with soap & water & after visiting toilets & before meals etc.)in their native languages for any who have difficulty comprehending English. Facilities owners will need to increase frequencies of toilet/bathing area cleaning at these dormitories as well.  With current developments of Singapore's own rapid test kits which we have been sharing with our neighboring countries, this is the time to ramp-up production of these accurate testing kits as there may now be a need to conduct more tests on any potentially infeyuuúcted dormitory  workers for early detection & isolation to prevent an even higher transmission numbers.  Contact Tracing/ Investigation Teams will need to work quickly to establish & identify any previous close contacts of current confirmed cases from the dormitories. We need to quickly mount a larger scale COVID-19 testing on these close contacts of the dormitories' confirmed cases. As many people may appear healthy now but they maybe rapidly infecting others. We need to be able to quickly identify & isolate any such persons from the crowded dormitories.  Please work out plans to test more of our dormitory  workers who had previous close contacts to current confirmed cases now.",2020-04-06,489
