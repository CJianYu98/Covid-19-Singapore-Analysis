10,I just had to walk through a void deck  event that was packed and I was terrified. Daily I have to clean up after people who have to pee and poop on toilet seats.   Likewise I handle trash disposal. It does not help that our customers do not know how to mind public hygiene. I even had to pick up a used mask.  We get people that clear their throats and threaten to spit.  Did I say I am terrified? I cannot afford to be quarantined,2020-03-21,86

Reasons include mindset (older collegues prefer to work from office), convenience (arising from unpreparedness to support staffs to wfh, comfort (air-conditioned office) etc. A simple 'spot check' will uncover the shocking reality, and I hope this will be resolved soon, otherwise no amount of 'circuit breakers' strategies will be effective ty.",2020-04-07,94

64,"The government can advise all they want about social distancing but unfortunately look at the smaller restaurants, how can they have more space between tables?  That would means less business for them (to take tables away).  Even for bigger restaurants, they may not want to turn away earnings by having lesser tables. I was just at Coffee Academic in Scotts Square last week, their tables are less than 10cm apart and they love to sit all the guests together in 1 section and closed off other areas for easy serving 🙄.  When customers asked if they can sit somewhere else; the staff said no, the other sections are closed.  Unless government impose some kind of fine to those who don’t implement distancing, many restaurants will not bother. ",2020-03-20,125

Perhaps Singapore could consider similar measures, that would minimise the risk of imported cases leading to subsequent local transmission, and sabotaging our local containment/mitigation efforts?  Also, can Singapore create a mobile app where people can opt-in to allow precise-tracking of their movements? This would allow efficient contact-tracing and quarantining of at-risk individuals. Hopefully everyone will opt-in (unless we want to make it mandatory). Also provide in the app a function for recording of key details like times/dates of onset of various symptoms.  In recent days, unlinked cases have been emerging consistently. Perhaps with better contact-tracing enhanced by technology, we'd be able to eliminate the virus from local circulation, and swiftly contain any outbreak caused by imported cases too.  This way, we can increase the likelihood that we will never come to a point where we would need to step-up social-distancing to catch-up with a runaway outbreak that we failed to prevent.",2020-03-11,156

They are going to have no one other than exhausted and brave hospital staff to see them through days or weeks of barely breathing through a ventilator until they either die or recover. They are not going to be well enough to text you.  You are not going to be able to phone the ward to check in on them regularly (staff will be too busy for that). During that time, they will be completely alone, while you sit at home waiting to hear whether they have made it through.  Imagine that person is someone you love dearly. Because it's going to be a reality for many in the coming weeks.
