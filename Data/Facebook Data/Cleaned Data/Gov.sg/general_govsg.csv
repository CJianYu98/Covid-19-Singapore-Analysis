43,The Government must pass a new law of compulsory mask wearing in public areas to curb further spread. It may appear to be a u-turn of the earlier stance. But it is crucial to stop further spread. The relatively lower number of confirmed cases in Hong Kong and Taiwan is likely a result of people there are very used to wearing masks. Unfortunately a lot of Singaporeans still go out without wearing masks at this very moment.,2020-04-10,76

Its time to lockdown before its really too late, the numbers of cases is too high for small country like us. As long as ppl are still travelling from 1 place to another, there are potential of spreading non-stop. We hope things will get better and to get back to our normal life soonest.

170,"6 local unlinked with no travel history, aged 57-67.  Perhaps the younger age groups who are infected are either not self-isolating and not visiting GPs as symptoms are too mild, or are seemingly asymptomatic.  Also, perhaps it's time to do sampling / serological testing among children who mix around with each other in church or neighbourhood communities?  Start with the communities of children of families with confirmed cases? They could be the ones insidiously providing the bridges for the virus between schools/communities/households. And while very mildly or asymptomatic, infecting the parents/grand-parents at home, thus producing unlinked cases.  Perhaps we need to be really strict about restricting children's social activities to only their immediate classmates, or even better, only a fixed cluster of a few classmates, so that we can avoid school closures, yet prevent children from being serious propagators of the virus.  Have packed meals to be consumed in classrooms instead of in canteens where children are closely packed in queues and freely mingle around.  No time to waste!",2020-03-19,165

211,"Respected Sir 		SUB: Suggestion to fight corona virus   The purpose of writing this letter is to give an idea/ suggestion to fight with the pandemic. I start with an example of A, B, C persons are washing hands and going out to buy essential needs. Let assume a person “D” a vegetable seller is infected with virus cells and throw him virus is spread to A B C again as a chain system. So the idea is very simple that government should announce a time over the country to wash the hands with sanitizer/soap, each and every person must participate on a particular time scheduled. Now hand to hand virus spread would stop completely as all peoples are washing hand simultaneously at same time. However Virus may rise again with already infected person sneezing, coughing or form the object he used earlier. For this concern, every individual must follow all W.H.O guidelines .By this a nation can control the pandemic around 90%, but one important thing to remember is washing hands must include wash of tap handle or anything which holds the incoming of water simultaneously, so that virus does not come again while turning off tap. I REPEAT AGAIN washing hands must include wash of tap handle or anything which holds the incoming of water simultaneously, so that virus does not come again while turning off tap, else the entire concept is of no-use as virus may come again while turning off the tap. Now after ONE TIME HAND WASH COUNTRY WIDE every individual must wash hand while coming out from home and must not touch anything so that virus will not comes not out from home. This process should be repeated maximum one month for safety. As virus will die automatically on surface maximum days available on who website which is not more than month. This concept will control coronavirus much more than lockdown please correct me if iam wrong.  Regards  Noorulanwar  (Twitter @anwaraap)  India Telangana karimnagar",2020-04-03,329

As a typical and normal thinking person, or in my own limited understanding, I can only guess the follow possibilities :  1. Too big a figure to disclose, and need to seek higher instruction or approval to disclose? 2. Figure is too impossible to disclose without big reaction or repercussion from the public? Trying to think of a way to change or conceal or delay this, or anything to mitigate? 3. Or maybe think of a new strategy, might as well hide and don’t disclose to public anymore? 4. Or maybe someone famous kena, or a number of famous people kena?

361," saw  the  movie  “the  perfect  storm”, in  order  not  let go  the  fish  they  catch  and  can’t bear  to  let  go  the  harvest they  had  on  their  fishing  boat, not willing  to  let the  fish  they  catch  go  down the  drain,  the  captain  decide  to  take  the  risky  path  so that  they  could  try  to  save  the  fish they  caught  and gamble  the life  of  the   whole crew  and  sail  through  the  eye  of  the  hurricane!  The  end  result?  the  boat  did not  survive the  storm, and  the  boat  sink, and  all  the  crew  and  captain die  ....  Another good movie to catch if you like to understand about leadership and the similar situation like we dealing with covid19 virus pandemic now.  What did the captain choose and prioritize? Money or Crew Life?  Almost 3 and more weeks ago, When USA can cancel all NBA and all big games, and Europe can stop all the soccer games, and even 2020 Olympics had to be postponed until next year, know how much economic losses are these to these people and countries? But a responsible man should do what it is necessary to do when they have to do what is needed to save lives / reduce / minimize lives losses, and not just thinking so much on economic gain or how to get economic gain like getting and encouraging own people go for staycation to support hotel industry instead,  going to patron and visit and support own zoo, own parks, etc ... (in the middle of a deadly covid19 virus breakout or pandemic???) . What is the point of economic gain when lives are lost?! And Economic gain for who??? Are some people lives just so cheap???  The cancelling of all the big money spinning games, etc. That already show how serious the situation is and how it could be... (imagine if US and Europe don’t shut down all these earlier, the infection numbers would have been much higher). It is unfortunately that the cooler weather and society culture and mentality and way of lives played a part in the virus spreading more wilder in some parts of the world! Other/Some countries leaders should take this as a heed! Instead, there are still people watching the neighbours’ house burning， and adopted “wait and see attitude” but did nothing much but self praise ownselves, think it is okie that the own house is not on fire, so just watch, and don’t take decisive measures?   Why now U-turn about the mask but yet no apology to the many and hundreds and thousands (or maybe even more) of people infected?  Also, if more “aggressive” or more urgent and swift action made 6-8 weeks or earlier ago, then the virus wouldn’t be spreading like this now. Why for a long time, adopt a “wait and see attitude”  and trying “to have the cake and eat it”.   Know what’s 2 steps behind?  Also ... Know what happen when one started wrong footed? So now, are they trying to catch up for the lost time and imposing overkill measures making life so much difficult for so many normal people? Would this be necessary when initial steps and measures are good and done properly?  If virus can be stop spreading better at the beginning, then less people will be infected, and not to mention dying. Closing school early or earlier can prevent many children and students and teachers being infected!  We have yet to see how bad this virus pandemic can do to mankind and Singapore ... So never take things lightly or be stubborn and complacent and keep having and playing politics and trying to force an elections instead of focusing on dealing with the virus wholeheartedly (without prejudice on the selection and consultation of real talent and not nominating own people) to  fight a unprecedented virus!  Know what is problem  with  1 party group thinking? Know the meaning of “group think”? Try google this. ",2020-04-09,651

And women wing event?  Also daily  MRT  and park  clusters also?  Base  on  US  and  many  countries  infection  figures, ( my poor guess  is)  we may  have  the  potential  to  reach  between  6000-9000  infections or  more! Only time  will tell ...  but then, if we  continue  to  think  that won’t happen, and   when that  really happen, how are  our  medical  infrastructure and  support  going  to  cope, especially if   I have  under guess  the  figures?  I wish I have over-estimated the figure. Hope I am wrong. But what it I am not wrong, or even under estimated the figures?  Importantly,  We do  not  merely  plan  by  best  case  scenario!  Instead,  We should  and we have to  plan  for worst  case  scenario!  How many ventilators do we have? and how many is stand-by for covid19? Not to forget there are many other type of illness and condition that need the ventilators! How many extra is for covid19 use or standby?  How about oxygen tanks? How about covid19 test kits? And how many trained nurse for ventilators and etc, as not all know how to use the ventilators? Etc  Now u turn about mask wearing but yet no apology to the many, hundreds and thousands and maybe even more infected?!  Know  what  is  fake  gold  standard?  Know  what  is  excuses  after    excuses after excuses? Why  not  admiting  their mistakes  and  cry?  Do  these people  Even  deserve the taxpayers’ multi millions  pay  package?

These few weeks we are all in the same battle.  To add on, Wonder if people are ignorant or complacent.  Government has been doing what they have to do, it is now the society, right down to individual, to practice social responsibility... one such irresponsible act will trigger a massive and exhausting tracing process, which not only will put our system to stretch but also the society at risk.

Please also launch some form of public education on how to wear and dispose of masks properly as many I have seen are not wearing or handling them properly, which is as bad as not wearing one. The execution of the strategy in its detail is important if we are to succeed in limiting the phenomenal increase in cases, especially amongst local unlinked cases. Thank you.",2020-04-14,152

545,"When my husband left me for another lady I was so hurt and I used to cry every day. Whenever I could miss him I could just close my bedroom and cry because I never wanted my kids to see me crying. It was tough times to endure the stress and at work, I could not perform well being a nurse I work with many people but I could be moody and could even lose tempers for small things my colleagues complained and I signed many warning before the matron. I tried so much to move on but it was hard I love my husband sometimes I could see him in my dreams wake up thinking he would come but nothing, I used to SMS him but no response calling him he never picked my calls and finally blocked all my numbers not even to support the kids. many times I tried to talk to his family and friends they tried their best but he had completely changed and he regarded everyone as a stranger kept a deaf ear on everyone who tried to talk to him. I resorted to sangomas and spell casters but not even at one time did i see a change. I started drinking alcohol because I couldn't handle the stress but as you all know once you are drunk you are out of stress it could be worse once the alcohol is out . I can't forget the day I came back home and our firstborn asked me where is Daddy I miss him a lot why he is no longer coming home I never gave a right answer I went in the bedroom started crying at this time. I thought a lot of bad things but again because I loved my kids I knew I had to be strong because it was my role to play as a mother. I phoned one family friend she is such a darling to me and she gave me a number of Dr. Mama SHAMIRAH+27790792882 she said she had helped her two years ago I had lost all my trust in everyone but she strengthened me and gave me the go-ahead to try Dr. Mama SHAMIRAH+27790792882. I thought about it with all my heart and finally decided to contact Dr. Mama SHAMIRAH I made everything known to her and she said that we had a future with my husband and we are compatible but the lady had used something on my man which had diverted his feelings away from not only me but also from the whole family. I was so angry at this point and I asked how-how was possible to get him back. Dr. Mama SHAMIRAH assured me that I would get my happiness back in three days Before I began the prayer with Dr. Mama SHAMIRAH, I sent her my info with that of my husband then I was given the instructions of the prayers we did together over the phone and after the fast day my husband texted me saying hi it was not a big message but I was so happy for that small massage I never replied though and after 48 hours of the prayer my husband came home I was not home by that time I was by neighbours I heard the car hooting and rushed to see who was it. He asked me to sit in the car we talked he was so romantic and he asked my forgiveness since then our lives have been progressing both in relationships and finances. I have written my story to tell everyone who may be in tears that I was like that before. If you can contact Dr. Mama Shamirah Call/Whatsapp+27790792882 you will get help. Thank you mama you can contact Dr. Mama Shamirah Call/Whatsapp+27790792882 you will get help. Thank you, mama",2020-06-14,635

We would need to monitor the situation for another 1-2 weeks as recently implemented stringent measures (like compulsory mask wearing) to see if we able to have a decline in daily numbers.

716,"First 1000 new cases in 70 days?  2nd 1000 new cases in about 8 days?  3rd 1000 new cases in about 4 day?  4th 1000 new cases in maybe 3 days  (about 2)!!!  Which part looks like the preventive and measures are working BEFORE they finally decided to close school and shut down work place? Which part look like what super multi-millions dollars club and team of leadership should produce?  §§§  saw  the  movie  “the  perfect  storm”, in  order  not  let go  the  fish  they  catch  and  can’t bear  to  let  go  the  harvest they  had  on  their  fishing  boat, not willing  to  let the  fish  they  catch  go  down the  drain,  the  captain  decide  to  take  the  risky  path  so that  they  could  try  to  save  the  fish they  caught  and gamble  the life  of  the   whole crew  and  sail  through  the  eye  of  the  hurricane!  The  end  result?  the  boat  did not  survive the  storm, and  the  boat  sink, and  all  the  crew  and  captain die  ....  Another good movie to catch if you like to understand about leadership and the similar situation like we dealing with covid19 virus pandemic now.  What did the captain choose and prioritize? Money or Crew Life?  Almost 3 and more weeks ago, When USA can cancel all NBA and all big games, and Europe can stop all the soccer games, and even 2020 Olympics had to be postponed until next year, know how much economic losses are these to these people and countries? But a responsible man should do what it is necessary to do when they have to do what is needed to save lives / reduce / minimize lives losses, and not just thinking so much on economic gain or how to get economic gain like getting and encouraging own people go for staycation to support hotel industry instead,  going to patron and visit and support own zoo, own parks, etc ... (in the middle of a deadly covid19 virus breakout or pandemic???) . What is the point of economic gain when lives are lost?! And Economic gain for who??? Are some people lives just so cheap???  The cancelling of all the big money spinning games, etc. That already show how serious the situation is and how it could be... (imagine if US and Europe don’t shut down all these earlier, the infection numbers would have been much higher). It is unfortunately that the cooler weather and society culture and mentality and way of lives played a part in the virus spreading more wilder in some parts of the world! Other/Some countries leaders should take this as a heed! Instead, there are still people watching the neighbours’ house burning， and adopted “wait and see attitude” but did nothing much but self praise ownselves, think it is okie that the own house is not on fire, so just watch, and don’t take decisive measures?   Why now U-turn about the mask but yet no apology to the many and hundreds and thousands (or maybe even more) of people infected?  Also, if more “aggressive” or more urgent and swift action made 4-6-8 weeks or earlier ago, then the virus wouldn’t be spreading like this now. Why for a long time, adopt a “wait and see attitude”  and trying “to have the cake and eat it”.   Know what’s 2 steps behind?  Also ... Know what happen when one started wrong footed? So now, are they trying to catch up for the lost time and imposing overkill measures making life so much difficult for so many normal people? Would this be necessary when initial steps and measures are good and done properly?  If virus can be stop spreading better at the beginning, then less people will be infected, and not to mention dying. Closing school early or earlier can prevent many children and students and teachers being infected!  We have yet to see how bad this virus pandemic can do to mankind and Singapore ... So never take things lightly or be stubborn and complacent and keep having and playing politics and trying to force an elections instead of focusing on dealing with the virus wholeheartedly (without prejudice on the selection and consultation of real talent and not nominating own people) to  fight a unprecedented virus!  Also, Another great classic example ... another know the story of titanic or watch the movie “titanic” based on the real event?  Know what happen to the passengers when the self claim best ship ever build sink?  Know what is the problem with 1 party group thinking? Know the meaning of “group think”? Try google this.  1 party system can pass any bills or laws they like... without obstruction or real contest ?  Btw, 1 party NK also claim no covid19 case in their country? ",2020-04-16,771

I never believed that anyone can solve someone's problems.I could rudely reply to the posts about the healers with insults little did i know that one day they will help me. The most grateful news of how my situation changed after a long period of suffering in an abusive marriage. My husband used to drink a lot and he loses all his mind and he could beat me up for no reason, I tried to settle matters with him but he kept a deaf ear, the worst thing was that I had failed to give him any kid, I conceived him twice but had miscarriages this made all his family to hate me and considered me as a person with bad luck but in reality I wanted to have kids so much. I looked for help in many places. Some used to tell me they could see darkness around my life and others could say bad luck while others could not give a serious reason behind my problems.and i that made mi to spend a lot reaching to the exetend of selling some of my things trying to get a better life with my husband bt i wouldn't loss hope,because of the situation i was facing! They all used to promise me good results but none could deliver, Most of the times when hardships come to us friends are few I was left alone crying every day and as a result, I lost my job because I couldn't perform well. Many friends left me and my husband filed a divorce and I became a laughing topic but I never lost hope. It was last year when I saw people writing about Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 and I felt interested to contact her one more time. I made my problems known to Mama who advised me to be cleansed from all that was making me suffer and to open up my luck in everything I do. I was asked to buy materials to help me which I did we begun the prayer and results were delivered in Four days. I thought it would be so easy but some stones remained unturned till last week when my husband came up with un apology to me for all he has been doing, he confessed for cheating and I forgave him and finally yesterday when i went for the check-up and the Mama confirmed that am two weeks pregnant with no complications. Am hoping to be a mother soon.

Why 2 week is because it is a known period whereby the symptoms truly reveal itself.. After all the hidden infected person are identified out for treatment then we can consider as safe to move out... Temperature taking is not going to help as the virus might already being badly transmitted by the time the person infected had high temperature on his head.  Safe distancing is never gonna be possible for our public transport as we can see it daily... Similar to many places whereby the luxury of space is not there.

We all know that the virus shows only mild symptoms to start with but the victim can start spreading it already even during this period. So we cant afford anymore to wait for few days  for symptoms to get serious n then do testing just because we do not have adequate testing facilities.  We must quickly get to a level close to on demand or even drive through testing. Only then we could rapidly confirm an infection and isolate. Unlike today where we doctors wait for few days just by issueing an MC and leving a big question mark whether the person is already infected or not!  Please update on how and by when anyone in doubt can get testing results in a matter of hours n not days.  Thanks.,2020-04-02,200

1394,"MOH  -  There is no need to keep looking at data - the government needs to look into the manufacturing of more masks for the population.   Definitely the “don’t wear a mask unless sick” cannot be advised anymore because there are infected ones who dont even know they are sick. Airborne transmission has already been conducted and shown to be possible Esp when face to face conversation at close quarters.  There should be a requirement for sales assistants and frontline staff or F&B staff to wear masks. Those taking public transport should also wear masks. Unless you are walking out in the open and just running a short errand without conversing with anyone, then maybe it’s ok not to mask because stocks are limited.  However, the government cannot keep using limited stocks as an excuse. Please look into having our own masks factory here.   Article: The director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control is advocating for people to wear masks to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.  People should continue to wear masks in the office, meeting rooms, lifts and on public transport*, even though *they don’t need to do so at home, in open air, or in an environment where there is good airflow and no crowds*.  This is because droplets and close contact transmit the virus, he said: “Droplets play a very important role – you’ve got to wear a mask, *because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth*.”  He added that because people may have the virus but be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, face masks help to prevent droplets that carry the virus from reaching and infecting others.”  https://mothership.sg/2020/03/not-wearing-mask-mistake/",2020-04-02,279
1395,The only way to stop any more new cases is to take the short-term pain to have a total lockdown whereby everyone is staying at home for a period of 2 weeks.... Why 2 week is because it is a known period whereby the symptoms truly reveal itself.. After all the hidden infected person are identified out for treatment then we can consider as safe to move out... Temperature taking is not going to help as the virus might already being badly transmitted by the time the person infected had high temperature on his head.  Safe distancing is never gonna be possible for our public transport as we can see it daily... Similar to many places whereby the luxury of space is not there.  Compulsory wearing of face mask is an alternative but if possible total lockdown is better to save the country once and for all..,2020-04-02,144

The reason is.. it can minimize saliva droplets floating in the air and infecting others when people talk, sneeze or cough without proper covering of mouth and nose as there are still many irresponsible people around. In Thailand and many countries have already doing that. No commuters are allowed into public transport if they are not masked up.",2020-04-02,97

2353,"It's better not to judge a book by its cover. I had always talked rubbish about spiritual healers because i was living a luxurious life. I never believed that anyone can solve someone's problems.I could rudely reply to the posts about the healers with insults little did i know that one day they will help me. The most grateful news of how my situation changed after a long period of suffering in an abusive marriage. My husband used to drink a lot and he loses all his mind and he could beat me up for no reason, I tried to settle matters with him but he kept a deaf ear, the worst thing was that I had failed to give him any kid, I conceived him twice but had miscarriages this made all his family to hate me and considered me as a person with bad luck but in reality I wanted to have kids so much. I looked for help in many places. Some used to tell me they could see darkness around my life and others could say bad luck while others could not give a serious reason behind my problems.and i that made mi to spend a lot reaching to the exetend of selling some of my things trying to get a better life with my husband bt i wouldn't loss hope,because of the situation i was facing! They all used to promise me good results but none could deliver, Most of the times when hardships come to us friends are few I was left alone crying every day and as a result, I lost my job because I couldn't perform well. Many friends left me and my husband filed a divorce and I became a laughing topic but I never lost hope. It was last year when I saw people writing about Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 and I felt interested to contact her one more time. I made my problems known to Mama who advised me to be cleansed from all that was making me suffer and to open up my luck in everything I do. I was asked to buy materials to help me which I did we begun the prayer and results were delivered in Four days. I thought it would be so easy but some stones remained unturned till last week when my husband came up with un apology to me for all he has been doing, he confessed for cheating and I forgave him and finally yesterday when i went for the check-up and the Mama confirmed that am two weeks pregnant with no complications. Am hoping to be a mother soon. Any woman out there facing the same in your love life please don't be ashamed of looking for help just contact Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 privately by either a Call or Whatsapp",2020-06-10,465

2468,"New cluster can easily start again if not everyone is serious. HDB for one is not stopping people from moving house. In resale chain so long as one buyer insists of moving he can claim against his seller so the whole chain of buyer/seller have to move. Most families prefer to move after CB since you cannot do renovation and also is not safe to move... many people are forced to move during CB period. Imagine the danger imposed to the families, the mover and the community. If HDB is serious they could have imposed rule to push completion date after CB and that way they could have reduced the movement and help the fight. After the epidemic history will judge the poor handling by HDB for not being serious in helping the people. This is very sad.",2020-04-25,139

It comes with lots of challenges like lost marriages, lost love, financial and job problems and so many more, but still there has always been a solution to every challenges that we face in life. Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my boyfriend. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached his flat I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to his room. When I knocked, he allowed me to enter because he wasn't expecting me at the time, but when I opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in his house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, he followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away. I reached home and cried a lot until i told my best friend everything and she told me to fight for my man and not lose him to another woman. She gave Mama Shamirah contact(+27790792882) and told Mama Shamirah will bring back my boyfriend to me and love and only me. I contacted Mama Shamirah and told her everything and she made a love and binding prayers for me and in 1 day of the prayers my boyfriend came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again. The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby, he cried and smiled with joy and happiness. We are back together and so much in love and waiting for our baby to arrive. Thanks so much Mama Shamirah your prayers indeed work. You can call or whatsapp Mama Shamirah on +27790792882 incase you are passing through the same situation. Don't be discouraged by what people may tell you that even don't know the situation you are going through, all that matters are the results so feel free to contact her on Call/Whatsapp +27790792882 0r Email: mamashamirahsince1970@gmail.com.

2663,"Seems the FW spread keeps continuing, as are the new clusters specific industrial locations and/or individual buildings? Regardless, it's pretty obvious prolonged close contact with asymptomatic/symptomatic individuals is more likely to get infected, considering the number of cluster cases in SG. It isn't very comforting either when community cases don't seem to be coming down, and fluctuating between low and high numbers each day. Are there still asymptomatic cases walking around in the community? Also, the easing of measures may be a good thing to return to normality, however, the long drawn out CB period has also a risk of complacency and false confidence, where there could be some who have begun to wear masks less, or relax their own safe practices. Many move around short distances with no mask on, even though there are others around, some are dropping off food or items for families, which questions if they are actual delivery workers or relatives? There seems to also be an increased movement of people and households as we grow into the CB. Whole families visit supermarkets still and don't seem to be questioned by the staff or ambassadors. And with the festive period approaching, there is an increased movement within Housing Areas where items and packages are being transferred and delivered/dropped off, especially during the late hours of the night. Unless they are official (approved) delivery workers, its curious if they really are as they seem to mingle around the home and void decks for some time unlike deliveries who come and go quickly. Lastly, can the Straits Times or some authority, sticky or make consistent, a compilation of ALL the restrictions during this CB period as a one stop place of reference? Understand that restrictions have been made to address the varied areas of work, but I find many still are unsure, unaware, unknowing of most of these restrictions and how they effect normal day activities. As it is, the restrictions made and changed come and go inbetween headlines and posts. I believe alot are still very uninformed.",2020-05-08,340

3016,"Every wrong decision cost lives. Be wise. Jogging is not an essential activity. There are so many exercises to do indoors. Why must insist on jogging and joggers expel so much droplets when they run. If they have the virus how? Also they draw in a lot of oxygen too. They could be inhaling deeply those infected aerosol particles. For the love of your family and your own life, stay home. A run is not worth dying for. If it is so, one’s life is meaningless.   Do read the excellent article Joyce Tan shared.   https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/coronavirus-runners-can-infect-you-with-covid19-even-if-youre-2m-away/news-story/b916247fa481018bae6ce75925654ed1?utm_source=News.com.au&utm_campaign=EditorialSF&utm_medium=Facebook&utm_content=SocialFlow",2020-04-14,95
3017,"The government took a gamble asking Singapore residents to wear mask only when one is sick. This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

If not the more stringent measures that you say will be futile. When the rest of Sg are abiding. All it takes is for these exemptions to spread the virus. From single digits to double digits to triple digits and more?  Don't get me wrong. The measures are good long awaited for. Better late than never. But have some sense on the matter. These exemptions actively breaths, pant. If they are carriers. It is as bad as coughing and sneezing everywhere they went. All that cross their path gets infected and infect those they go back to.

To condense ALL the theories regarding purpose of masks..Perhaps your task force might want to re-think to simply say""IT WILL BE AN OFFENCE IF ANYONE  IS SEEN  NOT WEARING A MASK WHEN IN CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH STRANGERS OUTSIDE THEIR HOMES"".

3531,"Higher viral-load often leads to greater disease severity, and greater infectiousness in the infected!  Even at home, it helps to maintain distance, ventilation, etc. .  Distancing measures etc. don't only help reduce chances of infection. They might also reduce severity of infection if infected!  Also, this article supports my theory (posted earlier) that the coronavirus, having started out with mild/undetected community transmission, could gradually become increasingly severe, due to factors that lead to increasingly-greater viral-loads from continual transmissions.  Thus, it is important to test as many people as possible, even those with the mildest of symptoms. Or else we end up with possibly what's currently happening in Singapore - the severe cases were eliminated at the start, but the mild/undetected cases carried on seeding other mild/undetected cases, such that severe cases start to emerge again, with a bigger wave of detected cases than the first time round, due to exponential transmission.  (Recently, a friend had both fever and cough but was not referred for testing. Furthermore, Singapore appears to not test anyone that recovers within the 5-day sick-leave period. Thus, many of these might be the mild cases that are being missed, and which contact-tracing isn't implemented to ring-fence the virus. And contact-tracing would often start very late, due to the 5-day delay.)  https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/how-does-the-coronavirus-behave-inside-a-patient",2020-04-01,204

The proposed test:  Place the COVID-19 virus in two test tubes mounted with high-powered electron-microscopes and HD-resolution-coloured cameras to take continuous photos/video of the changes to sample A [give the DL continuously by practitioners] and sample B [no DL to be given to the sample].     Please see photos on the tests done to fresh strawberries with DL.  I hope worldwide practitioners reading this post [hopefully those with direct links to bio-research labs] will make the connections and arrangements to have the lab-controlled tests done soonest possible.

Also, conduct controlled-lab tests of the common-cold flu germs, dengue germs, malaria germs, TB germs, etc.  We have been told that Divine Light is not for healing of illness.   Rather Divine Light is for the spiritual purification of the impurities in the withered soul, the mental and the physical aspects of human beings to cleanse and prolong their lives.

Giving a simple example that these people, with an income that does not qualify them for HDB flat but can hardly make it for a private condominium, are also Singaporean who are struggling to make ends meet, especially so if one is the sole bread winner of the family, and with the sudden loss of income during such period, which is never their choice.

In the end he said I’m not eligible as I need to have all 4 symptoms fever, cough, running nose and sore throat in order to get the subsided rate. Mentioned my fever was not due to Covid19. In your video, you mentioned that if one have any one of the symptom, as singaporean will get subsided rate.

4683,"Dear PM,  I really like the adoption of digital technology (like tracetogether or wearable device) to guard our public health in this pandemic, and move us quickly to the right direction for the phased re-opening of economy.  However, there will be foreseeable resistance and barrier for the effective use and implementation of wearable contact tracing device/app due to the fundamental trust issue.  I feel it’d be a good opportunity for our Government to address the data protection/privacy legislation to assure public that the data collected about them during this pandemic (and/or future ones) will be handled in consistent manners as it is intended for.  Such use is solely for public health purposes, in the interest and for the benefit of general public, and will be shut down as soon as it no longer serves the purpose.  More importantly, there is no sharing of information with other governmental agencies and/or private entities, and such information should not end up in unexpected places for other surveillance purposes.    In fact, a national approach would prob be more productive and preferable than individual vendors (NTUC, medical hall, salon, etc) holding personal data of individuals for safe entry implementation (subjecting public to unintended risk of personal data violation/leaks).  Hopefully we can hear more updates on the data privacy issue/action plans/process that would be critical to the successful implementation.  Thank you. ",2020-06-08,232

It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse. General travel bans can make things worse”",2020-02-10,158

5290,"1. This covid-19 is here to stay for a year or more as we know. To avoid large gathering,  this includes creative ways to organise national event or festive events such as National Day Parade,  National Day Ralley,  carnivals,  count down year end party,  mid year Singapore Sale,  and multiple exhibitions (IT fair, food fair,  baby fair,  book fair, NATAS, and etc).   2. For all above events,  it is hard to reduce it to 250 pax per session. If we are to proceed above 250 pax with preventive measures,  any unexpected clusters may trigger more infection and new cases. We are living in a crowded space,  not likely to keep 1 meter apart wherever we go. In trains,  buses during peak hours,  if we can have a 20cm distance parameter,  we are lucky.    3. Major events will hit many vendors hard due to repeated reschedule and low turn out rate. and PA  needs new ways to ensure community activities are not compromise or limited just to digital platform. Brisk walking,  block party,  National Day Dinner celebration usually hit more than 250 pax per session at GRC level.   4. A working committee should be set up at governmental level to look beyond short term with industry MICE key stakeholders on ways to draw crowds to keep business as usual. Rebate on business cost is not long term solution.   5. On hygiene part,  repeated message on hawker centers to broadcast and remind all patrons to return their tray after use,  wash hands frequently before and after meal,  and sneeze with tissue are relatively effective than just social distancing.  Even without social distancing,  if we are socially responsible to wash hands,  wear mask when sick,  return tray after use,  we can minimise the risk.",2020-03-14,281

5416,Can you please Talk about Children??! I am glad So far we are in better position in the world than many other Developed Countries.. But Take a minute and think are we being Over confident??! What if our confidence doesn't work out ?! Seeing The World Struggle... Seriously I want you to rethink once...  Do we really need to live Normal now and Risk our lives?! Isn't Disruption is better than loosing Lives? Why there is a need to open Schools?! Isn't it prevention is better than Cure...?! Ofcourse no one Guarrentee anything... but at least We should do The maximum so that we don't end up Giving more pressure to HEALTH care professionals ... Even after almost 2 months of 1st case we are still seeing new clusters ..The numbers might be low... But still we didn't flatten the Local Curve.and..Just that we are able to track doesn't mean That we are in safe position.. isn't it?! What if The virus is mutated and The one Now we are seeing is More dangerous one??! Aren't we being so selfish by risking Innocent children Life's? Also Many young children are having existing Health issues like Asthma.. Bronchitis etc Why not at least give Option for People who wants to opt for E Learning!?  How much of social(physical) DISTANCING measures are We able to implement in Public buses and MRTs also in schools? Aren't each school has more than 250 Pupils? And All dismissal and arrival at same time? Aren't many parents and grandparents Dropping off and Picking up Children at same timings?  ((What about the children taking Public Transport?!)))  Doesn't we have Very good E learning technologies available which We can easily utilise in this crisis? Finally if you are really confident about the Situation please let us know What sort of treatment is available and how much and how many medical supplies we have (surplus) ...?! Also How many Critical cases at one Time MOH can easily handle?!  (Because After explaining about National Stock pile of food supplies... Many people stopped worrying about food ...including me).. Same way give us more Information at least then we won't worry much ..and we will also feel confident... (Because Looking at the world numbers I Am much worried ..and getting a feel that this virus is Sneaky and Scary and not going to Spare any one or any country)  Please give us More assurance...Thank you,2020-03-22,386

5610," I have been married several times and all my marriages ended up in divorce because i couldn't have kids.I tried almost every specialist in southafrica and spent over R10,000 but with no positive results, until just recently out of desperation i spoke to one of my friends about my problems because of the changes in my husband's behaviour who i believe was considering marrying another wife according to his family.My friend advised me to see a spell caster but since i come from a religious family i didn't take it seriously but because i wanted to save my marriage and i was tired of living a miserable life i agreed to my friend's suggestion since i had nothing to lose. She suggested that we can call a lady called Dr. Mama Shamirah who helped her some time back to recover her stolen car and other properties.I called Dr. Mama Shamirah and explained to her about my situation and she agreed to help me.We started serious spiritual prayers and my sisters you can't believe it that after 2days my current husband came and confessed to me about his new relationship and he was ready to drop it and work on our marriage.

5691,"I was at Great World City today at about 1030 to try to buy groceries and the crowd was dumbfounding. I was amazed by the profile of the groups there. Grandparents cuddling their grandchildren while saying goodbye after meeting up with their extended families for a shopping trip together. The government did say not to visit the elderly but didn’t say anything about meeting up with them elsewhere so creative ways of meeting up have been used. Young families with toddlers and babies in tow. It is no wonder community cases do not die off altogether. Adult men who look strong enough to handle groceries on their own but were accompanied by equally strong looking younger men for the grocery shopping trip. We are very good at following the letter but not the spirit of the law. Elsewhere, customers who wear their masks under their noses continue to be served. Hand sanitizers that require touch operation by each and everyone instead of hands-free operation are in place in public domains. I hope we can put a little thought to this and nail the issue once and for all. The malls / shops should be made responsible to ensure that whole groups are not allowed in and also reduce touchpoints as much as possible.",2020-05-25,211
5693,"It's better not to judge a book by its cover. I had always talked rubbish about spiritual healers because i was living a luxurious life. I never believed that anyone can solve someone's problems.I could rudely reply to the posts about the healers with insults little did i know that one day they will help me. The most grateful news of how my situation changed after a long period of suffering in an abusive marriage. My husband used to drink a lot and he loses all his mind and he could beat me up for no reason, I tried to settle matters with him but he kept a deaf ear, the worst thing was that I had failed to give him any kid, I conceived him twice but had miscarriages this made all his family to hate me and considered me as a person with bad luck but in reality I wanted to have kids so much. I looked for help in many places. Some used to tell me they could see darkness around my life and others could say bad luck while others could not give a serious reason behind my problems.and i that made mi to spend a lot reaching to the exetend of selling some of my things trying to get a better life with my husband bt i wouldn't loss hope,because of the situation i was facing! They all used to promise me good results but none could deliver, Most of the times when hardships come to us friends are few I was left alone crying every day and as a result, I lost my job because I couldn't perform well. Many friends left me and my husband filed a divorce and I became a laughing topic but I never lost hope. It was last year when I saw people writing about Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 and I felt interested to contact her one more time. I made my problems known to Mama who advised me to be cleansed from all that was making me suffer and to open up my luck in everything I do. I was asked to buy materials to help me which I did we begun the prayer and results were delivered in Four days. I thought it would be so easy but some stones remained unturned till last week when my husband came up with un apology to me for all he has been doing, he confessed for cheating and I forgave him and finally yesterday when i went for the check-up and the Mama confirmed that am two weeks pregnant with no complications. Am hoping to be a mother soon.

6909,"Respected Sir 		SUB: Suggestion to fight corona virus   The purpose of writing this letter is to give an idea/ suggestion to fight with the pandemic. I start with an example of A, B, C persons are washing hands and going out to buy essential needs. Let assume a person “D” a vegetable seller is infected with virus cells and throw him virus is spread to A B C again as a chain system. So the idea is very simple that government should announce a time over the country to wash the hands with sanitizer/soap, each and every person must participate on a particular time scheduled. Now hand to hand virus spread would stop completely as all peoples are washing hand simultaneously at same time. However Virus may rise again with already infected person sneezing, coughing or form the object he used earlier. For this concern, every individual must follow all W.H.O guidelines .By this a nation can control the pandemic around 90%, but one important thing to remember is washing hands must include wash of tap handle or anything which holds the incoming of water simultaneously, so that virus does not come again while turning off tap. I REPEAT AGAIN washing hands must include wash of tap handle or anything which holds the incoming of water simultaneously, so that virus does not come again while turning off tap, else the entire concept is of no-use as virus may come again while turning off the tap. Now after ONE TIME HAND WASH COUNTRY WIDE every individual must wash hand while coming out from home and must not touch anything so that virus will not comes not out from home. This process should be repeated maximum one month for safety. As virus will die automatically on surface maximum days available on who website which is not more than month. This concept will control coronavirus much more than lockdown please correct me if iam wrong.  Regards  Noorulanwar  (Twitter @anwaraap)  India Telangana karimnagar",2020-04-03,329

7069,"1. New normal will surface after 1st Jun 2020. Several habits such as wearing mask when leaving house well or unwell,  washing hands with soaps often,  social distancing and telecommuting whenever possible till end 2020 must be enforced, like it or not. Safe entry is not a 1 time exercise but on going routine till end 2020 in public places.   2. Regretfully,  Covid-19 is here to stay for long unlike SARS,  MERS,  EBOLA, TB,  and H1N1. In fact, healthcare resources are already put to test, stretching their limit and other chronic illness patient treatment in hospital should not be neglected.   3. Travel and entertainment sectors cannot be closed forever as it kills their business and dampen our economy. Singaporeans being confined at home are dying for oversea holiday to relax and release stress. However,  crowd attracted events such as exhibition,  open party,  concerts,  carnivals,  night market, festival celebration will need to be halt in 2020.   4. No more open space IT show., food fair,  baby fair,  natas,  furniture fair,  National Day parade,  Great sales,  Christmas Party  or year end countdown must be held.  It may extend to 2021 if Singapore suffers 2nd or 3rd waves,  which is probably due to condense population.   5.Opening these sectors although gradually will give covid-19 more chance to creep and grown among our community.  Until vaccines are tested and proven effective,  which is most likely another 12 months from now,  it is high risk to have these sectors open.    6. Unemployment in these sectors will rise and structural unemployment may trigger negative sentimental,  frustration  and more crimes. Social issues will infuriate more pressure to already existing crisis.   Sadly,  this is the new normal in 2020 and beyond we need to live with. We need to face it and acknowledge the once in a lifetime agony.",2020-05-16,282

Being a small country with limited ICU,  hospitals and healthcare workers,  we cannot be at the service for the world, nursing imported cases. This is a good move.   2. If such move is made a month earlier,  things will be better.  However,  it is never too late to impose harsh measure now to contain it.  We know the cases will continue to spike to a few more hundreds in months to come and Singaporeans will be uneasy not able to travel.   3. Travel agencies will be worst hit with high operating cost and some smaller agencies force to end business. These are short term sacrifices to make for long term solution and total eradication of covid-19 spread.    4. More stringent measures can include closing or shortening working hours of non essential large gathering place such as pub, KTV,  cinema,  spa,  and large scale events,  encouraging non facing clients to work from home at least for next 60 days.  5. Too many resources,  effort and time are spent tracing suspected cases. There are other serious crimes to be solved,  national security issue to guard upon.  We cannot lose sight on any of them.   6. Old rules apply. Despite all the measures,  seeking everyone to be socially responsible to stay out if unwell,  maintain personal hygiene,  wash hands before meals and after meals, build up stamina by exercising outdoor,  cut down on mass gathering,  and return tray after meal outside.

The mask is something we wear to to protect our respiratory system and must be of the highest hygiene standards. Some wipes contain alcohol or other chemicals, traces of which left behind after washing will cause irritation to the nose and/or other severe respiratory problems.  MP Sun Xueling has been posting many great ideas on how to make reusable masks on FB. Go check it out.",2020-04-30,81

7389,"Proposed by a GROUP of student researchers 🤦🏻‍♀️  My goodness. You sure this is washable? Why need to wash your hands before making and not washing the mask after making? If you wash your hands before making, you need to make sure you need to wash all the tools before using as well. Isn’t using needle and thread way better than using staples which can pose a risk when you wear or wash the mask? And with that masking tape, confirm damage after one wash. With the use of thread, staples and masking tape become redundant 💆🏻‍♀️  Yes, its simple but not practical (and ugly). But it’s definitely a good project to work for should my kid’s kindergarten’s next project is making mask from recycled material.",2020-04-06,128

7414,"Hi, just a few pointers:  1. Please don’t use staples especially if disassembly is suggested after wearing. If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3. Not sure how breathable the waterproof totebag side can be 😅 I just tried putting a waterproof totebag over my nose and mouth - I can’t breathe at all 😂  Cute initiative though! But perhaps its safety can be looked into just a little more, before releasing it out to the public. Many may try this and may do more harm than good.  To everyone else: collect your free reusable facemask from the government asap! Maskgowhere.sg  Thanks! 🙂",2020-04-05,180

It can potentially mislead the ignorant in the public to think anyone wearing a mask must be sick.  Such advisory just serves to further stigmatise mask-wearing & promote wrong behaviors.

Can also take Vitamin D3, Zinc and Selenium which are also important for a strong immune system. [I have not been to the doctor anymore for 16 yrs ever since using this method.

Any more ideas in rewarding them  besides Performance and Sacrifice Bonuses?  NATO = No Action Talk Only   I saw on YouTube PM said If you don't tell me your problems  How do I know you got problems  But did PM know that he's being surrounded by layers of Modern eunuchs?

7814,"Europe or US definitely won't take same strict measures of lock down coz to them so called freedom (or economy) is very important. With only few imported cases and existing lessons of China you c wats the situation in Europe now. Btw Japan Italy US etc in all these countries it is not so easy for even those with travel exposure n with fever to get tested so the reported number is way underestimated. Sg cant ban everyone. Just hope authorities can release some regulations asking those back from Europe Iran Japan Korea etc self quarantine at home for 14 days. MNCs can ask their staff back from those places work from home for two weeks. We need to decide asap. Else with the central aircon we will just have more and more new clueless clusters. If rest of the world don't make an effort to contain the virus and if covid-19 infects as many as or even more than H1N1, then we really can only rely on luck loh. Coz 80% of the infected are with mild symptoms. 20% serious condition and 3-4% fatality rate.. While this fatality rate is provided that medical resources are not stretched.

8031,"Good news. CB ending already! But my personal suggestion is that offices in CBD not be opened as yet. Pls continue to ask workers there to WFH as it will be dangerous if a new cluster emerges there as that place is overpopulated with many, many people🙏",2020-05-14,47
8033,"1. It is good news that the new cases are declining and we see many countries gradually opening up. However, as what New Zealand PM Jacinda Kate Laurell Ardern said, we should not open too soon quoting example in South Korea new cases in nightclubs only to close again, if there is another outbreak. If it happens in other countries, most likely it will happen in Singapore.  2. Certain industries that attract crowds such as shopping malls, amusement park, cinema, pubs, KTV, exhibitions halls and carnivals should remain close until Aug/Sep 2020, till the current condition stabilizes.  3. Prolong closure will inevitably hurt their business and cause some of them to close down. This is a painful decision. However, judging from our local impulse behaviors, if we gradually open up malls, restaurant and other entertainment sites, it will attract large crowds. Most Singaporeans are confined to their homes with limited entertainment for close to 2 months circuit breaker. The desire to be free in the public is very strong when shops are gradually open.  4. Naturally, most of us will rush to malls and entertainment site such as cinema, carnival, parks, KTV, pubs and swimming pool to relax and to release stress once they are open. Even with social distancing and crowd control, you will see crowds forming outside the premises. Most Singaporeans do not mind queuing for hours especially on weekends.  5. All it takes , is one carrier to spread the virus to the rest unknowingly, and the whole circuit breaker will have to re-start again. For the safety of the majority, no large events such as Singapore Sale, National Day Celebration and year-end party or concerts should be held openly in 2020. This is for everyone safety and health. Celebration of such events will need to be virtual in a different format.  6. Wearing of mask till end 2020 or even throughout 2021 must be a daily habit for those well or unwell. Until the vaccines are found and proven effective, we cannot remove our mask anytime in public. Washing hands need to be a routine, not a choice for all of us.",2020-05-12,343

8070,"Our containment measures are pretty effective in flattening the curve.  The main areas we should focus on now are: 1. Getting unwell people to wear masks when they need to go out, e.g. to see doctor. Now, there is a social stigma against wearing masks and those who are unwell felt pressurized not to wear. They get odd stares, they get laughed at, they get criticized.  That's why many of us see unmasked people coughing/sneezing in clinics, in MRT and at workplace.  2. Employers should be educated and encouraged not to ""force"" their employees to come to work with mild symptoms. https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/going-to-work-sick-social-norm-in-singapore-needs-to-be-discouraged-experts  3. Organisations should scale down, cancel or defer non-essential large -scale events even if the events cater to the younger crowd.  While younger folks are less likely to have severe symptoms and die from the disease, they can still spread the virus to old and vulnerable.  This is especially when the current screening measures are ""not foolproof"" and as illustrated at SAFRA Jurong, ineffective to identify potentially infected with symptoms.",2020-03-13,168
