0,"Good to be optimistic but always stay humble.  The reason of 2nd circuit breaker extension is due to outbreak in foreign worker dormitories. While this piece is currently under control,  always be prepared for another spike in other areas when 2nd circuit breaker ends.  Believe in Murphy law to be safe.  While we want it good,  things will be otherwise.",2020-05-20,58
1,"In the recent announcements, there seems to be no mention of what is permitted from 1 June for those who live alone/without their family in SG. This segment of the population is probably the most affected mentally by being alone over the CB. Surely, there will be some lifting of restrictions for this segment. E.g mini bubbles like those that were allowed in NZ. Hoping the government will provide clarity on this matter. Thanks ",2020-05-19,75
2,"My concern is what will be done about the dormitories operators who were not following international cleaning and maintenance standards? Given that many of the workers would come from villages and rural areas where hygiene standards are very low, what future provisions will MOM be making in organising standard programmes to teach them about hygiene standards (like is done for maids)? How will employers and dormitory operators be made accountable as well?  These are questions that are very relevant after this bad experience. The general public needs to know. There is no point to control 80% of society with strict measures while neglecting 20% who live in bad conditions and become carriers of viruses.",2020-05-20,112
3,"Please allow 2 adults accompanying baby or young children going to hospital specialist clinic appt or polyclinic vaccinations appt. It's difficult to handle baby with many baby things, alone while still recovering from post-natal pains (I'm seeing a physiotherapist but now suspended and still in pain for the past 6 months). Otherwise, I'll have to request for wheelchair and a nurse has to help me throughout the appt.

113,"I am a single mother, my son goes to school on the 2nd June but I can't work. I am currently renting a space from a hairsalon that has a shop front and partition to separate our space. As my business falls under Beauty they say i cannot open on the 2nd of June. I am a manicurist and I hope to open as I have clients who are in pain due to ingrown nail that can cause swelling and inflammation or under hard skin that causes cracked heels that will lead to bleeding. I am told they an go seek hospital to treat it but most of them have have been say they feel pain even more frequent or the doc will tell them to go for minor operation to remove the nail which is not necessary than when they see me as I can treat this problem if not servere. But it has been two months and most of my clients are feeling the pain and have made appt. I only need to open to do pedicure only to help these clients. Even if it's 2 or 3 days week at least to do Pedicure for the feet takes about an hour only. And I have ladies and gentlemen who have injured back and can't bend to cut the nails for the feet or diabetes who need nails short if not dangerous if the nail is too long and they bang into anything in the house. I work alone with no employee. Please consider my business as essential. Cause I don't understand hair salon can open to do full Services that can take a good 4-6hrs per client and I am only doing pedicure that is only an hour job. And my landlord says this month I have to start paying rent and that is a good $2000. So if business cannot open how do I pay next months rent. Am very worried please advise. Pity my poor in pain clients also",2020-05-23,325
114,"During this Lock down. It comes with lots of challenges like lost marriages, lost love, financial and job problems and so many more, but still there has always been a solution to every challenges that we face in life. Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my boyfriend. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached his flat I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to his room. When I knocked, he allowed me to enter because he wasn't expecting me at the time, but when I opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in his house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, he followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away. I reached home and cried a lot until i told my best friend everything and she told me to fight for my man and not lose him to another woman. She gave Mama Shamirah contact(+27790792882) and told Mama Shamirah will bring back my boyfriend to me and love and only me. I contacted Mama Shamirah and told her everything and she made a love and binding prayers for me and in 1 day of the prayers my boyfriend came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again. The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby, he cried and smiled with joy and happiness. We are back together and so much in love and waiting for our baby to arrive. Thanks so much Mama Shamirah your prayers indeed work. You can call or whatsapp Mama Shamirah on +27790792882 incase you are passing through the same situation. Don't be discouraged by what people may tell you that even don't know the situation you are going through, all that matters are the results so feel free to contact her on Call/Whatsapp +27790792882 0r Email: mamashamirahsince1970@gmail.com.

199,"I grew up surrounded by God and church members from the very beginning. Being risen by Christian home, I always followed through the motions of doing “Christian things” that I thought a Christian was supposed to do. I didn’t know GOD, I just knew about Him. I found myself searching for purpose and meaning in people and also in myself. Whether that was my friends or in relationships, I poured my whole heart into them. I became very consumed with what people thought of me and was living for the acceptance of the world. At my lowest point when I lost my lovely husband to a beautiful young girl I think we call slay queens these days, I was alone and afraid, I couldn’t concentrate at work not even at any other thing I could work on. Losing my concentration cost me so much that I ended up losing my job too and went back to staying at my parents’ house with my two kids. I can’t lie to you, it was always more hurting and annoying staying home because my mom’s friends used to almost come every day to visit and sit outside talking about their marriages’ and fun they had maybe like during the weekends’ and laugh, OMG, that laugh they used to give always killed me. After what friends showed me that year I admit I had turn into a jealous person. That year was a year I will never forget. I could wake up in the morning sit on the couch watch Isindigo, login Facebook and all those sorts of social Medias and cry the whole day with my mum nursing me until it reached a time that she was also getting fade with my sobbing. It was my daughter’s birthday and some few people turned up, many were my mums friends and actually my daughters friends none of my closest turned up and it was from then I noticed that “people will always love you and support you when its beneficial” out of my mums friends, I found myself initiated in a long and funny conversation with one of them after the party. I won’t forget the fact that her husband called almost like 10 times in a period of 5 minutes just to remind her how he loved her and wishing her to drive safe back home, believe me I had never had that experience with my man. Later on during the conversation, she saw me burst into tears and she asked me what was going on, I told her everything I was going through with my life. And it was from here that I got to know about Mama Morgan +27784502035 a very cunning woman I have ever met. She told me about her meeting with Mama Morgan and she actually never gave me her numbers but took me with her to Mama Morgan. Being a born Christian, believe me I had a very big challenge here. Like how am I going to mix these two things from growing up in a Christian home to starting to believe in African tradition, but I kept on consoling myself. I always kept on having dreams having money, living lavish, and snakes chasing me, falling in very deep holes, having sex with people I don’t even know, being shot, losing fights and many more dreams that didn’t make sense to me. One morning of a beautiful Saturday I went on and called this lady (my mums’ friend) and told her I was ready to meet Mama , she came home, picked me and we went to meet Mama Morgan . She asked me what she wanted to use and I gave her everything then she conducted her prayers. What surprised me was that she was using a BIBLE and mirror to conduct her prayers then after everything she asked me to go back home and wait on the results. It took me 5 days then the father of my kids came to my parents place and He was all in tears telling me that the young girl she had opt to stay with was using muthi on him and she was targeting his riches she even tried to poison him like the evening before he came home but he missed on the poison and the cat ate it instead and he had come to ask for forgiveness and that he saw me in the dream like two days back and he was kneeling begging me to come back in his life and that’s why he had drove home to ask for my forgiveness. Believe me I cried even more than before when he was telling me his story. After like a week, I got a call that Eskom needed me back to work after a period of a year and a half. You can reach Mama Morgan on Call/Whatsapp+27784502035 in case you need her assistance.",2020-10-01,823

These personal details include a person's name, NRIC number and mobile phone number - information which is not shared with businesses, said SNDGO, adding that data collected is stored in a government server and can ""only be accessed by the authorities when needed for contact tracing purposes"".  Data collection is done at entry points through the scanning of a QR code displayed at a venue, or *** the scanning of an individual's identification card with a barcode ***, such as the NRIC or a driver's licence.'",2020-05-16,138

I asked ambassador if nric is accepted for those who don't own smartphone or dunno how to scan and was told, can't use nric.

Most that goes to wet market are seniors who are not tech savvy or low income families without a smartphone or data plan and also dunno or can't order groceries online.

When asked about the Check Out and we were told: “no need to Check Out”....  what about those elderly only enter by scanning IC?Hence, w/o Check Out, which mean we are in the outlet 24/7??? Best of all, the News mentioned that many shoppers did not “check out” after completed their shopping trips, that make the tracking very difficult for the tracking teams. Thus, is this SafeEntry app without Check Out really help in tracking???",2020-05-10,145

356,"1. Everytime there is a tighter measure such as closure,  naturally there are people crowding for their last dine in meal,  disco night,  MacDonald, bubble tea or pet shop purchase.  These behaviour is triggered by anxiety and fear of loss in basic needs temporary. Unknowingly,  it allows covid-19 to breed among crowds as some carriers may pass to others unknowingly,  with no symptoms.   2. Incremental measures are hard to enforce as it takes time for the entire Singapor population to abide and comply.  A one time hard measures,  though painful can help shorten the circuit breaker period.   3. The trick to reduce crowds now at wet market is to extend operation hours,  mandate mask,  and to offer staggered hours of visiting in batches. In another word,  from 8 to 9am,  only say 100 people with IC scanned are allowed. The next 100 people on queue will have their IC scan and receive SMS to come only after 9am to 10am (2nd staggered timing). They are ask to go home if their slot is not ready.  Their turn will not be lost if they come within the designated staggered hours. No queue allowed. Each visitor can only visit market once a day.   4.This is easier than having even and odd IC last digit numbers as there could be many even numbers on the same day. One habit we all like to do is,  we do not mind queuing for hours for something.  Key message is to avoid queue.",2020-04-22,236

Seriously  MOE, students should NOT be allowed back to school; education is lifelong - not essential and urgent services- but carry high risk of another super spreading cluster (pls CONSIDER- both for the child and educators; also family units themselves).  Plenty of collateral damage once students are allowed back to schools during this LAST MILE of the national CB.  Besides for unknown reasons, schools ban masks and ""discourage"" staffers from masking; up the COVID risk.  感恩！",2020-05-03,125
487,I agree with NOT reopening schools at all and to wear masks at all times. I prefer they just stick to the CB until 1 June and we all just rough it out for 1 more month and hopefully it'll bring the numbers down even further. Schools are a big NO NO for now.,2020-05-03,51
488,Old habits die hard.  Will higher numbers return sooner than expected as measures eased?   Looks like more and more people are out and about these days.
