Based on similar figures over the past decades, it is clear that Singapore govt has more than sufficient fiscal room to spend more of its untilised investment returns, while continuing to ringfence land sales revenue for reserves, such that the enormous reserves will still grow by a healthy amount every year.

Most would not bother as the process is time-consuming and they have to take on other duties like payrolls, training, etc. Hence they would just give excuses to MOM that they cannot find suitable candidate and still hire foreign workers. This is the sad local hiring culture! 2. Large portion of the people who are in the HR field are non Singaporean. Can't blame them if they preferred to look after their 'own' people.  3. The Chief Hiring Officers will not be doing their full diligence as they will be busy with office politics and getting certifications like ISO, Bizstar, etc, instead of checking how effectively their companies are in hiring locals. They just don't want to keep digging deeper and just treat the symptoms but not the root of the problem.

721,How to return the 53 billion taken from the reserve. Wage cut for those top earner working in the Govt sectors. Higher tax from those top earner both in the private or Govt sectors. Social tax on foreigners eg DPH.PR. Build and maintain only if necessary. Eg East coast MRT line can be delay until they have earn enough $$ from other MRT lines. EW and NS line interchange delay in building it. Raise up those low land coastal area first since the rate of raising sea level is small. Extend the lease of HDB flat without bring it down and rebuild.This save lot of cost for the residents. Do away those useless R and D which products or services are not sellable. Eg What can a robot dog do in a confine space in search and rescue operation. Cost cutting in all Govt sectors. Eg Since most students perfer poly route into university.Cut down PU from two years to one years . Pri sch cut down to one years.O level cut down to 3 years .Study smart .Do not study hard. Spend less than the tax collected. The tax collected depend on the number of residents in the workforce and the population number. With an aging population .They will be less residents in the workforce thus comsumer spending will be less .Thus less tax can be collected.Depending too much on the internal economic for tax  .The residents will get poorer. More export of goods and services .These are our view only.,2021-02-17,245

I have always maintained that I'm neither pro-govt nor pro-opposition, but pro-Singaporean and all these measures I believe, only seek to help Singaporeans. Certainly, there will come a time in the near future, when the economy is strong enough, that some taxes will go up to replenish our reserves. That is to be expected and if done at a time of plenty, is a less bitter pill to swallow than if no assistance is rendered now.  If you don't think DPM Heng or these measures his finance ministry came up with is deserving of a standing ovation, don't stand. No one is forcing you to. What are you trying to say when you give a standing ovation, but don't applaud? Who does that? If anyone knows of a current living culture/civilisation that practises standing ovations without applause, please enlighten me.

NO further claim payable and NO bonus.  That's it.  All perks that go with the office stay.  The ministers will then get a proportional sum of what the PM earns.

2572,"The US shut down Fort Detrick a Level 4 bioweapon lab in August 2019 because safety lapses. In August to September 2019 there were no less than 10 cases of people reported with an ""unknown coronavirus"" disease in US media.  More than 14k US people died from the flu from August 2019 till now. The CDC admitted a few days ago that they could not be sure whether any died of COVID-19 because none were tested.  2 Japanese tourists caught COVID-19 from visiting Hawaii, prior to the outbreak in Wuhan.  The 7th World Military Games in Wuhan on 18th October sees the US sending 350 athletes to the games. They won zero medals. Were they sick?  In the course of the games local Wuhan media reported of athletes going down with infectious diseases.  2 weeks after the games, local wuhan people were detected with an unknown respiratory disease.   Genetic tests proved that US has 5 strains of COVID-19. China has 2 and originated from the 5 US strains.  Italy tested that most of the infections in the countries had no Chinese connection and might had been present for a long time.",2020-03-13,177

2576,"To understand the origin of covid19, one has to look at viral genomes as they do not lie. Below study by three Chinese scientists and a scientist at St Louis University using global data is revealing. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2?fbclid=IwAR2CGS10WR9_5KUxmsWTfNBSD7W5_OXdgLR_Pts5EcW807oRyysMg3msF78  They discovered that there are two sources and Wuhan's source (Type II) was like a child virus and it inherited from a parent (Type I). So Type 1 source could spread itself or mutate itself to create child viruses just like the case in Wuhan. But there was no Type I in Wuhan so Type I was from a different location.  Their study makes sense because when one looks at the example of Italy. Italy has banned the Chinese on Jan 31 which is also what SG had done but Italy's measure was more stringent as they banned all flights from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau too. If one looks at the current outbreak, it happened from late Feb onwards. Given the 14 days of incubation period, the outbreak if spread by Chinese visitors shd have started in mid Feb. So its current outbreak could be due to Type II (a child virus just like Type I mutation in Wuhan) or directly from Type I which source is not from China.  Indeed, as reported in the Guardian https://bit.ly/3cG7OBt : ""....laboratory tests that isolated a strain of the virus from an Italian patient, which showed genetic differences compared with the original strain isolated in China and two Chinese tourists who became sick in Rome.""  The current global outbreak happens because the western countries believe that it is a Chinese disease (by eating wildlife) and they never look at their backyard that the source is actually there.",2020-03-13,274
