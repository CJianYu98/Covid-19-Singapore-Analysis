1,"Hope the authority can consider allowing funeral directors to be vaccinated earlier base on the grounds   1) they are essential workers even during lock down  2) they handle COVID death cases. During the funeral arrangements for such cases, family members of the deceased could be still under SHN or recovered status  3) they mingle with groups of 30 attendees and family members of the deceased daily   4) when they collect bodies from houses maybe die of other causes. Usually this kind of death will not trigger a need to go through swab, so if the deceased is infected with COVID then it will be a risk to funeral directors.  5) serving family members of those on SHN when they comes back from overseas to attend their loved ones funeral  ",2021-03-08,123

28,"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,2021-03-11,479

30,"Where China is able to build a whole bloody building in just 3 days, Singapore gov still tell citizens that they need to wait for 3 - 4 years for BTOs, despite that, the huge influx of foreign workers didn't bring down the sale price but stressing our already overloaded infrastructure n amenities.

87,"Any deterrence measures to ensure that the workers wear mask, maintain social distancing, sanitise and practise personal hygience? In community, we saw residents and cleaners without masks and chatting away without social distancing. They will not bother as they will not be caught anyway. If people take pictures/report the large group of people without mask at void deck or playing basketball, appear that no action will be taken and netizens will criticise the post at social media ""aiya, so busy body?!"".

100,"I have reported a complaint to BCA about FWs at worksites not complying to the covid-19 rules and regulation, namely about wearing of face mask. The mask was not worn and or were worn but under the chin without covering the nose and mouth. This was about a month ago when the dorms started showing re-infected numbers after been declared cleared. Till today, I can still see the same happenings at construction sites. I have been wondering if the lady I spoke to in BCA have reported upwards to her manager or just couldn't be bordered? If she did, what have the manager done about my complain? Took bus 35 from Bedok Mall. This bus passes by a dormitory along Tanah Merah Costal road. Most of the time, I can see FWs standing outside their dorm door without social distancing and without putting on face mask. Occasionally, I can see them walking from 1 door to another and mix socializing.  So, I have expected to see that re-infections in dorms is very likely and high.  A sad encounter... with stupid people in the BCA. I could tell and felt that the lady I spoke to was not interested as she did not even asked for my particulars for me to expect BCA's feedback and actions taken.  Where are the dormitory ambassador to control and ensure proper mask wearing and socializing control in the dorms?  There is no whistle blowing contact to the correct agencies.  Maybe I should take some photos and call the police at the same time to make it an issue.  Talk so much about covid-19 numbers coming from FWs but has it improved?  There is a need to step up control and enforcement in dormitories and worksites.",2020-09-09,284

109,"The PCR Tests are unreliable.  ""If we do a PCR corona test on an immuned person, it is not a virus that is detected, but a small shattered part of the viral genome. The test comes back positive for as long as there are tiny shattered parts of the virus left. Correct: Even if the infectious viruses are long dead, a corona test can come back positive, because the PCR method multiplies even a tiny fraction of the viral genetic material enough to be detected.  The PCR test with its extreme sensitivity was initially perfect to find out where the virus could be. But this test cannot identify whether the virus is still alive, i.e. still infectous.""

483,"Easy for everyone to have their GENIUS opinion but have you tried to research why they need to manually go to the remittance centers to send money in their country? These might be some of the reasons: 1. Maid does not have a bank account in SG. There are strict requirements from the FDW and Employers to be able to open a bank account 2.Relatives in their country does not have a bank account and/or lives in a remote area where rural banks are not accessible 3. Lucky plaza has all the remittance agencies that can send cash at yoyr doorstep 4. Human being. If your off day is still staying at your workplace, how would you feel? Psychologically and mentally it does not refresh you. Esp if your employer does not respect your own time during your off day at home.  Please EMPATHiZE every one has their own struggle. These FDW are not burdens but a big help in a FAMILY.  We are all sociable human beings, aren't we all under stress right now that we cannot even meet and hug our friends who stay just nearby? FDW stays far away from their families. Please be kind.",2020-06-13,194
484,"There are two parts to this. One is an essential need, and one is not. Essential: the need for foreign workers to send money back to their families. Many locals seem naively unaware that domestic helpers (and other foreign workers) need to get money home to their families frequently. Heck, that's the reason why they come to work here! To get money to send home! This essential need must be allowed, or else their families risk starving back home. And this is not a stretched truth. And that is why you see long snaking queues at said venues. In a nutshell, REMITTENCE. it is the lifeblood of your domestic helper. Govt can work with embassies and remittance businesses to bring the remittance to the worker instead, to prevent hot spots at the usual haunts of ofws. Also, employers and OFWs can explore online remit options where possible. Rates may not be as good, but if for the time being, perhaps the employer can work out something with the helper.  Non essential: some domestic helpers take the chance to fake it and go to said venues to meet their friends. This is a big no. socialising in groups at said venues. This should definitely not be allowed. Same rules apply whether you are a foreign worker domestic helper or a local or expat. The virus is no differentiator of man. We must all follow the phases so that we can make a full recovery to reopen the economy. NO socialising after remittance. Go home.  When the home is also your workplace, it can get unbearable for your helper. For you working at home, to get away from work, you switch off your PC and work mail. How does your helper ""switch off"" when all her bosses are at home? Therefore she needs time to mentally and physically destress and recalibrate. If you don't want to give her rest then please GET A ROBOT instead. And even robots need time to recharge! So, allow your helpers to do some exercise or other activities while following within the rules at all times.  A good employer knows that a good helper is an asset to his/her family. If you take care of the helper, the helper will want to take care of your household.",2020-06-13,379
