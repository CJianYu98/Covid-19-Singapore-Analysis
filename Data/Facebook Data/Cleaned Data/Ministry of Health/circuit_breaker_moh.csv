Today, when some other countries are facing another wave, having high community cases and planning to impose stricter measures, our Singapore is planning into phase 3. Why is this so?   Besides having a team of selfless and committed healthcare workers and other frontline heroes, another reason is due to we have a capable and competent gov with strong leadership. This is undeniably, the fact we see today. Thank you to our 4G leaders that never stop to make our Singapore safe for everyone here.   ""There was a time when oppies said that 4G leaders won't make it, but they did.""   Meantime, let's not be complacent.

371,"COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES  PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money. The governments moon shot daily testing program will cost £100 Billion roughly two thirds of the annual NHS budget.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.

452,"While there is a need to slowly open up, to protect those vulnerable and prevent potential cluster outbreak, MOM should assure the following :  1) All incoming travellers must be tested COVID-19 negative, taking into consideration the 14-day incubation period, before allowed to move around freely in Singapore. Widely reported asymptomatic incubation period was the critical blind spot that the MTF failed to address in Feb when the Wuhan couple started the church cluster resulting in unnecessary Circuit Breaker and drawing down more than necessary from our reserves.  2) There is a growing number of ""soveriegn"" public  who openly pull down their mask to expose their nose or mouth in public, neighbourhood shop area with zero enforcement from the authority.  3) A growing number who AFTER exercising and after cooling down, are not wearing mask walking relaxingly in public on their way home. In the first place, majority did not even hv a mask around their neck.  4) Many diners at F&B outlets are talking more than eating and most of the time with their mask pulled down.  We learnt from other countries that re-surgence of clusters mainly occurred in crowded and closed areas. As such, govt should have ZERO tolerance on non compliance to proper social distancing and wearing of facemask when we talk about further opening up. Setup easy and effective hotlines for public to report non compliances to follow up with fines and penalties.   Only ZERO tolerance, effective enforcement of Social distancing, mask wearing and measures to address the asymptomatic incubation blind spot could ensure that the previous costly  mishandling is not repeated.",2020-09-13,261

520,"The Flawed PCR Test You might have the virus, but so what? That doesn’t mean you’re sick!  * https://youtu.be/SjyfTvdr1_s Virology is Hoaxology: Viruses do not exist. Period.  Even if you strongly believe in germ theory, there are some serious problems with the generally accepted method of testing for a virus, it’s called the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test.  The PCR test amplifies a specific region of a DNA strand (the DNA target)—It is qualitative not quantitative; in other words, it can tell you if a virus is present or not, but it can’t tell you in what quantities, and it can’t make any accurate assessment about whether the presence of that virus or not is enough to cause disease.  The US CDC admits that a positive coronavirus COVID-19 test (using the PCR method) doesn’t mean the virus is causing the disease/symptoms you may have.  1. These are the actual words of the US CDC: “Positive [test] results are indicative of active infection with 2019-nCoV but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.”  2. These are the actual words of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and the Chapter of Infectious Disease Physicians, Academy of Medicine, Singapore, point no.5: https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf Microbiologic Data for Period of Infectivity and Viral RNA Shedding: ""It is important to note that viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus.""  So, what are testing centres actually testing and looking for besides SARS-CoV-2 virus?  A rhinovirus? An influenza virus? A dead cell? A coronavirus particle from past infection? An exosome? Alien contaminants? Unauthorised DNA harvesting?  This is the reason why majority of the people using this fraudulent PCR testing method will test positive again and again.  More fake science PCR testing will only escalate infectivity numbers creating fear and panic globally.  * https://youtu.be/xY8YHtJOanM Dr Stefan Lanka, biologist, virologist Viruses do not exist RT-PCR test and circular reasoning  It is interesting and extremely telling to note how fast BBC was to announce this damning verdict in 2015:  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31864218 while the appeals and two later verdicts, the last one in The German High Court in January 2017 where the measles skeptic WON FULL VICTORY and where the claimants were forced to pay all costs of the court-case, BBC so CONVENIENTLY IGNORED!   22.01.2017: Judges at the German Federal Supreme Court have CONFIRMED THAT THE MEASLES VIRUS DOES NOT EXIST, vindicating 'conspiracy theorists' who have said that no study has ever proven the existence of the virus.  The First Civil Senate of the BGH has confirmed the judgment by the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart (OLG) of the 16 February 2016. The sum of €100,000 which the biologist dr. Stefan Lanka had offered as a reward for scientific proof of the existence of the alleged measles virus does not have to be paid to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also was ORDERED TO BEAR ALL THE PROCEDURAL COSTS.  Five experts have been involved in the case and presented the results of scientific studies. All five experts, including Prof. Dr. Dr. Andreas Podbielski who had been appointed by the OLG Stuttgart as the preceding court, have consistently found that NONE of the six publications which have been introduced to the trial, contains scientific proof of the existence of the alleged measles virus. http://yournewswire.com/german-supreme-court-measles/  Is it strange that the commercial media is loosing credibility? Can BBC unjustly defame biologist dr. Stefan Lanka without any consequences?  * https://youtu.be/PWmRj1WWrSQ Dr Stefan Lanka  Measles Virus On Trial ",2020-08-06,577

614,"Can MOH or the respective authority, ensure there is no 'Failure to Comply' of Safety Guidelines? Have witnessed several failures in enforcement not just from members of the public, but also from workers of malls and retail outlets, on the guidelines of safe distancing and proper mask-wearing. As it is, many are not wearing masks, and several more have them below their nostrils. I witnessed a Safety Ambassador speak to someone who wasn't wearing a mask in a Mall Basement buying food (the mask was tucked away deep in his large bag). There were no questions asked and the Ambassador walked away after her advise. The person continued to purchase food without any urgency to wear a mask! Furthermore, with no questioning done, could this person have roamed the mall with no mask prior to being seen? Also, why did the outlet serve the customer who blatantly breached the guidelines? 2 more were witnessed walking the malls with no mask on! They left the mall, with mall security looking perplexed as the person exited the doors, without stopping the individual to investigate or even advised to wear a mask! This person could have also roamed the mall for some time with no one even batting an eyelid! I can understand that authorities cannot be 2 places at one time, but guidelines are meant to be followed and any plan is useless if there is a failure to comply, by workers and establishments! Outlets should enforce refused service to anyone not wearing a mask properly until they do so, and not allow them to roam the premises with full ignorance! Any plan is useless if there is a 'Failure to Comply'. It's disheartening to witness this ignorance when the risk still exists. The more this complacency continues, the more a 'false sense of invincibility' grows, leading to less enforcement and more people turning a blind eye, since it was ok once, it will be ok once more. For those who continue to adhere and follow the guidelines, I applaud their vigilance and hope they continue to do so regardless of those who choose to not comply.",2020-07-17,350

693,"HIGH INFECTIVITY WITH LOW MORTALITY IS GOOD NEWS  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  BASIC UNDERSTANDING ON HOW OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM OPERATE  Everyone’s immune system is different but, as a general rule, as we expose to more pathogens, we develop more immunity.  Once an antibody has been produced, a copy remains in the body so that if the same antigen appears again, it can fight off more quickly.  That is why with some diseases, such as chickenpox, you only get it once as the body has a chickenpox antibody stored, ready and waiting to destroy it next time it arrives.  This is called immunity.  There are three types of immunity in humans called innate, adaptive, and passive:  Innate immunity: We are all born with some level of immunity to invaders. Human immune systems, similarly to those of many animals, will attack foreign invaders from day one. This innate immunity includes the external barriers of our body—the first line of defense against pathogens—such as the skin and mucous membranes of the throat and gut. This response is more general and non-specific. If the pathogen manages to dodge the innate immune system, adaptive or acquired immunity kicks in.  Adaptive immunity: This protect from pathogens develops as we go through life. As we are exposed to diseases or get vaccinated, we build up a library of antibodies to different pathogens. This is sometimes referred to as immunological memory because our immune system remembers previous enemies.  SUMMARY  The immune system is incredibly complicated and utterly vital for our survival. Several different systems and cell types work in perfect synchrony (most of the time) throughout the body to fight off pathogens and clear up dead cells.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  PROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS  High Infectivity: Getting everyone infected during a respiratory flu virus outbreak to build natural immunity towards the virus—with special attention given to the vulnerable group—is the proven epidemiological and scientific model approach.  Low Mortality: 99% of healthy individuals with strong immune system can handle the virus with little to no flu symptoms or mortality.  This is why I mentioned high infectivity with low mortality is good news.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNPROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS  Majority of countries i.e., Taiwan, Vietnam, etc., applied the unproven epidemiological and scientific approach by stopping their people from getting infected to build natural immunity towards the virus—with strict unproven lockdowns, wearing masks, social distancing and isolation, etc.—and flattening the curve is a risky unproven approach that will only prolong the pandemic leading to a 2nd wave.  The low infectivity and low mortality rate by applying the unproven epidemiological and scientific model will only look good on statistics and data.  What will happen in 3-6 months or a year from now if another flu or coronavirus starts circulating again—and people do not have immunity towards the virus?  Start locking and shutting down the whole country again?  Bankrupting the people, the government and the whole country?  Thank you so much for reading!",2020-06-19,492
694,"Just like any other respiratory outbreak, the epidemiological and science model is to let healthy individuals mingle around—with special attention given to the vulnerable group—and build natural immunity towards the virus.  99% of healthy individuals will have no to little flu symptoms and can handle this SARS-COV-2 respiratory illness.  * https://youtu.be/hmiw3vhv1ec Dr. Fauci vs. Dr. Wittkowski | Endless Mitigations or Herd Immunity  Stress weakens the immune system—public health advisory should not be locking up the whole nation at home and spreading fear on TV/MSM by repeated media broadcasts sounding that the whole nation is going to get infected and die from SARS-COV-2 respiratory illness.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  TESTING: There is no epidemiological and scientific model that testing individuals for a respiratory virus can stop the spread.  What is the point of testing when there is no scientific evidence that PCR test machine is a gold standard test for virus?—unless it is for unauthorised human DNA harvesting.   Even the inventor of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) Dr. Kary Mullis, PhD Biochemist, Winner, 1993 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, stated that PCR cannot be use to identify a virus or particle.  RT-PCR testing (Reverse Transcript Polymerase Chain Reaction) machine cannot distinguish an infectious (harmful) viral particle versus a non-infectious (harmless) viral particle, as the rest simply detects any viral component even a dead cell or an exosome—up to 80% of false positive results reveals that RT-PCR testing are inaccurate—it will only escalate the infectivity numbers on statistics and data, and put fear on the people.

761,"HIGH INFECTIVITY WITH LOW MORTALITY IS GOOD NEWS  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNDERSTANDING HOW OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM OPERATE Everyone’s immune system is different but, as a general rule, as we expose to more pathogens, we develop more immunity.  Once an antibody has been produced, a copy remains in the body so that if the same antigen appears again, it can fight off more quickly.  That is why with some diseases, such as chickenpox, you only get it once as the body has a chickenpox antibody stored, ready and waiting to destroy it next time it arrives.  This is called immunity.  There are three types of immunity in humans called innate, adaptive, and passive:  Innate immunity: We are all born with some level of immunity to invaders. Human immune systems, similarly to those of many animals, will attack foreign invaders from day one. This innate immunity includes the external barriers of our body—the first line of defense against pathogens—such as the skin and mucous membranes of the throat and gut. This response is more general and non-specific. If the pathogen manages to dodge the innate immune system, adaptive or acquired immunity kicks in.  Adaptive (acquired) immunity: This protect from pathogens develops as we go through life. As we are exposed to diseases or get vaccinated, we build up a library of antibodies to different pathogens. This is sometimes referred to as immunological memory because our immune system remembers previous enemies.  Passive immunity: This type of immunity is “borrowed” from another source, but it does not last indefinitely. For instance, a baby receives antibodies from the mother through the placenta before birth and in breast milk following birth. This passive immunity protects the baby from some infections during the early years of their life.  SUMMARY The immune system is incredibly complicated and utterly vital for our survival. Several different systems and cell types work in perfect synchrony (most of the time) throughout the body to fight off pathogens and clear up dead cells.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  PROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS Getting everyone infected during a virus outbreak to build immunity towards the virus—with special attention given to the vulnerable group—is the proven epidemiological and scientific model approach.  Majority of healthy individuals with a strong immune system can handle the virus with little to no symptoms or mortality.  That is why I mentioned high infectivity with low mortality is good news.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNPROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS Majority of countries i.e., Taiwan, Vietnam, etc., applied the unproven epidemiological and scientific approach by stopping their people from getting infected to build immunity towards the virus—with strict unproven lockdowns, wearing masks, social distancing and isolation, etc.—and waiting for the virus to die off is a risky unproven approach that will only prolong the pandemic leading to a 2nd wave.  The low infectivity and low mortality rate by applying the unproven epidemiological and scientific model will only look good on statistics and data.  What will happen in 3-6 months or a year from now if another coronavirus starts circulating again—and their people do not have immunity towards the virus?  Start locking and shutting down the whole country again?  Bankrupting the people, the government and the whole country?  Thank you so much for reading!",2020-06-15,540

The first part, stemming population would be a real challenge, economically  With lesser people, the economy will be limited, would not grow bigger than desired.   Housing costs will drop as lesser people will result to decrease in demands  However, if the population grows, the city becomes denser and another  pandemic flares, Singapore goes into partial lockdown again and the nation""s reserves may be used again  Stem the population because with lesser people, less densely populated, lives will not be at risk  Remember, virus mutates.

For the phase 1 circuit breaker, a TCM can only receive a patient at any one time and restricted treatment to 45mins.   Isn't it more dangerous to have customers who are strangers in the same salon for such a long period as compared to a husband and wife or family members staying together visiting the same TCM at the same time? A clinic and doctor definitely know how to handle and disinfect the equipment, areas that the patients use better than a salon, no?  Doesn't it makes more sense that the husband and wife or family member staying together scenario visiting and receiving treatment from the same clinic and same TCM doctor more safe than strangers sitting inside a salon for the duration of more than 2hours?   Don't get me wrong, I am happy to see my salon reopening again but what is the rationale of this restriction on TCM? Aesthetic more important than health?",2020-06-03,191

838,"As indicated on the above graphics - “Refrain from talking to prevent the spread of droplets”  -  Before June 2,  have witnessed people talking LOUDLY ACROSS the seats (opposite seat row) . Some even pulled down their masks to talk .  Yesterday, the first day of Phase 1 - all the Safety Distancing stickers were removed - people are sitting shoulder to shoulder; some engaging in conversation.  Peak hours - those standing are barely 1 metre apart - some were also talking away.  With masks on - they talk loudly - disturbing the peace during the ride.   Some pulled their masks below their noses, barely touching the lips and talking away.   Safety Ambassadors need to be MORE proactive;  Annoucements onboard trains/buses - reminding commuters to REFRAIN from talking  (pre-recorded announcement may already be in place; however it needs to be broadcasted REGULARLY and in ALL Languages).  It appears the MASSES have totally NO Concept on HOW THE VIRUS IS BEING SPREAD.   From the start, it has been the “ME, ME, ME, ME” mentality .  -  What’s wrong with ME talking ? -  What’s wrong with ME Not wearing my mask properly? -  What’s wrong with ME Not observing Safety Distancing? -  What’s wrong with ME taking my children &/or elders to the supermarket, food centre, park etc -  What’s wrong with ME sneaking a visit to my boyfriend’s or girlfriend’s home  (have witnessed such activities during the late hours ) -  IF I caught the virus - It’s MY PROBLEM !!!  With this kind of SELFISH attitude amongst US - it will be a loooooooooong while before we can all step out of this Covid situation.. Cluster from the dorms aside,  every now & then we have cases from the community  - the ding dong between double & single digit  -  Do we really want to see the number escalate to an alarming figure THEN we see ... - the NEED for Personal Responsibility - HOW our behaviour and attitude could affect or make a difference  PLEASE, Let’s ALL Do Our Part ..

965,"Dear Mr Gan , One thing I don’t understand - why school dental cannot resume back in school when kids are already back in sch ? My kid has a bad toothache and bleeding this morning and I called sch dental was told they r closed and called HPB and told all sch dental cannot open. Dental only for urgent case how would we assess what’s urgent what’s not. They ask us to go private dental or poly clinic and need to pay . Isn’t that increasing risk of getting virus? Shdnt we stay home as much as possible and yet now ask me to bring my kid here and there after school to fix her toothache . Why kids can still go sch but cannot go to the school dental within school premises if really in pain ? Isn’t it like telling ppl to exercise but clinics and hospital not open for u if you have a fall or injuried. Don’t understand why the easing of restrictions so weird one ?!? ",2020-06-02,171

Il m'a dit qu'il n'a pas besoin de mon argent mais il suffit juste que je paie l'argent des ingrédients pour produire ce portefeuille et m'a encore dit si j'ai les moyens de venir dans son propre palais mais j'étais dans la pauvreté donc j'ai dû faire ce travail de distance qui me produit 1.500.000 FCFA tout les vendredis de chaque semaine qui n'a pas d'inconvénient ni de sacrifice sur ma vie. C'est là que j'ai crû que le portefeuille magique existe vraiment.

If travel abroad permitted, then Medishield Life (hospitalisation insurance) should cover hospital bills here if travellers infected while abroad.

The PAP government had withdrawn money from the reserve is to first help the SIA from collapsing but I had been waiting a long time before I can hear the news to help and prevent the healthcare workers from collapsing. I had heard the news about Ho Chin had ordered the ST Engineers mouth mask manufacture to relocation from Taiwan back to Singapore because never knew our precious mouth masks can't be allowed spending back home. And what had happened, Why do the PAP government have negligence to provide enough mouth masks in this pandemic time. In the Sars situation, why do the PAP government had not to gain any experiences? And why do the PAP politicians can tell people, they are the right people who will always do the right things? I believe the PAP government should have helped to equip the CleanSpace Technology half-mask for the healthcare workers or evenly provide the service for the outpatients in hospitals and polyclinics when the patients have to see the doctor consultants. In these ways, many people will very happy to have more chances to buy mouth masks to protect themselves or helped to prevent the virus from spreading out more easily to others. And I had mentioned many times if the pandemic has become bad to worse because of the PAP government advice for not to wear a mouth mask if you are not ill or have shown any symptoms. I hope the PAP government will have the courage to apologize for not be really helpful.     ",2020-04-11,347
