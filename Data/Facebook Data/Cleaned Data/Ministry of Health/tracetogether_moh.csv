16,"I have been using the TraceTogether app for awhile. No issues until the last 2 updates. My Samsung Note 9 battery on a full charge goes to 50% in 3-4 hours without any use. The app itself was using up to 20% of the battery. I have written in to the TraceTogether team but their response is "" Following recent updates to TraceTogether, we understand that some mobile device models have experienced increased battery usage. This is largely due to changes to help your App communicate with other TraceTogether devices including the recently launched Tokens. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you and other users of affected models.""  ",2020-10-07,103
