2,Only after so long then now implement pre departure tests from India? And u want to open up businesses but still go down hard on enforcement of safe distancing measures? Your policies just keep baffling us. Thank you for the entertainment @MOH,2020-09-09,41
3,"We need to implement WFH permanently, so that we can protect our people, and build resilience for families, business & countries. Learn to redesign and manage online organization. We can do that & do well with matured technological infrastructure. Many countries could not. We will be prepared for disease X. And we can open to tourist and yet prevent infection. Otherwise it will be forever fighting fire like the dorm case, and widespread in SG. Worse, harming our own people.",2020-09-10,78

21,Many netizens had asked Govt to produce negative test results before flying into SG. Those seating in high office ignored these suggestion. Many countries such as Malaysia are smarter I guessed. They start long ago. Bty why still allowed Indian travellers from India when Wuhan travellers were prevented after China cases rises. SG never learn.,2020-09-10,55
22,"I don't understand. Why India getting more cases reported everyday and still the country is open to Indian travellers. How to prevent if they are allowed home stay in SG? Where they throw their used items? Into rubbish chute. Cleaners may be infected unknowly and bring home the virus. Service people like aircon, plumber, electrician etc.. might also go into their houses unknowingly. How will these people know. Will there be a notice somewhere or a site to check on those under quarantined?",2020-09-10,82

We may not be expert in medical or infectious disease,we only want to seek clarification. We have a dormitory room(2 Tampines) of 12 FW staying in same bunk. Last week,MOH bring only 3 FW for test and same 3 FW are sent back to same bunk whereby 9 other FW ( not tested,but isolated for 6 weeks without symptoms) Will it be better to separate “tested” and “untest” What happen if one of 3 tested,is Postive? Whole bunk of 12,  QO another 14 days?  Thanks",2020-05-13,100

However if certified unwell should have a separate dorm to accommodate and refer to a doctor for medical checkup. Dorm stay at home do not visiting crowded gathering and outdoor activities. Drinking alcohol is their favourite bewerage. Working wise have a distancing of 1 metre with a mask , no chatting at work , as sliva droplets might flow the air woth close contact to.each others.Hygiene in wash hand after works for meals and check temperature at all time.

38,Those FW outside Dorm do not need to test? Just one FW spread to them again then 2nd wave come. What is the preventive action and control plan?,2020-05-13,27
39,Number of reported infection among FW is a function of how many FW MOH actually tested daily. It is not that MOH is controlling Covid 19...it is controlling the number of infected cases based on tests conducted. Key question is how many more cases when MOH conducts a full tests on all the 300K FW and when to report the final results? MOH needs to follow Taiwan and SKorea to complete the full testings asap. Please stop putting up a show of control and be transparent when can MOH conduct full tests on all FWs to determine how big a boo-boo they have done.,2020-05-12,102

Please take care of our foreign friends as they play a major role in our nation building, especially HDBs.",2020-04-05,71
113,Should we send out survey to check all the dormitory workers if they have been to Mustafa recently.For those who went there recently. Further isolation should be carried out. Those who take public transport should be given private bus services to bring them to their work space. Or quarantine order be given.

115,Pls do not start a blame game now. The foreign worker employer also must play a part. As long as we allowed people to mingle there's always a chance for the virus to be transmitted. Gov should do a total shutdown to break the cycle of transmission. There's no way around it. Economy we can rebuild but human life's once dead cannot be remake. I implore the leader to take this decision. Afterall u still hv to do a total shutdown later. Do it now. If LKY is in this position I believe he will take this drastic action and not played with the people life. We hv the know-how and  finance to rebuild the economy later.,2020-04-05,113

The dormitories are akin to a stationary cruise-ship. If we extrapolate the figure from the affected cruise-ships lately, we may be looking at a few thousands cases within a week or so.   How can we better protect these workers and ourselves?  Is getting them to stay in their rooms a workable method? There are a number of ‘abandoned’/empty buildings all around Singapore - what about quickly cleaning up those areas and getting the workers to split up into smaller groups and isolate themselves there?",2020-04-06,115

119,"Not evacuating the workers from the building and start disinfecting it is a big mistake. It feels like diamond cruises all over again except its now in Singapore.

169,"FOREIGN WORKERS - clear it's communal spread especially in Bangladeshi/Indian community that's passed on to dorms and other nationalities (China/Malaysia/Myanmar/Sri Lanka), does not matter whether patient zeros from within/outside dorms - cannot and unfair to rely on dorm operators to resolve urgent issue of overcrowding in dormitories, which ST reports to be 1mm foreign workers in 43 dorms  (i) BEDS/ISOLATIONS TENTS IN STADIUMS => see Wuhan - separate foreign workers out from dorms to 35 stadiums, some stadiums with spaced out beds to increase physical distancing, some stadiums with individual tents (from decathlon) to isolate close contacts of confirmed cases => pls consider what Wuhan did, use of rooms in school and stadiums for different kinds of isolations/quarantine  https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-home-quarantine-repeats-mistake-made-in-china-doctors-say  (ii) IMMEDIATE TESTS => HONG KONG & S KOREA - immediate testing of foreign worker on cough, fever or loss of smell/taste, cannot afford to wait potentially 10days for sufficient symptoms necessary for covid-9 test, because (i) still spreads in dorms whilst in isolation, (ii) fast deterioration when symptoms worsen making acute/ICU care likely, (iii) early treatment for faster recovery - early detection help (i) reduce further transmissions, (ii) isolate close contacts and places - Testing at least for fever or loss of sense of smell/taste should be case for general public, given reality of communal transmission / asymptomatic transmission / mild symptoms (such that these people recover without being detected but pass to others, meaning it can go on and on) - CLEAR that early tests for early detection and early treatment is reason why S Korea has low fatalities and now Hong Kong (9Mar HK govmt clinics allowed to swab and ask for tests, on 1 symptom eg cough or fever) has MUCH fewer critical cases, compared to Feb'2020  (iii) MASKS - Give some surgical masks from stockpile to foreign workers first. Replenish stockpile from China and need not be picky given urgency of foreign workers' issue. With govmt issuance of cloth masks, get Singapore residents to donate their previously bought boxes of masks.",2020-04-05,322

171,"The very fact they consist a small proportion against the entire population and yet yesterday have almost double the infected compared to singaporean locals means one thing. They have not observed and kept the hygiene standards and also not been observing any distancing measures.   The dormitory all allocated to them were almost new and good condition when they moved in. The fact there are cockroaches derive from littering and bad personal maintainence of their personal spaces.  In the Singapore army in BMT we have 10 men to a single bunk room and an entire company of 160 men using a single block. Yet with proper area cleaning we kept it spotless. Toilets are sparkling. On top of that as full time soldiers we had to fufil every single training obligation issued to us.  Instead of complaining about cockroaches and bad hygienic conditions....why not start area cleaning. They are getting a full months pay to do nothing. Spend the time wisely! Hundreds of Singaporeans too live in blocks and dine in local hawker centers with hundreds of people at any time.  My fear is if their girlfriends who may be FDWs go back home with their infection. The entire family she lives with will suffer. This will cause a massive infestation. I pray this day never comes.   I believe the govt policy to quarantine 20,000 is very sound. This is a preventative measure against a mass outbreak amongst millions of local Singaporeans who have stood by Singapore thick and thin and served the nation when she needed us. It’s understandable that many foreigners are here to enjoy the wealth, prosperity and jobs that we are blessed with. However consider the flip side of the coin....assuming there is a war....outbreak....or any disaster....will the very ones who flocked here for jobs stay with us and fight with us or will they be the first ones to board planes and ships out. It’s the sons of this land who will lose the most as we have families and friends here. As a son if this land without question I will fight for her as my love ones are here. Let’s all fight covid and this 30 days cooperate and give our best. For our love ones",2020-04-06,376

178,"Well this problem bring out the foreign labour policy issue. I knew long ago Singapore prefer foreign workers specifically those construction workers from Thailand. As years go by, it could be due the rapid development of Thailand, these Thais workers are difficult to come by and the labour cost could be more expensive. Due to certain reason, Singapore had been avoid getting Indon to work in construction industry. Instead they opt for labour from India, China and Bangladesh. Did I say something wrong. Sorry but the truth hurts. India and Bangladesh workers does has hygiene issue .",2020-04-06,96
