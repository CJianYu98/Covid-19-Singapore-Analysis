If they can‚Äôt meet up your standards then change them rather then hurting or torturing them. How much they r earning from you , just a few hundred and you expect them to do 24 hrs round the clock. How about I engage you as my domestic helper n torture you like this how will you feel. Please spare some though for the helper. If you want them to do a gd job you need to treat them like humans please.",2021-03-04,99
1,"I suggest MOM introduce a law whereby the Agent that brings in the FDW submit a report to MOM within the first 6 months of the FDW employment that the agent has called the FDW at least 3 times to ensure the FDW‚Äôs well being.  The report should be submitted to MOM for future reference, incase abuse cases surfaced. Agents make money from the FDW as well, that should be the least the Agents can do.  MOM should also follow up with a call yo the FDW at least once.  MOM can employ some staff for this job. Oh well. Just my 2 cents worth. ",2021-03-04,103

5,"Only six months‚Äô jail for this sadistic abuse when the maximum possible term was a total of 9 years?! What a joke, no wonder FDW abuse is rife in Singapore.

10,"Mental disorder? Depression? The common ‚ÄúGet-Out-Of-Jail-FREE‚Äù ticket for maid abuse cases is not working in this case. Glad the abuser was slapped with jail time. However I still feel 6 months‚Äô jail term punishment is too light. Lives have been lost due to such abuses. Should have given her huge fines on top of 5 years‚Äô jail time.  Having said that, I realised many maid-abusers are women, wives and mothers. Wonder what are the root causes that lead to such abusive behaviours on someone who literally has no power nor say in the family. ",2021-03-04,90
11,"Action not visible but mark is. Fm young I often hear my mom said to me n remind me one honest fact: when someone hit u no one vouch for ur pain but if u rtn a blow many vouch for d claimed innocent. So in real, send her back to agent  to resolve or make d helper sign warning letter like we will get one if we fail our task. Fair for both sides. Helper or maid shd oso hv probation period of 3 mths to ensure wat was declared or known capability or ability is justified n acceptable n Tis will oso allow both employer n maid to build chemistry (getting use to environment n character). I believe Tis will reduce clash between them. ",2021-03-06,125

782,"GOVERNMENT & PARLIAMENT the difference  GOVERNMENT  - run the country  PARLIAMENT  - represent the people - hold the government to account.   We want both a good government and a good Parliament.   For 55 yrs, our Parliament do not have enough parties truly representing the people. Instead majority inside are of the same ruling party, representing not the people, but the PAP.   This means we, the SG voters, have sold ourselves to be slaves (because we sold our Voice) and not master of our collective destiny.   You may argue we have a good government but we don't have a good Parliament. Giving PAP supermajority in parliament is like selling away our birthrights as stakeholders of our SG. Result is you get a SG by PAP, for PAP and not a SG by the People, for the People.   You can have BOTH a good government and a good Parliament.   VOTE IN A STRONG PARLIAMENT",2020-05-30,146
