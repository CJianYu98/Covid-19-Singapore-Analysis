WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,2021-03-11,479

In fact my poor illiterate mum cannot even use ATM nowadays because it is no longer the simple same ATM screen that she can just memorise .   I have to withdraw cash every month on her behalf cos it is not practical for her to go to the bank to queue every month given that many bank branches especially POSB have closed down and the long queues of seniors at each POSB and DBD branch daily .   Chances of elderly seniors like her getting conned while queuing at the banks are very high.  Banks should not forget that that we are their customers and without the depositors they would not have the fund to lend to others and make their huge profits .    Our society needs to engage the elderly with little education.   Dementia will become a much more serious problem for the elderly if we remove cash from our lives .   By using cash for their daily purchases    those suffering from slight or moderate dementia are able to exercise some control and use their mental skills.   One of the best way to slow down the dementia process is to engage dementia persons in their early stages .  Getting cash allowances and paying in cash is also a good way to educate the young children about managing finances. ,2021-03-04,248

792,"Singapore gov isn't bought, and relies on science. But what if the science was bought?  "" I did everything a doctor is supposed to do. I read all the papers, I critically appraised them, I understood them, I discussed them with the patient, and we made a decision together, based on the evidence. In the published data, reboxetine was a safe and effective drug. In reality, it was no better than a sugar pill, and worse, it does more harm than good. As a doctor I did something which, on the balance of all the evidence, harmed my patient, simply because unflattering data was left unpublished.  If you find that amazing, or outrageous, your journey is just beginning. Because nobody broke any law in that situation, reboxetine is still on the market, and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play, for all drugs, in all countries in the world. Negative data goes missing, for all treatments, in all areas of science. The regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us.  Sometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials, and when they see that the results are unflattering, they simply fail to publish them. This is not a new problem, and it‚Äôs not limited to medicine. In fact, this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science. It distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics, it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies, and despite everything that regulators, drug companies and even some academics will tell you, it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades.  In fact, it is so deep-rooted that even if we fixed it today‚Äîright now, for good, forever, without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation‚Äîthat still wouldn‚Äôt help, because we would still be practicing medicine, cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best, on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is‚Äîas you‚Äôve now seen‚Äîfundamentally distorted. ""  "" In the 1980s, U.S. doctors began giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to all patients who‚Äôd had a heart attack. This practice made perfect sense on paper: we knew that anti-arrhythmic drugs helped prevent abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that people who‚Äôve had a heart attack are quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that often these went unnoticed, undiagnosed and untreated. Giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to everyone who‚Äôd had a heart attack was a simple, sensible preventive measure.  Unfortunately, it turned out that we were wrong. This prescribing practice, with the best of intentions, on the best of principles, actually killed people. And because heart attacks are very common, it killed them in very large numbers: well over 100,000 people died unnecessarily before it was realized that the fine balance between benefit and risk was completely different for patients without a proven abnormal heart rhythm.  Could anyone have predicted this? Sadly, yes, they could have. A trial in 1980 tested a new anti-arrhythmic drug, lorcainide, in a small number of men who‚Äôd had a heart attack‚Äîless than a hundred‚Äîto see if it was any use. Nine out of forty-eight men on lorcainide died, compared with one out of forty-seven on placebo. The drug was early in its development cycle, and not long after this study it was dropped for commercial reasons. Because it wasn‚Äôt on the market, nobody even thought to publish the trial. The researchers assumed it was an idiosyncrasy of their molecule, and gave it no further thought. If they had published, we would have been much more cautious about trying other anti-arrhythmic drugs on people with heart attacks, and the phenomenal death toll‚Äîover 100,000 people in their graves prematurely‚Äîmight have been stopped sooner. More than a decade later, the researchers finally did publish their results, with a mea culpa, recognizing the harm they had done by not sharing them earlier:  When we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance. The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons, and this study was therefore never published; it is now a good example of ‚Äòpublication bias‚Äô. The results described here might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead.10  As we shall shortly see, this problem of unpublished data is widespread throughout medicine, and indeed the whole of academia, even though the scale of the problem, and the harm it causes, have been documented beyond any doubt. We will see stories on basic cancer research, Tamiflu, cholesterol blockbusters, obesity drugs, antidepressants and more, with evidence that goes from the dawn of medicine to the present day, and data that is still being withheld, right now, as I write, on widely used drugs which many of you reading this book will have taken this morning. We will also see how regulators and academic bodies have repeatedly failed to address the problem.  Because researchers are free to bury any result they please, patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine, from research to practice. Doctors can have no idea about the true effects of the treatments they give. Does this drug really work best, or have I simply been deprived of half the data? Nobody can tell. Is this expensive drug worth the money, or have the data simply been massaged? No one can tell. Will this drug kill patients? Is there any evidence that it‚Äôs dangerous? No one can tell.  This is a bizarre situation to arise in medicine, a discipline where everything is supposed to be based on evidence, and where everyday practice is bound up in medico-legal anxiety. In one of the most regulated corners of human conduct we‚Äôve taken our eyes off the ball, and allowed the evidence driving practice to be polluted and distorted. It seems unimaginable. We will now see how deep this problem goes. ""  "" It‚Äôs also worth being clear that this data is withheld from everyone in medicine, from top to bottom. Most countries have organizations to create careful, unbiased summaries of all the evidence on new treatments to determine whether they are cost effective. In the UK the organization is called NICE (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence); in Germany it is called IQWiG, while in the U.S. insurers may make their own assessments. But these organizations are unable either to identify or to access data that has been withheld by researchers or companies on a drug‚Äôs effectiveness; they have no more legal right to that data than you or I do. In fact, as we shall see, some regulators, despite having access to this information, have refused to share it with the public or doctors. Others have hidden the information they hold behind walls of chaos. This is an extraordinary and perverse situation.  So, while doctors are kept in the dark, patients are exposed to inferior treatments, ineffective treatments, unnecessary treatments, and unnecessarily expensive treatments that are no better than cheap ones; governments pay for unnecessarily expensive treatments, and mop up the cost of harms created by inadequate or harmful treatment; and individual participants in trials, such as those in the TGN1412 study, are exposed to terrifying, life-threatening ordeals, resulting in lifelong scars, again quite unnecessarily.

2406,"For Singapore the first case came from Wuhan, ie Jan 20, 2020 detected on Jan 23, 2020. Singapore Government was very pro active and spent a lot of resources to contain the virus. I guess we should appreciate the efforts by our government and the health workers rather than fact finding through WHO - which might not lead us anywhere.",2021-02-10,55
2407,"WHO actually went to Wuhan in Feb and Jul last yr for investigations and hence it is the third time Wuhan now. Singapore was involved for the Feb investigation, see WHO report : https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf  Hence it is not true WHO only investigates Wuhan one year later with the evidence no longer in existence.  The current trip is significant as the scientists have more knowledge of covid-19 a year later and also covid-19 has been discovered in other parts of Europe even before Dec 2019, thus lending credence to the notion that Wuhan may not be the source of the outbreak. Hence during today's press briefing, the WHO team concurred that there is evidence that Covid may have emerged outside of Wuhan. So it is imperative that they must go to places outside China which had reported covid-19 before Dec 2019 to do the tracing.  Covid-19 first emerged in China because the Chinese healthcare system mandates the doctors to input pneumonia cases into a computer system to track the possible recurrence of SARS. So the above-average no. of pneumonia cases in Wuhan in Dec 2019 triggered an alert to the Chinese healthcare authority for investigation and hence we came to know that covid-19 first emerged there. But if one looks at US pneumonia records in the winter 2019, it was reported there was a higher than usual no. of deaths then. But the Americans thought that they were just flu-related pneumonia and so they did not take action like what the Chinese did.   Hence in a nutshell, some time during the winter of 2019, covid-19 virus managed to spread globally but China discovered it first bec it had been ready to act for the possible recurrence of SARS which mirrored the symptoms of covid-19.  On the question why the European countries did not have the outbreak like Wuhan did before Dec 2019, one possible reason could be Wuhan is densely populated and also the Chinese life style of socialising means that many people were exposed to it for a long period in the winter and so R0 was higher compared to European cities which discovered traces of covid-19 before Dec 2019.  But we came to know that Italy had covid-19 cases in Feb 2020 which showed that R0 would build up over time as long as people were unaware of this silent pandemic. ",2021-02-09,377

3162,"The writer‚Äôs argument is severely flawed. He cited EU countries which take in patients from other member states. EU citizens have freedom of borderless movement within the EU and their national health insurance is portable throughout all EU countries.   ASEAN is different from the EU. There are wide socio-economic gaps between different ASEAN countries.  There is no free borderless movement of ASEAN nationals between member nations. National health benefits are not portable within ASEAN member nations.   Indonesia has a large population. There are many rich Indonesians who can afford to fly to Singapore for medical treatment and this was evident at the beginning of the pandemic when a severely ill patient flew into Singapore by air ambulance for treatment only to succumb a few days later. Since then, MOH has put a stop to ‚ÄòCOVID-19 medical tourists‚Äô requiring a health declaration to be submitted ahead of a planned visit to Singapore for medical consultation.  Although transmission within  Singapore is relatively low and ICU beds are readily available, allowing foreigners including Indonesians to seek treatment for COVID19 in Singapore will overwhelm the healthcare system. ICU beds are also required for other medical conditions besides COVID19. Hospitals in the UK have had to convert normal wards and operating theatres into COVID19 ICUs. We must never allow this to happen by opening the flood gates to foreign COVID19 cases.   The ability to pay for private medical care shouldn‚Äôt even be a consideration. Singapore‚Äôs hospital facilities should be reserved for Singaporeans and residents in times of a pandemic.   Because of the pandemic, hospital appointments and elective surgery for non-COVID19 related conditions have been put on hold for months.

4214,"Other than simple metrics for younger children, older teens have even more to gain. For example, whisking up a meringue is introducing air bubbles as well as denaturing proteins such as albumin by mechanical force. The difference between baking soda and baking powder is that the former needs something acidic in the recipe (lemon juice, cream of tartar, brown sugar, yoghurt, buttermilk etc) for CO2 to be produced and therefore the baked goods to rise while the latter only requires an aqueous phase as the acidic component is already present. Sugar is not just for taste but is part of the building blocks for the structure of cakes, stabilises your meringue, as well as tenderise your baked goods. The various flour are different because of particle size and protein content which affects the texture and flexibility of the baked products. Butter contains water and if you want to brown your butter, you have to remove the water content before the protein solids in butter will brown... There‚Äôs so much science in there. Baking is essentially chemistry. Baking bread is chemistry plus biology. Last but not least, I teach my daughter that for every change and adjustment she makes to her attempts at a recipe, she should document it. Documentation is one of the most important thing in scientific experiments. For whatever results and conclusions drawn is moot if the process is not documented in detail.",2020-12-21,235

I was on World Dream 9 days ago and I will presume that Quantum has the same exact measures in place, it just so happened Quantum had an unlucky moment in which a passenger was tested positive.  People I believe who go on these cruises know the risks they are getting into, but unlike international cruises, HighSeas/NoWhere/ cruises with no port of call have already been around a long time way before even Singapore had a casino and are generally safer since there will be no interaction with none other than Singaporeans/PRs (not including crew and the fly cruise passengers before the pandemic)  If you personally ask me, the definition of stupid in this pandemic is one who gets complacent, flouting the rules, not practicing the social distancing, etc etc. It‚Äôs not people who chose to go on the ship. So don‚Äôt blame these people or the government. In my opinion, Covid 19‚Äôs virus (TO ME) is not the problem, but the people are the bigger problem (especially those I mentioned above).",2020-12-09,205

Can the UN and WHO obtain this universal cooperation by all countries around the world to shut down this earth for 40 days and 40 nights at the same time?

It might not take off very well, scrapping it may be a good cause. Looking at the situation now and never forget recently SQ and other airlines let go alot of their staffs. It is really a very difficult time to everyone in the airline industry. But the introduction of an A380 dining experience sounds good.

5148,Dining in the plane is to keep our mind off the flight time in the air because we want to get off the plane asap.  Asking us to deliberately go back to the plane to experience dining inside?

These $498 meals are First Class fare, which has been curated by top, world-renowned chefs and come with premium wine and premium toileteries normally given out to First Class passengers.  We find a $498 meal expensive but top honchos who don't bat an eyelid to splurge $10,000 on an air ticket and $800 for a night in Shangri-la or Sheraton will beg to differ. I have met some of these high flyers (First Class passengers, PPS frequent flyers, etc) and I know these meals may appeal to them. These guys understand real value and they don't have time to waste browsing Facebook.  I'm not mocking or undermining my good friends here but I'm saying we're simply looking at things from our own perspectives. The world is much, much bigger than we think. Apple-to-apple comparisons are important.",2020-10-01,199

I tried to be strong just for them but many times I would fall apart, my heart was filled with sorrow and pain because I really loved my husband and our home? So I decided to search for help online and I came across Mama Morgan. I wanted to get my husband back so I felt I should give this a try. I contacted Mama Morgan and she was able to help me as soon as possible, she told me what to do and I did it? After some time my husband called me and told me that he missed me and the kids so much, I was overwhelmed!! and I asked him if he could come back to us, which he accepted, few days after he was home, he apologized for the pain he caused me and the kids. Then from that day, our marriage has been now stronger than how it was before, All thanks to Mama Morgan. She is so powerful and I decided to share my story on the internet that Mama Morgan  is a trustworthy powerful spiritual healer who I will always pray to live long to help anyone in the time of trouble, If you are here and your life is ruined, there""s hope, contact Mama Morgan she will be able to help you Call or Watsapp +27784502035.",2020-09-22,293

Go read the other analyses which were done weeks ago when we are hit by the pandemic. The authorities/MOM lump Singapore citizens with PRs as Singaporeans, forgetting that it is mandatory that Singapore citizens enlist for National Service and Singapore citizens cannot withdraw certain CPF contributions until death!

On weekends, she works as promotor. If work like this, have time to revise her homework? And in her study years, she can struck up a partnership to run canteens at construction sites in 1980s? It's not as easy to do business when you are studying. Which partner can trust her? Or which partner can verify this incident?  The most exaggerating story - in 1991, she went on a trip on an old plane to an Indonesia town so remote that she cannot recall it's name. One of the propellers malfunctioned and the pilot used a broom stick to force the propeller to turn!   If she went through so much in her early life, will she takes such a risk to go to a remote town in Indonesia to source for business by herself at an age of 29 during the 90s?   Some tall story here.

On Jan. 22, the first day Trump spoke publicly about the coronavirus, he told Fox News there was nothing to worry about. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all taken care of. And China is working very hard on the problem. We spoke about it and China is working very hard on it.‚Äù  Even two months later, Trump was still lauding China and Xi. ‚ÄúLook, I have a very good relationship with President Xi and they went through a lot. You know some people say other things. They went through a lot. They lost thousands of people. They‚Äôve been through hell,‚Äù he told reporters on March 24.  Josh Schwerin, senior strategist with the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, said Trump‚Äôs ploy is obvious.  ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs failure to act let the virus spread like wildfire in America and he now hopes that if the whole world is set ablaze, nobody will notice the damage he did at home,‚Äù Schwerin said. ‚ÄúTrump lies to distract from his early failures but his ongoing failures should worry us just as much.‚Äù  ...  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs jarring to see Trump‚Äôs letter invoke many of the data points that were publicly available in December and January to which he continued to turn a blind eye long after the WHO started sounding the alarm about the impending pandemic,‚Äù said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and a spokesman for the National Security Council under President Barack Obama. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to believe the WHO‚Äôs response was perfect ‚Äï it wasn‚Äôt, of course ‚Äï to find fault with Trump‚Äôs deeply flawed approach, which essentially amounted to empty praise of Beijing until his sudden 180, after which he‚Äôs offered nothing but blame.‚Äù  https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-china-reversal-coronavirus-blame_n_5ec44c7bc5b61e42ad3d8876",2020-05-23,623

10840,"Generally the consumption of utilities is depending on headcount in a family unit. Much depend on the lifestyles and the usage  of the members of the household unit and the prevalent weather existing.  Sometimes, there're people who've to bathe twice or more because of reasons unkown. Members  who are sporty, more washing is required for their sweaty clothings. Retirees and elderly  folks at home who watch TV with fans on on hot weather  as a source of pastimes consumed much  electricity. (Usually, these are members who have no aircon units at homes). Of course there're people who do not stay at home and always on the move. Their meals rely on outside stalholders.  The consumption of utilities may be curtailed for this household unit. Boiling of water for broth, washing of utensils and cleaning because of hygiene purposes make up the consumption of household utilities. Bills in expenses on utilities in household or expenditures whether for homes or external for social circles  will ever go up because of 'family bonding,' social cohesion and social circles and different activities. This is what a society is make up of. People who stay at home will have the household expeneses more whereas those who are working/not at homes may have the expenditures more. No income without savings will diminish the nest of accumulated wealth of past savings. Just from my observation, it is the transfer of costs and expenses and expenditures whether households, shops or factories or even transports cannot be quantified as utilities are. They should be provided by  Public Expenditure. What is the rationalism to determine the consumption of utilities then?",2020-03-10,268

11078,"#StandAgainstRacism #SayNOToSinophobia  This Coronavirus episode is a good wake up call to Chinese and Asians worldwide regardless of nationalities and paradigm.  I've received floods of msgs from friends and relatives worldwide (US, Canada, Australia and parts of Europe) on the escalation of brazen sinophobic racist attacks, insults and discrimination they suffered since the start of the Coronavirus episode. Anyone denying this is an ignorant fool with his head buried in the sand.  Even Asians like the Japanese, Vietnamese and Koreans are not spared the malice as many of them look like Chinese.  Poignant.  We concluded that at end of the day - you are still a ""chink"" to the racist West regardless of your self-proclaimed allegiance to them and/or total severence of your own Chinese/Asian roots to adopt Anglophone culture, language and narratives.   You may know your Homer and Shakespeare better than Western scholars, speak perfect Queen's English & fluent French, graduate from the most prestigious Western universities, drive top end German cars, be an immaculate gentleman in a bespoke suit from Savile Row and know every good vintage of Napa, Burgundy and Bordeaux - but still be despised and trampled over just because of the color of your skin. As evident by the countless cases of racism against Chinese and Asians worldwide during this Coronavirus period.  Time for Chinese and Asians worldwide to wake up and unite - stand firm and voice out against racism.  #StandAgainstRacism #SayNOToSinophobia  --------------  ""Chinese in UK report ‚Äòshocking‚Äô levels of racism after coronavirus outbreak.  Born and bred in Manchester, home to more than 7,000 Chinese people, the legal adviser said the level of anti-Asian racism the coronavirus had unearthed was ‚Äúshocking‚Äù.  ‚ÄúPeople seem to have put a whole race behind it and it‚Äôs exposing all these underlying prejudices towards Chinese people, or at least anyone who looks Chinese. It‚Äôs shocking in this day and age. It was so blatant,‚Äù Ngan said.  Ngan‚Äôs mother runs a Chinese restaurant in Heywood, in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. There had been ‚Äúa real downturn‚Äù over the lunar new year period, particularly since cases were confirmed in York last week, he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been very noticeable, far fewer customers since all this started.‚Äù  Despite only four confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the UK, Britain‚Äôs 390,000-strong Chinese community have noticed a markedly racist response to the global health crisis.  In Sheffield, a postgraduate student was reportedly verbally and physically harassed in the street for wearing a face mask, while in Leicestershire two students ‚Äì mistakenly thought to be Chinese ‚Äì were pelted with eggs on the street in Market Harborough. The Manchester Chinese Centre has received scores of complaints of racist incidents targeting children in schools across the region.  North Yorkshire police confirmed they had received two reports of verbal abuse where individuals of an ‚ÄúAsian appearance‚Äù had comments about coronavirus shouted at them in York, and there was a further incident where staff at an Asian tea house had been verbally abused.  Last week the University of York, home to around 2,000 Chinese students, issued a statement calling for respect and tolerance after xenophobic and racist comments were published on the anonymous confessions page Yorfess.  The site was shut down, but the student newspaper York Vision reported that comments ranged from stating that the risk of the virus spreading was minimal because Asian students were ‚Äúcliquey and unwilling to integrate‚Äù, to one user not wanting to share cutlery with their international housemates.  ...  The deeper prejudices exposed by the coronavirus are symptomatic of a long history of demonising Chinese people, according to Jex Wang, a Chinese-Australian DJ and writer, who was sent threatening, racist abuse after writing about the coronavirus on Instagram.  ‚ÄúStereotypes of Asians as submissive and non-aggressive make them a target that people think they can make fun of and laugh at. I‚Äôve seen posts saying Chinese people are dirty, disgusting, uneducated, we ‚Äòdeserved‚Äô the virus because of our ‚Äòweird‚Äô food habits,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúI kept seeing memes and jokes being shared which really upset me. There was even a coronavirus-themed club night in Sheffield that got shut down ‚Äì they were offering ‚Äòtraditional Chinese hats‚Äô to the first 100 people. What is a traditional Chinese hat??‚Äù  After calling out the problematic behaviour and language surrounding the coronavirus on Instagram, her inbox was soon flooded with such ‚Äúhateful‚Äù messages that she had to turn comments off on the post. ‚ÄúPeople accused me of eating bats, told me to go back to China, that I had betrayed the west, I was even accused of fraternising with the Chinese Communist party.‚Äù One message said: ‚ÄúChina needs to be cancelled.
