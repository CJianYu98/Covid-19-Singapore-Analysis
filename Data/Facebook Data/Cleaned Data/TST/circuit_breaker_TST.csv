0,I failed to get a place for my son in a sch just next to me. Now i need to spend additional 45min to pick up both kids. Ironically my younger one is in the infant near that ideal sch.. I tried to be PV but rejected coz im a working mother. There is nv a fair system in any case The poor will nv get a place in Nanyang pri coz they have no buy to pay for alumni.,2021-03-04,79
1,About time. It‚Äôs ridiculous that my kid wasn‚Äôt able get in the school just across the road. And yet people who stay much further away managed to get a place.  ,2021-03-03,32
2,Perhaps can consider scraping Phase 2A/2B. Let all children have equal chance through ballot regardless of their residence distance.,2021-03-04,18
3,"Just skip all the priorities, phases, etc. Have a national balloting based on luck, not distance, past relationships (alumni,etc)",2021-03-03,20
4,"If I am not wrong, there are always schools that easy to enrol in every area. A pure distance enrolment will cause prices of next door estates to popular schools to skyrocket. Only rich can afford. Wouldnt it create its only enclave of people?",2021-03-03,44
5,"All schools are good schools, and to enroll children in a school nearest to home address is important. First Priority should be given to ""Home Distance nearest to School"" before anything else. Subsequently, if there is an oversubscribed position for home-school distance, then elder siblings who are already attending that particular school, followed by alumni, and then parent volunteer should take into consideration, in that order.",2021-03-03,65
6,"Phase 2b is discriminatory and should be scraped.  1km radius is too big, should be reviewed. My kid needs to walk 15min to her school everyday when there‚Äôs a school within 5mins walk away, doesn‚Äôt make sense.   Children with siblings already attending particular school should still be given priority.   And I don‚Äôt even want to talk about those people who are gaming the system by renting a place nearby. Moe says they have to reside at the address for at least 30 months, but I wonder if they perform checks regularly. Not easy I understand. But maybe make everyone declare if it‚Äôs a rental address and check on those more rigorously.",2021-03-03,110
7,"Why is there a need for phase 2B where parent volunteers and community leaders get priority over phase 2C, esp when they have no direct connection to the school? Let the community leaders lead by example by applying through phase 2C. If not, the statement  that all schools are good schools is just bullcrap.",2021-03-03,51
8,"Distance should be considered a priority for enrollment, especially within walking distance to school. This will help ease the traffic congestion of cars queues along the roadside waiting to get into school to fetch the kids, which directly causes a problem for residents living nearby. If many are enrolled based on proximity, it could help ease the issue.",2021-03-04,58
9,‚Äòany increase in places for Phase 2C would mean greater competition under the earlier phases for more popular schools.‚Äô The most stressful phase for p1 registration. parents have upped their chances by paying alumni fees to get into phase 2A1. Popular schools hardly have vacancies in 2A2.  ,2021-03-03,43

11,"Please scrap parent volunteer scheme under Phase 2B as it is a form of ‚ÄúI help you, you help me‚Äù bribery.",2021-03-03,20
12,"It's ridiculous to know if my kids can't get to the popular primary school 1min walk away and have to travel at least 5-6km for the next nearest school. And we have to do that for at least 6 years (+number of children)! And imagine majority of the school children that lives in my vicinity all have to do that, it's definitely a much worse evil compared to the cons of soaring hdb prices, which is kind of balanced out because the flat is getting old (close to 50 years).",2021-03-04,84

16,Even for JC posting student are not posted to the JC of thier choice although student have chosen & qualify to enter with the cut off points . Moreover why is affiliated  sch is deducting 4 point. Some students who don't qualify to enter the JC with  the original grade but Just becos is affiliated they are given a place in that JC.  Moe just dump the students in some    dumping ground JC where there is no demand for that JC .  Moe nor the ministers care for the trouble the child  parent is facing nor if the child is losing moral &  feeling being degraded and losing interest in the studies .  Just for the sakes of giving a place in any JC of moe choice moe job and the education minister has done a great job as the task assign  is completed.  Appeal with moe and education minister no use is just wasting time.  Moe will push to the JC to relply and JC reply is moe to decide.   They are keeping the place in that JC for foreign student .,2021-03-04,175

21,"Ministry of Education, Singapore The Workers' Party Progress Singapore Party Louis Ng Kok Kwang Sun Xueling  Scrape away the complicated alumni and parent volunteer scheme.   Just follow the principles all school are good school and this will avoid the issue of P1 allocation and vacancies and the ever increasing frustration among the family staying near the primary school and they cannot enter send their kid into the nearest school.  Things are so simpler to resolve and yet the government just want to complicate it.  At this age, the primary kids just need more play time and rest time and happiness.  The closer they are to their primary school the better they feel in term of physiological and mental well-being.  (Updates) feedbacks submitted to reach.gov.sg",2021-03-03,121

27,"What‚Äôs the point of building schools in the neighbourhood when your child couldn‚Äôt even get a place to the nearest one? While stressing that all schools are ‚Äòequally good‚Äô, a ranking system still exists somewhere. Phase 2B relies on biased connections and parents with privileged free time to volunteer and become ‚Äòcommunity leaders‚Äô. If both parents are working class full-time or having more than 1 child it is challenging to find such spare time. Please be fair.",2021-03-07,76

40,"Well in all this whole conversation everyone seems to be saying the right and correct stuff abt this situation, but but to be honest do u all actually think MOE cares abt what u say... I mean just take a look at everything that is happening in this generation of schooling system or this generation of kids  1. Teachers are afraid of students and parents. Scolding them is wrong punishing them is wrong and so on and on 2. Teachers having to pay for parking in the school, mind you they are the ones bringing up our future leaders.  3. leaders that are making all this decision, are their kids in normal neighborhoods schools or elite schools. Do they really know what actually happens in all this school?  4. Look at what has happen now, compare to the time this decision makers were kids. They enjoyed the beach (swimming, staying overnight, don‚Äôt need licenses for tent) cinemas (cheap movie tickets for kids), playgrounds (where they can play with sand)   Kids in this generation will never have the fun exciting time we all use to have while we were kids.. they are not thinking of the kids period!! they are thinking abt themselves and their job and their money..",2021-03-04,205

Phase 2A, for what? Entrench privilege? Phase 2B, also for those who got spare hours to burn. Phase 2C, requires commitment to actually relocate to the school's vicinity.",2021-03-03,52
44,Distance based priority should go to those who live there all through the period the child attends the school otherwise the child must then move if the parents move since it is all about distance! Best idea in the world for those long property near popular schools. 6 year turnaround. We already have school starting times to suit the school bus profits so why not now use school to enrich property owners and brokers? Hahahahahahahahaha..

49,"So many kinks in the system that has just snowballed over the years and placing the average Singaporeans at a disadvantage.  Voicing our opinions are, most of the time, futile coz no one's gonna really walk the ground and truly understand the struggles of the average Singaporeans.   And while we are here debating on the different phases of registration, there is still a small group of children who requires special education. These special individuals will benefit from true inclusion, i.e. curriculum that is catered to serve both neurotypical and children with special needs, not literal inclusion of placing a few in a class and declaring it inclusive.   Bottom line is, the privileged are always going to continue to be the privileged lot and they are going to get their ways all the time anyway. The average Singaporean children just have to work extra hard, that's all we can do.  Every executed government plan always has economic benefits, that is not bad at all of course, but I wish there can be more balance. Hope the system can be thoroughly looked into and not like just switching from Tscores to AL scores kinda change..",2021-03-04,192
