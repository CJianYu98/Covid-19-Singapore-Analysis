101587157,11100600,Valerie Yap,"Dec 11, 2020",I hope sufficient inputs are gathered from the elderly on how they’d like the layouts to be.   Some of the interiors remind me of the private rooms in private hospitals.

101587157,11100600,Jasmine P'ng Siok Lee,"Dec 11, 2020","An expensive alternative (lease cost much more than 2 room flexi elderly flat) to nursing home option. But idea of living among ill or disabled people needing medical care or waiting to pass on morbid concept. Probably a good option for family who don't want to live with elderly at their home (bec social issues or cannot get along or don't want to care for frail elderly at home, privacy issues  etc). People who need such care & close medical monitoring  may not have adequate $$$ in CPF account !  Perhaps kids consider pay $$$ from CPF to help elderly buy such flats. Personally as an elderly I prefer to live among mixed age younger group people with young children (cheerful environment). Live in retirement village with frequent wakes can be emotionally stressing -reminding one of our declining health, vulnerability & death"

101585316,48475600,I-Chun Liu,"Sep 29, 2020","Failure to control ballooning obesity and lifestyle diseases has led to the entire population footing ever increasing healthcare premiums:  1. The overall trends for obesity and overweight (in Singapore), for both males and females, have been rising since 1992. The proportion of obese and overweight adults aged 18 to 69 years was 8.7% and 36.2% respectively in 2017. See: https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/resources-statistics/reports/executive-summary-nphs-2016_17.PDF  This compares very unfavourably with Japan, which has the lowest overweight and obese people at 23.8% among OECD countries, and South Korea coming second at 33.4% (data as of 2015). See: https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/health_glance-2017-21-en.pdf?expires=1600659993&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=F233C094EC13B8185B8DA332CB2756AA  2.

101585316,48475600,Teck Koon Lim,"Sep 29, 2020","The raised premium is largely the failure of our health care policies to curb DHL (diabetes, hypertension, lipid problems) and overweight/obesity and manage those who do not take responsibility for their own health.  You should have premium loading for those who do not take responsibility for their own health and give premium discount to those who do.    Please do not use Medishield Life and Careshield as a stop gap measure for failure of healthcare policies.  You are just solving a financial problem by spreading the financial load instead of coming up with effective solutions to have preventive health care strategies and tactics to reduce unnecessary healthcare utilization from preventable chronic diseases such as DHL (Diabetes, Hypertension, Lipid problems), overweight/obesity and musculoskeletal problems.  Our DHLO prevalence puts me to tears when compared to countries like Japan."

101585316,48475600,Ivy Ng,"Oct 1, 2020","I will try to explain my daughters’ condition to my best efforts. Hwee Suan was supposedly diagnosed with a chronic, lifelong condition called Short Bowel Syndrome  (SBS), more like similar treatment, she do not have an exact diagnosis yet). I had problems explaining her conditions earlier because She don't have an exact diagnosis yet Individuals with SBS suffer from mal-absorption, compromised immune systems; rely on IV nutrition because they can't absorb nutrients, always at risk for infections that could turn fatal in second, chronic diarrhea, electrolyte deficiency, oral aversion, etc. Hwee Suan has spent over half of her life, living in the hospital; she has had over 10 surgeries including peripheral line insertions. People think that because she ""looks"" good and has stayed out of the hospital, everything is ok. We are truly grateful she is out of the hospital and has been as healthy as She can be thank Guan Yin Ma, but this is our lives. Short Bowel Syndrome in INCURABLE. I've been fighting for over 7 years now and I will continue but just like everything else, some days are tougher than others, and her Mid-Sep14 days hospital admission with zero home leave was one of those days. I recall growing up watching NKF donation on TV and saw how many people moved to tears. It’s such a horrifying condition. Well that’s before I got to know about SBS and TPN For people with kidney failure, they need each hemodialysis treatment lasts about four hours and is done three times per week. TPN needs 14hours of infusion 3-4x a week on a cycling basis. While there are outpatient centers for Dialysis.  The difference is, there NO outpatient centers for TPN Both go long term and need a port/ peripheral line to run the treatment. Both sicknesses run the risk of running out of access when all the vessels collapsed and the patients lost their “lifelines” A kidney patient gets cured with a transplant. Some TPN patients need a transplant.  The difference is, Kidney transplant (usually one organ) is approved in Singapore BUT INTESTINE TRANSPLANT (usually need 2 organs – intestine and kidney from a living donor) IS NOT APPROVED IN SINGAPORE yet. Both Kidney dialysis and organ transplant patients are covered under medishield life extended outpatient treatments. I really really MOH will understand that TPN outpatient is really a treatment that they should support. CURRENT Criteria for Long-Term and Home PN for MediShield Life Coverage and MediSave The patient will require TPN for a minimum of 90 days. The reason is even dialysis treatment which was just 4hours therapy need not administered for 90days straight to be eligible for MOH outpatient claims for outpatient treatment. https://www.moh.gov.sg/.../medishield-life-coverage-extended The issue is TPN therapy needs a COMPULSORY break to alternate between TPN and glucose/premix infusion to prevent liver failure. It's medically dangerous to infuse TPN for 90days straight without breaks (we used to alternate between premix and glucose infusion) because 90 days straight infusion of TPN will cause liver failure and death. WE NEED SUPPORT. All of you out there who have helped or supported us even by sharing a post to spread awareness. Please help us write into MOH council for a review of the TPN policy.  we sincerely hope the policymakers will speak to the patients and the doctors before issuing any policys.  A wrong policy ruin lives. appreciate if you could help us write into MOH to appeal for a review of the TPN policy. The background to this request is the medishield council is seeking people's views on these ""preliminary recommendations"", with a public consultation held till Oct 20. https://www.straitstimes.com/.../medishield-life-to-offer...? 1. ACTION 1 - Read my post below and share my post. We appeal for a change of outpatient TPN 90days policy. We will greatly appreciate if MOH will seek the doctors on the serious side effects of 90days TPN continuous infusion. A wrong policy ruin cause liver failure and ruins lives. https://www.moh.gov.sg/.../medishield-life-coverage-extended 2.  ACTION 2- Details on the preliminary recommendations can be viewed, and feedback submitted. https://www.moh.gov.sg/e-consultation/mshl2020 3. ACTION 3 - Please help us lobby for MOH to approve pediatric intestine cum live transplant ( as it it’s a system), paediatric intestine is currently not approved in Singapore. We hope for a change and need a change before some children runs out of “life lines” and lose their lives. So now, we speak up, the above will really help us and the other families who has a child with small bowel syndrome or medical conditions which require TPN. A big thank you to all for reading. Please take time to forward and spread the awareness"

101577749,95270600,Mei Yin Ng,"Feb 15, 2020","Ministry of Health, Singapore  I was at Bedok Polyclinic a few days ago. The staff have started measuring temperature of everyone entering the polyclinic. A staff used a forehead thermometer while another used an ear thermometer. One must insert the ear thermometer properly into the ear in order to do an accurate reading. In addition, it takes longer for the staff to measure someone’s temperature using the ear thermometer, compared to a forehead thermometer. I would suggest the Polyclinic provides forehead thermometer to their staff instead of the ear thermometer so that they don’t have to come into too close contact with visitors and patients.   Next, it’s regarding water supply in the toilet inside the Bedok Polyclinic. In one of toilets, the water from the taps at the basins were flowing out so little and cut off so fast that it has become so difficult to do a proper hand washing. I am not sure if the same happens in the other toilets in Bedok Polyclinic, or even in other polyclinics. Is this done to cut cost? I think, the polyclinics should provide an environment to facilitate the public into practicing proper hygiene measures, especially in the current time of an epidemic event.   Hope the relevant authority will look into the matters so that  the staff in the polyclinics, together with the public, can protect themselves better in face of this COVID19 epidemic."

We’ll have serious loss at different areas no matter which direction you go. But a small number in your data is a tragic for the whole family. I plead you to stop school.
