These are rank and file workers who are marginally paid, and now possibly without income because of stop work and isolation, many of them will be under tremendous stress, beside the fear of infection. Please take care of our foreign friends as they play a major role in our nation building, especially HDBs."
101579493,30970600,Seherezada Onur,"Apr 5, 2020",Should we send out survey to check all the dormitory workers if they have been to Mustafa recently.For those who went there recently. Further isolation should be carried out. Those who take public transport should be given private bus services to bring them to their work space. Or quarantine order be given. Otherwise the spread to the community might be increase exponentially and it will be a nightmare. Understand that foreign workers like to mingle with each other during their break to little india. The risk of infection is very high among them

Govt MUST step up to ensure that this circuit breaker period every company, malls, shops, eateries, everyone MUST adhere to the measures. Let's all stay safe, healthy and positive and do our part so that we can all bounce back again soon!"
101579493,30970600,Abdul Rahim Ab Gani,"Apr 5, 2020",Pls do not start a blame game now. The foreign worker employer also must play a part. As long as we allowed people to mingle there's always a chance for the virus to be transmitted. Gov should do a total shutdown to break the cycle of transmission. There's no way around it. Economy we can rebuild but human life's once dead cannot be remake. I implore the leader to take this decision. Afterall u still hv to do a total shutdown later. Do it now. If LKY is in this position I believe he will take this drastic action and not played with the people life. We hv the know-how and  finance to rebuild the economy later.

I read in the news highlights above that these workers are not to go to work? Aren’t they under quarantine?  The dormitories are akin to a stationary cruise-ship. If we extrapolate the figure from the affected cruise-ships lately, we may be looking at a few thousands cases within a week or so.   How can we better protect these workers and ourselves?  Is getting them to stay in their rooms a workable method? There are a number of ‘abandoned’/empty buildings all around Singapore - what about quickly cleaning up those areas and getting the workers to split up into smaller groups and isolate themselves there?"
101579493,30970600,Kilyn Liong,"Apr 6, 2020","As long as MOH is already high alert on these 2 clusters, I believe they know what they are doing to contain spread to community from these dormitories. We could only pray for the quick contain of the spread and employers cooperate with  MOH."
101579493,30970600,Jimmy Beany,"Apr 6, 2020","Not evacuating the workers from the building and start disinfecting it is a big mistake. It feels like diamond cruises all over again except its now in Singapore. All workers should have been tested for the virus, because asymptomatic and mild symptoms patients are equally infectious. These dormitories are not adequately equipped to be quarantine centers."

Replenish stockpile from China and need not be picky given urgency of foreign workers' issue.

101579493,30970600,Alvyn Baron Xie,"Apr 6, 2020","The very fact they consist a small proportion against the entire population and yet yesterday have almost double the infected compared to singaporean locals means one thing. They have not observed and kept the hygiene standards and also not been observing any distancing measures.   The dormitory all allocated to them were almost new and good condition when they moved in. The fact there are cockroaches derive from littering and bad personal maintainence of their personal spaces.  In the Singapore army in BMT we have 10 men to a single bunk room and an entire company of 160 men using a single block. Yet with proper area cleaning we kept it spotless. Toilets are sparkling. On top of that as full time soldiers we had to fufil every single training obligation issued to us.  Instead of complaining about cockroaches and bad hygienic conditions....why not start area cleaning. They are getting a full months pay to do nothing. Spend the time wisely! Hundreds of Singaporeans too live in blocks and dine in local hawker centers with hundreds of people at any time.  My fear is if their girlfriends who may be FDWs go back home with their infection. The entire family she lives with will suffer. This will cause a massive infestation. I pray this day never comes.   I believe the govt policy to quarantine 20,000 is very sound. This is a preventative measure against a mass outbreak amongst millions of local Singaporeans who have stood by Singapore thick and thin and served the nation when she needed us. It’s understandable that many foreigners are here to enjoy the wealth, prosperity and jobs that we are blessed with. However consider the flip side of the coin....assuming there is a war....outbreak....or any disaster....will the very ones who flocked here for jobs stay with us and fight with us or will they be the first ones to board planes and ships out. It’s the sons of this land who will lose the most as we have families and friends here. As a son if this land without question I will fight for her as my love ones are here. Let’s all fight covid and this 30 days cooperate and give our best. For our love ones"

I knew long ago Singapore prefer foreign workers specifically those construction workers from Thailand. As years go by, it could be due the rapid development of Thailand, these Thais workers are difficult to come by and the labour cost could be more expensive. Due to certain reason, Singapore had been avoid getting Indon to work in construction industry. Instead they opt for labour from India, China and Bangladesh. Did I say something wrong.
