101584483,4358600,Tan Joy,"May 27, 2020",客工问题必须考虑多方面，正常与任何可能发生的突发事件。社会安宁和卫生和经济必须取得平衡，这次疫情显示额外成本的可怕性，社会如果动乱足以破坏生命财产国家安全等更不可当着理所当然。客工问题一来是文化，层次 还有费用，设施就是土地，能翻几倍呢?疫情期间增加多少住宿? 要合符新标准需要多少设备和费用，企业能不靠政府自己妥善处理吗？这次疫情交通住宿管理监督雇主在业者和官方都有责任。我们许多行业不错没有客工就没人来干了，怎么办呢? 那些行业是必须? 是非得进口客工不可，人力部要深入研究。

I had no choice as to give birth while being jobless in the middle of the lockdown. It would be good to have some understanding why the government is prioritising unborn and not even conceived babies over the existing Singaporean babies born during hard times."

Then what about those parents who give birth from 1 Oct onwards, they won't get to enjoy benefits from marriage and parenthood package? What a ridiculous support govt had come out. So are we going to put our babies back into the tummy and re give birth again just to get this additional support?

The mechanism can be by way of ""backflushing""; pre-approved grant first, penalize for ""cheating"" later (eg jail term for the small percentage of cheaters that will be barred from future programs) instead.  Please consider.  Err on the safe and trust side.  Many abled PMETs and citizens never want to be depending on support grant financially ever.  Support without conditions or condition-less and less Conditions.  During such times, support with a COVID -mindset.  Many of the grant officers can be and resources could be deployed to support job recovery or re-employment (Back To Work) for those affected."

In the mist of such economic situation people got no choice but to take up such role even if working hours are not 8-5 . Singaporean probably have to change their mindset and get out of their comfort zones.As a Singaporean I want to suggest and provide some solutions to whatever ideas there can be as DPM did mentioned about listening feedbacks from the ground.

101585384,22288600,Sah Soon Lim,"Jun 25, 2020","Let’s have good inclusive schemes for the low-wage Singaporeans , not just sticking to old mind sets or western HR practices blindly ! We not only need to raise the low wages of our workers at the bottom but also have to remove the social stigma against them and give them the much needed respect and career advancement opportunities .  For example ，NEA may want to think out of the box and consider an innovative proposal to draw up a common public health -essential service professional workers scheme to attract Singaporeans to join and serve as a life long career in this essential public sector . Such common service scheme respects and treasures every worker right from the bottom as a cleaner up to the top as a public health manager or superintendent. Young and old Singaporeans regardless of their educational levels or English proficiency can be encouraged to join as public health workers doing the cleaner‘s job at a good starting salary of say $2000 pm for a headstart.The more positive and ambitious ones will be given ample on-the-job career training and development opportunities under the scheme to upgrade themselves to take up various higher job responsibilities ，such as truck driver， machine & tool workshop technician, auto-machine operator，plumber，foreman，supervisor，manager ， public health inspector ，public health trainer ， public health enforcement officer，public health supprintendant and even as a certified public health consultant or a licensed cleaning contractor or SME boss in this industry,as they gain more practical experiences, higher job skills and relevant job interests while working and growing from the bottom to the top and to the best of their ability and hard work. If this pilot scheme proves to be successful for the essential public sector , similar common and inclusive schemes can then be widely implemented for other low wage Singaporeans to bring them into the main stream of our entire workforce in every industry so that we dont depend too much on FW to keep Singapore clean ,healthy and staying  ahead of others as a great city within a garden! More importantly ,we don’t become panic and helpless if the FW for any future reason will not or cannot come to Singapore to work any more. Could NEA or any aspiring MP care to take up or look into this essential issue that is of great concern to Singaporeans?"

This is going to cause major congestions on pathways in housing estates that are so narrow and only allow one person to walk pass at a time. How do you social distance with these ridiculous new measures.   It forces us out of the safety of our compound to add to the already crowded public areas? How is this logical? It’s also now putting us at unnecessary risk! I urge you to please look at these new guideline and do something about them as they are not practical. Condominiums should be able to exercise their own guidelines where rules like this are crazy and put residents in harms way unnecessarily. My dog is a puppy and was terrified to go on the street. We already try our best to be out quickly and come back but these rules force us to go further and so take longer times outside.   Please also check all BCA’s crazy guidelines that don’t make sense.

I was reading the 541-page report published on MOF website, and noted the proposed manpower cost of political appointments for many Ministries (not all) is higher for 2020 than 2019/2018. It is important to clarify why. Perhaps such proposed increase can be re-allocated to needy families, in the true spirit of SG united."
