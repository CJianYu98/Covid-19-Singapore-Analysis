Yet up to now it is still talk only. Was it because  dengue is not a global problem and pharma company cannot make big buck. So they are not keen in development of the vaccines? In fact dengue is more dangerous as no one can prevent himself from getting a mosquito bite. For Covid wash our hands, wear a mask etc etc, we are 95% safe."

101590344,72418600,Bryen Yap,Jan-17,Thanks heroes....  For.... Testing the vaccine
101590344,72418600,Sharingan Ismadi,Jan-13,"Yup. Faster vaccinate while the vaccine is still pfizer. Once the rest are approved for use in SG, no guarantee the doctor will give you your desired vaccine. But then again, once approved means the vaccines are good right?"
101590344,72418600,Edna Teo,Jan-03,https://youtu.be/8pP4--d4btk  See how it help ?
101591334,46288600,David Cool,Feb-05,"The same chip of the old block, in kindness, care, compassion, helpfulness, welfare, concern, etc, etc, etc. Singapore P. M. is the best leader, in the region. 👍❤️😊Tks"
101591334,46288600,Albert Cheung,Feb-06,"Over 14 millions inoculated in U.K. so far and I don’t recall seeing news on any death due to the vaccines. Insurance is normally what we have to pay for in return of unforeseen risk. No one is forcing anyone to take the vaccine, hence the risk. I suggest you buy an Insurance policy to cover yourself for any eventuality as a result of the vaccine given in U.K. and be grateful that it’s free. Better still, don’t take the vaccine, stay home and help the NHS. "
101591334,46288600,Ang Eng Siong,Feb-04,Thank u PM  for your concern and care for the people of Singapore.I am a pioneer and had the vaccination on 1st of feb at Teck Ghee C.C. Heartfelt thanks to our PM and leaders of Singapore.
