101584230,54803600,Wen Tian,"May 20, 2020","Good to be optimistic but always stay humble.  The reason of 2nd circuit breaker extension is due to outbreak in foreign worker dormitories. While this piece is currently under control,  always be prepared for another spike in other areas when 2nd circuit breaker ends.  Believe in Murphy law to be safe.  While we want it good,  things will be otherwise."

This segment of the population is probably the most affected mentally by being alone over the CB. Surely, there will be some lifting of restrictions for this segment. E.g mini bubbles like those that were allowed in NZ. Hoping the government will provide clarity on this matter. Thanks "
101584230,54803600,Hava Ashraff,"May 20, 2020","My concern is what will be done about the dormitories operators who were not following international cleaning and maintenance standards? Given that many of the workers would come from villages and rural areas where hygiene standards are very low, what future provisions will MOM be making in organising standard programmes to teach them about hygiene standards (like is done for maids)? How will employers and dormitory operators be made accountable as well?  These are questions that are very relevant after this bad experience. The general public needs to know. There is no point to control 80% of society with strict measures while neglecting 20% who live in bad conditions and become carriers of viruses."

I am currently renting a space from a hairsalon that has a shop front and partition to separate our space. As my business falls under Beauty they say i cannot open on the 2nd of June. I am a manicurist and I hope to open as I have clients who are in pain due to ingrown nail that can cause swelling and inflammation or under hard skin that causes cracked heels that will lead to bleeding. I am told they an go seek hospital to treat it but most of them have have been say they feel pain even more frequent or the doc will tell them to go for minor operation to remove the nail which is not necessary than when they see me as I can treat this problem if not servere. But it has been two months and most of my clients are feeling the pain and have made appt. I only need to open to do pedicure only to help these clients. Even if it's 2 or 3 days week at least to do Pedicure for the feet takes about an hour only. And I have ladies and gentlemen who have injured back and can't bend to cut the nails for the feet or diabetes who need nails short if not dangerous if the nail is too long and they bang into anything in the house. I work alone with no employee. Please consider my business as essential. Cause I don't understand hair salon can open to do full Services that can take a good 4-6hrs per client and I am only doing pedicure that is only an hour job. And my landlord says this month I have to start paying rent and that is a good $2000. So if business cannot open how do I pay next months rent. Am very worried please advise.

Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my boyfriend. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached his flat I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to his room. When I knocked, he allowed me to enter because he wasn't expecting me at the time, but when I opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in his house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, he followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away. I reached home and cried a lot until i told my best friend everything and she told me to fight for my man and not lose him to another woman. She gave Mama Shamirah contact(+27790792882) and told Mama Shamirah will bring back my boyfriend to me and love and only me. I contacted Mama Shamirah and told her everything and she made a love and binding prayers for me and in 1 day of the prayers my boyfriend came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again. The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby, he cried and smiled with joy and happiness. We are back together and so much in love and waiting for our baby to arrive. Thanks so much Mama Shamirah your prayers indeed work. You can call or whatsapp Mama Shamirah on +27790792882 incase you are passing through the same situation. Don't be discouraged by what people may tell you that even don't know the situation you are going through, all that matters are the results so feel free to contact her on Call/Whatsapp +27790792882 0r Email: mamashamirahsince1970@gmail.com.

101583614,73278600,Gurmeet Kaur Grewal,"May 2, 2020","Wearing of masks must continue to be mandated for all after the end of the CB. As infection can take place thru the eyes, the wearing of goggles, shield or visor should also be mandated once the CB measures are gradually lifted. This must become the way of life until such time a vaccine becomes available. It is very important for everyone to have peace of mind that they are safe all the time so that they can focus on their jobs, education and life.  The going will get tougher for sometime more both in terms of safety from the virus and financial consequences that most would face. A complete mind set shift is needed going forward."

101588126,40008600,Bongiwe Jessica,"Oct 1, 2020","I grew up surrounded by God and church members from the very beginning. Being risen by Christian home, I always followed through the motions of doing “Christian things” that I thought a Christian was supposed to do. I didn’t know GOD, I just knew about Him. I found myself searching for purpose and meaning in people and also in myself. Whether that was my friends or in relationships, I poured my whole heart into them. I became very consumed with what people thought of me and was living for the acceptance of the world. At my lowest point when I lost my lovely husband to a beautiful young girl I think we call slay queens these days, I was alone and afraid, I couldn’t concentrate at work not even at any other thing I could work on. Losing my concentration cost me so much that I ended up losing my job too and went back to staying at my parents’ house with my two kids. I can’t lie to you, it was always more hurting and annoying staying home because my mom’s friends used to almost come every day to visit and sit outside talking about their marriages’ and fun they had maybe like during the weekends’ and laugh, OMG, that laugh they used to give always killed me. After what friends showed me that year I admit I had turn into a jealous person. That year was a year I will never forget. I could wake up in the morning sit on the couch watch Isindigo, login Facebook and all those sorts of social Medias and cry the whole day with my mum nursing me until it reached a time that she was also getting fade with my sobbing. It was my daughter’s birthday and some few people turned up, many were my mums friends and actually my daughters friends none of my closest turned up and it was from then I noticed that “people will always love you and support you when its beneficial” out of my mums friends, I found myself initiated in a long and funny conversation with one of them after the party. I won’t forget the fact that her husband called almost like 10 times in a period of 5 minutes just to remind her how he loved her and wishing her to drive safe back home, believe me I had never had that experience with my man. Later on during the conversation, she saw me burst into tears and she asked me what was going on, I told her everything I was going through with my life. And it was from here that I got to know about Mama Morgan +27784502035 a very cunning woman I have ever met. She told me about her meeting with Mama Morgan and she actually never gave me her numbers but took me with her to Mama Morgan. Being a born Christian, believe me I had a very big challenge here. Like how am I going to mix these two things from growing up in a Christian home to starting to believe in African tradition, but I kept on consoling myself. I always kept on having dreams having money, living lavish, and snakes chasing me, falling in very deep holes, having sex with people I don’t even know, being shot, losing fights and many more dreams that didn’t make sense to me. One morning of a beautiful Saturday I went on and called this lady (my mums’ friend) and told her I was ready to meet Mama , she came home, picked me and we went to meet Mama Morgan . She asked me what she wanted to use and I gave her everything then she conducted her prayers. What surprised me was that she was using a BIBLE and mirror to conduct her prayers then after everything she asked me to go back home and wait on the results. It took me 5 days then the father of my kids came to my parents place and He was all in tears telling me that the young girl she had opt to stay with was using muthi on him and she was targeting his riches she even tried to poison him like the evening before he came home but he missed on the poison and the cat ate it instead and he had come to ask for forgiveness and that he saw me in the dream like two days back and he was kneeling begging me to come back in his life and that’s why he had drove home to ask for my forgiveness. Believe me I cried even more than before when he was telling me his story. After like a week, I got a call that Eskom needed me back to work after a period of a year and a half. You can reach Mama Morgan on Call/Whatsapp+27784502035 in case you need her assistance."

Most that goes to wet market are seniors who are not tech savvy or low income families without a smartphone or data plan and also dunno or can't order groceries online.

We noticed that most stand alone supermarkets only have staff at the entrance asking shoppers for SafeEntry registration Check In and no assistance advice for Check out. When asked about the Check Out and we were told: “no need to Check Out”....  what about those elderly only enter by scanning IC?Hence, w/o Check Out, which mean we are in the outlet 24/7??? Best of all, the News mentioned that many shoppers did not “check out” after completed their shopping trips, that make the tracking very difficult for the tracking teams. Thus, is this SafeEntry app without Check Out really help in tracking???"

I think all of us shares an equal responsibility to make sure we respect each other and follow the guidelines to the letter.

Will it result in overcrowding with social distancing being compromised for the first few days of opening?   2. This is always a worrying trend when trade opens for the first few days like MacDonald,  barber shop and also then the closure of pubs,  restaurant before the circuit breaker.    3. It is hard to discipline and resist and this is where covid-19 creeps in like what is happening in Beijing now.  As long vaccines are not found,  it is unlikely we can be free as a bird.    4.Wash hands and only go out for essential trip must be observed.  We can be excited but if not careful,  we will put more healthcare workers in a harder situation.  5.Wearing of mask till end of 2020 must be mandated and not an option.  When winter enters and haze issue happening,  we have more teething issue to solve , not to mention the dengue fever and the coming 7th month when burning of incense pollutes the environment.   We are not over the ordeal but just a respite for the worst to come. Repeated ads to wash hands,  wear mask and social distancing must continue on TV and radio to remind elderly and children. This must be a new normal everyone must observe till a vaccine is found."

101583182,92343600,Wen Tian,"Apr 22, 2020","1. Everytime there is a tighter measure such as closure,  naturally there are people crowding for their last dine in meal,  disco night,  MacDonald, bubble tea or pet shop purchase.  These behaviour is triggered by anxiety and fear of loss in basic needs temporary. Unknowingly,  it allows covid-19 to breed among crowds as some carriers may pass to others unknowingly,  with no symptoms.   2. Incremental measures are hard to enforce as it takes time for the entire Singapor population to abide and comply.  A one time hard measures,  though painful can help shorten the circuit breaker period.   3. The trick to reduce crowds now at wet market is to extend operation hours,  mandate mask,  and to offer staggered hours of visiting in batches. In another word,  from 8 to 9am,  only say 100 people with IC scanned are allowed. The next 100 people on queue will have their IC scan and receive SMS to come only after 9am to 10am (2nd staggered timing). They are ask to go home if their slot is not ready.  Their turn will not be lost if they come within the designated staggered hours. No queue allowed. Each visitor can only visit market once a day.   4.This is easier than having even and odd IC last digit numbers as there could be many even numbers on the same day. One habit we all like to do is,  we do not mind queuing for hours for something.  Key message is to avoid queue."

101583618,9018600,Ronald Leng,"May 3, 2020","👍👍👍 Brilliant！  Measured, calibrated and community-driven.  There is no 1-size fit ALL.   The same measures that apply to dormitories cannot be applied everywhere.  There is no 100% testing daily or even hourly (to be sure).  It is normal sampling, tightened and relaxed sampling.  Skeptics and alarmists are helpful; they may be right at times.  Seriously  MOE, students should NOT be allowed back to school; education is lifelong - not essential and urgent services- but carry high risk of another super spreading cluster (pls CONSIDER- both for the child and educators; also family units themselves).  Plenty of collateral damage once students are allowed back to schools during this LAST MILE of the national CB.  Besides for unknown reasons, schools ban masks and ""discourage"" staffers from masking; up the COVID risk.  感恩！"
