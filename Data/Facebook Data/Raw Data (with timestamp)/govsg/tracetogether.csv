You have a tough time tracing contacts but I saw that KTV now are open masquerading as bistro with girls running around rooms serving customers. Imaging if an outbreak happen in this KTV (say one at Sophia Road, Peace Center or the one at 8 Floor Textile Centre) Can you imaging how hard would it be for a contract tracer to trace the origin. All the guys will be saying they never been there and never seen the girl. All this trace together will come to a naught. Can the relevant authority please do something about this KTV cum Bistro? "
