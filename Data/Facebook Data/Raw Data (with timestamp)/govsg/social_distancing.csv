That would means less business for them (to take tables away).  Even for bigger restaurants, they may not want to turn away earnings by having lesser tables.

When customers asked if they can sit somewhere else; the staff said no, the other sections are closed.

Perhaps Singapore could consider similar measures, that would minimise the risk of imported cases leading to subsequent local transmission, and sabotaging our local containment/mitigation efforts?  Also, can Singapore create a mobile app where people can opt-in to allow precise-tracking of their movements? This would allow efficient contact-tracing and quarantining of at-risk individuals. Hopefully everyone will opt-in (unless we want to make it mandatory). Also provide in the app a function for recording of key details like times/dates of onset of various symptoms.  In recent days, unlinked cases have been emerging consistently. Perhaps with better contact-tracing enhanced by technology, we'd be able to eliminate the virus from local circulation, and swiftly contain any outbreak caused by imported cases too.  This way, we can increase the likelihood that we will never come to a point where we would need to step-up social-distancing to catch-up with a runaway outbreak that we failed to prevent."

To avoid crowded buses or trains, may I suggest to consider staggered working hours for those who need to work in factories, etc and also for supermarkets to take turns to stay open 24 hours especially during weekends or Public Holidays to keep crowds or long queues for checking out at bay."

Some standing around masks down taking their time eating, drinking and talking without safe distancing. Some people I see in my area, walking about smoking using hand phones , or masks down walking about with a bottle of drink but not drinking so that didn‚Äôt have to wear mask... almost daily in the evenings I see a group of mothers/ helpers chatting and children (4,5yr olds) with them playing together without any masks or face shields ... the popular spots, beaches & parks are not the only places that need more monitoring.  The heartlands need attention too.  I was at Tan Tock Seng Hospital for my medical follow up on 23rd July . Theres no safe distancing in the queue waiting to get the usual SafeEntry & temp check before entry to the building, plus the safe distance staff didn‚Äôt even notice that he was talking to a person whose mask was under her chin.... after she walked away... i highlighted to him, he then went after her and instructed her to properly don the mask .... Thank you."
