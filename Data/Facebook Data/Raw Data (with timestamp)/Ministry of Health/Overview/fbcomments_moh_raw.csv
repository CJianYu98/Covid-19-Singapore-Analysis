Me, my hubby and kid went all the way from the south to the north to fetch my mum from Yishun to Woodlands Galaxy CC on Saturday 27 Feb. My mum waited 1 hr for a queue number ticket. The PA staff (I assume) advised the crowd to return home, register for a new date again and come back another day. Some were dismayed and argued with the staff, some feedbacked they don’t know technology. I told the staff that “this is last thing I wanna hear after coming all the way here”.  I was bewildered, if you have expected weekends to be so crowded and tedious waiting, why set these seniors appointments on Saturday? Not to mention young people are also allowed to register during this period which I thought is supposed to prioritize the seniors... if not for the staff to suggest we could collect a queue tix, leave for dinner and come back 2 hrs later to take the jab, I would be more annoyed. He has provided an App to show the queue status.   After returning to the CC, my mum had to wait for another hour seated in the indoor auditorium to get the jab.. we were all beat and exhausted, I am sure other seniors and their caregivers also feel the same.",Feb-28

Regarding these volunteers who came to my door... How could MOH release / divulge my dad's personal data to them?  It wasn't a random knock on each residence, but they specifically came to look up my dad because they were given his name and address, and not sure what other data.  These are volunteers... Not MOH staff.. How could they be authorised to handle personal data?   Would this be considered a breach of PDPA?  And we have had cases of scammers/pranksters going around carrying out their act of deceit in the name of MOH during this pandemic.  It is unnerving to get strangers coming to one's doorstep without being first informed by MOH regarding this form of enthusiastic outreach towards the elderlies.  I look forward to receiving a verification from MOH at the soonest possible.  Gan Kim Yong Gan Kim Yong",Feb-23

We have the people and we know what needs to get done. Bring back our lives and build back better from it. I am extremely moved that the first dedicated facility for travellers has been opened. We have proven we can manage the risk and yet we can't afford to shake the confidence that we have in our community. I note that the task force constantly remind us to stay vigilant and we will indeed continue to stay alert. We have to stay safe and we have each other to cover our backs.

1.01589E+16,Wilson EL Tan,"02月18日 新加坡疫情统计数据报告：新增确诊病例11，累计确诊病例59,879，(包括：累计境外及客工确诊病例56,888、累计社区确诊病例2,944、累计旅客确诊病例47)，累计重症住院病例20(其中累计危重症病例1)，累计死亡病例29，累计确诊轻症隔离病例104，累计治愈病例59,679，死亡率0.04%。 Roylab Stats World Map全球新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例超110,703,624，累计死亡病例超2,447,941，死亡率2.21%。 美国新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例28,462,145，累计死亡病例502,787，死亡率1.76%。占全球确诊率25.71%，占全球死亡率20.53%。马来西亚排列47、中国排列84、新加坡排列96。 正月初七食七样菜：华人新春传统习俗 相传女媧氏开天辟地，第一日作鸡、二日作狗、三日作豬、四日作羊、五日作牛、六日作馬、七日作人，因而把初七称为人日。古书记载正月初七为人日节，初七早上妇女就会采集菠菜、芹菜、茴香、蒜、蔥、韭菜、芥菜、白菜等七样菜共煮而食，这叫七样菜。南朝·梁宗懍《荊楚岁时记》云：“正月初七日为人日，以七样菜为羹。吃七菜羹、七菜粥的习俗在日本平安时代由唐朝传入日本，一直保留至今，日本人在新年期间(正月初七)吃的七种野菜为：水芹、荠菜、御形(鼠麴草)、繁缕、仏(佛)之座(稻槎菜)、菘(芜菁)、萝蔔。正月初七吃七样菜，这一古老的中原习俗在潮汕大地保留下來、历久弥新。潮汕人的七种菜配合主要为了过年图个吉利，一般包括芹菜、葱、蒜仔(蒜苗)、韭菜、菜头(萝蔔)、厚合菜(豬毑菜)、春菜、芥兰、飞龙菜(菠菜)。潮汕人吃七样菜在於它的好意头，它使人们吃出了好心情，同时又寄托了人们期盼财运兴旺、顺风顺水、吉祥如意的心愿。潮汕地区还有一首关于七样羹的民謠：七样羹，七样羹，大人吃了变后生(年轻)，奴仔(小孩)吃了变红芽(面色红润)，姿娘(女子)吃了如拋(朵)花。其实，人日吃七样菜，是有一定的科学根据的，此时春气生，天寒渐暖，菜蔬逐渐多起來。食混合菜，能使肠胃适应季节转变。而且初一到初六每个人都已吃到肚满肠肥，初七日吃多点蔬菜清清肠胃，对身体也有莫大益处!

1.01589E+16,Joseph Tan,"Is global mass vaccination really the best and only way forward? . Or is there some herd mentality among global leaders, and public health professionals, with biased favor for ""prestigious"" ""high-tech"" vaccines, instead of ""low-tech"" N95 masks? Or even some profit-driven interest in pushing widespread vaccination instead of widespread N95 mask usage? . Have countries like Singapore tried getting people involved in border control, to have strict N95 mask protocols, before deeming border leaks as inevitable? Or are people like bus drivers and quarantine-hotel staff free to wear whatever random low-effectiveness piece of cloth that they fancy? . Wouldn't widespread N95 mask usage effectively lead to ""herd immunity""? (Instead of other low-efficiency masks that keep the virus circulating in lower doses that reduce disease severity and thus evade detection.) . Vaccines: ~$20 each (cost of distribution not yet included). Pros deemed to outweigh the Cons, by the same global group of people who told us sars-cov-2 wasn't airborne, when evidence of airborne transmission of previous coronaviruses was already available but ignored. And while evidence of long-term safety of covid vaccines is absent. And are the ones who earlier rejected widespread mask usage as pointless, thus are psychologically predisposed to not consider widespread mask usage as the actual solution. . Future of reliance on vaccine: Lengthy global ""anti-social"" measures the next time a virulent airborne disease surfaces, while waiting for vaccine development. Potential for huge profits for Pharm industry if adverse long-term health consequences eventually surface with high frequency. . N95 Masks: ~$1 each, easily reused for a month. Much more politically/morally feasible to force entire populations to use them, compared to the vaccines. Pandemic could have ended months ago, with widespread N95 mask usage, achieving sufficient ""herd immunity"" for transmission to fizzle out globally. Probably can get 1 N95 mask per person for global population, in 1 month's time.  Child-sized N95 masks can be promptly implemented, unlike vaccines which are neither tested nor implemented on children. . Future of reliance on N95 Masks: Swift implementation to eradicate human-human transmission. Can be stored easily, and for years with negligible decrease in filtration efficiency. . According to scmp news:  An American firm is stuck with 30 million N95 masks, while 90% of mask factories in China were closed (2nd half of 2020).  U.S. guidelines still discourage general population from using N95s.  U.S. FDA still designates N95 masks as being in short supply.  https://www.scmp.com/video/coronavirus/3122177/us-stuck-30-million-locally-made-n95-masks-it-cant-sell  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/one-third-of-us-military-refusing-covid-19-vaccine-pentagon-14224202  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-health-care-worker-reluctance/  https://www.webmd.com/drug-medication/news/20190208/fluoroquinolones-over-prescribed-despite-dangers",Feb-19

1.01589E+16,Wilson EL Tan,"02月13日 新加坡疫情统计数据报告：新增确诊病例09，累计确诊病例59,833，(包括：累计境外及客工确诊病例56,843、累计社区确诊病例2,943、累计旅客确诊病例47)，累计重症住院病例34(其中累计危重症病例1)，累计死亡病例29，累计确诊轻症隔离病例119，累计治愈病例59,604，死亡率0.04%。 Roylab Stats World Map全球新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例超108,953,518，累计死亡病例超2,400,408，死亡率2.20%。 美国新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例28,125,957，累计死亡病例492,933，死亡率1.75%。占全球确诊率25.81%，占全球死亡率20.53%。马来西亚排列49、中国排列84、新加坡排列96。 疫苗作为抵御病毒全球大流行的终极武器，被人们寄予厚望，疫苗是解决新冠肺炎病毒最根本办法，不管哪个国家做出来疫苗，都不能供应全世界，这需要互相学习，且做出来后取长补短，可能要由很多厂家来生产，才能够供应全世界。世界卫生组织（WHO）呼吁全球合作伙伴共同发起全球合作加速开发、生产、公平获取新冠肺炎防控新工具的倡议。新冠病毒是一种新病毒，疫苗研发有很多不确定因素，多种技术路线并进才是多保险方案，为了更大限度地提升疫苗研发的成功率，在梳理分析不同的技术基础和可能性之后，科研攻关组布局了病毒的灭活疫苗、核酸疫苗、重组蛋白疫苗、腺病毒载体疫苗、减毒流感病毒载体疫苗这样5条技术路线。目前国际上绝大多数疫苗都处于临床研究阶段，中国有4种疫苗即腺病毒载体疫苗和3种灭活疫苗；美国有3种包括莫德纳药企的mRNA疫苗、辉瑞药企的mRNA疫苗、Inovio药企的DNA载体疫苗；英国有1种为牛津大学的腺病毒载体疫苗。 灭活疫苗是最传统的经典技术路线：即在体外培养新冠病毒，然后将其灭活，使之没有毒性，但这些病毒仍能刺激人体产生抗体，使免疫细胞记住病毒的模样，灭活疫苗的优点是制备方法简单快速，安全性比较高，它是应对急性疾病传播通常采用的手段，其缺点如接种剂量大、免疫期短、免疫途径单一等，而有时会造成抗体依赖增强效应（ADE），使病毒感染加重，会导致疫苗研发失败的严重不良反应。 腺病毒载体疫苗是用经过改造后无害的腺病毒作为载体，装入新冠病毒的S蛋白基因，制成腺病毒载体疫苗，刺激人体产生抗体。S蛋白是新冠病毒入侵人体细胞的关键“钥匙”，无害的腺病毒戴上S蛋白的“帽子”，假装自己很“凶”，让人体产生免疫记忆。优点是：安全、高效、引发的不良反应少。这种疫苗有成功先例，缺点，重组病毒载体疫苗研发需要考虑如何克服“预存免疫”，大多数人成长过程中曾感染过5型腺病毒，体内可能存在能中和腺病毒载体的抗体，从而可能攻击载体、降低疫苗效果。 核酸疫苗包括mRNA疫苗和DNA疫苗，是将编码S蛋白的基因，mRNA或DNA直接注入人体，利用人体细胞在人体内合成S蛋白，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于把一份记录详细的病毒档案交给人体的免疫系统。优点是：研制时不需要合成蛋白质或病毒，流程简单，安全性相对比较高，核酸疫苗是全世界都在积极探索的疫苗研发新技术，缺点是：无成功先例，多数国家无法大规模生产，可能因价格较贵而难以普及到低收入国家。 重组蛋白疫苗，也称基因工程重组亚单位疫苗，是通过基因工程方法，大量生产新冠病毒最有可能作为抗原的S蛋白，把它注射到人体，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于不生产完整病毒，而是单独生产很多新冠病毒的关键部件“钥匙”，将其交给人体的免疫系统认识。优点是：安全、高效、可规模化生产，有成功先例，重组亚单位疫苗的缺点是需要找到一个好的表达系统，这很困难。 病毒减毒活疫苗是非常重要的一类疫苗，是低毒性流感病毒戴上新冠病毒S蛋白“帽子”后形成的融合病毒，可以一石二鸟，既能防流感又能防新冠。 每逢佳节倍思亲，挥之不去的怀念，抹之不掉的回忆，音容不忘永常在。树欲静而风不止、子欲养而亲不在。高山仰望止于前、大海无边渡于岸。沉舟侧伴千帆过、病树前头万木春。子鼠疫年千家災、丑牛苗种万民安。",Feb-14

When I asked who and how I came into contact with, no further info was given to me. I was told that I’m put under phone surveillance but I’m free to go out. Was also told that I would need to get a swab test done. Was the call really from MOH or it was a fraud? As it is PH, I doubt I can call the Hotline for enquiry. Kindly assist, thanks. ",Feb-12

1.01589E+16,Wilson EL Tan,"02月11日 新加坡疫情统计数据报告：新增确诊病例12，累计确诊病例59,806，(包括：累计境外及客工确诊病例56,818、累计社区确诊病例2,941、累计旅客确诊病例47)，累计重症住院病例33(其中累计危重症病例1)，累计死亡病例29，累计确诊轻症隔离病例139，累计治愈病例59,558，死亡率0.04%。 Roylab Stats World Map全球新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例超108,087,517，累计死亡病例超2,371,613，死亡率2.19%。 美国新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例27,916,004，累计死亡病例483,738，死亡率1.73%。占全球确诊率25.82%，占全球死亡率20.39%。马来西亚排列49、中国排列84、新加坡排列96。 灭活疫苗是最传统的经典技术路线：即在体外培养新冠病毒，然后将其灭活，使之没有毒性，但这些病毒仍能刺激人体产生抗体，使免疫细胞记住病毒的模样，灭活疫苗的优点是制备方法简单快速，安全性比较高，它是应对急性疾病传播通常采用的手段，其缺点如接种剂量大、免疫期短、免疫途径单一等，而有时会造成抗体依赖增强效应（ADE），使病毒感染加重，会导致疫苗研发失败的严重不良反应。 腺病毒载体疫苗是用经过改造后无害的腺病毒作为载体，装入新冠病毒的S蛋白基因，制成腺病毒载体疫苗，刺激人体产生抗体。S蛋白是新冠病毒入侵人体细胞的关键“钥匙”，无害的腺病毒戴上S蛋白的“帽子”，假装自己很“凶”，让人体产生免疫记忆。优点是：安全、高效、引发的不良反应少。这种疫苗有成功先例，缺点，重组病毒载体疫苗研发需要考虑如何克服“预存免疫”，大多数人成长过程中曾感染过5型腺病毒，体内可能存在能中和腺病毒载体的抗体，从而可能攻击载体、降低疫苗效果。 核酸疫苗包括mRNA疫苗和DNA疫苗，是将编码S蛋白的基因，mRNA或DNA直接注入人体，利用人体细胞在人体内合成S蛋白，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于把一份记录详细的病毒档案交给人体的免疫系统。优点是：研制时不需要合成蛋白质或病毒，流程简单，安全性相对比较高，核酸疫苗是全世界都在积极探索的疫苗研发新技术，缺点是：无成功先例，多数国家无法大规模生产，可能因价格较贵而难以普及到低收入国家。 重组蛋白疫苗，也称基因工程重组亚单位疫苗，是通过基因工程方法，大量生产新冠病毒最有可能作为抗原的S蛋白，把它注射到人体，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于不生产完整病毒，而是单独生产很多新冠病毒的关键部件“钥匙”，将其交给人体的免疫系统认识。优点是：安全、高效、可规模化生产，有成功先例，重组亚单位疫苗的缺点是需要找到一个好的表达系统，这很困难。 病毒减毒活疫苗是非常重要的一类疫苗，是低毒性流感病毒戴上新冠病毒S蛋白“帽子”后形成的融合病毒，可以一石二鸟，既能防流感又能防新冠。 ",Feb-12

1.01589E+16,Jan Hello,"There seems to be a general assumption that you can only get covid if you live in a dormitory. People are wandering about with masks half on half off. Removing them to talk on the bus, train or boat. They have forgotten that the wearing of masks protects the individual from breathing the virus in as well as out. The vaccine roll out is poor. The trace token is unusable in many places and phones still have to be used. Stores have abandoned entry check in because it require an extra member of staff (just visit Plaza Singapura), as an example. There is an assumption that covid 19 does not exist in Singapore. Following that as it doesn't exist it can't mutate.  If, Singapore wants to carry on under those misconceptions then it will have to remain isolated from the rest of the world or until everyone is vaccinated. Not just in Singapore but for all who enter, or pass through.",Feb-09

I believe we have both the money and manpower do so. I sincerely hope our good government could ram up the pace as the number of community cases seems to be on the rise.

It does however sadden me that some of these comments are truly harsh. Actually they make me a little afraid to go out when my SHN is over.

The lady beside me was making a few sniffing sound and this old woman infront of her kept looking back at the lady beside me with a freaking annoying look. Anyone would have know that the lady beside me has allergy that's why she sniff. So I purposely make a loud cough and she quickly  get up off her seat and walked away. She seriously have mental illness to react like that. No one will behave like her. I didn't manage to take the front view of her reaction. If u see her reaction, u will laugh too. Old woman, if u r so scare ya, don't come out in public ya. If u r weak in yr body, people don't even need to sniff or cough, u still will genna the virus.

1.01589E+16,Bert Tan,"THE PFIZER–BIONTECH AND MODERNA mRNA VACCINES ARE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA).  IN CLINICAL TRIALS, BOTH WERE FOUND TO BE 95 PERCENT EFFECTIVE AFTER GETTING THE BOOSTER DOSE.  BUT WE NEED 100% VACCINES NOT 95% AS OUR DEATH RATES ARE VERY LOW.  mRNA VACCINES DO NOT CONTAIN A WEAKENED OR INACTIVE FORM OF THE VIRUS ITSELF.  INSTEAD, THEY USE MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) TO TEACH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RECOGNISE AND REACT TO A COMPONENT OF THE VIRUS THAT IS KEY TO ITS ABILITY TO MAKE US SICK.  VIRUSES CAN’T REPRODUCE THEMSELVES, THEY NEED A HOST—THE CORONAVIRUS USES A SPIKE PROTEIN TO GAIN ENTRY INTO THE CELLS AND START THE REPLICATION PROCESS THAT MAKES US SICK.  IN DEVELOPING mRNA VACCINES, SCIENTISTS ZEROED IN ON A UNIQUE SPIKE PROTEIN THAT IS FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE VIRUS.  ON ITS OWN, THIS SPIKE PROTEIN IS INCAPABLE OF CAUSING COVID-19.  THE mRNA VACCINES WORK BY RELAYING A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO BUILD THIS PROTEIN, WITH THE GOAL OF TEACHING YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HOW TO DISARM IT.  AFTER INJECTION, THE VACCINE PARTICLES COME INTO CONTACT WITH IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS AND DELIVER THE mRNA MESSAGE.  YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS SPIKE PROTEIN, AND HERE’S HOW—AS THE VACCINATED CELLS START CHURNING OUT THE SPIKE PROTEIN, OTHER IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS REALISE THAT THE PROTEIN SHOULD NOT BE THERE, THAT’S WHEN THE BATTLE BEGINS.  THE IMMUNE SYSTEM STARTS BUILDING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE AND MAKING ANTIBODIES.  YOUR BODY CONTINUES TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL ALL THE SPIKE PROTEINS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.  AT THE END OF THIS NATURAL IMMUNE PROCESS, YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS THE KNOWLEDGE IT NEEDS TO RECOGNISE THE SPIKE PROTEIN AND FEND OFF FUTURE EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS.  SO IF THE VIRUS ENTERS THE BODY, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL IDENTIFY AND ATTACK IT.  COVID-19 mRNA VACCINES ARE GIVEN IN THE UPPER ARM MUSCLE—ONCE THE INSTRUCTIONS (mRNA) ARE INSIDE THE IMMUNE CELLS, THE CELLS USE THEM TO MAKE THE PROTEIN PIECE.  AFTER THE PROTEIN PIECE IS MADE, THE CELL BREAKS DOWN THE INSTRUCTIONS AND GETS RID OF THEM.  NEXT, THE CELL DISPLAYS THE PROTEIN PIECE ON ITS SURFACE.  TWO DOSES, SEPARATED BY THREE TO FOUR WEEKS, IS THE TRIED-AND-TRUE APPROACH TO GENERATE AN EFFECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE THROUGH VACCINATION.  THE FIRST DOSE PRIMES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND INTRODUCES THE BODY TO THE GERM OF INTEREST—THIS ALLOWS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO PREPARE ITS DEFENSE.  THE SECOND DOSE, OR BOOSTER, PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RAMP UP THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF THE ANTIBODIES USED TO FIGHT THE VIRUS.  IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO SPREAD THE VIRUS AFTER BEING VACCINATED, SO MASKING UP AND SOCIAL DISTANCING REMANS CRITICAL.  PFIZER AND MODERNA VACCINES USE MESSENGER RNA THAT ENCODES THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN. UPON INJECTION OF THE VACCINE, THE MRNA ENTERS INTO IMMUNE CELLS CALLED DENDRITIC CELLS.   THE DENDRITIC CELLS USE THE INSTRUCTIONS WRITTEN IN THE mRNA TO SYNTHESISE THE HALLMARK SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN, WHICH CHARACTERISES THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THESE IMMUNE CELLS THEN SHOW THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN TO B-CELLS, WHICH THEN MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES.  THE mRNA VACCINES ARE UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF INDUCING A SPECIAL KIND OF IMMUNE CELL (CALLED A T-FOLLICULAR HELPER CELL) TO HELP B-CELLS PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  THE T-CELLS DO THIS THROUGH DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE B-CELLS AND BY SENDING CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT TELL THE B-CELLS TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  IT IS THIS HELP IN ANTIBODY PRODUCTION THAT MAKES THESE VACCINES EFFECTIVE.  BUT NOT ALL B-CELLS ARE THE SAME.  THERE ARE TWO KINDS THAT MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES—LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS AND MEMORY B-CELLS.  THE LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS, AS THEIR NAME IMPLIES, LIVE IN THE BONE MARROW FOR YEARS AFTER VACCINATION, CONTINUOUSLY CHURNING OUT ANTIBODY (IN THIS CASE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODY), THESE LONG-LIVED B-CELLS DO NOT NEED TO BE BOOSTED.  THE MEMORY B-CELLS, ON THE OTHER HAND, LIVE IN A STATE AKIN TO HIBERNATION.  THEY DO NOT PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL STIMULATED BY A BOOSTER OF THE VACCINE, OR ARE EXPOSED TO INFECTION WITH THE CORONAVIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THAT IS THE REASON WE NEED THAT SECOND DOSE—TOGETHER THESE TWO TYPES OF B-CELLS PROVIDE A CONSTANT LEVEL OF PROTECTION.  THAT BOOSTER SHOT IS NECESSARY FOR THE T-CELLS TO STIMULATE THE MEMORY B-CELLS TO PRODUCE MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES.  IF THE BOOSTER ISN’T GIVEN WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE WINDOW, LOWER QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES WILL BE PRODUCED THAT MAY NOT PROVIDE AS POWERFUL PROTECTION FROM THE VIRUS.  mRNA STANDS FOR MESSENGER RNA, WHICH IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR MAKING PROTEINS.  DNA, WHICH LIVES IN THE NUCLEUS OF CELLS, MAKES mRNA AND SHIPS IT OUTSIDE THE NUCLEUS TO THE SURROUNDING CELL CYTOPLASM.  ONCE IN THE CYTOPLASM, mRNA IS TRANSLATED INTO A HOST OF CELL PROTEINS AND ENZYMES.  BECAUSE OUR CELLS MAKE PROTEINS ALL THE TIME, THEY ALSO MAKE mRNA ALL THE TIME.  SOON AFER MAKING PROTEINS, mRNA BREAKS DOWN.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtprX4KcBws  IT IS A LIE OF EVIL KOSHER PHARMA THAT mRNA VACCINES CANNOT ENTER THE NUCLEUS OF THE CELL, SO IT CANNOT CHANGE YOUR DNA.  IF ANY DOCTOR TELLS THE TRUTH, HE WILL BE DE-FROCKED AND BLACK BALLED FOR LIFE.  LISTEN !!  mRNA VACCINES IN THE REALM OF IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY—IT HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED BEFORE.  THE BULLCRAP EVIL KOSHER VACCINE LOBBY GIVES IS THAT EVEN IF mRNA DID ENTER THE NUCLEUS, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONVERTED TO DNA.  THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ENZYME CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE, WHICH THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN.  THAT THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN AN ENZYME CALLED INTEGRASE, WHICH WOULD ALSO BE NEEDED FOR mRNA TO INSERT ITSELF INTO THE DNA—mRNA VACCINES LACK ALL OF THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ALTER DNA.  THAT THEY REMAIN IN THE CELL CYTOPLASM FOR JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THEY ARE DESTROYED.  BRAAAYYYYYYYYYY !  REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE IS AN RNA-DEPENDENT DNA POLYMERASE THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN MANY RETROVIRUSES SUCH AS HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV).  HIV, HAS AN ENZYME, CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE THAT COPIES THE VIRUS’S GENETIC MATERIAL BACK INTO THE GENOME.  VIRUSES LIKE THE SARS-CoV-2 OR INFLUENZA DON’T HAVE THIS ENZYME THE SCIENTISTS VOUCH.  FOR 40 YEARS TOP SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN WAXING ELOQUENT ABOUT AIDS / HIV—THE VACCINE IS STILL “ABSCONDING”.  THEY DON’T EVEN KNOW THAT HIV IS MADE IN THE LAB !",Feb-04

1.01589E+16,Bert Tan,"THE PFIZER–BIONTECH AND MODERNA mRNA VACCINES ARE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA).  IN CLINICAL TRIALS, BOTH WERE FOUND TO BE 95 PERCENT EFFECTIVE AFTER GETTING THE BOOSTER DOSE.  BUT WE NEED 100% VACCINES NOT 95% AS OUR DEATH RATES ARE VERY LOW.  mRNA VACCINES DO NOT CONTAIN A WEAKENED OR INACTIVE FORM OF THE VIRUS ITSELF.  INSTEAD, THEY USE MESSENGER RNA (MRNA) TO TEACH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE AND REACT TO A COMPONENT OF THE VIRUS THAT IS KEY TO ITS ABILITY TO MAKE US SICK.  VIRUSES CAN’T REPRODUCE THEMSELVES, THEY NEED A HOST—THE CORONAVIRUS USES A SPIKE PROTEIN TO GAIN ENTRY INTO THE CELLS AND START THE REPLICATION PROCESS THAT MAKES US SICK.  IN DEVELOPING mRNA VACCINES, SCIENTISTS ZEROED IN ON A UNIQUE SPIKE PROTEIN THAT IS FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE VIRUS.  ON ITS OWN, THIS SPIKE PROTEIN IS INCAPABLE OF CAUSING COVID-19.  THE mRNA VACCINES WORK BY RELAYING A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO BUILD THIS PROTEIN, WITH THE GOAL OF TEACHING YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HOW TO DISARM IT.  AFTER INJECTION, THE VACCINE PARTICLES COME INTO CONTACT WITH IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS AND DELIVER THE mRNA MESSAGE:  YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS SPIKE PROTEIN, AND HERE’S HOW—AS THE VACCINATED CELLS START CHURNING OUT THE SPIKE PROTEIN, OTHER IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS REALISE THAT THE PROTEIN SHOULD NOT BE THERE, THAT’S WHEN THE BATTLE BEGINS.  THE IMMUNE SYSTEM STARTS BUILDING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE AND MAKING ANTIBODIES.  YOUR BODY CONTINUES TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL ALL THE SPIKE PROTEINS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.  AT THE END OF THIS NATURAL IMMUNE PROCESS, YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS THE KNOWLEDGE IT NEEDS TO RECOGNISE THE SPIKE PROTEIN AND FEND OFF FUTURE EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS.  SO IF THE VIRUS ENTERS THE BODY, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL IDENTIFY AND ATTACK IT.  COVID-19 mRNA VACCINES ARE GIVEN IN THE UPPER ARM MUSCLE—ONCE THE INSTRUCTIONS (mRNA) ARE INSIDE THE IMMUNE CELLS, THE CELLS USE THEM TO MAKE THE PROTEIN PIECE.  AFTER THE PROTEIN PIECE IS MADE, THE CELL BREAKS DOWN THE INSTRUCTIONS AND GETS RID OF THEM.  NEXT, THE CELL DISPLAYS THE PROTEIN PIECE ON ITS SURFACE.  TWO DOSES, SEPARATED BY THREE TO FOUR WEEKS, IS THE TRIED-AND-TRUE APPROACH TO GENERATE AN EFFECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE THROUGH VACCINATION.  THE FIRST DOSE PRIMES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND INTRODUCES THE BODY TO THE GERM OF INTEREST—THIS ALLOWS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO PREPARE ITS DEFENSE.  THE SECOND DOSE, OR BOOSTER, PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RAMP UP THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF THE ANTIBODIES USED TO FIGHT THE VIRUS.  IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO SPREAD THE VIRUS AFTER BEING VACCINATED, SO MASKING UP AND SOCIAL DISTANCING REMANS CRITICAL.  PFIZER AND MODERNA VACCINES USE MESSENGER RNA THAT ENCODES THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN. UPON INJECTION OF THE VACCINE, THE MRNA ENTERS INTO IMMUNE CELLS CALLED DENDRITIC CELLS.   THE DENDRITIC CELLS USE THE INSTRUCTIONS WRITTEN IN THE mRNA TO SYNTHESISE THE HALLMARK SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN, WHICH CHARACTERISES THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THESE IMMUNE CELLS THEN SHOW THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN TO B-CELLS, WHICH THEN MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES.  THE mRNA VACCINES ARE UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF INDUCING A SPECIAL KIND OF IMMUNE CELL (CALLED A T-FOLLICULAR HELPER CELL) TO HELP B-CELLS PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  THE T-CELLS DO THIS THROUGH DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE B-CELLS AND BY SENDING CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT TELL THE B-CELLS TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  IT IS THIS HELP IN ANTIBODY PRODUCTION THAT MAKES THESE VACCINES EFFECTIVE.  BUT NOT ALL B-CELLS ARE THE SAME.  THERE ARE TWO KINDS THAT MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES—LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS AND MEMORY B-CELLS.  THE LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS, AS THEIR NAME IMPLIES, LIVE IN THE BONE MARROW FOR YEARS AFTER VACCINATION, CONTINUOUSLY CHURNING OUT ANTIBODY (IN THIS CASE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODY), THESE LONG-LIVED B-CELLS DO NOT NEED TO BE BOOSTED.  THE MEMORY B-CELLS, ON THE OTHER HAND, LIVE IN A STATE AKIN TO HIBERNATION.  THEY DO NOT PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL STIMULATED BY A BOOSTER OF THE VACCINE, OR ARE EXPOSED TO INFECTION WITH THE CORONAVIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THAT IS THE REASON WE NEED THAT SECOND DOSE—TOGETHER THESE TWO TYPES OF B-CELLS PROVIDE A CONSTANT LEVEL OF PROTECTION.  THAT BOOSTER SHOT IS NECESSARY FOR THE T-CELLS TO STIMULATE THE MEMORY B-CELLS TO PRODUCE MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES.  IF THE BOOSTER ISN’T GIVEN WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE WINDOW, LOWER QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES WILL BE PRODUCED THAT MAY NOT PROVIDE AS POWERFUL PROTECTION FROM THE VIRUS.  mRNA STANDS FOR MESSENGER RNA, WHICH IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR MAKING PROTEINS.  DNA, WHICH LIVES IN THE NUCLEUS OF CELLS, MAKES mRNA AND SHIPS IT OUTSIDE THE NUCLEUS TO THE SURROUNDING CELL CYTOPLASM.  ONCE IN THE CYTOPLASM, mRNA IS TRANSLATED INTO A HOST OF CELL PROTEINS AND ENZYMES.  BECAUSE OUR CELLS MAKE PROTEINS ALL THE TIME, THEY ALSO MAKE mRNA ALL THE TIME.  SOON AFER MAKING PROTEINS, mRNA BREAKS DOWN.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtprX4KcBws  IT IS A LIE OF KOSHER EVIL PHARMA THAT mRNA VACCINES CANNOT ENTER THE NUCLEUS OF THE CELL, SO IT CANNOT CHANGE YOUR DNA.  IF ANY DOCTOR TELLS THE TRUTH, HE WILL BE DE-FROCKED AND BLACK BALLED FOR LIFE.  LISTEN !!  mRNA VACCINES IN THE REALM OF IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY—IT HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED BEFORE.  THE BULLCRAP EVIL KOSHER VACCINE LOBBY GIVES IS THAT EVEN IF mRNA DID ENTER THE NUCLEUS, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONVERTED TO DNA.  THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ENZYME CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE, WHICH THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN.  THAT THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN AN ENZYME CALLED INTEGRASE, WHICH WOULD ALSO BE NEEDED FOR mRNA TO INSERT ITSELF INTO THE DNA—mRNA VACCINES LACK ALL OF THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ALTER DNA.  THAT THEY REMAIN IN THE CELL CYTOPLASM FOR JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THEY ARE DESTROYED.  BRAAAYYYYYYYYYY !  REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE IS AN RNA-DEPENDENT DNA POLYMERASE THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN MANY RETROVIRUSES SUCH AS HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV).  HIV, HAS AN ENZYME, CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE THAT COPIES THE VIRUS’S GENETIC MATERIAL BACK INTO THE GENOME.  VIRUSES LIKE THE SARS-CoV-2 OR INFLUENZA DON’T HAVE THIS ENZYME THE SCIENTISTS VOUCH.  FOR 40 YEARS TOP SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN WAXING ELOQUENT ABOUT AIDS / HIV—THE VACCINE IS STILL “ABSCONDING”.  THEY DON’T EVEN KNOW THAT HIV IS MADE IN THE LAB !",Feb-01

THESE IMMUNE CELLS THEN SHOW THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN TO B-CELLS, WHICH THEN MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES.  THE mRNA VACCINES ARE UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF INDUCING A SPECIAL KIND OF IMMUNE CELL (CALLED A T-FOLLICULAR HELPER CELL) TO HELP B-CELLS PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  THE T-CELLS DO THIS THROUGH DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE B-CELLS AND BY SENDING CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT TELL THE B-CELLS TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  IT IS THIS HELP IN ANTIBODY PRODUCTION THAT MAKES THESE VACCINES EFFECTIVE.  BUT NOT ALL B-CELLS ARE THE SAME.  THERE ARE TWO KINDS THAT MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES—LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS AND MEMORY B-CELLS.  THE LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS, AS THEIR NAME IMPLIES, LIVE IN THE BONE MARROW FOR YEARS AFTER VACCINATION, CONTINUOUSLY CHURNING OUT ANTIBODY (IN THIS CASE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODY), THESE LONG-LIVED B-CELLS DO NOT NEED TO BE BOOSTED.  THE MEMORY B-CELLS, ON THE OTHER HAND, LIVE IN A STATE AKIN TO HIBERNATION.  THEY DO NOT PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL STIMULATED BY A BOOSTER OF THE VACCINE, OR ARE EXPOSED TO INFECTION WITH THE CORONAVIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THAT IS THE REASON WE NEED THAT SECOND DOSE—TOGETHER THESE TWO TYPES OF B-CELLS PROVIDE A CONSTANT LEVEL OF PROTECTION.  THAT BOOSTER SHOT IS NECESSARY FOR THE T-CELLS TO STIMULATE THE MEMORY B-CELLS TO PRODUCE MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES.  IF THE BOOSTER ISN’T GIVEN WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE WINDOW, LOWER QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES WILL BE PRODUCED THAT MAY NOT PROVIDE AS POWERFUL PROTECTION FROM THE VIRUS.  mRNA STANDS FOR MESSENGER RNA, WHICH IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR MAKING PROTEINS.  DNA, WHICH LIVES IN THE NUCLEUS OF CELLS, MAKES mRNA AND SHIPS IT OUTSIDE THE NUCLEUS TO THE SURROUNDING CELL CYTOPLASM.  ONCE IN THE CYTOPLASM, mRNA IS TRANSLATED INTO A HOST OF CELL PROTEINS AND ENZYMES.  BECAUSE OUR CELLS MAKE PROTEINS ALL THE TIME, THEY ALSO MAKE mRNA ALL THE TIME.  SOON AFER MAKING PROTEINS, mRNA BREAKS DOWN.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtprX4KcBws  IT IS A LIE OF KOSHER EVIL PHARMA THAT mRNA VACCINES CANNOT ENTER THE NUCLEUS OF THE CELL, SO IT CANNOT CHANGE YOUR DNA.  IF ANY DOCTOR TELLS THE TRUTH, HE WILL BE DE-FROCKED AND BLACK BALLED FOR LIFE.  LISTEN !!  mRNA VACCINES IN THE REALM OF IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY—IT HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED BEFORE.  THE BULLCRAP EVIL KOSHER VACCINE LOBBY GIVES IS THAT EVEN IF mRNA DID ENTER THE NUCLEUS, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONVERTED TO DNA.  THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ENZYME CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE, WHICH THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN.  THAT THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN AN ENZYME CALLED INTEGRASE, WHICH WOULD ALSO BE NEEDED FOR mRNA TO INSERT ITSELF INTO THE DNA—mRNA VACCINES LACK ALL OF THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ALTER DNA.  THAT THEY REMAIN IN THE CELL CYTOPLASM FOR JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THEY ARE DESTROYED.  BRAAAYYYYYYYYYY !  REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE IS AN RNA-DEPENDENT DNA POLYMERASE THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN MANY RETROVIRUSES SUCH AS HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV).  HIV, HAS AN ENZYME, CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE THAT COPIES THE VIRUS’S GENETIC MATERIAL BACK INTO THE GENOME.  VIRUSES LIKE THE SARS-CoV-2 OR INFLUENZA DON’T HAVE THIS ENZYME THE SCIENTISTS VOUCH.  FOR 40 YEARS TOP SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN WAXING ELOQUENT ABOUT AIDS / HIV—THE VACCINE IS STILL “ABSCONDING”.  THEY DON’T EVEN KNOW THAT HIV IS MADE IN THE LAB !",Feb-01

Yesterday I read that Malaysia likely infection is going up fast at 5728 cases yesterday. The Malaysian detected cases under quarantine in SG is still not as many as Indonesia. That suggest Indonesia likely has an even more dire situation.  and yesterday, one local case has taken the first dose of the vaccine and still caught the virus ! As expected, the immune system need a few weeks to kick in. We must get it into our heads that the vaccines need a few weeks to work.  and 1 case visited a Yishun Khatib very crowded coffee shop in the heartland. This could be a potential problem.

U r risking everybody from aircrews, staff from airport, drivers who transported these ppl to the hotel, then when spread to communities , u all say we Nvr do our part. Wat is the reason u cannot stop ppl from India into Singapore? They are champion imported case Everyday yet u don stop it! Why ! Close the border temporary. Give all Singaporean abroad a deadline to be back Singapore if not border will close till further notice. Why can’t u do this? Stop risking our nurses, doctors n their families , it’s time to give them a break. N why short term visiting allowed? Fiancée allowed smore? These are not essential, No visiting pls! Not even family member should come visiting physically. Technology is so advanced why can’t they use video to communicate n see each other at this point of time ? All these countries , India , Indonesia many of them can’t even be bothered to wear mask n no social distancing , not talk abt hygiene . So u still arm wide open to welcome them into Singapore? Stop wasting our resources n risking our ppl in Singapore. How much u can earn from these ppl at this point of time? Now kena the B117 ... 25 infected... n how many more this 25 has spread to... if u continue to open the border, we may be back to square one. so angry with this Govt!",Jan-30

Once foreigner came to Singapore should immediately put to 14 days quarantine and swab test needed to do 3 times during this quarantine period. Once test positive of Covid infection. This foreigner should not entitle to enter Singapore and deport back to where they came from.  This method will surely ensure safety of our community out spread of Covid.,Jan-30

Mr Wong, co-chair of the Government’s Covid-19 task force, said that people who decline or do not book a slot for the vaccination when offered because they are still undecided must “accept the consequences” that if they change their minds later, a ready supply of vaccines may not be available.  Overcoming public distrust of the Covid-19 vaccines is a major obstacle to governments’ efforts worldwide in persuading enough people to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.  The acceptance of the vaccines depends on public trust and confidence in the safety and efficacy of vaccines and immunisation, the health system, healthcare professionals and the wider vaccine research community.  These are all important factors that influence a person’s decision-making process.  Furthermore, for vaccine uptake to increase, the public must be inspired through authentic communication and dialogue — something the public health agencies here, including the national task force, has arguably failed to achieve.  The public health agencies should have launched robust public outreach efforts that encourage various communities, including religious groups, to address the questions and concerns that these communities may have.  Even if the public does not fully trust the science of the vaccines, social norms in the communities can go a long way in persuading people to get vaccinated.  If individuals believe that all the people they love and the people who care for them think that they should get the vaccine, they are more likely to be influenced to get it.  The public’s trust and confidence are important in light of adverse overseas news reports about the side effects of the vaccines, with people having died after getting the shots.  Another hurdle our public health officials have to overcome is the people’s primary concern: Whether the vaccines are appropriately tested for safety, efficacy and effectiveness before the authorities such as the Health Sciences Authority approve them for use.  We have been in this pandemic for around a year and the vaccines have been developed fairly quickly (it normally takes a few years), so it is natural for people to be suspicious of what is unknown.  The public health agencies must work to ""immunise"" people against misinformation.  This could be accomplished only if there is trust resulting from authentic relationships between the Government and the people.  Vaccine hesitancy is a problem of dignity as much as of the abundance of falsehoods.  Singaporeans want to have their choices respected, not to be told that they cannot choose which vaccines to take because they rejected one the first time.  It would be helpful for the national task force to re-examine its communication and engagement strategy for the vaccination programme, with the view to build up the public’s trust.

1.01589E+16,Yen W,"This is very good news presented in a transparent and responsible manner. The vaccine safety financial assistance initiative will help increase vaccine compliance among the working population, so that they don’t need to worry about how to pay their bills if they’re unable to work because of a vaccine reaction.

1.01589E+16,Ang Ming Sen,"""A total of 33 people in Norway aged 75 and older died after getting vaccinated but all were reported to be already seriously ill prior to getting their shots."" - Taken from internet dated Jan 20. This has been on my mind. The young people will be almost not have such problems. They should absolutely go for it. I'll also go for it. But there are a small number of elderlies who may have some underlying health problems. Making the way to the jabbing stations may be a strain on them. I'm glad that the gov did not make it compulsory, but the way they are saying free vaccination is like implying they may not get it free again. This is a form of stress. I'm very stressful too. The government should extend the vaccines as free for elderly people even if they reject it the first time. That will alleviate the stress we have. ",Jan-29
1.01589E+16,Danny Chin,Round 1 of new vaccines takers are mainly live human test subject. The Pharmaceutical companies will analyses the result and data collected.

1.01589E+16,Keeyan Ho,"It is good to have gotten the vaccine quickly as there would be a long queue later on. However all these vaccines are cleared for emergency use which is NOW, but it also means many unknowns or 'use at own risk'. Hence SGGGOVT's advisory that getting vaccinated is not 'mandatory'. That is very nice but it is unkind (and still being pushy) to warn that those who decide against it when offered may not (I read that as shall not) get the vaccine free of charge when they decide later to have it. For the over-70 Elderlies of which I am one, that is very nasty irresponsible and a demonstration of unfilial love (I wonder if they treat their own family elders in the same way) besides our worry that our golden years to enjoy our family and this country may be at risk.  The reason that the Elderlies should be given the vaccine early because they are a higher risk of COVID-19 infection group and this will give them protection. That is a very kind and noble decision if not for the fact that if the situation gets bad, the Elderlies would get infected quickly and overcome health services to the detriment of everyone else younger. But it is still a sensible decision.  But coming back to this another kind offer to reimburse costs for serious side effects due to getting a vaccination, I believe that is provided by vaccine  manufacturers to people who agree to be used as guinea pigs in the vaccine testing. So getting a vaccination is like becoming a volunteer in the vaccine testing programs of the vaccine manufacturers. I suppose it's a bohpian when buying vaccines approved for emegency use. Whether the Expert Panel will be kindly in their verification of cases and decisions is another thing bearing in mind SG's very prudent hands on the national wallet.  It's not easy to make good decisions especially decisions to save the lives and livelihood of 6 million people. So far so good, well done  SGGOVT. But could we know how the vaccinated Elderlies are doing, by way of daily numerical stats?",Jan-29

1.01589E+16,Paul Lim,"Wow this is big news! Merck publicly acknowledged that natural infection builds a better immune response than a vaccinated one.   They stop short at explaining why past coronavirus vaccines were not pushed out for the past 20 years was because they did not pass even the animal trials which shows horrific deaths in vaccinated animals when exposed to wild virus, a phenomenon called antibody dependent enhancement.   I’m glad at least one pharma is honest and puts the interest of the people’s health above money.  I wonder if the govts worldwide pushing for vaccinations are reading this.  https://www.merck.com/news/merck-discontinues-development-of-sars-cov-2-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-continues-development-of-two-investigational-therapeutic-candidates/",Jan-29
1.01589E+16,David Lim,"Vaccinating healthy people on the pretext of immunity is MURDER, once they die, and if they become disable, generating Karma for those with their hidden agenda.  Vaccination is Profit driven, not Immunity for the masses as claimed.  Viruses are part nature so that the masses can eventually generate their own immunity.  Bio Engineered Viruses are not natural but developed with a specific purpose, for example, to kill or prevent the natural spirit from linking to its original Source.",Jan-29

Do you get ""extra marks "" for registration to be ""neat and tidy "". Spreadsheets can do it for you. So what's the problem? You don't need only staff nurses to do injections. Diabetes patients on insulin can do it. Student nurses and medical students can do it. Have a 2-shift program.  If you're waiting for  2nd doses to arrive,  tell us, the public. Don't waste resource visiting homes.  Do it only if and after more than 50% reject vaccination. Let them queue again after everyone else (who want it) have had their turn.  Get logistical advice from Israel or even Indonesia.  Don't be shy.  We did get advice and help (of a different kind) for a few cohorts in NS. These countries CAN plan. 30% vaccinated.  Injections into ARMS within 24 or was it 48 hours of vaccine arrival.  Possibly from tarmac of airport?  India even had a dry run. But we ALREADY had dry runs of some sort . Remember the masks distribution? Get the same group to help you set up the logistics, control the crowd entry of ic numbers.  No need to explain the same instructions,  advice again and again.  Get the TV to do it everyday in the 4 languages.  And at the venues itself.  Use technology,  not use the mouths.  That spreads covid!",Jan-29

The numbers of community samples tested is very important, as 0 positives out of 20,000 locals tested a day would give us a lot more confidence than 0 positives out of only 100 locals tested.

ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE, NATIONAL CENTRE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf  Sars-CoV-2 virus has not been isolated, purified and cultured. What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been isolated or cultured, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people with false positive results?",Jan-27
1.01588E+16,Sakura Tan,"We have seen a number of cases who test negative during SHN and released into the community only to find out they are positive when they decide to leave Singapore weeks later. Maybe MOH should continue to test all incoming  imports ( local or foreign) every week after release from quarantine to reduce risk of spread in the community ( at least for another 2-3 weeks) . Waiting weeks to find out before they leave Singapore is too late. And if they don’t leave , they continue to spread the virus.  After all if they can afford to come to Singapore and be quarantined they can afford to be tested weekly. Better inconvenience a few persons than risk our country. ",Jan-26

Did they eat lunch together in close proximity in their pantry area?

Her swab done on 16 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19. She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 23 January in preparation for her return to the UK. Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Her Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and her serology test result has also come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported based on her travel history.

1.01588E+16,Tan Kok Kee,OMG! Another 48 imported cases.  When would it end. One of the main reason contributing to such returning cases could be the fact that our medical service here is one of the best and infected patients are guarantee a place in the hospitals unlike some heavily infected countries where getting into one is almost impossible because of the numbers. Its a suggestion but can the authorities actually confined all such imported cases to one location for their SHN. I actually do not have confidence in some of this imported cases for not breaching their SHN. Another way is to speed up the vaccination protocol and start massive vaccinations to all our citizens. Help us to help the authorities in our war against the virus. The above opinions are mine alone and not intended to cause any harm or misunderstanding to anyone whatsoever.,Jan-24

Furthermore, some of these ambassadors have gathered at some random corner to chit-chat.

In like manner, there were multiple situations when these staff were too busy playing games (yes, games) and ignoring the presence of individuals and whether they have even checked in. While I understand that the onus is on the individuals to perform self check-in at the malls, shouldn't these officers who were deployed provide an additional layer of security and check?

Nope. No staffs were deployed to exercise the appropriate measures other than few promoters observed everywhere eagerly selling their goodies for CNY. Even cashiers whom I’m sure could provide basic precautionary advices were nonchalantly unconcerned. I believed if I were to tell the patrons to do so myself (Yup. Two aunties behind me in queue were not even 1m apart much less following the newly-pasted distancing sticker on the floor) they would be quick to point out that vaccines are available so I’m just over-reacting.

What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been isolated or cultured, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?",Jan-22

1.01588E+16,Steven Ng,I still think the community cases are caused by leakage from the large amount of imported cases. So i hope the authority will immediately place all imported cases to 21 or 28 days quarantine and most important confined them to dedicated facilities. By increasing the quarantine and makenthem stay at dedicated facilities we will filter out for only those genuinely need to come to Singapore and not for those trying to escape from the ravaging spread of Covid in their countries.,Jan-22
1.01588E+16,Steven Ng,"I have a few points to raise to the authority. Point 1. For the last 2 months i noticed the imported cases has been rising at alarming rate. I am particularly concerned of those given SHN at their own premises. Although they can claim they stay on their own but there is no stopping them receiving visitors. These visitors can be friends, relatives and even food delivery persons. All these visitors if they got infected will pass to the community for sure.  Therefore authority should implement SHN at dedicated facilities like it or not. We cannot be too lax on this. Dedicated or government monitored facilities is less easy for people to sneak out and more control in place. SHN on their own can also affect the neighbour house especially if they stay at condo or hdb flat or private apartments.",Jan-22

They may be carrier with no symptoms but could infect the lesser immune and also people may be lax in not wearing their masks bec of the increase in group siZes... chatting over table with drinks without masks ... wake up the drinks on tables do not shield one from virus especially sitting in group and chatting even laughing away!!!!,Jan-21

What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been isolated or cultured, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?",Jan-22

And/or  Include the total number of daily arrivals with total number of imported case detected by your “proactive” efforts will and can also provide some kind of assurance that you have been and still doing a very good job preventing the spread and keeping us safe.  Eg. “From the total of 3456 arrivals today 19/1/21, there were 35 imported cases detected my our proactive testing”..even the number 35 cases looks huge, in terms of percentage that’s only 0.05% of total arrival for the day.

1.01588E+16,Yen W,"The source of infection for the first case in this cluster hasn’t been found yet, in spite of testing close contacts. Please start testing more of the local population ASAP, until you find the source of this infection. The more people that are tested in the local population, the more confident we are to find any hidden reservoirs of infection. The epidemiology of local unlinked cases (eg. 11 workers at Mandarin Orchard) in the last few weeks suggests that the virus has been circulating undetected for a while, with people getting no symptoms or mild symptoms. The MRT is jam packed, and many people have long commutes on MRT. I see many people on crowded MRT with masks hanging below their noses.  There is no point trying to fool the local population, and not allow your doctors at NCID to share epidemiological information that is important for protecting our health.

Many have already menioned here with regards to those who don't wear a mask, less alone, wear them properly! Many are leaving their homes to walk to the carpark with no mask, neither wearing them in the lifts they use. Some get off taxi's and GRAB vehicles, only to properly wear their mask once out of the vehicle. These to name a few, are the complacent behaviour of many who post the risk of transmitting or even getting the virus. At work they may adhere to the rules, but outside, many don't! And if ambassadors don't enforce or take notice, they continue to break the rules so many of us are trying to follow! Just check into HDB central areas at nights, and without any policing, so many are not wearing a mask but carrying one, just in case! These are NEW infections which mean the virus is still amongst us. If these actions are not checked or corrected, soon more will get infected",Jan-19

1.01588E+16,Subhamoy Sen,Today's cases are wonderful example of how many true cases of covid-19 are hiding in the community..  People who may be infected are not proactively seeking medical assistance and posing even greater threat as a super spreader...  We need to make ourselves remember.. that this is for greater good.. please do not hide your health issues.. being sick is not a crime.. u need care and affection.. so medical care is going to give you that... Also it will prevent the spread to your dear ones...  We all need to be sincere in our efforts.. how long will we keep stressing out frontline warriors? And what about all those who do loads of sacrifices to adjust to new normal?  We need to remember to be safe.. follow the right practices... Only then we can win...  I pray for the well-being of the affected.. may they quickly recover and return to their dear ones...  Stay safe Stay blessed.. 🙏😊,Jan-17

Looking at the rising trend of people testing positive after the 14 days quarantine, would the taskforce consider subjecting ALL travellers (including Singaporeans and Permanent Residents) arriving in our nation (not only those arriving from the United Kingdom and South Africa) to an additional seven days of self-isolation (or even additional 14 days) at their place of residence, following their 14-day stay-home notice period?  A closer look at the symptoms of travellers during and after their isolation period is also critical and for those travellers who have mild symptoms even after a month, would the taskforce consider re-testing and extending their isolation period?  As for the domitory workers, would the taskforce also consider having tighter controls and having a peer buddy system or closer supervision by their supervisors to monitor if they have any symptoms or feeling unwell.  This has been on my mind for a long time and I would like to voice out my concerns due to the increasing imported cases, locally transmitted cases and asymptomatic cases in our nation.  Thank you very much for your kind attention.  Best regards, Shu Min",Jan-17

This is a clear sign of Pandemic Fatigue; wherein people begin to disregard protocols and safe practices while new and more infectious strain variants are already here in Singapore. One or two caught flouting SHN orders means there are possibly MORE who weren't caught and have already started multiple clusters which will eventually flare up.  Just look at how students in heartland schools behave after school.

1.01588E+16,Max Boh,"Please send patrols more often to residential areas, 1 ambassador + 1 police would be a good combination.   Take Tampines for example, every single time I venture out in, I either see people who do not even bother wearing a mask while they're casually cycling, or wearing their masks below their chins then roaming around all over the place.  Half the food deliveries don't wear them either, and their state of health is too good to say that they will be breathless with a mask on. Seeing them handle food packages makes me shun away from food deliveries these days. I even encounter a few times, this lady who will just stroll from 833 to the nearby coffee shop 827 mask-less, order her food openly at the mixed veg stall, then yell randomly while eating at the coffee shop depending on her mood. Some smokers (no offense to those who don't do this) would just casually walk pass occupied bus stops, shops, while blowing their smoke without a care to the world.  Its these people that may end up being asymptomatic and infecting others when they go all out to be in their own world and others have to pay the price for these people's mistakes. I know MOH and the Govt are doing your best and thank you for it, but the human factor could prove far more fatal down the road as the awareness drive seems to slow down.. especially when the vaccine was announced, spotted at least twice the amount of people who start to neglect their masks the following day.

WE DON'T NEED PHASE 3 TRIALS FOR mRNA VACCINES—WE ARE NOT GUINEA PIGS.  THE mRNA VACCINE TECHNOLOGY IS NEW AND NEEDS CAREFUL AND EXTENSIVE SAFETY TESTING.  THESE WILL BE THE FIRST-EVER MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) VACCINES BROUGHT TO MARKET FOR HUMAN PATIENTS.  NO MRNA VACCINES HAVE EVER BEEN APPROVED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.  COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE DEVELOPMENT IS FRAUGHT WITH UNKNOWN SAFETY RISKS.  mRNA IS EASILY DESTROYED, AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY ENZYMES THAT WILL JUST BREAK IT APART.  PFIZER mRNA VACCINE WHICH HAS TO BE REFRIGERATED TO 70 DEG C—IT DOES NOT SUIT OUR NEEDS (PFIZER VACCINE NEEDS TO BE KEPT EXTREMELY COLD: MINUS 70 DEGREES CELSIUS, WHICH IS COLDER THAN WINTER IN ANTARCTICA).  MODERNA SAYS ITS VACCINE CANDIDATE IS STABLE AT REGULAR FREEZER TEMPERATURE (MINUS 20 DEGREES CELSIUS) FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS, AND AFTER THAWING IT CAN LAST IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR 30 DAYS, IT CAN ALSO BE KEPT AT ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR UP TO 12 HOURS—TAKE THAT WITH A PINCH OF SALT.  MODERNA SAYS THAT THEY HAVE MASTERED A STRATEGIC FORMULA OF LIPID NANOPARTICLES—THE STRUCTURAL BACKBONE OF THE VACCINE THAT DOUBLES AS A MODE OF TRANSPORTING THE DRUG INTO HUMAN CELLS...  OH YEAH ?  NO VACCINES HAVE BEEN MADE TO CURE HIV AFTER 40 YEARS OF RELENTLESS RESEARCH.  mRNA VACCINES INTERVENE DIRECTLY IN THE GENETIC MATERIAL OF THE PATIENT AND THEREFORE ALTER THE INDIVIDUAL GENETIC MATERIAL, WHICH REPRESENTS THE GENETIC MANIPULATION.  WARNING: A GENETIC DEFECT CAUSED BY UNTESTED mRNA VACCINE IS FOREVER—THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE mRNA VACCINATION WILL BE GENETICALLY IRREVERSIBLE !  THE VACCINE, DEVELOPED AND ENDORSED BY ANTHONY FAUCI AND FUNDED BY BILL GATES, USES EXPERIMENTAL mRNA TECHNOLOGY.  WE KNOW WHY BILL GATES TREATS PUNE SERUM INSTITUTE AS HIS TAJ MAHAL—STUD HORSE BREEDER POONAWALAS, YOU ARE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE TODAY.  ETHIOPIAN W.H.O. CHIEF IS A CRIMINAL, AND IS IN THE PAYROLL OF BILL GATES.  MESSENGER RNA OR mRNA IS THE RIBONUCLEIC ACID THAT TRANSFERS THE GENETIC CODE OF THE DNA OF THE CELL NUCLEUS TO A RIBOSOME IN THE CYTOPLASM, THAT IS, THE ONE THAT DETERMINES THE ORDER IN WHICH THE AMINO ACIDS OF A PROTEIN BIND AND ACT AS A MOLD OR PATTERN FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF THAT PROTEIN.  SCIENTISTS AT BIONTECH AND MODERNA INDEPENDENTLY DESIGNED A PIECE OF GENETIC SOFTWARE CODING FOR THE SARS-CoV-2 SPIKE (S) PROTEIN—THEY INSERTED THIS S PROTEIN CODE INTO A MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) MOLECULE.  WHEN THIS MRNA IS INJECTED INTO THE BODY, CELLS RECEIVING IT MAKE THE S PROTEIN AND DISPLAY IT ON THEIR SURFACE.  THIS PUTS THE IMMUNE DEFENCE SYSTEM ON HIGH ALERT FOR THE ACTUAL VIRUS, WHICH THE BODY MAY LATER ENCOUNTER IN A NATURAL INFECTION—THIS IS A NEAT TRICK OF BIOLOGY, ON THEORY, TO GET THE BODY TO PRODUCE ITS OWN VACCINE.  THE APPROACH USES MESSENGER RNA, OR mRNA, TO TURN A PATIENT'S CELLS INTO FACTORIES THAT MAKE ONE PARTICULAR CORONAVIRUS PROTEIN.  THE PFIZER AND BIONTECH VACCINE USES MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) TECHNOLOGY AND IS DESIGNED TO TRIGGER AN IMMUNE RESPONSE WITHOUT USING PATHOGENS, SUCH AS ACTUAL VIRUS PARTICLES.  TILL TODAY, A COMPLETE SINGLE VIRUS HAS NOT BEEN ISOLATED, PURIFIED AND CULTURED—SO, WHAT ARE ALL THIS VACCINES FOR ?

CHIEF IS A CRIMINAL, AND IS IN THE PAYROLL OF BILL GATES.  MESSENGER RNA OR mRNA IS THE RIBONUCLEIC ACID THAT TRANSFERS THE GENETIC CODE OF THE DNA OF THE CELL NUCLEUS TO A RIBOSOME IN THE CYTOPLASM, THAT IS, THE ONE THAT DETERMINES THE ORDER IN WHICH THE AMINO ACIDS OF A PROTEIN BIND AND ACT AS A MOLD OR PATTERN FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF THAT PROTEIN.  SCIENTISTS AT BIONTECH AND MODERNA INDEPENDENTLY DESIGNED A PIECE OF GENETIC SOFTWARE CODING FOR THE SARS-CoV-2 SPIKE (S) PROTEIN—THEY INSERTED THIS S PROTEIN CODE INTO A MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) MOLECULE.  WHEN THIS MRNA IS INJECTED INTO THE BODY, CELLS RECEIVING IT MAKE THE S PROTEIN AND DISPLAY IT ON THEIR SURFACE.  THIS PUTS THE IMMUNE DEFENCE SYSTEM ON HIGH ALERT FOR THE ACTUAL VIRUS, WHICH THE BODY MAY LATER ENCOUNTER IN A NATURAL INFECTION—THIS IS A NEAT TRICK OF BIOLOGY, ON THEORY, TO GET THE BODY TO PRODUCE ITS OWN VACCINE.  THE APPROACH USES MESSENGER RNA, OR mRNA, TO TURN A PATIENT'S CELLS INTO FACTORIES THAT MAKE ONE PARTICULAR CORONAVIRUS PROTEIN.  THE PFIZER AND BIONTECH VACCINE USES MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) TECHNOLOGY AND IS DESIGNED TO TRIGGER AN IMMUNE RESPONSE WITHOUT USING PATHOGENS, SUCH AS ACTUAL VIRUS PARTICLES.  TILL TODAY, A COMPLETE SINGLE VIRUS HAS NOT BEEN ISOLATED, PURIFIED AND CULTURED—SO, WHAT ARE ALL THIS VACCINES FOR ?

Think about it, if you are Indonesia or Philippine girls etc, and knowing you might have already got covid, what will you do? Will you not quickly find way (eg. as maids) to get into Singapore to enjoy free medical treatments while having free incomes? To get negative covid test? Just bribe the testers over there. What's the problem?  Won't you wander why only Singapore having this problem of importing covid maids but not other countries, s.t. Taiwan and Hong Kong?

Imported or not,  It still means 1 new patient to look after, to spend medical resources on, to facilitate hotel quarantine etc. The people attending to these imported cases are who? Community people : ie - doctors/nurses/hotel staff/volunteers who are our siblings, family members, parents etc. They come home to us, take the public transport, Grab, drive etc. There is always a risk they catch the virus and then spread to community (as what can be seen from overseas countries where healthcare workers contract the virus etc)  So for those who say dont need to worry coz these are imported cases, my question to you is this : What happens if the doctors/nurses are yr family members? You worry abt their health and ur health. What happens if they catch the virus, is it fair to you that you hv been dutifully following the Govt policies? What happens if there is an outbreak and you hv the virus? You hope to get the medical care u need, but then again the resources are continuously stretched by daily high imported cases.",Jan-14

All it take is one of this SHN servers to break their quarantine and we will have a big cluster following. Imagine, 42 today, will the number keep going up? Am both sad and afraid. Sad  because  with such a efficient government,  such basic control at our borders seems lenient and afraid because of the slow pace of our vaccination program. I strongly believe with the efficiency of our government,  SOPs like such is easy to carry out as we have both the means and money.

Our concern is community cases, especially those that were unlink therefore untraceable or uncontrollable.  Imported cases means they enter SG negative but then got tested positive or developed symptom while serving QO. They can take and pass the pre departure test in their home country but the virus is in such small quantity at that stage that it can’t be detected. Few days later after they reach SG then the virus grew to an sufficient amount  to be tested positive.    Why do we still wear mask while zero community case?   Because there might be asymptomatic carrier in SG too they don’t have symptom and if they don’t take the test they will not be discovered, they can be infectious.  The reasons why We have zero community case now could be because we are all wearing mask, protecting SG from a breakout incase some carrier slip thru the system.",Jan-10

1.01588E+16,Kelvin Oh,"BREAKING NEWS Global news      Italy conducts autopsy of the coronavirus patient, massive revelation ensues.      Italy became the first country in the world to perform an autopsy.  (Autopsy) on the corpse of Covid-19 and after extensive research, it was found that Covid-19 does not exist as a virus.  But very large  It's a global scam, people have died from ""Amplified Global 5G Electromagnetic Radiation (Poison)"".       Doctors in Italy have violated the World Health Organization (WHO) law, which does not allow autopsies.  (Autopsy) on the corpses of those who have died from the corona virus to search after scientific discovery.  It cannot be assumed that it is not a virus, but rather the fatal bacteria that cause blood clots in the blood vessels, such as blood clots in the veins and nerves formed by these bacteria, and are the patients who cause death.      Italy beat the virus, stating that  ""Nothing else is hardening of the arteries in atherosclerosis  (Thromboembolism) and the way to deal with it is to cure it. ""      Antibiotic      Anti-inflammatory and      Taking an anticoagulant (aspirin) will treat it.      And it shows that a cure for the disease is possible, exciting news for the world, was provided by an Italian doctor with an autopsy.  (Post-mortem) of the coronavirus, according to many Italian scientists  People do not need a ventilator and an intensive care unit (ICU) .The protocol for this has been published in Italy.      CHINA already knows this.  But never made public      Please share this information with your family, neighbors, acquaintances, friends, coworkers, so they can escape the fear of Covid-19 and understand that this is not a virus.  Rather, it is a bacteria that is only exposed to 5G radiation, the cause is very dangerous for people with low immunity.  This radiation can also cause inflammation and lack of oxygen.  Victims should take Asprin-100mg and Apronix or Paracetamol 650mg. Why… ??? क. Since it has been proven that COVID-19 causes blood clots which cause blood clots in humans and cause blood clots.  Tonnes in the veins and because the brain, heart and lungs are unable to receive oxygen because of the difficult illness and people  Quickly died of breathing difficulties      Doctors in Italy failed to comply with WHO procedures and performed an autopsy of the COVID-19 death.Doctors opened up the limbs and other parts of the body, and after proper examination and examination, the blood vessels were dilated and the blood vessels were filled.  With thromboembolism, which often stops the blood from flowing  It also reduces the flow of oxygen into the body, which can lead to death.  Upon learning of this research, the Italian Ministry of Health immediately changed the Covid-19 treatment protocol and gave patients 100mg positive aspirin and started Empromax.As a result, patients began to recover and their health began to improve.  Italy's health ministry eliminated more than 14,000 patients in a single day and sent them home.     Source: Italian Ministry of Health",Jan-08

1.01588E+16,Anthony Paul Ray,I’ve never really understood why the imported cases need to be reported when people have been infected overseas and detected whilst in quarantine. We’re now seeing people being reported as “locally transmitted” cases when they appear to have past infections and/or infections from ships or before they came to Singapore. I realise MOH probably want to be open but why give stupid people something to panic and complain about  when you’re doing such a great job of isolating incoming cases and keeping real community cases at practically nil.,Jan-07

He does not interact with diners at Azur.*  He tested positive for a pooled swab during Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) on 2 January, and was tested again on 4 January. On the same day, he started to develop acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. His individual test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 5 January, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.

Viral mutation is like a game of chance.  Unlike human DNA replication where there is proofreading of the new DNA produced, virus RNA mutation has no proofreading mechanism.  It may mutate into something harmless. It may mutate into something that is just as harmful to humans as the original virus. Or it may mutate into something that is MORE transmissible or MORE DEADLY than the original virus. It may even mutate into an AIRBORNE virus which will render all our border controls, quarantine and even our non-N95 masks USELESS. It is a game of luck.  But with trillions of chances and tries in replication in just 1 infected person, the global chances of mutating into a more DEADLY virus is very real.  So everyone needs to get themselves vaccinated to deprive the virus the trillions of chances to mutate into a deadly airborne virus that may mean the extinction of mankind should they get infected.  YOU could be the host that allows the virus to mutate into a DEADLY VIRUS that will make humankind EXTINCT!!  VACCINATION IS NOT AN OPTION! IT IS A MUST TO STOP THE VIRUS!!!",Jan-05

COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?",Jan-03

1.01588E+16,Bert Tan,"Leading Canadian Health Expert Outraged at Government Response to COVID  Dr. Roger Hodkinson, MA, MB, FRCPC, FCAP, CEO and medical director of Western Medical Assessments, spoke at the Edmonton City Council Community and Public Services Committee meeting on Nov. 13 about the city’s move to extend its face-covering bylaw. He was listed as speaker number 95 on the meeting agenda.  Dr. Hodkinson was trained at Cambridge University in the UK. He is ex-president of the pathology section of the Medical Association. He was the chairman of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada Examination Committee and Pathology in Ottawa, Canada.  Here’s the transcript of Hodkinson’s testimony:  This is Dr. Hodkinson, I just wanted to let you know I’m standing by. OK, well we would love to hear from you, the floor is yours. Thank you very much. I do appreciate the opportunity to address you on this very important matter. What I’m going to say is lay language, and blunt. It is counter-narrative, and so you don’t immediately think I’m a quack, I’m going to briefly outline my credentials so that you can understand where I’m coming from in terms of knowledge base in all of this. I’m a medical specialist in pathology which includes virology. I trained at Cambridge University in the UK. I’m the ex-president of the pathology section of the Medical Association. I was previously an assistant professor in the Faculty of Medicine doing a lot of teaching. I was the chairman of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada Examination Committee and Pathology in Ottawa, but more to the point I’m currently the chairman of a biotechnology company in North Carolina selling the COVID-19 test. And [inaudible] you might say I know a little bit about all of this. The bottom line is simply this: There is utterly unfounded public hysteria driven by the media and politicians. It’s outrageous. This is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public. There is absolutely nothing that can be done to contain this virus. Other than protecting older, more vulnerable people. It should be thought of as nothing more than a bad flu season. This is not Ebola. It’s not SARS. It’s politics playing medicine and that’s a very dangerous game. There is no action of any kind needed other than what happened last year when we felt unwell. We stayed home, we took chicken noodle soup, we didn’t visit granny and we decided when we would return to work. We didn’t need anyone to tell us. Masks are utterly useless. There is no evidence base for their effectiveness whatsoever. Paper masks and fabric masks are simply virtue-signaling. They’re not even worn effectively most of the time. It’s utterly ridiculous. Seeing these unfortunate, uneducated people — I’m not saying that in a pejorative sense — seeing these people walking around like lemmings, obeying without any knowledge base, to put the mask on their face. Social distancing is also useless because COVID is spread by aerosols which travel 30 meters or so before landing. Enclosures have had such terrible unintended consequences. Everywhere should be opened tomorrow as well as was stated in the Great Barrington Declaration that I circulated prior to this meeting. And a word on testing: I do want to emphasize that I’m in the business of testing for COVID. I do want to emphasize that positive test results do not, underlined in neon, mean a clinical infection. It’s simply driving public hysteria and all testing should stop. Unless you’re presenting to the hospital with some respiratory problem. All that should be done is to protect the vulnerable and to give them all in the nursing homes that are under your control, give them all 3,000 to 5,000 international units of vitamin D every day which has been shown to radically reduce the likelihood of Infection. And I would remind you all that using the province’s own statistics, the risk of death under 65 in this province is one in 300,000. One in 300,000. You’ve got to get a grip on this. The scale of the response that you are undertaking with no evidence for it is utterly ridiculous given the consequences of acting in a way that you’re proposing. All kinds of suicides, business closures, funerals, weddings etc. It’s simply outrageous! It’s just another bad flu and you’ve got to get your minds around that. Let people make their own decisions. You should be totally out of the business of medicine. You’re being led down the garden path by the chief medical officer of health for this province. I am absolutely outraged that this has reached this level. It should all stop tomorrow. Thank you very much.

Most people let their guard off then dining outside .The spread not only come from the air but also from the utensils we all sharing together with many people .It will be unrealistic to trust all utensils are cleaned properly.If government can have a tougher stands on F&B like what they doing to entertainment outlet than we can control better.This is what I call putting focus on the wrong things.,"Dec 31, 2020"

Another issue is ... at the back of these two (+) cases are their colleagues, their family members, their contacts ... by the time contact tracing is done ...

1.01588E+16,Bert Tan,"Leading Canadian Health Expert Outraged at Government Response to COVID  Dr. Roger Hodkinson, MA, MB, FRCPC, FCAP, CEO and medical director of Western Medical Assessments, spoke at the Edmonton City Council Community and Public Services Committee meeting on Nov. 13 about the city’s move to extend its face-covering bylaw. He was listed as speaker number 95 on the meeting agenda.  Dr. Hodkinson was trained at Cambridge University in the UK. He is ex-president of the pathology section of the Medical Association. He was the chairman of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada Examination Committee and Pathology in Ottawa, Canada.  Here’s the transcript of Hodkinson’s testimony:  This is Dr. Hodkinson, I just wanted to let you know I’m standing by. OK, well we would love to hear from you, the floor is yours. Thank you very much. I do appreciate the opportunity to address you on this very important matter. What I’m going to say is lay language, and blunt. It is counter-narrative, and so you don’t immediately think I’m a quack, I’m going to briefly outline my credentials so that you can understand where I’m coming from in terms of knowledge base in all of this. I’m a medical specialist in pathology which includes virology. I trained at Cambridge University in the UK. I’m the ex-president of the pathology section of the Medical Association. I was previously an assistant professor in the Faculty of Medicine doing a lot of teaching. I was the chairman of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada Examination Committee and Pathology in Ottawa, but more to the point I’m currently the chairman of a biotechnology company in North Carolina selling the COVID-19 test. And [inaudible] you might say I know a little bit about all of this. The bottom line is simply this: There is utterly unfounded public hysteria driven by the media and politicians. It’s outrageous. This is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public. There is absolutely nothing that can be done to contain this virus. Other than protecting older, more vulnerable people. It should be thought of as nothing more than a bad flu season. This is not Ebola. It’s not SARS. It’s politics playing medicine and that’s a very dangerous game. There is no action of any kind needed other than what happened last year when we felt unwell. We stayed home, we took chicken noodle soup, we didn’t visit granny and we decided when we would return to work. We didn’t need anyone to tell us. Masks are utterly useless. There is no evidence base for their effectiveness whatsoever. Paper masks and fabric masks are simply virtue-signaling. They’re not even worn effectively most of the time. It’s utterly ridiculous. Seeing these unfortunate, uneducated people — I’m not saying that in a pejorative sense — seeing these people walking around like lemmings, obeying without any knowledge base, to put the mask on their face. Social distancing is also useless because COVID is spread by aerosols which travel 30 meters or so before landing. Enclosures have had such terrible unintended consequences. Everywhere should be opened tomorrow as well as was stated in the Great Barrington Declaration that I circulated prior to this meeting. And a word on testing: I do want to emphasize that I’m in the business of testing for COVID. I do want to emphasize that positive test results do not, underlined in neon, mean a clinical infection. It’s simply driving public hysteria and all testing should stop. Unless you’re presenting to the hospital with some respiratory problem. All that should be done is to protect the vulnerable and to give them all in the nursing homes that are under your control, give them all 3,000 to 5,000 international units of vitamin D every day which has been shown to radically reduce the likelihood of Infection. And I would remind you all that using the province’s own statistics, the risk of death under 65 in this province is one in 300,000. One in 300,000. You’ve got to get a grip on this. The scale of the response that you are undertaking with no evidence for it is utterly ridiculous given the consequences of acting in a way that you’re proposing. All kinds of suicides, business closures, funerals, weddings etc. It’s simply outrageous! It’s just another bad flu and you’ve got to get your minds around that. Let people make their own decisions. You should be totally out of the business of medicine. You’re being led down the garden path by the chief medical officer of health for this province. I am absolutely outraged that this has reached this level. It should all stop tomorrow. Thank you very much.

MOM should start to investigate and not approve entry application until they are sure that test done at origin country not by backyard hospitals and doctors la. Making employers pay for the medical fee if positive upon arrival will only add salts to wounds.  You are punishing your citizens for needing to employ FDW.

1.01588E+16,Bert Tan,"THE PCR DECEPTION⎮Short Documentary About the Test Used for Covid-19 https://youtu.be/h_fmcpF8mfk  Scientists tells the truth but politicians suggests otherwise!  Every Scary Things You're Being Told Depends On The Unreliable PCR Test https://youtu.be/6ny9nNFHQsY  ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE, NATIONAL CENTRE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf  Sars-CoV-2 virus has not been isolated and purified. What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been purified and isolated, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?","Dec 31, 2020"

What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been purified and isolated, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?","Dec 31, 2020"

1.01588E+16,I-Chun Liu,"Ministry of Health, Singapore Could we please have explanations on the following:  1. Why Singapore has still not set a year by which smoking rate will be under 5%, a.k.a. endgame. Endgame targets of other countries include: Malaysia <5% (2045), Canada <5% (2035), New Zealand <5% (2025), Finland <2% (2040). How about Singapore?  2. Why did the Government reject the brilliant Singapore-initiated Tobacco-free Generation proposal: https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/tobaccocontrol/22/suppl_1/i22.full.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2jYpnQzM86Mn2EMa-r_1YfCksn3S8SjtnX8LYgVIdaf50BDbhBgRLorj8 to ban the sale of tobacco to those born in and after year 20XX?   Existing smokers who are addicted are NOT affected, leading to a gradual decline of smokers as current smokers pass on and no new replacement smokers come on board. Tobacco levy revenue will also not drop to 0 overnight.  This proposal will ensure that we will achieve the 1986 National Smoking Control Programme theme and goal: 'Towards a Nation of Non-Smokers'.  3. Why did the Government instead choose to adopt minimum age laws for tobacco use, which were led and supported by the tobacco industry? Minimum age laws are flawed, due to ""badge of coming of age"" and misleading message (OK to smoke at 21, but harmful at 20?). The concept of the Tobacco-free Generation is explained very well (from 9:00 to 20:30) in this webinar: https://ash.org/brookline-nov-2020/","Dec 30, 2020"

Ex-Attorney General Walter Woon recently said, ""No one with a moral sense is ever truly free to do as he likes. One has always to be conscious about how one’s behaviour impacts others. A clear signal must be sent that society will not tolerate selfishness masquerading as freedom. The welfare of the many outweighs the rights of an individual.""  This certainly applies to neighbours’ smoke drift. Without a law in place to curb smoke drift to neighbouring units, no amount of moral suasion, talking to smokers or voluntary mediation can resolve the problem. Smokers always claim that smoking in their homes whenever, however and wherever they like is ""not against the law"". If it bothers you, then close YOUR windows. Your suffocation, hefty air-con bills, and worse, damaged health is none of their concern. Non-smokers have suffered enough.

I'm concern and would like to ask base on that article written.  I didnt see any collaboration of vaccine mentioned in the article.  -In regards to Sars or Covid 19 virus-vaccine, and regarding the 2 vaccines from Pifzer and Moderna using the new mRNA technology compared to traditional vaccine,   The mentioned were as abstracted in [.] brackets from article:  1. [This information was used by several international research groups in their studies of biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients, helping us understand how the virus spreads to different organs and causes complications in some patients.]  2. [discussions with some colleagues in the engineering field on how their technologies could be adapted for developing diagnostic procedures for COVID-19 as well as other infectious diseases.]  3. [colleagues from fields such as pathology, cancer and immunology use their expertise to study COVID-19 in different ways. Combining their knowledge with innovative technologies helped us gain new knowledge of the virus quickly.]  4. [We also assisted some local companies in developing diagnostic kits that can be used at point-of-care settings, and more importantly, help to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers.]   One heartened mentioned in this article saw was, [ ] abstracted:  [ In another collaboration, we detected strong virus-specific T cell immunity in people who have recovered from COVID-19 and SARS. Interestingly, those who had SARS 17 years ago still harboured T cells from their earlier infection, and those same T cells could also recognise COVID-19. This finding may be useful for the design and testing of COVID-19 vaccines. ]   Questions: 1. I would like to ask Gov taskforce, Ministry of Health, given since the Sars outbreak in 2002-2004, and no Sars vaccine was created that period of time, and people have been travelling around the world since, aren't the people developed T-cell immunity also?   From MOH website on the status of Covid19 local situation as of 27/12/2020: https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 53,870 were Discharged  0 Hospitalised (Critical)  29 Death   On the 29 death, base on the news reported for local Singapore, most of the death the covid patients were caused by having pre existing conditions.   Q1. If 53,870 were previously diagnosed having covid 19 virus, can we say that these people had gotten the T-cell immunity of covid19  Q2. Since after phase 2 and till current date 27/12/20, the people can go out to malls, dine, shopping, the local community inflection numbers were very low, many days can be zero. Most were imported cases. Can we say that the local people had gotten herd immunity?   Q3. The safety of the 2 vaccines Pifzer and Moderna using mRNA technology - teach Human DNA cells, different from traditional method of using weakened virus, to naturally activate body immune system cells to fight the weakend virus.   Abstracted [The mRNA technology contains instructions for human cells to make proteins that mimic part of the coronavirus, and is used in vaccines from Moderna as well as from Pfizer and BioNTech.]  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-starts-work-on-plant-for-mrna-based-covid-19-vaccine-13816686?cid=FBcna  Aren't this new technology - giving instruction - have high risk to human DNA cells. Human DNA cells - is like a code of instruction designed by GOD for growth.  Animals, birds and plants of different species of have their set of DNA cells.  the high risk of this technologies      1. Autoimmune diesases     2. Aftecting the natural DNA cells, risking deformity in future offspring.   US CDC website on active surveillance of the status of people after vaccination, show that on 18/12/2020, approx 30% were hospitalised.  How is Singapore Gov taskforce and MOH still recommend frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable elderly with existing medical conditions and vascular condition to take these vaccine?  https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-19/05-COVID-CLARK.pdf  I do not have the latest update of US CDC website on active surveillance of the status of people after vaccination.  I really appreciate if Singapore Gov Taskforce, Ministry of Health, can publicly and transparently share these data, to let the People know these safety status data of people in other countries vaccination.  I also want to ask on the liabilities for compensations from these pharmaceutical companies of these 2 vaccines introduced, for any adverse reactions, side effects and long term conditions to the People , and also if MOH endorsing these vaccines. Kindly please address publicly to the people.  Last note:  Fomer Vice-president of Pifzer, Mike Yeadon mentioned the notion of having millions of healthy, fit people is ridiculous quoted below, he also shared his knowledge and reasoning in his video: [Yeadon states this notion is “ridiculous because while SARS-CoV-2 is indeed novel, coronaviruses are not. There’s no such thing as an ‘ancestor-less virus’.” Indeed, he points out, there are at least “four, endemic, common-cold inducing coronaviruses … [which] circulate freely in UK and elsewhere.” Those who have been infected by “one or more of these endemic, common-cold producing coronaviruses in the past, have a long-lived and robust [T-cell] immunity, not only to those viruses, but to closely related viruses. SARS-CoV-2 is one such closely-related virus.”] https://lbry.tv/Mike-Yeadon-Unlocked:0  A doctor whom gathered info regarding the vaccines using new technologies mRNA also shared her view: https://www.stopworldcontrol.com/madej/","Dec 28, 2020"

What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found.

PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective.

What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been purified and isolated, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.

1.01587E+16,Bom Tay,Sorry for the long post skip if u r bored. Thks. 26th 2020 Feb OA waved to alert me n came to ask if I had anything to tell her. . We talked about the old uncle patient who fell on 24th Feb 2020. OA told the centre was arranging for an escot to take him home after dialysis which he became weak always. Usually I would walk him to the taxi stand whenever I could. Most nurses said they had instructions no need to walk him to the taxi stand if he was feeling tired he just wait. Few would walk him. I was told the nurses asked him to wait till the nurses finished their duties then a nurse would walk him to the taxi stand. Which was not always true. Most importantly on 26th Feb I told the OA a Singaporean to lookout for foreign nurses should they were rude or bully the Singaporean patients. I didn't that was wrong n racist. I cited the incident of a Malaysian Indian senior nurse who I witnessed mimicked the sound of a deaf dying old patient. With actions too. The old uncle patient patient had a feeding tube running thru his nose. When I brought it up I was told by the manager an India Indian she would talk to the Malaysian Indian nurse. What was the outcome I was not told. Until at a meeting facilitated by the Msw officer the CEO was chairing the Malaysian Indian nurse testified that I was giving her problem she was actually playing n treated the dying old uncle patient like a father. What I saw was different with the managers backing her it made me looked bad. She was lying. I told the CEO if she dares to swear what I said was a lie I was willing to stop my dialysis. But at the meeting my only intention was to tell the CEO about the senior nurses taking money n one Pinoy the most senior nurse was not only taking money but wanted to borrow money from an old auntie patient. The Pinoy even dared to ask the old auntie patient to borrow from loanshark for him. I requested to speak to the CEO alone. The Msw officer was told by the CEO to stay. When I brought the matrer of the corrupted Pinoy nurse the CEO was not interested n snubbed me telling he was told by his staff everything he needed to know. The CEO was likely told what the staff wanted him to know. The staff were worried I told all that had happened at the centre. Another important matter was the centre was running at random n many SOPs were not strictly followed. Later another Msw manager from another district came to talk to me. I told him about the centre many medical lapses. The Msw manager said he had informed the nurses no food allowed n no money allowed to received. But food n money were freely given n accepted. These were not what I bothered I was more worry about these foreign nurses taking big money especially the most senior nurse a Pinoy. I was telling the Msw manager many times the Pinoy was really leeching his behavior was out of sorts. The Msw manager told me the Pinoy was considered the position of a centre nurse manager. I remember telling the clinical nurse manager n Msw manager that the Pinoy couldn't be trusted. U didn't elaborate in case 'I beat the bush n scare the snake'. The Msw manager n myself even went to talk to the clinical nurse manager an India Indian weeks before the corrupted Pinoy the most senior nurse at the centre. The manager said the Pinoy had some personal problems not convenient to discuss. The manager was covering up for the Pinoy like she always had for years. That was how the corrupted Pinoy n few of his fellow nurse plied their trade for many years. Weeks later the Pinoy disappeared with patients' money. The manager pretended she didn't know anything she n her superior the district nurse manager were busy telling the victims n Filipino nurses to keep mum about the disappearance of the Pinoy nurse. I was warned by the 2 patients to stop talking about the Pinoy. The rest of the victims didn't tell me anything. The nurses were angry with me if not the managers already talked smothered the victims. The HQ didn't knew about so many patients lent money to the Pinoy only the one that informed HQ  . The Pinoy disappeared around July 2019. I knew 5 lent him money how many more I do not know. With his monthly salary he should be able to pay the 5 victims in not much time but he chose to leave Singapore. I believe there should be many more victims. I already informed the Msw manager about the number of victims I know. N HQ knew too how the Pinoy got to get out of the country was the question. The district nurse manager n clinical nurse manager played a big part smothering the full extent of his doings. In another words the managers helped him to run. If he takes from able n well off I don't care but he took from poor old sick Singaporeans for years he was here. One of the victims who moved about on a motorised scooter. He was about 50 years old. We talked a few times over months about the corrupted pi oy nurse but later stopped talking tell g me the managers told him not to say.. The managers were obstructing the course of justice. His fellow Filipino nurses likely followed what he was doing. I was kicked out for teing the OA the Pinay nurses were taking money from an old auntie patient for wheeling her into the centre. The managers made a police report of harassment to Clementi police station. The IO called me n told me the names of persons who made the report. This is the biggest medical centre of its kind managers n directors r not upright how to run the centres. Will they cover up suspicious death? I believe the managers will. The CEO has to bear the responsibilities. To kicked me out was not the solution only to nursed the hard feelings of the nurses managers n directors n to forcefully closed the ugly matters. . The right thing to do was to discipline the foreign nurses n the managers. The directors were weak handling the juniors staff. Don't they feel ashamed. N I m sore. ' Beggers cannot be choosers' I m recieving free treatments I should not be talking. But as Singaporean I cannot allow these foreign medical workers to be rude n take advantage of our poor sick n old patients. After doing always deny n not embarrass or shy. I don't speak I cannot call myself a Singaporean. .,"Dec 19, 2020"

It is known many countries now having increased infection, because it is winter.     and neighbouring countries' situations haven't improve much. People now tired of following rules ! The gov should put on TV ask citizens and foreigners to obey covid rules. One place where people are disregarding rules is at parks. You can't run with a mask on. People not exercising but just strolling also don't wear mask, because joggers don't wear. It is the rule that joggers can don't need a mask, but people who are not joggers ?

From information gathered, looks like flights coming in from USA, UK and white countries are given nice accommodation like MBS and Sentosa.  Flights from Dubai - people are given Hotel Carlton.  Flights from Manila - people are given Hotel Royal.  I stayed in Hotel Carlton - and I feel claustrophobic. I need a balcony and to look at open spaces with trees and greenery.  Is there a bias here?

I wonder if I can pay attention to it. I am a 60-year-old and have been working in society for almost 50 years. The epidemic has brought inconvenience to our lives and threatened our situation.  For example, one day when I was queuing, I felt that someone was too close to me, and I felt a kind of body temperature approaching me. I quickly told the other person to stay away from me, but I couldn’t make it and I was attacked. Everyone next to me ignored them, like this  Situation, what can I do?  Because I am an old man?

Stop spreading misleading news & don't panic with unfounded hoaxes. Covid-19 vaccination  help prevent the virus from spreading. There's new vaccines coming out & they were already tested on volunteers. Rule is all vaccines must always go on clinical trial test first before the vaccine be out. Which explain why you recently hear the news mentioned there's 3 different kinds of vaccines (different manufacturers) will be out soon .. the news mentioned 96 percent or 93 percent success rate & they still testing it further.

Stop spreading misleading news & don't panic with unfounded hoaxes. Covid-19 vaccination  help prevent the virus from spreading. There's new vaccines coming out & they were already tested on volunteers. Rule is all vaccines must always go on clinical trial test first before the vaccine be out. Which explain why you recently hear the news mentioned there's 3 different kinds of vaccines (different manufacturers) will be out soon .. the news mentioned 96 percent or 93 percent success rate & they still testing it further.

1.01587E+16,Joseph Kee,"So as not to sound like I am pouring cold water on a seemingly good news. As was stated many of the imported cases were without symptoms which means asymptomatic. According to data, as many as 70 pct of people positive were asymptomatic and can remain so without developing symptoms at a later stage. people with symptoms would normally seek treatment in gp or hospital. But asymptomatic do not see a gp or hospital for obvious reason. They do not know they were infected.Those who got tested in gp or hospital then, will come into moh radar and be counted in the data. Therein lies the danger as asymptomatic can be in the community shedding virus as they go and these people goes undetected. So my point is there are lots of asymptomatic in our community. And they are not imported cases and will never be in the data. How did he catch the virus.? It is probably from another asymptomatic.  I understand that MOH daily numbers should not lull us into complacency.  Because one need to analyse objectively to know what is exactly happening in reality. So  put on your mask and social distance until a vaccine is available. Travel bubble is jumping the gun.","Nov 25, 2020"

1.01587E+16,Low De,"The Multi-Task Force & MOH have to monitor for the 🦠 situation in global closely & carefully from now onwards, during winter season till next year.   Besides Hong Kong 🇭🇰 is the current affected location as a result of delaying on the travel bubble in next two weeks for monitoring, Shanghai & Tianjin are also the latest affected cities. The trend is about asymptomatic, no symptom. ‘Identify & Capture patient 0’ at the arrival as critical. Absolutely no complacency. Otherwise, the number of days as we have been maintaining for 0 cases in the community would be wasted. Remember the period when we have been going through since April.   No cases in the community will encourage more Singaporeans to spend more on their S$100/- voucher of SingapoRediscover with their family during festive season & school holiday, minimum to boost our local tourism. Indeed 😷 & safe distancing must always strictly to comply for everyone.   Hence, the selection of locations for our travel bubble is somehow considerable in regards of their 🦠 preventive measures in their respective country. For an example, 🇹🇼Republic Of China, Taiwan is a good role model in global. Australia 🇦🇺 is warmer during festive season where the climate is opposite to European countries but still depends on their preventive status.  Transparency, accurate with updated 🦠status will gradually be gaining on trust & reliability among countries in difficult conditions.","Nov 24, 2020"

1.01587E+16,Nelson Loh,"Have the government figure out how to minimize the imported cases?  Airlines and departure airports are supposed to ensure that passengers are cleared of coronavirus infections before they are allowed to depart for Singapore. Almost daily, we have infected passengers from India. Is there a strict check in India? Could Ministry of Foreign Affairs ensure infected people are barred from entering Singapore? They should be sent back to the country of departure.","Nov 24, 2020"

1.01587E+16,任雯婷,有12個進口案例？ 感覺進口案例好像這次多了一點？ 但不知道他們在Stay -Home 是隔離幾天？他們會不會隨意去公共場所呢？畢竟新冠肺炎的傳播媒介太容易了，所以很可怕😱！ 好不容易經過我們大家的努力，才換來新加坡境內的安全， 希望大家也不要鬆懈，隨時隨地保持警惕 注意⚠️自己出門帶口罩，勤洗手，儘量避免多數人的聚會，這樣可避免群聚感染與傳播 ,"Nov 22, 2020"

Many are asymptomatic.   Even half of the Delhi slums were found to be infected in the past but got over it.  Infection rates only refer to 'identified' or 'reported' infection rates.  The actual rates are monumentally far more.  The only way to confirm anything is to test the entire population immediately before this report and get a 'everyone is hunky dory' result a minute before putting out this report.

1.01587E+16,Mark Leong,"Meaningless comparison cos Sg’s MediShield life is unique. While HK’s VHIS are provided by private insurers, i think it may shed light better if comparisons are made with IP plans rather than the basic MediShield life plan provided by gov. With the latest changes to MediShield life, like increasing coverage, there is apparently an overlapping in terms of coverage with IP plans. If IP plans are to increase their coverage too, to justify their increasing premium. It will result in higher premiums again for those who already had IP plans coverage too. That is a double whammy.  This round of changes is sending the message to pple that they should forego their IP plans and just stick to the basic MediShield life plan provided by the gov. Of course whether private insurers will increase their premiums or not remains unknown. If basic MediShield life is going that direction of increasingly “improving” more coverages as medical and hospitalisation cost continue to increase in the future, it is unwittingly asking pple to terminate and forego their IP plans as gov will go the path of what private insurers are already doing. Such plans will increasingly becoming a burden then to mitigate hospitalisation costs in the future. While some, whom already suffering from chronic diseases may continue with IP coverage, they may no longer care to keep their conditions in check. Cos doing so will mean incurring own medical cost without coverage by MediShield life. While seeing their conditions get worsen and be hospitalised, they do not hv to worry as their hospitalisation coverage is already taken care with their IP plans. Resulting in more claims to further burdening the national healthcare insurance. Already the move to remove “as charged” with co-payment, it had already increased burden on members. I do not see the value anymore with IP plans if members choose the path to keep their chronic diseases in check. This new changes really confirmed that IP plans are not only unnecessary, these are no longer a value coverage seeing the premiums continue to increase. If Sg is truly wishing to see its pple maintain good health.","Nov 16, 2020"

1.01586E+16,Seri Ou Smas,The last 2 cases transmitted by Singaporeans in the community were reported on 24 Oct 2020. Since then all locally transmitted cases reported are either in the Dormitories or foreigners who were detected after their SHN including a Vietnamese and an Indian. Even the cases on 24 Oct were probably the result of getting in contact with foreigner at T3. Basically since at least 24 Oct there has been no virus spreading among locals in the neighbourhood within Singapore. So why is the Ministry of Health not allowing social football amongst friends during the weekend? Instead they are opening up the tourism sector like allowing 22 Chinese tourists to come in. They are also allowing nightclubs and K-rooms to open instead of allowing social football in the open air football fields. WHY?   ,"Nov 9, 2020"

If there are no cases spreading in the community, ut means there is no coronavirus spreading in the community right? If there are asymptomatic cases, there will also be symptomatic cases because the asymptomatic ones will spread it to others who will show symptoms. Where is the science in what we are doing? What is the logic? Currently the cases are being imported. Maybe some lingering traces in the dormitories. Does this warrant DORSCON Orange? We were Green in March but the cases were much higher then. What on earth is our government's logic?","Nov 8, 2020"

1.01586E+16,Bert Tan,"Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg https://youtu.be/TLiputnTdeg  Viruses are not alive so how can it be contagious?   COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money. The governments moon shot daily testing program will cost £100 Billion roughly two thirds of the annual NHS budget.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.

1.01586E+16,Jonathan Teo,"Ministry of Health, Singapore The problem is that the government reacts too slowly to a changing situation. Earlier in the year, news was already surfacing that there was asymptomatic transmission, yet the government was still bragging that it had learned from SARS, which was purely symptomatic transmission. I was saying then that we were fighting the wrong enemy.  The situation has changed again. If you look at the statistics of many of the countries, you see that the second wave has much higher daily cases than the first wave. Yet, the daily deaths in the second wave are much lower than the first. Something has definitely changed. Nobody is certain what it is. It could be treatment protocols (e.g., lying prone instead of on the back, when to deliver intubation, etc), better medical treatments, more available medical equipment and supplies, or the virus itself may have mutated to become less deadly. Another harsh possibility brought up is that, the moribund cases built up has been cleared: in other words, sadly, the grim reaper has already taken the most vulnerable ones. Many of the cases now are not even clinically sick - they just test positive possibly because of the presence of antibodies or RNA fragments left by the virus much earlier.  Presently we have zero cases locally. The odd local cases that appear are mostly from the dormitories. And the evidence suggests the disease is much less deadly now. Any rational assessment of the situation should conclude that the real threat level now is very low. Yet we remain at DORSCON Orange, contrary to what the DORSCON chart itself prescribes. Yet we are wearing masks and socially distancing against a virus that has largely disappeared among the community. Yet businesses and activities are severely limited, causing unnecessary inconvenience and physical, social, economic and mental suffering to the people. The costs (very real) and benefits (pretty dubious) just don't add up any more.  Perhaps our well paid ministers, whose livelihoods are not affected, who commute maskless in their cars and not take the public transport, who enjoy peaceful walks in their gardens of their landed houses, perhaps they should have more heart for the common people weary from Covid fatigue?","Oct 24, 2020"

COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money. The governments moon shot daily testing program will cost £100 Billion roughly two thirds of the annual NHS budget.

1.01586E+16,Jenn Tong,"When considering mandatory trace together in venue with large crowd, please consider physical trace together token for everyone instead of mixing with app.  App version are unreliable especially on iOS devices.  App version can easily be disable whereas it is not possible with physical token.  If physical token implementation is not possible in such venue, enforce a unique SafeEntry for each unique crowd location. e.g. each theater has its own unique SafeEntry QR that need to be scan upon entry.  Such unique QR will disable the checkout button which means participant need to scan a unique exit QR to avoid early checkout.","Oct 21, 2020"

Whilst we penalize our F and B outlets for violating safe distancing rules,  it seems that it's ok for foreign workers to gather in large groups without safe distancing, with impunity.  Shouldn't rules be applied consistently across the board?  Your attention to this matter, please.  Thank you.   SS Goh","Oct 18, 2020"

1.01586E+16,Bert Tan,"COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES  PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money. The governments moon shot daily testing program will cost £100 Billion roughly two thirds of the annual NHS budget.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.","Oct 15, 2020"

But stay close to me while putting theeir item!!!!  Can't they wait for me to complete my transaction!  I read reports government checks on eatery, but I do not see any one checking on supermarket queue and queue at shopping center escalator when the people behind just stand right behind me!

Viruses have no soul and are not contagious!  https://youtu.be/m8ke8MA4XHM  https://youtu.be/Z27UgYvnEzE  Origin Of The Word Virus: First recorded in 1590–1600; from Latin—vīrus “slime, poison”; akin to Sanskrit viṣá-, Avestan viša-, Greek iós (from earlier wiós, from still earlier wisós), all meaning “poison, venom”. Coronavirus in Chinese—冠状病毒; 毒 meaning ""Poison"".  Dr. Thomas Cowan Viruses Are Simply Excretions Of A Toxic Cell https://youtu.be/XfrmBtAeVwk  Dr. Stefan Lanka RT-PCR tests are scientifically meaningless https://youtu.be/YQdHn944U50  Virology is Hoaxology https://youtu.be/SjyfTvdr1_s  Spanish Flu: For documented evidence, please read: Chapter 2: THE SPANISH INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC OF 1918 WAS CAUSED BY VACCINATIONS  Swine Flu Expose, book by Eleanora I. McBean, Ph.D., N.D. 1977 http://www.whale.to/vaccine/sf1.html  The Spanish flu was caused by many different environmental factors wherein native waters and food was polluted by nefarious military forces. The body discards the majority of poisons through the skin, therefore eruptions on the skin from poisoning are common. Smallpox vaccines was offered as a solution, when in fact, it perpetuated this poisoning further and further, causing many deaths. Smallpox is an ancient disease that occurs in toxic bodies as an expression of toxicity. It can be hastened and brought about by environmental pollution. There is a multitude of virus strains, and each toxic area in the body will utilize different strains of viruses for cleansing toxic tissues. Native American Indians were wiped out due to the destruction of their food supply, and the poisoning of their waters. This, in turn, caused disease. For example, the manifestation of smallpox symptoms is due to the severe poisoning of the body. Both measles and smallpox are skin eruptions wherein toxins expel through the skin. Smallpox is more extended and severe. There are those that also claim the Indians were infected via blankets, however: Historian Philip Ranlet of Hunter College and author of a 2000 article on the smallpox blanket incident in Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies, also casts doubt. “There is no evidence that the scheme worked,” Ranlet says. Historians usually attribute most of the deaths to the spread of diseases for which native people had no immunity, but recently historian Andrés Reséndez has pushed back against this, arguing that populations were lower than previously estimated, and “a nexus of slavery, overwork and famine killed more Indians in the Caribbean than smallpox, influenza and malaria.” I stand by this and assert that Native Indian’s natural raw food supply was killed off, their waters poisoned, their diets changed, and they were turned into slaves, leading to diseases of all kinds to try to balance the toxic effects of toxic food, lack of proper nutrition, and stress on their bodies.  Ebola: The Ebola vaccine is causing the outbreak of Ebola symptoms in people. It is merely the body reacting to chemical toxicity present in those vaccines. Even the CDC admits in part “Ebola does not pass through the air, through the food, or water.” Yet, many media outlets contradict this statement even, by claiming Ebola is ‘highly contagious’. I have seen no proof that Ebola exists naturally outside a vaccine. So, even according to the CDC themselves, the only real way to get it is direct blood to blood contact using needles with a victim somehow. Ebola, like H1N1, is a manmade disease that exists only in vaccine form. It is merely a reaction to chemical toxicity and man-made spliced animal viral tissues, no different than other vaccines. Yet, Ebola appears to have more extreme effects. The only real way to transmit it is through injection of the vaccine. You must remember that all of this literature is written by the CDC and other organizations within government. These people are the exact people with a vested interest who would try to use such a virus against the people, either through fear, or hysteria. It is highly likely that Ebola in its stated form does not exist, and is merely a government invented disease-causing serum akin to AIDS and the swine flu ‘pandemic’ to provoke fear into the populace so that they can use that as an excuse for vaccination here and abroad, thereby further usurping African land through ‘humanitarian efforts’. All done in order to bring about world government control through land usurping.

Another point to bring up - I sympathised with the FW, for having to wear those black recycled mask the entire day. Frankly, these masks are very uncomfortable. It’s unimaginable to have to wear the whole day and under the hot sun. Why are their employers not willing to issue surgical masks?

Also somewhere someone explained that these workers are scheduled swap test every 2 weeks. It seems during the 2 weekly swap tests some workers became positive.

It is respectable that one of the features of the policy is the cross subsidy of citizens with pre-existing conditions by the population enrolled into the scheme, with each healthy person subsidizing I guess between 1-5 dollars for such cases. However, I wonder why the same tenet is not being applied to both genders, especially given the backdrop that females do have less CPF contributions in general due to home making choices such as raising children, looking after elderly or for other reasons. And yet premiums are S$ 206 for men and S$253 for females. What is the rationale for picking one category over another and not applying the universality tenet consistently ?","Aug 30, 2020"

The First Civil Senate of the BGH has confirmed the judgment by the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart (OLG) of the 16 February 2016. The sum of €100,000 which the biologist dr. Stefan Lanka had offered as a reward for scientific proof of the existence of the alleged measles virus does not have to be paid to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also was ORDERED TO BEAR ALL THE PROCEDURAL COSTS.  Five experts have been involved in the case and presented the results of scientific studies. All five experts, including Prof. Dr. Dr. Andreas Podbielski who had been appointed by the OLG Stuttgart as the preceding court, have consistently found that NONE of the six publications which have been introduced to the trial, contains scientific proof of the existence of the alleged measles virus. http://yournewswire.com/german-supreme-court-measles/  Is it strange that the commercial media is loosing credibility?

1.01584E+16,Bert Tan,"The Flawed PCR Test You might have the virus, but so what? That doesn’t mean you’re sick!  * https://youtu.be/SjyfTvdr1_s Virology is Hoaxology: Viruses do not exist. Period.  Even if you strongly believe in germ theory, there are some serious problems with the generally accepted method of testing for a virus, it’s called the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test.  The PCR test amplifies a specific region of a DNA strand (the DNA target)—It is qualitative not quantitative; in other words, it can tell you if a virus is present or not, but it can’t tell you in what quantities, and it can’t make any accurate assessment about whether the presence of that virus or not is enough to cause disease.  The US CDC admits that a positive coronavirus COVID-19 test (using the PCR method) doesn’t mean the virus is causing the disease/symptoms you may have.  1. These are the actual words of the US CDC: “Positive [test] results are indicative of active infection with 2019-nCoV but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.”  2. These are the actual words of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and the Chapter of Infectious Disease Physicians, Academy of Medicine, Singapore, point no.5: https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf Microbiologic Data for Period of Infectivity and Viral RNA Shedding: ""It is important to note that viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus.""  So, what are testing centres actually testing and looking for besides SARS-CoV-2 virus?  A rhinovirus? An influenza virus? A dead cell? A coronavirus particle from past infection? An exosome? Alien contaminants? Unauthorised DNA harvesting?  This is the reason why majority of the people using this fraudulent PCR testing method will test positive again and again.  More fake science PCR testing will only escalate infectivity numbers creating fear and panic globally.  * https://youtu.be/xY8YHtJOanM Dr Stefan Lanka, biologist, virologist Viruses do not exist RT-PCR test and circular reasoning  It is interesting and extremely telling to note how fast BBC was to announce this damning verdict in 2015:  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31864218 while the appeals and two later verdicts, the last one in The German High Court in January 2017 where the measles skeptic WON FULL VICTORY and where the claimants were forced to pay all costs of the court-case, BBC so CONVENIENTLY IGNORED!   22.01.2017: Judges at the German Federal Supreme Court have CONFIRMED THAT THE MEASLES VIRUS DOES NOT EXIST, vindicating 'conspiracy theorists' who have said that no study has ever proven the existence of the virus.  The First Civil Senate of the BGH has confirmed the judgment by the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart (OLG) of the 16 February 2016. The sum of €100,000 which the biologist dr. Stefan Lanka had offered as a reward for scientific proof of the existence of the alleged measles virus does not have to be paid to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also was ORDERED TO BEAR ALL THE PROCEDURAL COSTS.  Five experts have been involved in the case and presented the results of scientific studies. All five experts, including Prof. Dr. Dr. Andreas Podbielski who had been appointed by the OLG Stuttgart as the preceding court, have consistently found that NONE of the six publications which have been introduced to the trial, contains scientific proof of the existence of the alleged measles virus. http://yournewswire.com/german-supreme-court-measles/  Is it strange that the commercial media is loosing credibility? Can BBC unjustly defame biologist dr. Stefan Lanka without any consequences?  * https://youtu.be/PWmRj1WWrSQ Dr Stefan Lanka  Measles Virus On Trial ","Aug 7, 2020"

They may not wear proper mask, social distance, practice hygiene in their country. So high chance of getting infected. And we blindly allow them in.  SHN is not the solution. Families of SHN in close contact and high chance of getting infection. Best part, they are out and about infecting others. There is no control nor prevention.  Our covid task force incompetent. Too slow and ineffective in preventing import cases.  After Aug 10, i can almost guarantee we will be out of control. For sure ! Unless we pre-test before allow them to fly to SG. Train SQ staff to do testing at all major airports. Its a lot cheaper than import rubbish & clear on home ground. Have flexible flights arrangement, and insurance to cover cost in event fail covid test.  If covid pre-flight-test is incorporated in SQ flights, many people will want & feel safer to fly SQ.

The pathogen and the disease it causes are modeled largely on SARS, but it is more transmissible in the community setting by people with mild symptoms.  The disease starts in pig farms in Brazil, quietly and slowly at first, but then it starts to spread more rapidly in healthcare settings. When it starts to spread efficiently from person to person in the low-income, densely packed neighborhoods of some of the megacities in South America, the epidemic explodes. It is first exported by air travel to Portugal, the United States, and China and then to many other countries. Although at first some countries are able to control it, it continues to spread and be reintroduced, and eventually no country can maintain control.  There is no possibility of a vaccine being available in the first year. There is a fictional antiviral drug that can help the sick but not significantly limit spread of the disease.  Since the whole human population is susceptible, during the initial months of the pandemic, the cumulative number of cases increases exponentially, doubling every week. And as the cases and deaths accumulate, the economic and societal consequences become increasingly severe.  The scenario ends at the 18-month point, with 65 million deaths. The pandemic is beginning to slow due to the decreasing number of susceptible people. The pandemic will continue at some rate until there is an effective vaccine or until 80-90 % of the global population has been exposed. From that point on, it is likely to be an endemic childhood disease.","Jul 22, 2020"

The real science is to test only the sick to look for the infectious pathogen and come up with therapeutics to eradicate the pathogen.  With medical truth, we can end this political agenda driven fake science pandemic!  COVID-19 pandemic is to promote vaccine mandate and to advance political agendas for power, profit and control:  1. Prolong the COVID-19 pandemic with fake science preventive measures to prevent people from getting infected to build natural immunity towards the virus, create bogus tests and reports to censor medical truth, and destroy global economy with more citizen debt—WITH FAKE SCIENCE  2. Create global fear and panic with PCR testing of up to 80% or more false positive results to escalate infectivity numbers and suppress dissent—WITH FAKE PROBLEMS  3. Using fake science model of ""flattening the curve"" lockdowns and social distancing to prolong the pandemic and wait for ""one size fits all"" pharma drugs/vaccines that will never work—WITH FAKE SOLUTIONS  4. Push one world totalitarian state government—TO MANDATE POLICIES for power, profit and control  FAKE SCIENCE + FAKE PROBLEMS + FAKE SOLUTIONS = MANDATE POLICIES  ""TEST, TEST, TEST !"" MANTRA ARE DRIVEN BY THE CORRUPTED WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IN CAHOOTS WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY, WORLDWIDE GOVERNMENT, BIG PHARMA, MONOPOLISED MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND BIG FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS TO PUSH FAKE SCIENCE—TO CREATE FEAR AND PANIC—TO ADVANCE POLITICAL AGENDAS !","Jul 17, 2020"

Our country hired them to come and work for us, taking jobs that usually filtered by our own kinds. They need that pathetic salary and they took care of jobs we loathed. Is it a fair statement to chase them away when they are sick in our countries, and while they also worked their arse off but we complained about them anyway. Your frustration lies with “Why ain’t the management finally become effective? Why were they so wishy washy about taking preventives during the start of this situation. Why do they only panicked and act fast after losing control? Why do they forced stop circuit breaker, despite still reporting 150+ NEW cases daily”,  and not at patients who are already struggling.

The company that someone I know (let's call him John) works for has some rather serious violations to the COVID19 safety regulations, and John is very tempted to report those violations to the authorities in the interests of himself, his colleages (close to thousands work in the same compound), and the greater community that is Singapore (because many of these workers are still free to move around regularly and not isolated).  However, John is apprehensive that he will suffer repurcussions as there are contractual rules that forbid him from leaking infomation about the company (although not specific to COVID safety), and also he is worried that the workers will loose their job if the company gets a stop work order or some other serious penalty.  What should he do to protect their lives and livelihood? ","Jul 2, 2020"

Whether thre is election or not we hve to follow rules fr our own good. We are still queing at markets, shopping ctres, hawker ctrs, at smrt & bus berth.  Then why cannot que at election booth.  If PAP has not been truthful in their representations we wld hve been in the streets without proper housing, education & healthcare system etc.   This is not done by the opps who always make promises but in vain. Singaporeans Ask yourself who can turn arround the economy Who has greater influence with the world Who is gg to create job fr us.  Who is providing the best living standard fr us The opps.  No never PAP alone not only past 50 yrs did will  cont to do it. I saw a video in utube one of the opps party candidate talking about race.  Ask yoursel they cld not think of how to handle covid 19 crisis, unemployment  issues ,healthcare needs but trigger racism.  Let me tell u this they cannot devide us. We are for the PAP We singaporeans are & will never be racialist.  Who is slendering opps or PAP Opps - wake up your idea Only weak party uses race dreaming to win votes SG stay united Vote wisely 💪💪💕💕","Jul 2, 2020"

PAP will continue to have the mandate to run Singapore but it cannot run from causing more damage to the virus situation in Singapore ! Just by reducing the covid test is not proof for Low rates ! Spread in community has begun since January , otherwise workers will not be infected Nor Mustafa will be infected ! So let us not fake it! Or we wall end up like liars and cheats!

1.01583E+16,Bert Tan,"Face masks can block a virus is fake science—science is about truth!  Our natural God-given immune system can stop an infection and build immunity towards the pathogen is the real science!  Real Science With Scientific Evidence: Aerosolised viruses that are converted into colloidal suspensions in air are super lightweight tiny nanometres in size particles that can remain airborne for many hours and can spread up to 21 kilometres like pollen—viruses can also remain active on cardboard paper in a dark setting away from UV light for many days.  It interprets into that super lightweight and super tiny zoonotic coronaviruses can stick to all parts of our body and material surfaces, floats on air, floats on water, etc, for many hours or even days—can enter into human/animal mucous membranes (mouth, nose, eyes, cuts and wounds) to replicate/spread with or without the fake science preventive measures of face masks, social distancing, contact tracing, etc..  Public health advisory in cahoots with monopolised mainstream media—using fake science for repeated media broadcasts to spread panic and fear—are brainwashing and making us fools into believing that: The virus cannot go further than 1-2 metres with fake models of social distancing and other preventive measures; Sitting down having meals without masks is safe but people standing beside you must wear masks; Cyclists, joggers, etc, are safe without masks but unsafe for people walking on the streets without masks...blah-blah blah-blah...but failed to mention about boosting our immune health.  * https://youtu.be/pTA5ndbXaFI Do face masks stop the spread of coronavirus? Scientists at Edinburgh University investigate  There is no scientific evidence wearing cloth or surgical face masks can block a virus that is 10-100 times smaller than the smallest bacteria.  An average face mask uses a 16 gauge mesh and has a pore size of 1.29 millimetres.  An average size of a virus is 250 nanometres (1 billionth nanometres = 1 metre).  How can we catch mosquitoes with a trawl net?  * https://youtu.be/x5R8oCRYC5I Health Expert Discusses Face Masks Amid Coronavirus Outbreak  To mask or not to mask is a personal preference and shouldn't be made mandatory with a fine.  Real Scientific Epidemiological, Immunological And Systems Biology Engineering Models: Just like any other seasonal respiratory outbreak, the scientific model is to let healthy individuals mingle around—with special attention given to the vulnerable group—and build natural immunity towards the virus.  99.8% of healthy individuals will have no to little flu symptoms and can handle the respiratory infection.  Government must apply systems approach to modern science and put taxpayer's hard-earned money into good use.  Revamp the whole outdated wartime cardboard medical establishment models with real systems biology engineering.  If we were to have real systems biology engineers—not outdated wartime cardboard medical models and politician with zero medical science knowledge become public health minister—we would not be in a fake science pandemic destroying economy and lives.  Immune System: The 2-box innate and adaptive understanding of our immune system is outdated wartime medical science which only studies the body in parts, and should not be taught and applied in all medical establishments with immediate effect.  Modern Systems Biology Engineering Science discovered that we have a much more complex immune system working as a whole, not in parts, which consists of the innate system, interferon system, microbiome system, neural system and adaptive system.  * https://youtu.be/yYQ0lwzFgu8 MIT PhD Dr Shiva Ayyadurai Explains the Reality of the Modern Immune System  A harmless virus or pathogen does not kill, it is a weakened immune system that leads to an overreacted immune response to attack back, triggering a cytokine storm in the sick patient's body is the cause of death.  Our natural God-given immune defence system can turn on and off to make antibodies after recovering from an infection to build immunity towards the virus for protection from the whole natural process of an infection.  Therefore, boosting the human immune system is the real science.  Testing Fraud: The real proven scientific model is to test only the sick to look for the infectious pathogen and come up with therapeutics to eradicate the pathogen, and not by testing asymptomatic/healthy individuals.  * https://youtu.be/BiaQb7LqwRg Proof that asymptomatic carriers do not and cannot spread the virus or infect others plus how life-threatening facemasks wearing is  * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219423/ A study on infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers  More fake science inaccurate PCR testing on healthy individuals with up to 80% of false positive results will only escalate infectivity numbers on statistics and data putting more fear and panic to the public.  Noticed the high escalated infectivity rate with more fake science testing on healthy individuals but the seasonal mortality rates remains the same?  * https://youtu.be/i9sD8g_tSXI CDC report confirms COVID-19 fatality rate similar to seasonal flu  Even the inventor of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) Dr. Kary Mullis, PhD Biochemist, Winner, 1993 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, states that PCR machine cannot be used as a gold standard test to distinguish an infectious (harmful) viral particle versus a non-infectious (harmless) viral particle, as the rest simply detects any viral component even a dead cell or an exosome—unless it is for illegal DNA harvesting.  See point no.5: * https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf Microbiologic Data for Period of Infectivity and Viral RNA Shedding  The Fake Science: Fake science Tedros at the corrupted World Health Organization has zero idea of the definition of ""evidence"".  * https://t.co/b3NvzCyerL?amp=1 WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 5 June 2020  There is nothing called ""evolving evidence"", that means he has no evidence.  The definition of evidence according to real science, is unambiguous predictions.  If there is ambiguity, it is not evidence.  Summary: If public health ministries are serious about real health for the people, tell us why you say nothing about boosting the immune system?!  No big profit to be made promoting the human immune system?!  The corrupted World Health Organization in cahoots with worldwide government, monopolised mainstream media and financial corporations are pushing fake science to create fear and panic to advance political agendas:  1. Destroy global economy with fake science 2. Create global fear, panic and suppress dissent with fake problems 3. Create more citizen debt with fake solutions 4.

Revamp the whole outdated war time cardboard medical model establishment with real systems biology engineering.  A harmless virus or pathogen is not killing the patient, it is a weakened immune system that leads to an overreacted immune response that attacks back triggering a cytokine storm in the patient's body is the cause of death.  * https://youtu.be/i9sD8g_tSXI CDC report confirms COVID-19 fatality rate similar to seasonal flu  * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172861/ Intravenous vitamin C for reduction of cytokines storm in acute respiratory distress syndrome  * https://youtu.be/2S_eyQqXRSI German New Medicine: Virus Mania, Truth about Infectious Disease | Caroline Markolin PhD  Public health advisory should be doing nationwide checks on individual's vitamin D levels—98.9% of Covid patients defined as vitamin D deficient (below 20ng/ml) died—and not useless inaccurate RT-PCR testing with up to 80% false positive results.  More inaccurate testing will only escalate infectivity numbers on statistics and data putting more fear on the people.  Even the inventor of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) Dr. Kary Mullis, PhD Biochemist, Winner, 1993 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, stated that PCR cannot be use to identify a virus, an exosome or a particle.  Public health advisory should be educating the nation about the importance of boosting the immune system by eating healthy, getting involved in more outdoor sports and recreational activities with plenty of natural sunlight to replenish vitamin D—rather than waiting for 3rd generation pathogen DNA (plasmids) genetically engineered specific antigens vaccines for over 30 subtypes of coronaviruses that will never work, and can lead to viral and DNA interferences creating more injuries and deaths.  3rd generation DNA vaccines is like taking an old vintage car's 3 speed manual transmission (our God-given immune system) and installing a modem 6 speed automatic transmission (DNA/RNA vaccines) which only look good on paper theory, but will breakdown with over-stressing the other parts of the whole car's system on practical use.  99% of healthy individuals can turn on and off their natural defence system mechanism to make antibodies after recovering from an infection to build immunity towards the virus for protection from the whole natural process of an infection.

My personal experience - several attempts - had a wisdom tooth bridge of more than 10 years, fell off. Visited several dentists, after consultation,  paid for consultation fees. In the Medisave guidelines, it says Medisave can be used for wisdom tooth treatments. Had 1 set of 3 tooths bridge, cost came up to between $4800 to $5200, Medisave usage guidelines, $950 per tooth. Extract herewith from Medisave website - You can use MediSave to pay for your dental implant insertion or removal as long as it is a surgical procedure.  For a dental surgery with insertion or removal of dental implants, you can use MediSave to pay for your dental implants, up to the following limits:  Insertion of Dental Implants  Number of implant(s) inserted x $950 Operation limit of Table 2C  Removal of Dental Implants  Number of implant(s) removed x $450 Operation limit of Table 1C  For example, if you have to insert two dental implants, you can use up to $1,900 (2 x $950) for payment of your dental implants. After most of consultation,  most advice, deductions only $950, & not $950 X 3. Extras will be consultation fees in cash, xrays treatments also paid separately in cash. Authorities should have those guidelines lay out clearly for usage. Most seniors like me, do not have high paid income, are we being exploit here for our stupidity? Thank you","Jun 17, 2020"

1.01582E+16,Bert Tan,"HIGH INFECTIVITY WITH LOW MORTALITY IS GOOD NEWS  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNDERSTANDING HOW OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM OPERATE Everyone’s immune system is different but, as a general rule, as we expose to more pathogens, we develop more immunity.  Once an antibody has been produced, a copy remains in the body so that if the same antigen appears again, it can fight off more quickly.  That is why with some diseases, such as chickenpox, you only get it once as the body has a chickenpox antibody stored, ready and waiting to destroy it next time it arrives.  This is called immunity.  There are three types of immunity in humans called innate, adaptive, and passive:  Innate immunity: We are all born with some level of immunity to invaders. Human immune systems, similarly to those of many animals, will attack foreign invaders from day one. This innate immunity includes the external barriers of our body—the first line of defense against pathogens—such as the skin and mucous membranes of the throat and gut. This response is more general and non-specific. If the pathogen manages to dodge the innate immune system, adaptive or acquired immunity kicks in.  Adaptive (acquired) immunity: This protect from pathogens develops as we go through life. As we are exposed to diseases or get vaccinated, we build up a library of antibodies to different pathogens. This is sometimes referred to as immunological memory because our immune system remembers previous enemies.  Passive immunity: This type of immunity is “borrowed” from another source, but it does not last indefinitely. For instance, a baby receives antibodies from the mother through the placenta before birth and in breast milk following birth. This passive immunity protects the baby from some infections during the early years of their life.  SUMMARY The immune system is incredibly complicated and utterly vital for our survival. Several different systems and cell types work in perfect synchrony (most of the time) throughout the body to fight off pathogens and clear up dead cells.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  PROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS Getting everyone infected during a virus outbreak to build immunity towards the virus—with special attention given to the vulnerable group—is the proven epidemiological and scientific model approach.  Majority of healthy individuals with a strong immune system can handle the virus with little to no symptoms or mortality.  That is why I mentioned high infectivity with low mortality is good news.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNPROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS Majority of countries i.e., Taiwan, Vietnam, etc., applied the unproven epidemiological and scientific approach by stopping their people from getting infected to build immunity towards the virus—with strict unproven lockdowns, wearing masks, social distancing and isolation, etc.—and waiting for the virus to die off is a risky unproven approach that will only prolong the pandemic leading to a 2nd wave.  The low infectivity and low mortality rate by applying the unproven epidemiological and scientific model will only look good on statistics and data.  What will happen in 3-6 months or a year from now if another coronavirus starts circulating again—and their people do not have immunity towards the virus?

1.01582E+16,Bert Tan,"HIGH INFECTIVITY WITH LOW MORTALITY IS GOOD NEWS  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNDERSTANDING HOW OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM OPERATE  Everyone’s immune system is different but, as a general rule, as we expose to more pathogens, we develop more immunity.  Once an antibody has been produced, a copy remains in the body so that if the same antigen appears again, it can fight off more quickly.  That is why with some diseases, such as chickenpox, you only get it once as the body has a chickenpox antibody stored, ready and waiting to destroy it next time it arrives.  This is called immunity.  There are three types of immunity in humans called innate, adaptive, and passive:  Innate immunity: We are all born with some level of immunity to invaders. Human immune systems, similarly to those of many animals, will attack foreign invaders from day one. This innate immunity includes the external barriers of our body—the first line of defense against pathogens—such as the skin and mucous membranes of the throat and gut. This response is more general and non-specific. If the pathogen manages to dodge the innate immune system, adaptive or acquired immunity kicks in.  Adaptive (acquired) immunity: This protect from pathogens develops as we go through life. As we are exposed to diseases or get vaccinated, we build up a library of antibodies to different pathogens. This is sometimes referred to as immunological memory because our immune system remembers previous enemies.  Passive immunity: This type of immunity is “borrowed” from another source, but it does not last indefinitely. For instance, a baby receives antibodies from the mother through the placenta before birth and in breast milk following birth. This passive immunity protects the baby from some infections during the early years of their life.  SUMMARY  The immune system is incredibly complicated and utterly vital for our survival. Several different systems and cell types work in perfect synchrony (most of the time) throughout the body to fight off pathogens and clear up dead cells.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  PROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS  Getting everyone infected during a virus outbreak to build immunity towards the pathogen—with special attention given to the vulnerable group—is the proven epidemiological and scientific model approach.  Majority of healthy individuals with a strong immune system can handle the virus with little to no symptoms or mortality.  That is why I mentioned high infectivity with low mortality is good news.  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  UNPROVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO PANDEMICS  Countries like Taiwan, Vietnam, etc., applied the unproven epidemiological and scientific approach by stopping their people from getting infected to build immunity towards the pathogen—with strict unproven lockdowns, wearing masks, social distancing and isolation, etc.—is a risky unproven approach.  The low infectivity and low mortality rate by applying the unproven epidemiological and scientific model, will only look good on statistics.  What will happen in 3-6 months or a year from now if another coronavirus starts circulating again—and their people do not have immunity towards the virus?  Start locking and shutting down the whole country again?  Bankrupting the people, the government and the whole country?","Jun 14, 2020"

He is trying very hard to find alternatives for accommodation to this group of workers but to no avail till now. He has called up Mom for help but they gave him a time frame to move them. He has run out of resources and urgently need help before he cross with the rules imposed by the authority.

1.01581E+16,Macaw Mink,"On what basis is the CB allowed to be lifted so soon? Doesn't it seem to contradict what the Multi-Min Task Force said earlier, about lifting the CB when certain criteria have been met. Have the criteria been met yet? There should also not be any opening of borders and any easing of travel restrictions at all, until the country's infection cases are cleared, otherwise there will be even more waves of uncontrollable infections. We do not know the true numbers of asymptomatic carriers in the community as there isn't mass testing. Shouldn't there be greater protection for the people, on top of the usual strict regulations in place? MOH should quickly arrange for everyone who is returning to the workplace or school to be tested and declared negative first.   Would using the test kits to check and give assurance to the citizens who live outside the dorms be considered a waste? What then, is the purpose of dedicating funds and expertise to producing the kits, if they can't be used by the people of Singapore? If it's because of costs, perhaps there could be tiered subsidies with highest priority for Singapore citizens, followed by permanent residents, etc. We all know that the economy needs to be saved, but please don't keep using our citizens especially the children as guinea pigs to test the effectiveness of the Circuit Breaker's ease. Who is prepared to be accountable for the consequences? Please do plan for long-term and not short term mere economic benefits.  Productive adults can return to their workplace, provided they are healthy and tested negative to kick-start the economy again. The children, youth who are still schooling can return later, after testing with priority given to the graduating cohorts. Too date, many of the fatalities appear to be older, frail senior citizens.  It is heart-wrenching for their loved ones left behind.  We really do not wish to see any young child or person being added to the fatality list, or have his or her health compromised for the rest of his or her life. Every citizen is a human, not a mere digit.","May 22, 2020"

In the midst of so many things, the dreams of countless travelers like me are written day after day on this small island.  The hard work of the day ends in an instant with the magnificent beauty of the city at night. Priyadarshini There is never any lack of beauty in this city.  But today this city has come to a standstill.  The commotion of the city is covered by an unknown enemy.  COVID 19 is sitting on the chest of the city in an unexpected way.  Today I have been under house arrest for about 1 month just to protect myself and the city.  In the meantime, the ""enchanted form"" of the city has been revived by many.  I have been thinking for so long, ""Maya"" in this city of bricks and stones is just in my mind.  But this epidemic shattered my thoughts.  This city seems to have existed far above humanity.  They are continuing to treat the increasing number of victims at a rocket speed without interruption.  And providing food and capital like your own child.  Which is rare in any other country in the world.  Epidemics, dangers, hurricanes, will come and go.  Countless travelers like me will constantly travel to this small island.  But in this enchanted form there should be no defect of respect towards this city.  Hundreds of sorrows and happiness will be in love with this ""beloved"".

I have been thinking for so long, ""Maya"" in this city of bricks and stones is just in my mind.  But this epidemic shattered my thoughts.  This city seems to have existed far above humanity.  They are continuing to treat the increasing number of victims at a rocket speed without interruption.  And providing food and capital like your own child.  Which is rare in any other country in the world.  Epidemics, dangers, hurricanes, will come and go.  Countless travelers like me will constantly travel to this small island.

PERSISTENT ANTIBODIES (PRODUCED BY FLU VACCINES TAKEN IN PREVIOUS YEARS) CONTINUE TO BE PRODUCED BY THE IMMUNE SYSTEM FOR YEARS AND SEVERELY AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE NOVEL ANTIBODIES THAT RECOGNISE UNIQUE MOLECULAR FEATURES OF A NEW SEASONAL STRAIN; IN THE CASE OF A LAB MADE SPLICED VIRUS LIKE SARS-COV-2, THIS CAN KILL YOU.  TEST-NEGATIVE STUDY DESIGNS ARE OFTEN UTILISED TO CALCULATE INFLUENZA VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS. THE VIRUS INTERFERENCE PHENOMENON GOES AGAINST THE BASIC ASSUMPTION OF THE TEST-NEGATIVE VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS STUDY THAT VACCINATION DOES NOT CHANGE THE RISK OF INFECTION WITH OTHER RESPIRATORY ILLNESS, THUS POTENTIALLY BIASING VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS RESULTS IN THE POSITIVE DIRECTION. THE INFLUENZA VACCINE TEACHES THE BODY TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES AGAINST THE HEAD OF THE VIRUS'S SURFACE PROTEIN, HEMAGGLUTININ (HA). THOSE ANTIBODIES IDEALLY PREVENT HA FROM ATTACHING TO CELLULAR RECEPTORS, THWARTING INFECTION. BUT HA'S HEAD IS HIGHLY MUTABLE, WHICH IS WHY VACCINE-MAKERS MUST COME UP WITH A NEW FORMULA EVERY YEAR.  THEY CANNOT DO THIS...  IT IS A BLOODY LIE !  VACCINES EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN EXAGGERATED BY BRIBED DOCTORS AND THOSE WHO WENT FOR SEXUAL JAUNTS TO BANGKOK (BLACK MAIL / HIDDEN CAM). WHEN CHALLENGED, THESE CRIMINAL DOCTORS BAFFLE WITH BULLSHIT LIKE USING TECHNICAL JARGON: OH IT WAS DUE TO “ESCAPE MUTANTS"" OR “ANTIGENIC DRIFT”...  BLAH FUCKIN’ BLAH !  CONVENTIONAL VACCINES ARE ONLY EFFECTIVE FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME DUE TO THE PROPENSITY OF INFLUENZA VIRUSES TO UNDERGO ANTIGENIC DRIFT AND ANTIGENIC SHIFT. THE EFFICACY OF THESE FLU VACCINES IS UNCERTAIN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR DUE TO POTENTIAL MISMATCH BETWEEN THE CIRCULATING VIRUSES AND VACCINE STRAINS, AND MUTATIONS ARISING DUE TO EGG ADAPTATION. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE INABILITY TO STORE THESE VACCINES LONG-TERM AND VACCINE SHORTAGES ARE CHALLENGES THAT ARE OVERCOME BY CHANGING THE LABELS AND EXPIRY DATES AND EXPORTING THEM TO NATIONS WHERE THE RULING PARTY TAKES MASSIVE POLITICAL DONATIONS FROM KOSHER EVIL PHARMA. THE LEADER OF THE NATION WILL ALSO BE BESTOWED KOSHER TITLE LIKES “CHAMPION OF EARTH”, ETC.. RAPID INFLUENZA VIRUS EVOLUTION AND YEARLY VACCINE REFORMULATIONS MAKE THE STOCKPILING OF VACCINES FOR FUTURE USE AN IMPOSSIBLE ISSUE.  BUT WITH DEEP STATE PAYROLL POLITICIANS AND JUDGES, EVERY THING IS SO MANAGEABLE WITH SOME NUDGING FROM BILL FUCKIN’ GATES AND PRINCE FUCKIN’ CHARLES WHO ARE SO FOND OF POOR INDIANS. THIS EVIL DUO GOES TO INDIA AND TREATS PUNE SERUM INSTITUTE LIKE TAJ MAHAL.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMTl3gU0mFc  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8c87p0xI9Q  VACCINE DERIVED VIRUS INTERFERENCE IS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CORONAVIRUS.  ANNUAL FLU SHOTS INCREASE THE RISK OF ILLNESS FROM NON-INFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTIONS SUCH AS RHINOVIRUSES, CORONAVIRUSES, RS VIRUSES, PARAINFLUENZA VIRUSES, ADENOVIRUSES, HMP VIRUSES AND ENTEROVIRUSES.","May 3, 2020"

But how would the elderly residents be tested? Bring them to hospitals.for swab test? That is a BAD idea, esp so.when hospitals are places where virus exposure and infection are the highest. Could the residents and nursing staff.of ALL nursing homes in Singapore be screened within the Home facility? Or medical staff (screened and confirm virus-free before they are despatched to nursing Home)to carry out the swab test at nursing homes premises. This is to.ensure.that NO new.infection cluster would be created under such exercise.

He cannot understand why I cannot visit him. He must be thinking that I dont want to visit anymore. Since the accident I never fail to visit him. Everyday I will go and tell him how much I love him and everything will be fine. He was getting better. But now it had been more than one month I want to visit him.

After a week I followed up, HPB said I was not shortlisted. I forwarded email from MOH and SG Healthcare Corps which indicates I have been selected and I have undergone training.

1.0158E+16,David Koh,"Hope MOH is analysing the daily data ( even though it has not shared any of it with the public)  1. Indoor such as dorm situation (fan is normally used, I assumed) 2. Indoor (mall) : aircon.  3. Outdoor: a lot of feedback on the risk of exercising without mask. But no answer from MOH.  My concerns:  1. Indoor: fan vs aircon: is there any trends. I asked this question is because Covid 19 virus is very small (~0.1 micron in size and very light). So the chances of airborne is great and with the assistance of fan, it will be airborne longer and further vs aircon environment.  2. Outdoor vs indoor: a. It was reported that Covid 19 virus cannot survive high temperature of more than ~ 30 degree C. b. With Outdoor environment, the virus can be spread out very quickly and vanished into the atmosphere, therefore reducing the risk of infection. If so, MOH such come out to verify this so as to address the concerns of not wearing mask during exercise.  Understand it is everybody effort to implement the CB.

Hence the reason why social distancing is so important, which eventually led to compulsory wearing of masks. Most of the local community cases, are based on a cluster, be it a meeting, gathering, party, family home, of which, has a high potential of passing the virus on to another. Though there may have been some who got it from unknown sources, majority were in close contact for a duration of time. The measures put out by the Task Force, concentrates on mitigating this primary area of risk. Now with enforcement, it slowly brings the numbers down. However it shouldn't come to such enforcement's if social distancing, something which was emphasized upon early, was adhered to. Thankfully, many Singaporeans have followed and unselfishly made sacrifices during this period. FW Dorms are locked in and may increase in numbers these next few days, but will taper off eventually. Local community cases are important as the need to establish no further cases, will allow much of the restrictions to be lifted. We are getting there and lets not worry about numbers. The objective is to starve the Virus from infecting others. ","Apr 22, 2020"

1.0158E+16,Kai Xian,"I propose for the Ministry of Healthy and relevant agencies to impose a shutdown of food delivery platforms such as Grab, FoodPanda, Deliveroo etc, to prevent new clusters of Covid-19 transmission and the spread of the virus.  It has been evident in the past two weeks of 'Circuit Breaker' that delivery riders have faced tremendous pressure in their job of delivering F&B to customers at home. Shortly after the announcement of tightening and restriction of what is deemed to be “essential”, a number of videos have circulated on the internet which displayed the rowdy behaviour of delivery riders and F&B workers. Some of the commotion between the riders and stores resulted in close contact of these persons in their individual bids to put their point across.  Such behaviour is fairly understandable- likely due to the pressures of increased orders and lacklustre management of orders. These delivery riders on the ground are helpless except to do their utmost to fulfil their daily orders. The delivery platforms have also been purported to be almost impossible for delivery riders to cancel orders in view of unforeseen circumstances such as long waiting times or out-of-stock items. These inadvertently culminate into displays of frustrations, jostling, and hurling of insults or abuses. It has also been evident many F&B locations are ironically, the ground of close gathering of delivery riders who have almost no option to practice safe-distancing at these crowded venues. The mood of Singaporeans from all walks of life is expected to run high through the Circuit Breaker period, and occurences of these disputes are most likely to increase.  One cannot be certain that all delivery riders or F&B outlets are Covid-free. It would take just one infected individual in the nucleus to spread devastating consequences deep into the homes of families waiting for their orders. The measures at wet markets and supermarkets are quite effective in allowing families to purchase groceries. Food establishments also remain open and people should have little difficulty to get food and drinks for consumption. It is timely that the Ministry consider a shutdown of the delivery platforms to minimise potential outbreak of the virus within the community.","Apr 22, 2020"

Only human being can think deeply and act wisely. So, the virus is spreading very fast and therefore this is high time for us to think deeply and act wisely. In fact, the virus or death doesn't care which religion, nationality, race and political party we belong to. The virus and death only care about whether we are living being or not. Since it is so, at least now, we must stop discrimination according to our own religion, political party, race or nationality. Just we must stand up as a wise Human being without discrimination to fight against the virus. By now, our main priority must be to stop spreading and transmission of the virus. However, we can see still people look forward and go out to eat McDonald, KFC, Pizza hut and Starbucks. If we do so, it is better to get ready for our funeral. This is not time for having fun or pleasing our tongue. This is not time for us to live to eat, but eat to live. So, just we need to be satisfied with what we have. There may be only one meal per day, but still we can survive by eating something. If we can't tolerate and be patient with it, we will have to suffer a lot and even leave everything. To overcome the current epidemic, we must let our conceit and egoistic ideas go and we must have a good listening skill. It is clear that we are not experts in medical treatments. That is why we must obey and follow the instructions of the doctors' and healthcare staffs. No matter how much power, money and material things we have, no one can use or no way to use those things at the moment. So, let's be united as humans and let's do our part properly. Let's fulfill our own duties and responsibilities towards the society and let's try our best to help our own government, army forces and healthcare staffs to stop the virus and to see a peaceful future.   May each and everyone be wise and have insight to act as humans without any discrimination and without any egoistic and selfish thought. May the humanity arise against the virus and may the whole world be free from the virus, its cause, its danger, its fear, its worry and its suffering. May all each and everyone and every being be protected by the Blessings of all kind hearted people's Loving-kindness and Compassionate thoughts....!","Apr 22, 2020"

CRIPPLING THE ECONOMY CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 PANDEMIC AGENDA IS ALL ABOUT ! ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• MONOPOLISED MAINSTREAM MEDIA WILL NEVER TELL YOU ALL THIS AND ARE CENSORING TRUTH !  WHY ARE HEALTHCARE MEDICINES / HOSPITALS / TREATMENTS / ETC., SO FXXKING EXPENSIVE ??  WHY ARE WE FALLING SICK SO OFTEN ??  WHY ARE HEALTH ORGANISATIONS / WORLD GOVERNMENTS PUSHING TOXIC CHEMICAL LADEN MANDATORY VACCINATION ??  WHAT IS THE REAL REASON BEHIND COVID-19 PANDEMIC FEAR MONGERING ??  https://youtu.be/ndy76mJHD6o https://youtu.be/5I46oFxp5L0 LISTEN TO TRUTH, FREEDOM AND HEALTH BY DR PhD SHIVA AYYADURAI TO FIND OUT WHY !!  When you get a flu vaccine, you have two options:  1. Inactivated influenza vaccines contain flu viruses that have been killed so they can’t cause the flu.  2. Live influenza vaccine (LAIV or FluMist) nasal spray contains a live, but weakened form of the virus.  Here are some of the ingredients you’ll find in the flu vaccine:  Egg protein Many flu vaccines are made by growing the viruses inside fertilised chicken eggs. This means that they contain a small amount of egg protein. A newer version of the vaccine, called Flucelvax, is grown in animal cells instead.  Preservatives Vaccine manufacturers add the preservative thimerosal to multidose vaccine vials. Thimerosal prevents dangerous bacteria and fungi from getting into the vial with each use. Thimerosal contains mercury, which can be toxic in large doses. There isn’t enough evidence to show the small amount contained in the flu vaccine is dangerous. But if you’re concerned, thimerosal-free versions of the flu vaccine are available.  Stabilisers Sucrose, sorbitol, and monosodium glutamate (MSG) are used to keep vaccines stable. They prevent vaccines from losing potency, even when exposed to heat and light. Sucrose is the same table sugar you spoon into coffee and sprinkle on berries. Sorbitol is an artificial sweetener that’s also found in chewing gum. MSG is a flavor enhancer. Commonly thought of as an additive in Chinese food, it’s used in many processed foods. Though certain people are sensitive to MSG, the amount found in the flu vaccine is very small.  Antibiotics Neomycin, gentamicin, and other antibiotics are added to vaccines in very small amounts. They stop bacteria from contaminating the vaccine.  Polysorbate 80 This emulsifier prevents sauces and salad dressings from separating. In vaccines, polysorbate 80 keeps all the ingredients evenly distributed. Though large doses can cause some people to have reactions, the amount in the flu vaccine is very small.  Formaldehyde This natural compound is found in household products from glues and other adhesives to pressed-wood furniture. Formaldehyde is a gas that is soluble in water. It’s used in the flu vaccine to inactivate influenza virus. Routine exposure to large doses of formaldehyde is linked to eye and throat irritation, breathing trouble, and a higher risk for certain cancers.  (Above are just some of the basic Ingredients in a flu vaccine)  BELOW: NOW, LOOK AT THE LIES U.S. CDC TRIES TO PUSH MANDATORY VACCINATION USING THEIR OWN U.S. CDC TRUSTED SOURCE.  [ However, according to the CDC Trusted Source, most formaldehyde used in producing a vaccine undergoes removal from the vaccine solution before being packaged to be sent to doctors and pharmacies. Per the U.S. FDA, the level of formaldehyde that remains in a vaccine (such as the flu vaccine) is much lower than the amount that occurs naturally in the human body. The residual amount of formaldehyde used in vaccines “does not pose a safety concern,” and “there is no evidence linking cancer to infrequent exposure to tiny amounts of formaldehyde via injection as occurs with vaccines.” ]  FROM  https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/formaldehyde.html  BEFORE MANDATORY VACCINATION: U.S. CDC WROTE THAT FORMALDEHYDE IS FATAL AND CAN CAUSE ADVERSE REACTIONS TO HUMANS: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=216&tid=39  AFTER MANDATORY VACCINATION: U.S. CDC CLAIMS SMALL DOSES IS TOLERABLE TO HUMANS.

They cant even consult their dentist for tightening & such.  i have a teribbly bad decay tooth at the back of my teeth, now i'm only allowed to be treated when it hurts. so i must wait untill my teeth to hurt badly then i can visit the dental clinic?

1.0158E+16,Siva Rajoo,"Ministry of Health, Singapore  It’s a good idea to extend the CB measures and more important to close more workplaces especially in any companies where there were staff who had tested positive for  covid-19 cases and yet still continue to operate because they are essential services. So this is where you have look into first.    I hope many of the essential services that are allowed to continue operations should be also revised and reviewed and we should further cut back on movements.   For a start , there are so many essential services concentrated in Changi Airport and as a result a lot of staff movement which includes a significant number of work permit holders. So this is one area where we can scale down as airline frequency is quite Low. Can we consider having Changi airport to close for one month so that we also carry out necessary renovations and upgrade. Also it would enable the airport terminals to go for a complete deep cleaning. This is the best time to speed up any infrastructure upgrades when there is no pax movement .   Any flights in the meantime can be operated from Seletar airport if possible.  So we can still have freighter cargo flights operating.   We need to consider cutting down on essential services movement as much as possible. Let’s all hope our efforts bear positive results soon. Thank you sir.  #sgunited","Apr 21, 2020"

In fact, the virus or death doesn't care which religion, nationality, race and political party we belong to. The virus and death only care about whether we are living being or not. Since it is so, at least now, we must stop discrimination according to our own religion, political party, race or nationality. Just we must stand up as a wise Human being without discrimination to fight against the virus. By now, our main priority must be to stop spreading and transmission of the virus. However, we can see still people look forward and go out to eat McDonald, KFC, Pizza hut and Starbucks. If we do so, it is better to get ready for our funeral. This is not time for having fun or pleasing our tongue. This is not time for us to live to eat, but eat to live. So, just we need to be satisfied with what we have. There may be only one meal per day, but still we can survive by eating something. If we can't tolerate and be patient with it, we will have to suffer a lot and even leave everything. To overcome the current epidemic, we must let our conceit and egoistic ideas go and we must have a good listening skill. It is clear that we are not experts in medical treatments. That is why we must obey and follow the instructions of the doctors' and healthcare staffs. No matter how much power, money and material things we have, no one can use or no way to use those things at the moment. So, let's be united as humans and let's do our part properly. Let's fulfill our own duties and responsibilities towards the society and let's try our best to help our own government, army forces and healthcare staffs to stop the virus and to see a peaceful future.   May each and everyone be wise and have insight to act as humans without any discrimination and without any egoistic and selfish thought. May the humanity arise against the virus and may the whole world be free from the virus, its cause, its danger, its fear, its worry and its suffering. May all each and everyone and every being be protected by the Blessings of all kind hearted people's Loving-kindness and Compassionate thoughts....!","Apr 22, 2020"

There is no cover-up by the Government or MOH. MOH’s daily press releases publish information on all confirmed cases, including the number of imported cases, and the linked and unlinked cases at that point in time, even as contact tracing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

1.0158E+16,Bert Tan,"WHAT IS IN A FLU VACCINE ? •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  When you get a flu vaccine, you have two options:  1. Inactivated influenza vaccines contain flu viruses that have been killed so they can’t cause the flu.  2. Live influenza vaccine (LAIV or FluMist) nasal spray contains a live, but weakened form of the virus.  Here are some of the ingredients you’ll find in the flu vaccine:  Egg protein Many flu vaccines are made by growing the viruses inside fertilised chicken eggs. This means that they contain a small amount of egg protein. A newer version of the vaccine, called Flucelvax, is grown in animal cells instead.  Preservatives Vaccine manufacturers add the preservative thimerosal to multidose vaccine vials. Thimerosal prevents dangerous bacteria and fungi from getting into the vial with each use. Thimerosal contains mercury, which can be toxic in large doses. There isn’t enough evidence to show the small amount contained in the flu vaccine is dangerous. But if you’re concerned, thimerosal-free versions of the flu vaccine are available.  Stabilisers Sucrose, sorbitol, and monosodium glutamate (MSG) are used to keep vaccines stable. They prevent vaccines from losing potency, even when exposed to heat and light. Sucrose is the same table sugar you spoon into coffee and sprinkle on berries. Sorbitol is an artificial sweetener that’s also found in chewing gum. MSG is a flavor enhancer. Commonly thought of as an additive in Chinese food, it’s used in many processed foods. Though certain people are sensitive to MSG, the amount found in the flu vaccine is very small.  Antibiotics Neomycin, gentamicin, and other antibiotics are added to vaccines in very small amounts. They stop bacteria from contaminating the vaccine.  Polysorbate 80 This emulsifier prevents sauces and salad dressings from separating. In vaccines, polysorbate 80 keeps all the ingredients evenly distributed. Though large doses can cause some people to have reactions, the amount in the flu vaccine is very small.  Formaldehyde This natural compound is found in household products from glues and other adhesives to pressed-wood furniture. Formaldehyde is a gas that is soluble in water. It’s used in the flu vaccine to inactivate influenza virus. Routine exposure to large doses of formaldehyde is linked to eye and throat irritation, breathing trouble, and a higher risk for certain cancers.  BELOW: NOW, LOOK AT THE LIES U.S. CDC TRIES TO PUSH MANDATORY VACCINE USING THEIR OWN U.S. CDC TRUSTED SOURCE.  CUNTS !  However, according to the CDC Trusted Source, most formaldehyde used in producing a vaccine undergoes removal from the vaccine solution before being packaged to be sent to doctors and pharmacies.  Per the U.S. FDA, the level of formaldehyde that remains in a vaccine (such as the flu vaccine) is much lower than the amount that occurs naturally in the human body. The residual amount of formaldehyde used in vaccines “does not pose a safety concern,” and “there is no evidence linking cancer to infrequent exposure to tiny amounts of formaldehyde via injection as occurs with vaccines.”  FROM  https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/formaldehyde.html  BEFORE MANDATORY VACCINATION, U.S. CDC WROTE THAT FORMALDEHYDE IS FATAL AND CAUSE ADVERSE REACTIONS TO HUMANS: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=216&tid=39  AFTER MANDATORY VACCINATION, U.S. CDC CLAIMS SMALL DOSES IS TOLERABLE TO HUMANS.

I do it at a pace of 6kph, sometimes faster, in order to gain as much aerobic benefits as possible. This pace is even faster than some of the very slow joggers. The amount of air intake required at this level of exertion is no less than that for slow jog. Here's my question:  Will I be fined for doing my brisk walk without wearing the mask? I am now 68 and have a lower back problem, making it rather risky for me to jog. Owing to this, I have stopped jogging.

1.0158E+16,Spencer Lui,"Singapore Total Defence is a total failure. If there is a war happening, most of the people will be infected by the virus when they are hiding or gathering around inside the bomb shelter. I have been wondering why do Singapore Authority had issued the enforcement for everyone to have a one-meter distance away from each other but have not heard any news until a period times, you can now hear the news to advise for everyone should wear a mouth mask when going out dating, shopping and other things you like to do. The PAP government had withdrawn money from the reserve is to first help the SIA from collapsing but I had been waiting a long time before I can hear the news to help and prevent the healthcare workers from collapsing. I had heard the news about Ho Chin had ordered the ST Engineers mouth mask manufacture to relocation from Taiwan back to Singapore because never knew our precious mouth masks can't be allowed spending back home. And what had happened, Why do the PAP government have negligence to provide enough mouth masks in this pandemic time. In the Sars situation, why do the PAP government had not to gain any experiences? And why do the PAP politicians can tell people, they are the right people who will always do the right things? I believe the PAP government should have helped to equip the CleanSpace Technology half-mask for the healthcare workers or evenly provide the service for the outpatients in hospitals and polyclinics when the patients have to see the doctor consultants. In these ways, many people will very happy to have more chances to buy mouth masks to protect themselves or helped to prevent the virus from spreading out more easily to others. And I had mentioned many times if the pandemic has become bad to worse because of the PAP government advice for not to wear a mouth mask if you are not ill or have shown any symptoms. I hope the PAP government will have the courage to apologize for not be really helpful.     ","Apr 10, 2020"

Working from home meaning to perform full capacity as in office. There are endless meetings and discussions are held thru conf call/ video calls. 2. Home based learning + no child care, meaning a full time care giver/ parent needs to pay full attention to the kids' need at home at all time. 3. Family support, like help taking care of children and/or household tasks are not allowed.  There is no solution unless one of the working parent takes up a full-time parent/ care giver role during this time. So,  1. Please enforce the restriction at discretion; or 2.

These are the profile if sick will keep quiet n die die wont declare. After fever 4 days, will just keep it to themselves n continue to work... Coz they not living with their kids or elderly parents, nothing to lose for them.   Go outside touch bus handle, lift button, go hawker eat with their stainless spoon n fork, spread it all around.  U imagine if 100 of us singaporeans works as newspaper courier in new york city after conversion then earning like sgd9k per month (just example) ...  If we sick will we declare to those public health officials in nyc? Confirm got sent back we think, uprooted fem our job n life there... Fever 4 days then just keep quiet, keep working (n keep spreading)... Untill all 100 of us all fall sick together n raise alarm of the local health officials.   This model is what they (foreign workers) goes thru all over the world, in sg, malaysia, japan, korea, usa, etc.  The working girls with special pass sir, those r the sleeping clusters, if they recover frm the corona 5 day fever, u ask them now they wont tell u...

The longer you wait, the worse days come sooner, they are like moving virus; unless you test them all and isolate them all but virus spread out faster than what ppl can react. Besides , large people also easy cause riot if you put them in a building and frame them too long. What if turn out more than half of fw got infection in each dorm? The money paid to cure them maybe use to send them home is more practical. Each patient could spend SG up to 56 days hospital resources. Another thing is those workers are into daily life, driver, cleaner, gardener, food delivery, security, mover.... that means virus will easily be carried to condo, school, office.... if that happens so soon .. what can you do to protect kids and elders? You now move them into new housing home just create virus spread out more.

Hand sanitising before entering of any enclose area like supermarkets ,limiting numbers and giving fine to all who dosen't wear mask. Also to break up the foreigner into 5 catageory is prime piority now. Or else they will just keep cross contaminating.  Teaching them all proper precaution and hygiene measure ,and wearing mask at all times. Move them to bigger dormitories according to catageory, if available spaces are limited, consider renting cruise ships for isolation. A swap test to all foreigner worker is not needed as well, when they are asymtomatic or just caught the virus , it will just appear negative, the detection rate increases only after about 5-7days or when symptoms worsen.

Nevertheless, you allow all Childcare centre to open for those essential work parents to drop their children at the centre everyday.  May I know whether have you ever spare any thoughts for the teachers and educators who also have their seniors/parents/family/kids at home.  They are equally as good as the frontline healthcare personnel who also sacrifice during this pandemic.  It is very disappointed that you have neglected this group of “peanuts” pay childcare educators.  For heaven sake, since all the schools are closed why not also closed all the childcare centre too.  How many essential workers parents in each childcare centre that justify to remain open just to waste electricity, manpower and risk educators of getting virus while commuting to work.

How could the father bring their kids out to supermarket just to kill their kids by letting them getting free of charge coronavirus. I thought government already told all Singaporeans that old people and kids less than 18 years old must all stay at home to keep themselves safe from the coronavirus. But Singaporeans are doing exactly the opposite of what government has implemented. A lot of kids and old people are still going outside enjoying their life. Plus could you ask Ntuc and Sheng Siong to control the amount of people inside the supermarket? A bunch of people were queuing up and I was one of them queuing up in the middle. The man and the woman who was queuing up in front of me was still shopping while queuing up. Another old man saw the line got three metre gap immediately cut my queue. So I shouted at them like a crazy dog. It is not fair. You want to queue up or you want to shopping? The only way for Singapore government to stop the coronavirus epidemic is to ban people from using the toilets outside. All toilets must be closed at all times so that Singaporeans got no choice but to go home and use their own toilets. No point stopping this corona idiots and telling them what they are supposed to do and they just don't follow.,"Apr 8, 2020"

1.01579E+16,Alvyn Baron Xie,"The very fact they consist a small proportion against the entire population and yet yesterday have almost double the infected compared to singaporean locals means one thing. They have not observed and kept the hygiene standards and also not been observing any distancing measures.   The dormitory all allocated to them were almost new and good condition when they moved in. The fact there are cockroaches derive from littering and bad personal maintainence of their personal spaces.  In the Singapore army in BMT we have 10 men to a single bunk room and an entire company of 160 men using a single block. Yet with proper area cleaning we kept it spotless. Toilets are sparkling. On top of that as full time soldiers we had to fufil every single training obligation issued to us.  Instead of complaining about cockroaches and bad hygienic conditions....why not start area cleaning. They are getting a full months pay to do nothing. Spend the time wisely! Hundreds of Singaporeans too live in blocks and dine in local hawker centers with hundreds of people at any time.  My fear is if their girlfriends who may be FDWs go back home with their infection. The entire family she lives with will suffer. This will cause a massive infestation. I pray this day never comes.   I believe the govt policy to quarantine 20,000 is very sound. This is a preventative measure against a mass outbreak amongst millions of local Singaporeans who have stood by Singapore thick and thin and served the nation when she needed us. It’s understandable that many foreigners are here to enjoy the wealth, prosperity and jobs that we are blessed with. However consider the flip side of the coin....assuming there is a war....outbreak....or any disaster....will the very ones who flocked here for jobs stay with us and fight with us or will they be the first ones to board planes and ships out. It’s the sons of this land who will lose the most as we have families and friends here. As a son if this land without question I will fight for her as my love ones are here.

1.01579E+16,Siew Hong Alice,"MOH, thanks for this initiative to add more countries to dedicated quarantine center. Are these based on the countries showing high risk or because of recent local clusters that started from those returnee who breached the stay home notice at own residence? Just wondering if that’s the reason how the dormitory or construction clusters started ? If yes, then would this be better to impose dedicated quarantine center for all returnee from all countries for below consideration:  1. With the pandemic widely spread across the world (now 1199711 confirmed cases, fatality 64667 (5.39%)), we need stricter measure to requiring all returnee to dedicated quarantine center. This would helps to mitigate transmission risk when they breach SHN to go out, their family or housemate is at risk. Sometimes, they may have no choice to work for money, so there is still loophole to trigger cluster.   2. If only specific countries returnee are required to serve at quarantine center, does the other countries returnee go home by public transport like bus or MRT? This put other commuter at risk, many have feedback that’s it’s nearly impossible to impose 1m safe distancing in public transport. Although all have given reusable mask, but those just returned may not wear one.   3. Understood that quarantine center capacity might be an issue to house all returnee, can help to share the shortage (was it because of hotel operator choose not to participate?) and would there be short term quarantine Center being set up ?   4. Returnee of pass holder are required to obtain approval from MOM or ICA. How about the residents ? Would there be approval process so that the required dedicated quarantine center capacity can be arranged ?   In sum, while nationwide circuit breakers started to break the chain of transmission. We also need to step up stricter measures to cover all returnee. Thanks!  ","Apr 5, 2020"

At the moment , we must drill that mindset that even one case is one too many.   Thus , I had hoped the recently announced circuit breaker measures would have included a semi closure of air travel into Singapore for a period of time. We could have used this measure to stop the number of imported cases to zero , so that we could fully concentrate on bringing the number of local infections down.   I do hope the officials will consider also suspending all passenger arrivals and departures for this one month and to only allow cargo flights to operate. This timeframe would help our medical resources to fully concentrate on all local cases. ","Apr 3, 2020"

Heavy economic and social costs.  2) wear masks - most economical and easy to implement. No need for hospitals. Nurses, drugs, life goes on.  Govt teach people how to make a washable cloth mask with a filter/tissue pocket. The tissue can be changed anytime, and the mask can be washed.  3) social distancing. Ineffective when community spread is high. Troublesome and hard to control. Flattens curve but still economically costly, results uncertain, extra budgets to support businesses, unemployed etc. 4) herd immunity.   Over 90% of positive cases came from asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmissions. Nobody in their right mind would want to walk next to a sick person, and a sick person would not intentionally spread it.  The remaining 10% are those in health care environments.

If one of the people in the queue has the virus, the person in front and behind would definitely have a higher chance of getting it since they have prolonged contact with him/her. I highly doubt this 1 m distance is going to help if the person coughs or sneezes. Furthermore, it is impossible to contact trace since there is no record of the people in the queue unless everyone is forced to install the TraceTogether app. Worse still, for Malls where supermarkets are located, it is almost impossible to get groceries from these supermarkets.

The 1 metre distancing is a good move but I hope the authority re-consider it for public transport.

The queue at Serangoon MRT on a typical 7am is already forming, not forgetting we left house at 6 plus from SK.  Thus with this 1 meter, the queue will be unimaginable. Can’t imagine what time we will reach office.  Maybe the authorities can consider that everyone wear a mask when reaching the platform/ queuing?  I heard from my colleague that when she was in Taiwan, everyone was wearing a mask when taking public transport. She wasn’t prepared when taking a local bus but the driver passed a mask to her and also go the extra mile to spray sanitizer on her hand. That was when she noticed the bus commuters all wear mask.

It would really create chaos in our already overcrowded public transport if they enforced it too? How to solve this problem without compromising the health safety aspect from one public space to another?  Have the Government consider deploying body temperature thermal image scanner at entrances of MRT and LRT stations like those deployed at our airports as well?

If they do not have a lot and yet employers do not offer alternatives except that they either no pay, how are you going to advise them then? Will there be any mandate or rules for employers too on this matter?  I feel that the new rule on medical leave is going to back fire as many will no longer go and see the doctor for slight symptoms and wait until their symptoms get serious then they go see doctor. Now people may go see doctor if the symptoms are slight since mc will not be enforced, but if mc are to be enforced, there will be more people who will not see doctor for slight symptoms anymore due to the fact that many do not want to loose their jobs during this difficult times.  No point telling us about the resilience budget cos covid-19 is not going to go away anytime soon. It may run longer than SARS and people need to put food on the table too.  If you are going to enforce anything, please enforce in full cycle and not halfway, enforce at employees' end and yet not enforcing it on the employers' end.  PS: Doctors now give MCs as if it is free, as long as you cough a little, running nose a little, also give 5 days MC. Then ask you to see them again and again. 5 days MC given consequently without any other remedy like sending to hospital for test or anything. Just keep giving people 5 days MC again and again.  Now that you enforce MCs, who would dare to go see them anymore?","Mar 27, 2020"

Can those who insisted that schools be closed give suggestions how to take care of these kids? Leave them all alone at home by themselves while the parents go to work?

Gather more top scientists and lab technicians in the world if we don’t already have enough in Singapore, fly them in by private jet to reduce infection risk, buy whatever additional lab equipment needed to expedite the R&D, … etc. to make the R&D effort running 24x7 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) non-stop on rotating shifts. Concurrently working with WHO, MOH, and FDA to fast track the various trials, tests, verifications, and approval process.  Meanwhile start building pharmaceutical factories and cleanrooms, order/build production equipment and production line getting ready to bacth produce once the vaccine and cure are ready to launch, hire and train the operators, quality inspectors, engineers, technicians, management team, … etc. to run the production. Also need to get the supply chain ready to provide the materials needed for production. Again concurrently work with other interetsed countries to start building production factories and getting everything ready once the vaccine and cure are ready to launch.  Highly possible and hopefully all these can be accomplished successfully before end of the year. Isn’t this a better option and better use of the reserve? i.e. vaccine and cure are successfully developed, job creations for thousands of people across so many industries i.e. R&D, construction, logistics, automation, manufacturing, transportation, training …. etc. Businesses go back to as usual, everyone’s life goes back to normal. No more worries of dipping more into the reserve. You happy I happy everyone happy.  Can this be done ??","Mar 26, 2020"

Schools check on the health of the students, your kids. Schools teach your kids personal hygiene. Schools take care of your kids for half a day.

While staggered hours may reduce the volume,  commuters are equally exposed not just to 10 other commuters but more.   2. Government may impose a hard 1 month movement restriction only to allow essential travel to clinic, hospital  supermarket, hawker center,  food court,  cafe, restaurant and police station. All work and school to be suspended for a month,  just like what Wuhan did in January.  Companies are encouraged to use telecommute for communication.   3. Shorten the operating hours of trains and buses on weekends and Friday to end at 11pm or earlier ,  to discourage commuters from staying out late. This is also a good chance for SMRT maintenance staff more time for repair work. Delay morning operating hours for train on weekend only at 7am.   4.

More proactive steps should be taken..to ban social activities are required...People are going about their business as usual as far as I can see and that is a problem.  It's wrong even to allow social congregation of up to 10 people anywhere for this critical period.  I actually advocate a 2 weeks lock down to prevent further transmission.

1.01579E+16,Quinn Wong,"I have been against Singapore lock down since Jan, but now it is a good timing to lock down already: 1- sg already locked from outside and imported cases are limited to the existing ones now 2- sg already has wide local transmission now, just a matter of testing, if you test more you will identify 5 times 10 times of current reported cases judging from the situation in US UK two weeks ago and now 3. More and more daily untraceable cases 4. By locking outside we limit the number of imported cases, then lockdown from inside for two weeks we can identify most of the internal local cases, which makes the Lockdown more effective 5. If we locked down in Jan it was not sustainable, but now it is necessary and it is the correct timing for a lock down. We can choose to proactively lock down now, but if we don't do now and wait for it to slowly lose control and forced to lock down later then the situation will be difficult.","Mar 24, 2020"
1.01579E+16,Ju-Peter Seng,"Hi, We all can see the number of imported cases now among the newly infected. Besides the requirement for those who came back from overseas to stay home for 14 days, shouldn't their family be required to stay home as well? There is a risk of contact within the family, isn't it? The reason why I am asking is because I have seen real cases where people just came back from Europe, and yes they are staying home but their children are still going to school as usual. They cook for the family and I'm sure they do not isolate themselves from their children. I believe this is a loop hole in the current system.

1.01579E+16,Teck Koon Lim,"We need to up the ante on both.  Social distancing will only work in tandem with social responsibility.  We need to cut down transmission of COVID by owning the following behavior and ensure people we have influenced over do the same.  •Cover up when cough or sneeze.  US NIH studies show aerosolized COVID virus is still infectious for 3 hours. The guy before you coughs in the queue, you move forward, you will walk into the mist of virus.  In the lift, some someone coughs, all will have no where to run. •Suspected of feeling sick, see doc and stay home as much as possible. Regardless whether you think is just a cold or a flu. •Washing hands regularly and do it the right way. This not only protects you but prevents smearing all over for others  I have been observing for many weeks. All the above are woefully inadequate.  You guys go hawker centres and observe.

1.01579E+16,James Tan,"My two cents worth…  If we may have noticed, there are 3 keywords frequently appeared around the world with regards to COVID-19, they are: 1. Imported 2. Linked 3. Unlinked  So what should be done in Singapore to prevent further increase of the infected numbers? I personally think that there are a few measures need to take seriously in the current context.  1. Imported cases has increased tremendously, this is inevitable considering Singapore a small red dot in Asia, where many people have to travel around the world to make a living, regardless of their nationality and occupation. We have businessmen traveling across the global to sign deals, professionals providing their expertise globally in various trades, students studying aboard, home helpers and foreign skilled workers that facilitated the growth of Singapore etc. Yes, the government has kicked in preventive measures to make sure the possibility of spreading the virus contained. But have all these measures been taken seriously by the people going into Singapore? Unfortunately to some people, social responsibility is not what they really care about. To tackle this, my suggestion is to step up the cost of not abide to the rules. Increase manpower to monitor their whereabout and conditions, monitoring should also include their family members that live together. Deploy NS men or neighborhood policemen to spot check them daily, track the movement of their family members.  2. Except family members living together, everyone should not go out unnecessarily. Tracking and monitoring of those just returned, their family members and those linked to previous cases are crucial. As mentioned earlier, stepping up stringent measures for Stay Home Notice, frequent house visit is a MUST, as the cost of relying on human consciousness is too high. People not serving Stay Home Notice but under tracking and monitoring due to their linkage should put up mask when going out, this is to ensure virus not spread if the person suddenly infected. Furthermore, this is so much better of having the whole nation putting up mask.  3. No more gatherings should be allowed regardless of the number of people involved and their religion, this is to break the link of spreading the virus. Nobody can tell whether the person passes by is infected or not, you can’t take the risk of giving them the benefit of the doubt that everyone has the integrity and conscious about social responsibility. Of course, in some cases those infected they themselves not knowing as well. Hence, instead of looking for cure why not prevent it from happening in the first place? Unlinked means not knowing where the virus came from, no previous record or trace of how the person became infected. So beside no gathering, stay out when necessarily, like buying food (pack food back to eat instead of eating out) and daily necessities, go to work (also pack back to eat during lunch or dinner) and go to school. Conduct business meetings using the internet, work from home if can, cook at home if can too. Everyone should limit their movement so as to contain the risk of been infected and spreading the virus.  In the current situation, we might have to forgo a bit of democracy and humanitarianism, just to ensure that Singapore is a safe, healthy and clean nation to live in. These are the fundamentals of a sustainable Singapore.","Mar 21, 2020"

1.01579E+16,Charmaine Ng,"I'm no app developer but as a user this app is of little use to me.   First, it's good to know that our data would not be accessed unless we were near a confirmed case. But the app itself has a fatal flaw. It has to be kept open always.  Huh? Meaning if I am using Facebook now it would be rendered useless? And I need to keep it face down as a iPhone user so it can continue accessing my location - which means the question isn't on how the battery usage will not only increase but how much the battery usage will be increased. If the mobile phone runs out of juice - again, how effective is this in active tracing?  Another question would be on security. What is being done to ensure the app is safe to use - since Bluetooth signal is kept on constantly with the app running in foreground seems like a good and simple way for someone with knowledge in the field to tap on and gain access to our data from our phones - not from your database.  Lastly, with Covid-19 affecting elderly the most; shouldn't the app be all the more made user friendly for them? Please do consider offering them in other languages like Mandarin, Malayu and Tamil. Maybe not all, but there are many elderly who knows how to operate a smartphone but not all of these elderly understand English.  If you have a pop-up to alert users who have been near a confirmed case it would be even better since now I understood that the user would be contacted via phone only.  I appreciate the gesture and think this is a great concept but the way it's implemented is not very assuring.","Mar 22, 2020"

1.01579E+16,I-Chun Liu,"With stricter border controls in place, we are down to ensuring personal hygiene and social distancing.  I am very concerned that people here are failing miserably in personal hygiene. If we go by NHS's powerful messaging of ""Catch it. Bin it. Kill it"", we fail on all 3 counts.  People are still coughing/sneezing without covering with a tissue, still spitting phlegm into tissue and throwing into bowls instead of trash bins (just saw last Sat), and not washing hands before eating (7 adults and kids I observed in a cafe yesterday).  Re: Open-mouthed coughers  8days.sg reader A. Wong told us: I was queuing to pay for (uncovered) breads on a tray at BreadTalk when the lady in front of me turned back and coughed. It was my turn next and so the cashier rung up my order. The lady who coughed wasn’t masked — I was shocked. Coincidentally, she did not ‘infect’ her purchases but instead aimed her cough behind her [at me] — no social responsibility. I later binned the bread for peace of mind. My family and friends told me I shouldn't have paid for it and should have gotten new ones, but everything took place in a short span of time and in hindsight, it might have been for the best so that the possibly germy bread wouldn’t make its way back to the shelf.  https://www.8days.sg/eatanddrink/newsandopening/hey-auntie-quit-tailgating-me-while-queuing-for-kueh-in-the-time-12542414  More impactful messaging and reminders must be used to ensure better personal hygiene.  ""One of the most effective ways of protecting everyone is by remember the simple phrase: Catch it. Bin it. Kill it.  CATCH IT – Always carry tissues and use them to cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.  BIN IT – Dispose of used tissues as soon as possible.  KILL IT – Clean your hands with soap and water as soon as you can and make sure you wash them frequently. If you have no washing facilities, make use of an alcohol gel.""  https://wmas.nhs.uk/2013/12/18/remember-to-catch-it-bin-it-kill-it-this-winter/?fbclid=IwAR2P-ZwiVwDdIdE_oOBLoCI6NzODi-v-KJA298Ac8Wxp-lcMYPdLKNJpBw8","Mar 19, 2020"

The best thing we can do to lower the odds of the Russian Roulette we are forced to play for the unforeseeable future is to practice these basic things and ensure that people you have influence over do the same:  •Cover up when cough or sneeze.  US NIH studies show aerosolized COVID virus is still infectious for 3 hours. God bless you merry gentleman. •Suspected of feeling sick, see doc and stay home as much as possible. Regardless whether you think is just a cold or a flu. •Washing hands regularly and do it the right way. This not only protects you but prevents smearing all over for others  We are not doing all these enough to cut down the transmission rate as imported cases mount.  Personal observation: •Many cough at will •I was at cafe two days ago. Decided to do an observation.  I observed that the next 7 patrons who came in for the next one hour, none went to wash their hands before they plonked themselves down to order and eat. I did not see them using hand sanitizers either. Neither did they refrain from touching their hair and face. A few wore lanyard and ID tags. They played with it, touched face and touched hair habitually.  We need to do better for ourselves and for others.","Mar 19, 2020"

Currently, all work pass holders in Singapore receive free COVID-19 treatment.   Alternatively, we may want to implement a full payment system for COVID-19 treatment for any foreigners regardless of whether they are work pass holders or not who import the COVID-19 to Singapore from this point onwards.  Some work pass holders are infected with the COVID-19 and returned to Singapore for free COVID-19 treatment.

If they unluckily caught the virus and likely would want to return Singapore for treatment, but this can be preventable at first by choosing not to travel. Thanks for the Annex summarizing the cases details, can also help include the housing address and which place they been before hospital admission ?   Can MoH and MOE help confirm that the SHN covers the household tenants including students who also required to serve the 14 days SHN or LoA if they stay at same household ? As they are close contact to the person serving the SHN, there is also risk associated with it.   Thirdly, does the SHN applies for traveler entering Singapore via land and sea? It seems to be loop hole risk that if doesn’t, worry cases increase too much that stretched further the healthcare capacity.

1.01578E+16,Chin VB,"It’s so important that we have knowledge about Coronavirus that we are all battling now. Please read!  Hi guys. As a Chinese, I'd like to share some personal views on the Coronavirus.  I often feel speechless when I watch some international news and comments on social media. It feels like some people don't care about the possibility of a virus outbreak in their own country. And when you tell them about epidemic preventions and their effectiveness in China, someones just yell out that China is lying, and then go on to party without masks.  It's frustrating. The local government of Wuhan made lots of mistakes in the early days, and that led to today's total confirmed case number of more than 80,000. And we have lost at least 3,000 people! Now many countries are making the same mistakes just like they never get information from China. Sometimes I really don't know why????  👉🏻Some say that no symptoms no need for masks, and even discriminate against people who wear masks.  ‼️This virus has a very unpredictable incubation period, and you can infect many people without any symptoms! In one case, a woman infected 7 people even though she did not has any symptoms.   👉🏻Some say that people with mild symptoms can self-heal simply by being isolated at home. And youngs will not die. ‼️That's what we thought at first, but in the end, China had to quickly build specialist hospitals to place and treat *ALL* suspected and confirmed cases to avoid more cross-infection. Without symptomatic treatment, home isolation may turn a mild patient into a serious one. And home-isolated patients may high probably infect their whole family. You may self-heal, what about your parents and children?  BTW, we got some cured cases who are more than 70 when some patients who were only 30 dead. Young doesn't mean healthy or cannot die.  👉🏻Some say that the mortality rate of this disease is very low.  ‼️As mentioned above, the virus is highly contagious and can cause systemic organ failure. The low mortality rate depends on preventing mild cases from developing into severe ones. It depends, in another word, on whether the average medical resource is sufficient. No matter how advanced your country's medical technologies are, they are useless if you cannot get them. Most dead cases of Wuhan was actually due to the early collapse of medical resources at the start. (Just picture all the people rush into the same hospital in one day.)  👉🏻Some believe the virus originated in China and could be prevented by expelling the Chinese.  ‼️What a stupid logic! Aside from the fact that scientists still haven't found the source of the virus (did the Spanish flu originate in Spain?), the most important thing is that to only discriminate against people from one region will let down the guard against patients from other regions. Viruses don't pick nationality or race. Looking at the confirmed cases in Europe, how many of them have clear contacts with China? What's the use of running from an Asian but hugging an infected Italian?  ‼️China's preventive measures include blocking affected areas, keeping residents staying home as far as possible, working and teaching online, organizing large-scale disinfection, and setting up special hospitals, free treatment, calling in medical personnel from all over the country to support Wuhan... Even so, the virus has only reduced its transmission speed and has not been eliminated yet.  (Update: I un-capitalized the word ""free"" since someone was unhappy about that. Free treatment is important, if infected people can not afford it, they may get sicker and infect more people. It's not a wellness but a precaution. I list these measures here because they exist, not because I want to flaunt them. I haven't left my house for two months. It's not something to be happy or proud about. 😒)  And some countries that have seen a rise in confirmed cases are still debating whether to wear masks, and some internet users are busily laughing at how dirty China is! OMG, is H1N1 showed up cause Mexico or America was too dirty?   People are dealing with a virus together, and some people just wanna be racism. What's packed in their heads?  Anyway, at least trying some preventions which have been proven useful in China to protect people is better than creaming 'China is lying'.   To be frankly I don't care whether people believe thoses suggestions or not. If China lie, the Chinese will pay for it. If other countries don't take enough effective precautions, their citizens will pay for it. If repeating the spell 'lying' can take the virus down, I encourage everyone saying it a thousand times a day.   --But the bad news is it doesn't work! Just wake up and wash your hands guys!

1.01578E+16,Chin VB,"It’s so important that we have knowledge about Coronavirus that we are all battling now. Please read!  Hi guys. As a Chinese, I'd like to share some personal views on the Coronavirus.  I often feel speechless when I watch some international news and comments on social media. It feels like some people don't care about the possibility of a virus outbreak in their own country. And when you tell them about epidemic preventions and their effectiveness in China, someones just yell out that China is lying, and then go on to party without masks.  It's frustrating. The local government of Wuhan made lots of mistakes in the early days, and that led to today's total confirmed case number of more than 80,000. And we have lost at least 3,000 people! Now many countries are making the same mistakes just like they never get information from China. Sometimes I really don't know why????  👉🏻Some say that no symptoms no need for masks, and even discriminate against people who wear masks.  ‼️This virus has a very unpredictable incubation period, and you can infect many people without any symptoms! In one case, a woman infected 7 people even though she did not has any symptoms.   👉🏻Some say that people with mild symptoms can self-heal simply by being isolated at home. And youngs will not die. ‼️That's what we thought at first, but in the end, China had to quickly build specialist hospitals to place and treat *ALL* suspected and confirmed cases to avoid more cross-infection. Without symptomatic treatment, home isolation may turn a mild patient into a serious one. And home-isolated patients may high probably infect their whole family. You may self-heal, what about your parents and children?  BTW, we got some cured cases who are more than 70 when some patients who were only 30 dead. Young doesn't mean healthy or cannot die.  👉🏻Some say that the mortality rate of this disease is very low.  ‼️As mentioned above, the virus is highly contagious and can cause systemic organ failure. The low mortality rate depends on preventing mild cases from developing into severe ones. It depends, in another word, on whether the average medical resource is sufficient. No matter how advanced your country's medical technologies are, they are useless if you cannot get them. Most dead cases of Wuhan was actually due to the early collapse of medical resources at the start. (Just picture all the people rush into the same hospital in one day.)  👉🏻Some believe the virus originated in China and could be prevented by expelling the Chinese.  ‼️What a stupid logic! Aside from the fact that scientists still haven't found the source of the virus (did the Spanish flu originate in Spain?), the most important thing is that to only discriminate against people from one region will let down the guard against patients from other regions. Viruses don't pick nationality or race. Looking at the confirmed cases in Europe, how many of them have clear contacts with China? What's the use of running from an Asian but hugging an infected Italian?  ‼️China's preventive measures include blocking affected areas, keeping residents staying home as far as possible, working and teaching online, organizing large-scale disinfection, and setting up special hospitals, free treatment, calling in medical personnel from all over the country to support Wuhan... Even so, the virus has only reduced its transmission speed and has not been eliminated yet.  (Update: I un-capitalized the word ""free"" since someone was unhappy about that. Free treatment is important, if infected people can not afford it, they may get sicker and infect more people. It's not a wellness but a precaution. I list these measures here because they exist, not because I want to flaunt them. I haven't left my house for two months. It's not something to be happy or proud about. 😒)  And some countries that have seen a rise in confirmed cases are still debating whether to wear masks, and some internet users are busily laughing at how dirty China is! OMG, is H1N1 showed up cause Mexico or America was too dirty?   People are dealing with a virus together, and some people just wanna be racism. What's packed in their heads?  Anyway, at least trying some preventions which have been proven useful in China to protect people is better than creaming 'China is lying'.   To be frankly I don't care whether people believe thoses suggestions or not. If China lie, the Chinese will pay for it. If other countries don't take enough effective precautions, their citizens will pay for it. If repeating the spell 'lying' can take the virus down, I encourage everyone saying it a thousand times a day.   --But the bad news is it doesn't work! Just wake up and wash your hands guys!

1.01578E+16,Rason Lee,"Speech by SMS Lam -  31.          I am glad to update that the Integrated Youth Service will be starting in Woodlands this year.  Care Corner will reach out to youths at-risk and raise awareness on mental well-being and resilience. They will also provide individualised emotional support, needs identification and peer support services, and refer those who require further intervention to appropriate health and social services.  32.          Moving forward, we will continue to take a whole-of-society approach and work with other ministries to address youth mental health needs. This includes MOE, the Ministry for Social and Family Development (MSF), and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), including their National Youth Council (NYC), on the recently announced Youth Mental Well-being Network.  > I'm fine with the IMH offshoot located outside of IMH, but what are the details to the IYS such that it does not become another stigma-spot?

It may take some time before effective treatments and vaccines become available. As the global situation evolves, many countries may become infected. It will become increasingly difficult to stop the virus at our borders as we cannot ban visitors from every country and shut ourselves out from the world.  > Can there be more details on the ""limitations and constraints""? My sense is that you are saying immune cells isolation and monoclonal lab reproduction will not be in time to treat the currently critically ill, so how about the sourcing of suitable donor for wholesale transfusion as last resort, in which case you might have to open the call for local self-suspected subclinical cases or foreign authorities?

Based on personal experience, the number of smokers have NOT reduced, and ENFORCEMENT of smoking in prohibited places is still grossly inadequate. Not a day goes by without non-smokers being assaulted by toxic second-hand smoke. More needs to be done for protection against second-hand smoke exposure.   The attached photo of rampant cigarette butt and empty pack-littering says it all. The absolute number of smokers/frequency of smoking now might actually have INCREASED, in line with our population growth to 5.7 million.   Every floor of my block has at least 1 smoker (as per stats of '1 in 4 Singaporean male age 18 to 39 is a smoker') and despite 3 moves, I have not found a smoke-free unit without neighbours' smoke drift.

1.01578E+16,Nelson Tan,It look like Covid-19 is unstoppable until a vaccine is available to the mass public which earliest is by next year ... my own opinion is that the only way to stop this virus in sg is everyone stay at home for 1 mth n whoever come into sg need to be quarantine for a mth cos lastest data show that incubation period can be up to 27 days. Except for healthcare workers n etc if not noone to take care of the patients in hospital. It is better to do this early while it is still controllable before it is too late which will eventually end up in a indefinate lockdown like what happened to 500 mil people in china. Rather to sacrifice early then to pay a heavy price later. First serious mistake in sg is letting in more then 10k of wuhan tourist into sg when the virus is already a known issue. Just by contact tracing doesn't solve the problem which only minimise the problem. Economy cannot be place first then it's people n anyway sg most likely will go into recession no matter what happened from now as long as the Covid-19 problem is not solved worldwide.,"Mar 1, 2020"

Things can easily take a turn for the worst just like that and confirmed cases can increase exponentially suddenly. While the number of recovered cases in SG is encouraging, there seems to be reports of recovered patients in China becoming infected again, hopefully this is not true. SG has thus far dealt with this outbreak objectively and calmly through a combination of data and evidence based approach. This has given us a wide berth to completely eradicate this menace once and for all from this island. Instead of relaxing our measures as some suggested such as returning to Doscorn yellow, I think we should do the opposite and step up the measures such as closing schools over the next 2 weeks and adopting a mask up policy over the next 2 weeks to completely rid SG of covid 19. stay safe people.","Feb 22, 2020"

Singapore Airlines and SilkAir will temporarily reduce services across our network due to weak demand as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.since many Airlines and Hotels understood  the risk and refunding the amount.its not acceptable that we are facing difficulty to connect to your customer care itself. @sghealthministry @AirAsiaIndia  #Singapore #Changi #Airport #SingaporeZombieApocalypse https://twitter.com/sg_warehouse/status/1226691374688325634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1226691374688325634&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.sg%2Fstop-flights-people-worldwide-are-cancelling-trips-to-singapore-after-news-that-the-coronavirus-has-spread-to-locals%2F https://www.businessinsider.sg/stop-flights-people-worldwide-are-cancelling-trips-to-singapore-after-news-that-the-coronavirus-has-spread-to-locals/","Feb 21, 2020"

The device 'should' be simple for those with the knowledge.  A pendant worn around the neck. A ring placed on the hand. When the ring comes near the pendant an audible squeal is heard, or a voice saying ""wash your bloody hands or at least use the back of your hands"".

1.01578E+16,Seherezada Onur,Dear Sirs what is the risk of close contact for those staying under the same roof with those who are put on home stay order. How would they spend their time in a small area. What is the chances of them obeying the requirements since they are human and need free space. Would there be possible infection to those stay under the same roof and they may not know they are infected since this virus can be asymptomatic. If this is the case would there be more outbreak due to the people staying with them infected and spread to the community without they knowing. If we could isolate them in an offshore island for 14 days the chances of defaulting will be minimised and it will be preventive in nature and we can focus the effort in minimising the spread to the community and the cost of this prevention should offset the pain of contact tracing. In an off shore island like St John they may have more roaming space and would be more conducive for them and those who are in the same roof will be less stressful of worrying the potential of getting infected ,"Feb 18, 2020"

1.01578E+16,Seherezada Onur,Dear Sirs I appreciated the tightening of control for people returning to Singapore with this new SHN. Human tends to enjoy freedom of Space . Limiting them in a small confine space may add pressure to those under the SHN and those who are staying under the same roof. If we want tightening it should we not bite the bullet and place them in offshore island like St John for a period of 14 days instead of having them mingle with the community especially those who has to share the same roof with them . As the virus maybe asymptomatic for some days would not that expose the risk for those staying in the same roof. Those who stay in the same roof have potential of unknowingly catch the virus when they use the toilets common area . There might be risk of further spread since those who stay in the same roof may move around and potential of becoming another outbreak point. Please do consider this proposal to put those returning in offshore island where they have bigger roaming space and less stressful to them and minimised the risk of spreading to the community,"Feb 18, 2020"

Place people's health over business profits. This is the time that everybody, including bosses, to work together for the whole of Singapore and Singaporeans' health.  MOH, you need to push health and prevention as priority number one. Sure MTI may push to have the PRCs back because they take in bosses' feedback in closed door meetings. The rest of Singaporeans also need to have meetings with the authorities to feedback that they are more concerned of everyone's health and this must be priority number one.

One of the UK’s leading respiratory disease experts, Gisli Jenkins, professor of experimental medicine at Nottingham University, said that smokers had high rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a form of lung damage. And people with COPD are at high risk generally of respiratory illnesses such as the new coronavirus.  Prof Jenkins said it would be “astonishing” if smokers were not at greater risk of Covid-19 than non smokers. And he said there may be a link between high smoking rates and severity of the disease.   “China has extremely high rates of COPD and it also has high rates of severe pneumonia. In this particular coronavirus 15 per cent of the Chinese population who have been infected have severe respiratory disease and around two per cent have died - in the rest of the world the disease doesn’t seem to be as bad.""  https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-dangerous-smokers/","Feb 18, 2020"

All health care workers who treats such patients should be doing the same as a preventive measure at least twice daily.  I strongly believe currently spreading COVID-19 can be controlled at very early stages with ""triple heat therapy"" with steam and warm water if performed efficiently.   There is nothing to lose by testing this treatment on early symptomatic new corona viral infected patients. This therapy helps to control the infection by giving time to our immune system while keeping virus growth suppressed. In medical terms this may give natural ""live attenuated vaccine"" type effect by suppressing the infection with ""Cell mediated immunity"" till full control taken over by ""Humoral immunity"" with producing definite antibodies.  This way of assisting the immune system is way more efficient than let the virus to take over your body, let you suffer to the maximum if not die then gradually allow body to get full antibody effect over couple or more weeks.  I am a medical graduate who is practicing steam and warm water for early control of acute viral respiratory tract infection on myself for 20 years with lot of success. For the past 20 years I have self-treated all my common colds and flues by 48hrs if not within 24hrs. Also controlled two probable influenza events within 72hrs in the winter.   For the past 20 years never had to clear my nose from respiratory secretions, never let it infect lungs with long suffering coughs. Never had antibiotics for sinusitis or lung infections. Never used expectorants. Never been away from work due to any related issues. What else you expect from a treatment which is cheap and simple like this?   I have done a scientific discussion on the possibilities of COVID-19 control through this method.   Please view my video upload through below link.   https://youtu.be/Dom2Oungw7I   End note: I don’t a see a reason to die in thousands and get sick in tens of thousands from a respiratory infection when you have simple, cheap and readily available method of early treatment.

1.01578E+16,Seherezada Onur,Great to hear more cases discharge. Worried about the returning workers from the epicenter. Just saw a news at straits times about home stay rule for those retuning from china. Since we want to impose strict rules we might as well bite the bullet to put them in offshore island like St John before allowing them to come to the community. Putting them together with people in the same roof who may have been healthy and normal might put them at risk as the cruise cases in Japan has illustrated the risk of infection from close contact. For those affected in Singapore . Subsequent case are evidence of close contact maybe at risk of infection. Since asymtomatic is one of the characteristic of this virus. Shouldnt we take a tougher stand if we still want them back in the community. Allowing them to stay with people who may be healthy under the same roof may also post greater risk of spreading the virus to the community if those under same roof are infected and allow to roam around without knowing they have caught the virus . Since we want to impose strict rules let us do it in a preventive manner. If they are house in off shore island the chances of them defaulting the rules would be greatly reduce,"Feb 17, 2020"

1.01578E+16,Mei Yin Ng,"Ministry of Health, Singapore  I was at Bedok Polyclinic a few days ago. The staff have started measuring temperature of everyone entering the polyclinic. A staff used a forehead thermometer while another used an ear thermometer. One must insert the ear thermometer properly into the ear in order to do an accurate reading. In addition, it takes longer for the staff to measure someone’s temperature using the ear thermometer, compared to a forehead thermometer. I would suggest the Polyclinic provides forehead thermometer to their staff instead of the ear thermometer so that they don’t have to come into too close contact with visitors and patients.   Next, it’s regarding water supply in the toilet inside the Bedok Polyclinic. In one of toilets, the water from the taps at the basins were flowing out so little and cut off so fast that it has become so difficult to do a proper hand washing. I am not sure if the same happens in the other toilets in Bedok Polyclinic, or even in other polyclinics. Is this done to cut cost? I think, the polyclinics should provide an environment to facilitate the public into practicing proper hygiene measures, especially in the current time of an epidemic event.   Hope the relevant authority will look into the matters so that  the staff in the polyclinics, together with the public, can protect themselves better in face of this COVID19 epidemic.","Feb 15, 2020"

1.01578E+16,Jayanath De Alwis,"Dear Reader, in my opinion right now in Wuhan everyone should be doing steam inhalation, warm water face wash and warm water gargling at the earliest cold and flu symptom while waiting for medical treatment. All health care workers should be doing the same as a preventive measure at least twice daily.  I strongly believe currently spreading COVID-19 can be controlled at very early stages with ""triple heat therapy"" with steam and warm water if performed efficiently.   There is nothing to lose by testing this treatment on early symptomatic New Corona Viral infection patients. This therapy helps to control the infection by giving time to our immune system while keeping virus growth suppressed. In medical terms this may give natural ""live attenuated vaccine"" type effect by suppressing the infection with ""Cell mediated immunity"" till full control taken over by ""Humoral immunity"" with producing definite antibodies.  I am a medical graduate who is practicing steam and warm water for early control of acute viral respiratory tract infection on myself for 20 years with lot of success. For the past 20 years I have self-treated all my common colds and flues by 48hrs if not within 24hrs. Also controlled two probable influenza events within 72hrs in the winter.   For the past 20 years never had to clear my nose from respiratory secretions, never let it infect lungs with long suffering coughs. Never had antibiotics for sinusitis or lung infections. Never used expectorants. Never been away from work due to any related issues. What else you expect from a treatment which is cheap and simple like this?   I have done a scientific discussion on the possibilities of COVID-19 control through this method.

This will serve  1) to contain the spread further  2) public in large may remain more calm instead of seeing a clinic full of people who are coughing or sneezing ,  3) not overburdening our public hospital .. instead of overloading the frontline staff in trying to detect suspects , n subject both front line staff n members of the public with further exposure ..

Therefore, I hope the MOM can fully support the worker if his employer penalises him for taking MC. While on MC, even if the flu symptoms are mild, we should also be responsible NOT to go out.

Ïf those drugs come wit side effects. Its ok  la.. Cos these drugs frm USA wat ? MOH just behave like 'monkey see monkey do' no brain of themselves. Why ï saïd these..?  Those aids patients...most of them aldy gone..wilĺ attest to my statement. Taking those aids drugs aids patient encounter hair grown on tongue. Its ok la..becos it came frm USA.. 2) the current COVÏD19 epidemïc making every singaporean worried...its like playing russian roulette.  Wat we only hear frm MOH in addressïng this epidemïc is..just medicore statement by them...the whole bunch only know to supply mask, diagnostic kit, collect data tats all..no concrete plan.. Same as wat our PM lee saying this COVI19 may lead to a reccesion..no plan in hand on how to counter the reccession. Just talk only. PM lee n MOH can sieep under same roof.  Cos they are only good at talking only..no action.  Who will suffer ? Its thoe average n below average families worst hit.  3) frm my half done website 'https://yangholïstïccentre.com/ ' its shown tat i am specialïse in dealing wit any sort of airborne viruses...so easy to treat..to those tat just got infected n for those that want to avoid being infected...a simple method  of doing it guarantee u wont be infected.. But its difficult for me to tell those medical goons on wat i could do to tackle thïs COVID19... Cos those MOH goons are too biase..they only believe in medical science..nothing else.  By relying on medïcal science to deal wit viruses..a kind of spiritual it may take century or more for medical science to crack the code.  3)  MOH is putting those infected CoVID19 patients under quarantine..of cos its the right thing to do but come to think of it..MOH is making these patients as sitting ducks. If u called yrself as the authority...u shld try every avenue to get these patients to be treated wit the right appqoach..u shld shut the door for alternative treatment since medïcal cant do a thing abt it.  mOH is way off their responsibility being called yourself as the authority taking charge of singaporean well being on health matter.. But u guys know 'nut' in dealing wit mysterious sickness...Got tîs dr janil frm MOH coming out to claim that COVID19 spread thru droplets.. OMG!!! Tat means MOH is saying by wearing mask could avoid being infected. Dropletr wont pass thru those mask fibre..droplets will be stuck on thetfibre..this was wat this smart alec dr frm MOH was trying to tell all singaporean.

Yes ..its the responsibility of the govt..BUT all these effort put up by the govt is medicore. The main issue ïs not address...on how to find way to contain to get rid of this nCov n sg is nCov free... Is MOH able to achieve tat?  In the area of treatment...those infected patients under 24 hrs observation....for nCov related illness..ie coughing where nCov medical wilĺ prescribe cough medicine n so on ..BUT . The main treatment on nCov is not there. Patients got to rely nn their immune system to fight back the nCov...tatr all. Can say there is no treatment offered by the MOH's medical team (volunteers or medical doc) to provide for these patients.  Seem tat we r facing this.. MOH the so called medical authority in Sg is lacking of ideas to apply method to make Sg free frm nCov. In china wuhan the authority using truck to spread disinfectant thru out the street. Actually airbnrne viruses dont give a damn to these disinfectant or powerful antibiotics. So can say wat they (the chinese ) chasing after the rainbow. At least they were trying their best. Unlike Sg MOH..simply got no idea to deal wit main issue but they want to dictate n control.. Talking abt finding way to cure nCov patients...MOH didnt put any effort on it...by having a hotlïne or a channel for feedback in regard to nCov issue. In another word, MOH since their medical team is helpless in dealing (treatment) wit nCov..they shld be more open to alternative treatment. Holistic ppl like us..our analogy on human is ..'human existance is being dictated by sursounding elements' .  As mentioned in my website..'if its a spiritual sickness..it must be treated in a spiritual manner. Tat is why, u see taoist followers do their praying (burning joss sticks)at roadside dur evening time. Why they do tat for generation? Go Ask those taoist mediums who were on trance at certain night in their taoist temple.  If airborne virus is a spiritual element..u think medïcal science able to treat it ?  Unfortunately, we got too many ignorant medical docs over at MOH...selfïshly controlling n dictating on wat can be allowed or wat canoot be allowed..its a one way street...sigh...sigh. Fyi..we can guarantee or assuring nCov patient tat under our type of holistic treatment...they will be cured in a matter of abt 2 days or earlier..only to those just got infected within a day or two.

Virus die when exposed to light (sunlight) why issit so.?  Just like u watch those Dracula movies..they perished away.  This intepret tat virus derived frm the Darkside.  Nature Creation of the two environment (11 hrs day n 12 hrs nightfall) n others like..the creation of two groupings of living beings..the warm n cold bĺood plus the indoor n outdoor plants...all these (two groupings ) help to allow harmonious living among them. N among these two elements (living beïngs they dont share similiar charaäteristics) Even in spiritual forces...they come wit the 'Brightside n Darkside ' spiritual forces. The question is who rein supreme among these two spiritual forces. Frm the standing point by looking at the Solar System...the Mighty Sun (representing the Brightside) stood adamantly whereas..those elements frm the Darkside got to avoid direct contact wit the purity sunlight...by hiding at dark corners or running away frm the 'coming of dawn' toward the 'coming of dusk'. This analogy clearly shown that thde spiritual brightside elements rein supreme. Tat is why they say 'the good will tramp over evil. Or the truth always prevail.  Koowing they r the weaker force..of cos got to provide incentives for those who embrace them (darkside )..

If they dont provide these xciting elements...whn is going to embrace them?  Tat is why viruses coming frm the darkside loathe the sight of purity.

1.01578E+16,Wentao Fu,"It is getting clearer that the high mortality rate in Wuhan is probably not because the virus there is more lethal, but because the collapse of the health care system. Based on the statistics so far, it seems the ratio of critical illness requiring ICU is about 10% of total cases (Singapore has 7 out of 45 as of today, around 15%). When the virus is widely spread and critical illness is beyond the ICU capacity, the mortality rate will obviously be higher. This probably can explain why so many cities in China are taking very strict measure and implementing hard/soft lock-down, despite the big impact on economy. Zhejiang province has more than 1000 cases with 0 death, but most cities including Hangzhou are in soft lock-down. Guess their government well understands the real danger is the collapse of the healthcare system, less about the existing mortality rate. If this logic works, Singapore health care system would also have a limit. How many more ICU beds do we have to deal with critical cases? Our leaders seems confident that the virus would not widely spread in Singapore even without the strict measures of stopping school and big events... I am not sure where the confidence is from... our hot weather? experience from SARS?... but really hope it is a right decision, cannot imagine what if.... ","Feb 10, 2020"

Otherwise, most Singaporeans will typically self medicate first (infecting family members), then make a couple of GP trips, where they will infect more people over the days, as well as delaying own recovery. General practitioners should also send patients to nearest hospitals for test immediately instead if sending them home with flu meds, if patients still visit GP first. Prevention should also start at home. If family members are showing flu- like symptoms, they should quickly mask the ill ones and send them to hospitals. I, for one, am most afraid of infecting my family members.","Feb 10, 2020"

Not everyone is disciplined; 2) those who are unwell may not know they are unwell; 3) those who are unwell may not have a mask; 4) Most importantly, the virus can be passed to you by those who are infected but without any symptoms (Look at the British who got the virus from business conference in Hyatt Singapore and pass it to so many people in Europe).

When these viruses ( airborne or close- contact ) once enter the the body...they go after the spirituality of the human body ( purity blood system n the spiritual head)...nothing to do wit organ. Both of these two viruses groupings may share similiar characteristics but their modus operandi may differ slightly. Take for example..close-contact viruses (aids, hepatitis, herpes n etc) once enter the body..they target the purity blood system..not targetting organ...n left untreated..they invaee the spiritual head.. Tat is why, the onslaught frm germ derived sickesses . Ie cancer..patient faces drastic changes to their body structure..(shrinkage or sunken) whereas, aids patient late stage of infectinn faces changes to their face features..

I’m surprised that Church is missed out! Or if case 8 & 9 have told officers that they have been to church, have measures taken to inform the church members to take LOA of 14 days and stop church activities for 2 weeks?   2.  Now we have 40 cases and at least 10 local community infections, can more stringent measures be taken, such as quarantining all colleagues who’s in the same office / searing in close proximity with these confirmed cases?   3. CoronaVirus is not the same as SARS and H1N1. It is more deadly than H1N1, and spread much easier and faster than SARS, so using the same practice as SARS / H1N1 time and making decisions based on SARS and H1N1 experience will not be enough. Look at Wu Han. After extreme measures of isolation are taken, there are still so many confirmed cases. Singapore hasn’t implemented such isolation measures. Our kids will continue to go to school, adults going to workplaces. How sure are we that we will not become another Wu Han?   4. Wearing of masks. Can government stop telling public that “you don’t need to wear a mask if you are feeling well”? This doesn’t apply for Corona Virus. If the country is short of masks, then at least ask cab drivers, grab Drivers, store assistants, restaurant waiters, those who frequently take public transports, school teachers, kindergarten Teachers and carers to wear masks.","Feb 9, 2020"

1.01578E+16,Kee Yan Yeo,"With the infection count increasing steadily by the day, please look to suspend preschools as soon as possible and provide guidelines to companies on how to help affected working parents adjust.  Toddlers and preschoolers are the most vulnerable because of their age and their general lack of ability to observe basic personal hygiene (e.g. rubbing their eyes or noses, putting fingers in their mouth, not covering mouth when sneezing) compared to young adults and older. The human proximity in a preschool environment is also much closer and physical contact among preschoolers much more frequent.  While there is temperature screening, it's still uncertain at this stage of the outbreak if transmission is possible even before the onset of symptoms. If just 1 infected child or adult slips through the temperature screen, the risk of infection spread in a preschool environment will be very high.  Young children are unable to comprehend the severity of the outbreak. It is the responsibility of adults to keep them safe.","Feb 9, 2020"

1.01578E+16,Chenning Lu,"Dear MOH,   I’m all for being especially careful with travellers from China under current circumstances (policy of 14 days LOA etc). However, may I understand given that now Singapore has similar number of, if not more cases than many Chinese cities, what is the basis of declaring the risk of infection from public transport or in public places is low, and that healthy people should not wear masks? Seems to be a discrepancy here.  40 confirmed cases, 4 in critical conditions in ICU, 1 require additional oxygen support. The percentage is quite high. Is it enough to not quarantine those who only have mild symptoms yet to be confirmed? How about their family members? I’m referring to the fact that 6 out of 7 newly confirmed cases displayed symptoms late Jan but not isolated/quarantined until early Feb, a gap of 1 week or more.

The population of Wuhan is 11 millions,while Singapore's population is 5 millions. Almost everyone in Wuhan had make contact with one another,but not everyone in Singapore have hamsters. 11 millions ÷ 5 millions = 2 There are 700++ deaths in Wuhan. 700 ÷ 2 = 350  If there are 1 family in every 350 households,who have a hamster in their homes. If there are 100 households in every block=Every 3.5 blocks of flats,there must be 1 family,who own at least 1 hamster.  If there are 1000 blocks of flats and if there are 5 pets shops in Jurong=Every 200 blocks to 1 pets shop at average  200 blocks ÷ 3.5 blocks = 57 different families purchase hamster food from a pets shop  I think,the death rate is as low as death from allergy.","Feb 9, 2020"

1.01578E+16,Su Zhen,Can tell us more now is under what type of spread?,"Feb 9, 2020"
1.01578E+16,Liyuan Song,"The recent cases are already showing the coronavirus is already spreading within the community. As such, we have a few proposals for the MOH to consider to manage local community spreading: 1. All students to stay at home and attend web class. Children do not create economic value now but they are the future of the country, and they should be protected because they cannot protect themselves. They are clustered together every day in school and are generally weaker in immunity and is a high risk group. If a child is inflected, and if the family has an elder, the elderly will also risk been affected. Many cases in China are cluster and family infections which is why China has already banned schools from resuming. If the cases spread to the schools in Singapore it will consume huge amount of our limited medical resources. 2. The government should encourage working from home. I understand the government current reluctance to make more concrete measures may be due to concerns about the impact to the economy. However, this non actions or slow reactions will only cause greater spreads which will end up creating more damage to the economy. I would encourage the government to encourage business to tell their staff to work from home, especially for back office functions. My husband returned from his HK employer. His HK employer, like many other companies in HK, is already asking staff to work from home. HK’s current infection cases are currently lower than Singapore despite its close proximity to mainland China and it large mainland Chinese population. 3. Set up specialize venue for suspected cases to go to. One of the main causes of the spread in Wuhan during the early stage was the patients are going to public hospitals and clinics, and many doctors and medical staff are not aware of this new virus. Many were dismiss as common flu and asked to go back and rest. In the early stage of the spread, many medical staff in Wuhan were down with the virus because they have not taken precaution. Many have only basic face mask. They were not provided protective suits. These staff then spread to their family members and those they were in contact with. In Singapore, our GP and clinics are firstly not equipped to confirm the virus, and secondly their staff are not adequately protected, such that clinics can become a source of the virus if patients continue to go to them. These GPs are scattered across the island, in HDB estates and shopping malls. It would be better to install a few temporary specialized examination centers in Singapore where patients can go to check their cases. As Case 19 demonstrates, she went to TTS but was dismissed as not infected after an X-ray was taken until she insisted for a proper check at second visit at SGH. In the case of Case 34, she went to two GPs but were dismissed. She’s not the only one, Case 37 and Case 39 also went to two clinics. It is not in the interests of GPs to confirm a case as it will mean their clinic will have to be thoroughly cleaned, they and their staff quarantined, and their business affected. The hospitals in Singapore currently tasked to accept these cases are also not properly managing the flow. If someone has a fever and cough, and go to these hospital, they are sitting amongst other patients. These patient are in hospital for some medical reasons and are already low on immunity. By setting up specialized examination center across the island, it will avoid spreading to the already weak. The Chinese who were dealing with so many cases has already proven the X-ray is not effective in confirming if a patient has been infected with the coronavirus. Test kits results are also not entirely reliable. The main method in China is CT scan + test kit, with some suspected cases to be quarantined first and have a second CT to confirm. Many clinics in Singapore are not equipped to do the test, so it make even more senses to conduct the examination in specialized centers. 4. Until now, I still do not understand why the government is telling the public not to wear a face mask unless you are sick. How do you know if a sick person is wearing a face mask when he is supposed to? There are sick children who still goes to school despite been told not to, and there are those who are supposed to be under home quarantined and still roaming outside. Medical staff should be made to wear face mask compulsory while at work. Not only them, but professions that will face many people, such as drivers (2 out of 19 local cases are drivers), hawkers, airport staff, supermarket cashiers, should also be made to wear face mask compulsory. This is for their own protection as well as for the sake of others. 5. Discourage large gatherings, close down entertainment centers, cinemas, resorts and casinos. A few hundred Spaniards can destroy the great Aztec civilization and wipe out more than 90% of the Aztec population because the virus they carry are more efficient than guns. Every one patient is linked to a wide net of immediate family members and extended family members, young and old. Singapore is also one of the most densely populated place in the world. Prevention is better than cure.","Feb 9, 2020"

Prioritize these places and person who likely had higher interaction with other people  - Food court , stall with highest customer (drink stall could be the one) - Shopping mall in each district or most tourist visitor (city area) , most visited shops - Attraction place (Zoo, bird park and science center) - Office building (private or government institution). Start with most crowded building with many international employee (typically city area or industrial park) - Taxi company, driver that drive more routes from Changi Airport (to any place) in last 3 - 4 weeks  Once result out, it will provide more certainty and insight of virus spreading location, spreading rate and help to decide of next action (isolate building/area with most infected case)","Feb 9, 2020"

1.01578E+16,Quinn Wong,"Sorry to disturb. I really hope the below voice can be heard.  In the latest speech it says the fatality rate of this coronavirus is as low as flu.  After some research here are some more accurate data: for places outside hubei province of China the fatality rate is low which is of 0.2%, for hubei province it is 1.4%, but for Wuhan city in hubei province it is as high as 6%! Meanwhile it is way much more contagious than sars. Data is as of 1 Feb and should be higher now.  Low rate of 0.2% is a result of the super strict measures in other places of China which ban people going out without wearing mask, ban all gatherings, city lockdown etc etc. But Wuhan had such a high rate because in the first one month they didn't take any of above strict measures which caused large outbreak after 14 days incubation period.  In the latest speech it also mentioned that people with mild symptoms should go family GP and rest at home. Wuhan became such a mess also because those mildly infected ones self quarantine at home and then infected their family members and more. I am not sure our gov realized the different fatality rates in different places or not.Hope no outbreak in Singapore. Really praying.","Feb 8, 2020"

Could we - in future - ration the sale of masks and sanitizers once there is a confirmed case? Have heard anecdotal accounts of Chinese nationals snapping these up in boxes before the nationwide frenzy. While it is understandable for them to want to do that, can we make sure that it doesn’t lead to a mass frenzy?   While mortality rates are low, this virus is so much more infectious: the overall number of deaths is likely to be far higher. Isn’t that of huge concern to Singapore?  If so, could we cancel mass events? If not, what are concrete reasons?  If not, can there be clearer comms of what exactly are the safety measures to reassure the public? For example, in the case of the Chinese team still performing in the air show, what was being done to make sure they aren’t in incubation stage?  Very clear comms could allay fears and bring about understanding   We are now second in the world, outside of mainland China, with the highest number of infections. Could we have done more, and done more earlier? This could be a valuable lesson for future outbreaks.   Lastly given how the mortality rate is supposedly so low, are there specific reasons for 4 out of 30 patients being in more serious conditions? Again, clear explanations would be really helpful.  Lastly I do know this is a trying period for everyone including you. So please do take care!","Feb 9, 2020"

But none of the last three patients traveled to China, nor did they have any association with the coronary virus.   At the same time, the Singapore government moved  Orange is announced from Risk Level Yolo  The Singapore government has announced three risk levels to control the Corona virus.  The first Yola means the affected  The patients are Chinese citizens or have traveled to China recently   Second Risk Level Orange means that some locals are infected with the coronary virus who have not traveled to China or are not associated with any coronary disease.   The latest Risk Level Red (RED) means that Risk Level Red will be declared only if a coronary infected patient is detected across the country.  Then all offices, schools will be declared closed   Yesterday, locals and even residents in Singapore became alarmed with the announcement of the Ricks Level Orange.  When people get panic, their brains don't work   And there is no caste of terrorized people, no religion, no country  When a man becomes terrified he does not even know how.   The body temperature will be checked at the exit of each dormitory from today and after returning to the dormitory at work.  If a person has a body temperature of 1.5 degrees Celsius, he will be kept under close observation in a separate room.  Even when entering the office the body temperature will be checked   However, no migrant was infected with the Corona virus until the last news.  Singapore and China, as well as being a country, are also suspected of spreading the Corona virus in Singapore.   However, the expatriates need not panic  And there is no need to listen to the rumors of Facebook  Keep an eye on the Singapore Minster of Health Facebook page for the latest news about the Corona virus.","Feb 8, 2020"

After some research here are some more accurate data: for places outside hubei province of China the fatality rate is low which is of 0.2%, for hubei province it is 1.4%, but for Wuhan city in hubei province it is as high as 6%! Meanwhile it is way much more contagious than sars. Data is as of 1 Feb and should be higher now.  Low rate of 0.2% is a result of the super strict measures in other places of China which ban people going out without wearing mask, ban all gatherings, city lockdown etc etc. But Wuhan had such a high rate because in the first one month they didn't take any of above strict measures which caused large outbreak after 14 days incubation period.  In the latest speech it also mentioned that people with mild symptoms should go family GP and rest at home.

1.01578E+16,Irene Seah,"My message to MOH 6 days ago on 2 Feb that was unread as of now:  Dear Mr Lawrence Wong,  When the government decided to make it compulsory for those returning from China to go on Leave of Absence, did you consider that the majority of these people will be returning to their rented rooms and staying together with their landlords? While not going to work as a precaution to ensure the safety of the general public, landlords and their families are then forced into a situation where they have to be in close proximity to these “suspect” cases 24/7 for 14 days. These same people will be going to work and going about their daily business as usual. Does that not contravene the original purpose of your action – which is to safeguard the general public? Isn’t there a glaring loophole here?  I am a landlord to such a tenant who returned home just yesterday. And because I am not so unreasonable as to stop her from coming back to my place, I have decided to self-quarantine myself too as I also feel responsible to the general public. Fortunately, I am self-employed and work from home most of the time and so I can do this. But I am still inconvenienced as I have to refrain from visiting my elderly mother these two weeks or to meet my son when he books out of BMT for fear he may not be able to book in when he declares this situation to his army superiors.  But what about those landlords and family members who have to go to work? Wouldn’t it be the same as if the returning Chinese people were not required to go on Leave of Absence at all? That defeats the purpose of your action in the first place, wouldn’t it?  Last by not least, in this interview here, https://www.straitstimes.com/.../about-30000-work-pass... Mr Shanmugam said and I quote: ""You know they are on leave of absence or home quarantine so that the rest of Singapore, all of us, can be saved. So if they are tossed out onto the streets, where are they going to go? We have to avoid these sorts of irrational actions.""  Does that mean that the government is making martyrs of us landlords so that “the rest of Singapore, all of us, can be saved”? WOW – do we landlords get an award for this?","Feb 8, 2020"

1.01578E+16,Samuel Hay,"From:   PREVENTION AND CURE FOR CORONA VIRUS  Re: Health Crisis/ CORONA VIRUS CURE  I HAD SARS…              As an ardent researcher in many different fields some discoveries over the years have purposely been hidden away to protect Big Pharma’s massive profits. Some of these discoveries, it utilized could,  in addition to healing and creating an atmosphere of less suffering for millions of people worldwide, save our own Medicare and Medicaid programs.              Getting right to it, first of all there is a solution called ‘silver colloid’ which quite simply is microscopic silver particles in water. The brand I used to cure my killer staph infection which had me in bed for three months, dying, only took ten days to completely cure. Living is a wetland area I later cured myself of Lyme Disease in two weeks using the same silver colloid. I can only recommend Mesosilver as my personal experience was with this particular brand.              About forty years ago I discovered the properties of ozone in relation to fighting communicable disease. I had to build my own ozone machine. It and its replacements have run 24/7 for all this time. Although Big Pharma has most likely been the culprit in having the FDA issue a warning, Im 77 years old and healthy as a mule. No communicable disease in this household. When they first came on the market they were priced around $650.00 but today with mass production the average cost is around $100.00 and even less for smaller models which could be used in public bathrooms to eliminate all, I said “All” disease germs. Instantly kills the AIDS virus on contact for example and it would take at least 20 minutes in pure Clorox! Ozone will permeate every inch of homes/office.              The ozone produced in the machine is a very small amount especially compared with a lightning storm. That lightning is what cleanses the atmosphere. Have you ever seen a sign that said, “Do not breathe while near a thunderstorm?” I don’t think so. Without a positive mentality to cure not just treat contagious disease, no clinical tests will ever be performed. If you were dying from a contagious repertory disease, would you want to give it a go? I absolutely would!              Germs cannot, as with the silver, ever become immune and the Chinese are currently fearing a mutation of the germs creating a public health emergency there.              In layman’s terms, the microscopic silver particles in water do not work the same way as antibiotics. When the bacteria or virus uses it to hydrate, it cuts their guts apart.              The ozone produced by the machines is O3 allowing a very unstable electron to be pulled into the outer ring but is very unstable. When it comes in contact with other atoms it can be pulled away. In the event such nearby atoms are bacteria or virus, the germs are electrocuted on a microscopic scale.              The essence of this exercise is to make public the potential of these two discoveries as preventative and curative properties. When I go out in large crowds I spray my throat and nostrils with the silver colloids in water. Simple as that. You can take the silver internally and also apply it externally to wounds.","Feb 8, 2020"

1.01578E+16,Florence Wong,"Dear MOH, from my observation, I find it ironic that the pamphlet that came with the mask says ""Do not use this if you are well"". Have you ever assess that the problem lies with sick and lazy people insisting that they do not want to wear the mask? They are the cause of the shortage of masks. Infected are the minority while the healthy are the majority. It is because the healthy majority fear being infected, so everyone rushes to grab masks from anywhere they can purchase from and thus a panic to buy masks. Although I may be middle aged, I am very prone to anyone having flu or cough as I have bronchitis thus weak or no resistance against these sickness. Your regulations are lax and targeting the wrong group of people. The sick should be subjected to 3 month jail terms and $5000 fines or both, for going around spreading the virus. This is considered a light punishment. You should go around the shopping malls, bus stops, especially train stations where the sick sneeze and spraying their saliva into the air without covering their mouth. They think that just because there is no one on the side, they can just sneeze or cough everywhere they like. I saw 4 persons in Dhoby Ghaut Station on 8th Mar 2020 spraying their germs and viruses in the high traffic area during a period of 10 mins doing their virus spreading thing. It is really inconsiderate of them doing so. You should have a go and see the situation on the ground.

I STRONGLY SUGGEST ALL PERSONS BACK FROM CHINA MUST BE QUARANTINED AND MUST HAVE COMPULSORY MONITORING SYSTEM ON THE PROCEDURE. in case the potential virus carrier walk in crowded people.   look at the WuHan city now, what a disaster, because of panic of that, now almost all the cities in China launched most strict quarantine measures.

Since the later is not possible in the interim, we have to look at the former, but don't look too long, asymptomatic cases are forming, and spreading, and existing cases are worsening as I type.   With all due respect, LOA is one of the worse idea of containing the outbreak i have ever seen. One day we are not ensured the possible infected are safely under enforced quarantined, one more day of uncertainty, one more day of people rushing to buy masks and sanitizers.  I find it incredibly naive for the government to count on people to only wear masks when we are sick. In the days following the outbreak, everywhere i go, I see people coughing, sneezing without a mask. I see lots of people wearing masks wrongly. Perhaps the ministers should walk in the shoes of the people on the ground and see for yourself the effectiveness of your campaign.  If you are counting on public education to help contain the outbreak Minister, from what I can see, my personal perception is please, don't count on it. A lady coughing rejected a mask I offered to her today. This is not a good sign.   I am not trying to fear monger, Minister. Those are my personal opinions and observations.   Decisive actions must be taken now before we turn into the next Hubei.  We don't have the capacity or the people to build a 1000 bed hospital in 9 days sir.   I fear for the thousands of commuters who will be stuck in public transport tomorrow, in and enclosed space, most for over 30 minutes with very close contact in the morning and evenings.

What’s the basis to define taxi or public transport as transient contact and low risk? There are many reported cases infection spread in public transport and small space in taxi could make it worse. Wearing mask may not be the only solution to prevent spreading but given the highly contagious virus that can infect from eye, nose and mouth, is there harm to suggest wearing masks?

1.01577E+16,Kenneth Tay,"Dear sir,   Sorry to bother you during these difficult time due to the Coronavirus outbreak.   I understand that all work pass holders from China are allowed into Singapore after the Chinese New Year break. I understand the need of these workers as I am in the renovation industry.   I fully agree to have these workers on home-quarantine for 14 days upon their return and fully support this measure. But I have 1 concern on top of this move.   It is stated in many mainstream article that those infected or carrying the virus may not have any symptoms of illness. So, is it really safe for these home-quarantined workforce to return to work after 14 days if they do not show any symptoms? What if they are infected but did not show any symptoms?   I believe everyone is thoughtful and do not wish to spread the virus to people around them, especially their love ones. But I think many of those who affected others don't even know they had done so because they don't even know they themselves are infected.   As such, can you mandate that for all travellers, citizens & non-citizens, who had been to mainland China within the last 14 days, apart from the advised 14 days Home Quarantine, these people will also be required to test for the Coronavirus even if they did not show any symptoms, before they can return to work or back into the society?   I understand these may incur more cost and I think most employers will be willing to share the burden with our Government in fight to stop the spreading of the virus.   Also, so as to not cause further delay on these workforce to be back for work, the test can be done on the 10th day or 12th day of home quarantine, whichever experts deems proper and safe.   Thank you for your time reading my concern and hope you can seriously consider my humble suggestion.","Feb 5, 2020"

Some will take out and put on the table and use back again.  Some, will hold the masks on their hand, swing it around as they walk and chat with their friends.  Seriously? For those people who are sick, if you place your masks on the table, aint you contaminating the table? If you are not sick, aint you afraid of the table contaminating your mask?  For those who swing it around, if you are sick with airborne disease, aint you spreading it around by swinging it? That is why in some cases, wearing masks can make matter worse   I have seen 1 gal pull her mask down at the chin and stand at the bus stop opposite haw pah villa mrt station to smoke. What is the point of wearing mask when you periodically exposed your mouth and nose and touch your mask with your hands not knowing when your hand is dirty? To achieve a false sense of security?

While the risk of them passing to their colleagues is eliminated, the risk of them passing to their room mate is even higher due to the close proximity.

1.01577E+16,Irene Seah,"Dear Mr Lawrence Wong,  When the government decided to make it compulsory for those returning from China to go on Leave of Absence, did you consider that the majority of these people will be returning to their rented rooms and staying together with their landlords? While not going to work as a precaution to ensure the safety of the general public, landlords and their families are then forced into a situation where they have to be in close proximity to these “suspect” cases 24/7 for 14 days.  These same people will be going to work and going about their daily business as usual.  Does that not contravene the original purpose of your action – which is to safeguard the general public?  Isn’t there a glaring loophole here?  I am a landlord to such a tenant who returned home just yesterday.  And because I am not so unreasonable as to stop her from coming back to my place, I have decided to self-quarantine myself too as I also feel responsible to the general public.  Fortunately, I am self-employed and work from home most of the time and so I can do this.  But I am still inconvenienced as I have to refrain from visiting my elderly mother these two weeks or to meet my son when he books out of BMT for fear he may not be able to book in when he declares this situation to his army superiors.  But what about those landlords and family members who have to go to work?  Wouldn’t it be the same as if the returning Chinese people were not required to go on Leave of Absence at all?  That defeats the purpose of your action in the first place, wouldn’t it?  Last by not least, in this interview here, https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/about-30000-work-pass-holders-from-china-yet-to-return-josephine-teo Mr Shanmugam said and I quote: ""You know they are on leave of absence or home quarantine so that the rest of Singapore, all of us, can be saved. So if they are tossed out onto the streets, where are they going to go? We have to avoid these sorts of irrational actions.""  Does that mean that the government is making martyrs of us landlords so that “the rest of Singapore, all of us, can be saved”?  WOW – do we landlords get an award for this?","Feb 2, 2020"

1.01577E+16,Madz Anthony Azur Dimaiwat,"THREE MORE CONFIRMED IMPORTED CASES OF WUHAN CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN SINGAPORE  30TH JAN 2020                    As of 30 January 2020, 2pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed three additional imported cases of Wuhan coronavirus infection in Singapore. Ten confirmed cases were earlier announced by MOH.  2.               There is currently no evidence of community spread in Singapore.  About the cases  Case 11  3.               The 11th case is a 31 year-old female Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on 22 January. She was a travelling companion of the fourth confirmed case1. She is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).  4.               The case reported that she was asymptomatic during her flight to Singapore. She was identified as a close contact of the fourth confirmed case and had been quarantined from 26 January. She developed symptoms on 27 January, and was admitted to NCID. Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on 29 January at about 11pm.  Case 12  5.               The 12th confirmed case is a 37 year-old female Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with her family on 22 January. She is currently warded in an isolation room at the NCID.  6.               The case reported that she was asymptomatic during her flight to Singapore. She subsequently developed symptoms on 26 January. She took a taxi to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 29 January, and was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated at NCID. Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on 29 January at about 11pm.  7.               Prior to hospital admission, the case stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa (10 Artillery Avenue), Hotel 81 Princess (21 Lorong 12 Geylang) and Home Suite View Hotel (12 Lorong 12 Geylang). She indicated that she had visited Orchard Road and Geylang, and had travelled by taxi. The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low.  Case 13  8.               The 13th confirmed case is a 73 year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan with her family on 21 January. She was tested positive for Wuhan coronavirus infection on 30 January at about 2pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID and her condition is stable.  9.               MOH has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases.  Update on condition of confirmed cases  10.           The three new cases are stable currently, and we are continuing to monitor their health. As for the ten previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving.   Update on suspect cases  11.           As of 30 January, 12pm, 164 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and 13 have tested positive (case 13 was confirmed at about 2pm, 30 January). Test results for the remaining 49 cases are pending.  Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases  12.           Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.  13.           As of 30 January, 12pm, MOH has identified 170 close contacts. Of the 139 who are still in Singapore, 135 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining four close contacts.  Health advisory  14.           Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.  15.           All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.  16.           Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times: ·       Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats; ·       Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness; ·       Observe good personal hygiene; ·       Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing); ·       Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath; ·       Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and ·       Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.  17.           MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan cluster.  ____________ 1  The fourth case is a 36 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on 22 January.","Jan 30, 2020"

1.01577E+16,Jimmy Seng-Kuan Gan,"Dear MOH, There is one fundamental flaw in the idea of distributing 4 mask to each household and telling everyone not to use it unless you are sick. The assumption made is that those who are sick and may have the Wuhan coronavirus will be responsible to use a mask when they are in the public places, what if they don't?  Wouldn't it then mean that the healthy Singaporean walking around without a mask can still catch virus? I was at the GP on Wednesday, 29 Jan after all the heightened alert about the virus, still there were patients there coughing away without a mask on. So I think there is a flaw in the comment that healthy Singaporeans should not wear mask to protect themselves.","Jan 30, 2020"

We are quite fearful due to many cases of infected people in SG...  Expected human flow maybe a few hundreds crowding at every RC/CC especially the first few days... at the same time...

In time like this whereby there is a high risk of the spread of the contagious 2019nCOV, people will be fearful of those inconsiderate people and take precaution to protect themselves.  The ministers can continue to harp on people not to wear masks when they r not sick. But please try to understand the feeling of the common people who have to take the crowded MRT and buses or face many people in their line of work in every working days to earn a living and to feed their family. They r not like you who own cars and r always able to avoid crowds. They may have old folks or children at home who cannot afford to fall sick due to their low immunity system.  If you want the people to stop wearing mask when they r not sick, then you have to ensure those who r sick must wear masks in public places. You must enforce and carry out actions such as catching those sick people who do not wear masks in public while coughing, ask for their reasons and give warnings or fine. The gov have to drill into the minds of the group of inconsiderate people to practice social responsibility and practice wearing masks in public when they r sick. Teach people not to sneeze and cough directly into others. Through media production, spread the educational message across repetitively through multiple channels, advertising on buses, taxi, etc.  It’s time for the people (both local and foreigners) in Singapore to have more awareness of their social responsibility and practice good habits.

Would like to offer some suggestion (even though I’m pretty sure any feedbacks are probably ignored) regarding masks, can we either distribute to letterbox (thru Singpost) or distribute by community centre based on household or NRIC (can do a general deduction via medisave or charge 0.1% additional tax for this year if you really need to cover the cost) This way everyone gets it properly and equally. The entire nation is just wasting time wandering around NTUC and pharmacy everyday hoping to buy some masks for the most basic protection we are now deprived of.

First Observation - within a matter of days, Singapore has run out of face masks. None of the pharmacies I visited today have a single piece of mask left. Why is this so? Is it because our supply chain is not robust? Is it because we allowed visitors to buy an indiscriminate number of masks? Are these visitors exporting masks? Are businesses being held accountable or are they diverting the masks to the next most profitable client / country? Is the government doing anything to investigate / verify / and place measures to counteract the above-mentioned points via solid actions? I strongly recommend that the government work to Ensure a strong supply of masks. A suggestion - Restrict Tourists to purchase only 1 piece per passport per day and reserve at least X pieces of mask per Singapore residing household per day, depending on the number of family members. You have all the data. Please Ensure that you remember a fundamental principle: Singaporeans should be entitled to a safe environment and it is your duty to deliver on that entitlement.  2. Second observation - Only today was it released that Hubei residents will be restricted from entering Singapore. 3 questions come to mind - Why only Hubei and not Whole of China? n-COV is more contagious than SARS. Why only today and not within 48 hours of the crisis? Why did we allow approx 2000 China visitors to roam the streets freely? I am sure you and your team of able Ministers had consulted very able and talented Doctors, Professors, International agencies. It is public news days ago that this virus is more virulent and contagious than SARS. Should stronger measures not have been put into place within 24-48H of the virus becoming international news? Have you questioned the speed, efficiency and confidence with which you and your fellow ministers have put in place measures?  Minister, do remember that the health & safety of all Singaporeans is your responsibility.  And it seems to many Singaporeans at this juncture, that this responsibility is not being carried out well. Prove us wrong. Just ask yourself if we want Singaporean deaths and infections arising from this. Many families will suffer the consequences.  Please also activate our defence force . The army ambulances should be activated to cope, non-sensitive camps should be used as a “fever centre” to ease the load on Hospitals and GPs.   Please, implement with speed. Take a strong stand, and take risks, that would pay off for the well being of Singaporeans.   Thank you.","Jan 28, 2020"

I feel rationing may not be the best way to curb hoarding or reselling or mass buying to send them overseas. It may result in frustration and even cause unnecessary panic. Maybe the govt can consider distributing them via local community channels like the CCs etc. Each Singaporean is entitled to buy one box. So if you have a family of 5, you can get 5 boxes. Each box has 50 masks and that should go a long way to reassure Singaporeans on masks availability over the next few weeks.

While alot of them are private businesses, it would not be far fetched for government to impose this for a while.

It's the children, the elderly folks, and those with an already compromised immunity in our families.  Apparently, the system has so far failed to detect the asymptomatic but already infected Wuhan residents who managed to roam freely in our public places using our public transport, putting the public, especially those who work at the front-line, at unnecessary risk.   Personally, i am concerned about how robust the system really is.  Even with the help of contact tracing ( which is both time- and resources-consuming) in the aftermath, how likely is it able to get hold of all those who have been in close contact for reasonable amount of time with the infected persons?

1.01577E+16,Datuk Duke Tan,"Dear Dr. Lam Pin Min（蓝彬明）good evening.   By way of introductions, I am BK Tan , and travel frequently. As a Singaporean, my immediate concerns are with respect to service staff at the many hotels throughout the island; as well as the safety of our Singapore Cabin Crew and Tech Crew.   Over the past week, as the news updates of the 2019-nCoV was released, many individuals, including myself, have concerns that front line staff throughout the service industry (such as hoteliers and airline crew) whom are the most exposed to the virus are not taking sufficient measures to protect themselves.   I however do not fault these employees since the concern of the everyday Asian (and Singaporean worker) is a fear of backlash and repercussions (from the employer) for making that first step to “protect oneself”.   News reports have shown that the strain we are dealing with today can very well be more potent than SARS. As an ex-employee of the Singapore Airlines group, I have witnessed first hand the impact of a slump in travel due to SARS. Surplus aircraft were parked at the taxiways as space was constrained; staff took a paycut across the board; voluntary retirement schemes were introduced etc.   I keep hearing “we can better manage today’s situation because of the lessons from SARS.” However, have we really?   A Leader is one whom always has the employee’s welfare (health included) at heart. We do not wish to wait for the first accident / casualty because of a mindset that business takes precedence over employee welfare.   Based on clarification (https://www.facebook.com/6352578678/posts/10158135435373679/) I know for a fact that at Singapore Airlines, crew may AT THEIR DISCRETION use masks and disposable gloves when on rostered for China bound flights. Should they wish to, other than within the aircraft cabin, aircrew may wear masks at public areas (hotels and airport terminal); and on crew transport (to/from airport terminal and hotel). I applaud this BUT only on the surface since Management has not made this a MANDATORY requirement.   Whilst good presentation and looks are key for service staff, this surely must now take secondary importance. From this point onwards, at least till we can find a cure for the virus, it must be brains before beauty.   I ask that through the Ministry of Health, Singapore, MAKE IT MANDATORY, for Aircrew to down masks (at minimum) for ALL FLIGHTS, this on the basis that Singapore is a transit hub, for Travelers (including inbound from and outbound to China), flying internationally.   Am confident that the Singapore Ministry of Manpower requires all employers to instill a safe work place environment, and Temasek as Singapore Airlines’* largest shareholder surely would want workplace safety to be always instilled at all times.   On this basis, please consider making it MANDATORY (not optional) for ALL SERVICE STAFF (hoteliers, aircrew etc) the use of masks, gloves and other protection gear (as necessary). Specific for the aircrew, the mandate should be extended for ALL FLIGHTS instead of restricting this to solely CHINA operations. Everyone of us, are well aware of why there is a need for better protection, given the circumstances at hand and only hope for a better and more responsible Management that places emphasis on their front line staff health and safety.   *includes SilkAir and FlyScoot as SQ group wholly owned subsidiaries.","Jan 28, 2020"

1.01577E+16,Eng Lee,"Philippines has already made moves to stop Chinese visitors from Wuhan entering and are getting the ones already on Boracay flown out of there. “According to a report from CNA, “Philippine authorities are sending back nearly 500 Chinese tourists who came from Wuhan.” “The tourists had arrived in Kalibo; that’s a stepping stone to the holiday hot spot of Boracay, just before Manila announced it was halting flights from Wuhan on Thursday night.” One anchor went onto say: “authorities have arranged four flights to take them back to Wuhan.”  Taiwan and Thailand have also taken steps to deal with the coronavirus by stopping any more groups from entering their countries.  “Taipei said it was barring almost all visitors from China in an effort to stop the virus from taking hold on the island, as governments around the world stepped up efforts to halt the spread of the Sars-like disease”  Our Singapore authorities have set up screening points but frankly that is not effective in containing the spread. Screening is a very weak precaution as the virus isn’t detected straightaway.   We hope our leaders will not be afraid to take bolder steps to stop issuing visas to big groups and individual visitors from Hubei and the surrounding cities. Whilst we can’t stop everyone, surely we must do more because this tiny island can not afford to have an epidemic.    Please don’t wait till it gets full blown before something is done. It will be much more costly than losing the present tourist dollars.   https://philnews.ph/2020/01/24/virologist-who-helped-fight-sars-says-wuhan-coronavirus-is-10x-worse/?fbclid=IwAR3kQr3an3epRioe609lZBEFh_DIDzuCdkmaL0-toriwdRn7802UbxlSyho#.XipiYtB0AQE.facebook  Dr. Guyan Yi, director of the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong echoed concerns that the virus in Wuhan was already “uncontrollable”. As per the report, Dr. Guan Yi who was in Wuhan this week said that he had to “escape” after observing an appalling lack of preventative measures by the local authorities.  He who dealt with SARS has said this is 10x worse so the government needs to make sound bold moves in stopping visitors from Wuhan and surrounding cities from coming in.  It may not be a guarantee but it is definitely better than just screening visitors from the infected areas.  We can’t fully stop the spread but at least stronger precautions rather than simply relying on screening should be implemented.","Jan 26, 2020"

(no two persons have the same Wuhan-CV immunity resistance, perhaps).   Why HSA /GP not initiating ""N95 Mask"" public education for all coughers to don on mask; so many people are coughing at malls, foodcourts and fastfoods?  Why are customs officers risking infection without mask?  Those who will be returning from epicentre of Wuhan CV, are there robust quarantine /declaration/ disinfection procedures?  Are schools alerted to send students back or to quarantine if excessive coughing and/or high fever?  And how are our healthcare professionals protected from Wuhan CV without getting infected; how many got infected as a result?  Are Grabs/Taxi drivers/Bus drivers to don mask as basic defence against Wuhan CV/carriers?  Are cleaners/ food handlers /Grab food or those on duty to put on mask/gloves ; if coughing and feverish?  Prevention is better than CURE; worst incurable as Wuhan CV gets mutated, elusive and ""recessive"".   Do we have enough N95 masks during the ""Wuhan CV"" season?

Alot of questions may be on ur mind right now while we continue our daily lives.   I have seen many fear mongering spreading among the chats. Let's not spread fear among ourselves and trust that our govt agencies are doing their best to ensure safety of our people. We have been tru SARs and H1N1.  The lessons learnt from there will be implemented swiftly within our shores.  In this time the need for *psychological defence* is paramount to ensure we stand as a one, as singaporeans ensuring continuity of lives.   As extracted from Total Defence:  Psychological Defence.   ""The will and resolve to defend our way of life and interests, and the fighting spirit to overcome challenges together.""  Singapore's ability to overcome threats and challenges that come our way depends on the collective will of our people to defend our way of life, the resolve to stand up for Singapore when pressured by forces that undermine our national interests, and the fighting spirit to press on and overcome crises together.  This is Psychological Defence.  Stay safe out there. Cheers.","Jan 26, 2020"

1.01577E+16,Tim Tan,"This guy stayed at Sentosa but decided to come all the way to the neighbourhoods to SKGH in Sengkang instead of the nearest hospital at SGH. Similar to the 3rd case who went to Orchard/MBS/GBTB etc via public transport, these clowns are taking the opportunity to jalan jalan as much as possible. And why not? Unlike some of our neighbouring countries who have gone all out to ban and/or return Wuhan/Chinese people to their origins, when are our leaders and authorities going to have more balls to take firmer measures for the general welfare of the Singaporean public?  Our current strategy is to let them have a free pass to roam around Singapore in any way they like until they come down with symptoms, but by then it would be probably too late and they would have likely infected others around them. Is that really the best that our multi-million paid leaders can come up with?  As further evidence of the incompetency of the top here, Malaysia's 4 confirmed cases also all have links to Singapore. And yet here our leaders are simply singing rhetoric by telling everybody to ""work together"" when they as key decision makers are so lacking. Is economy, GDP and $$$ really so much more important?  Fullest respect to the frontline workers and medical professionals on the ground though. Pity all of us have opera singers as leaders to make our jobs and lives much tougher and more uncertain.","Jan 26, 2020"

1.01577E+16,Siew Hong Alice,"Can MOH publish the incubation period for 2019 nCOVs ? CDC warned about 2-14days. From these 4 cases of wuhan nCOVs, they only developed symptoms few days after arriving Singapore, and this has confirmed the incubation period suspect. Yet they are not requested to quarantined for 14 days nor wearing the mask (despite not sick at arrivals) and allowed to travel around Singapore and risk other innocent people especially the vulnerable kids and oldies (they are the group usually hard to persuaded to put on mask).   Secondly, can immigration published the number of wuhan visitors has arrived Singapore that’s are risk of 14 days incubation period and track down them to quarantine? Waiting them to wander around in public and only show up after sick is reactive and we need them to be aware and responsible ppl to self quarantine. Yes, it might cost in reduced tourist spending, but it’s necessary to prevent virus transmission to the public. Life of citizens and our dear frontline medical officers is invaluable. A doctor has risked his life on cny day 1. We wouldn’t want to see such sad news happening on sg health care. Think about the SARS lessons learnt.   Thirdly, Shouldn’t the innocent public to encouraged to put on mask in view of thousands of Wuhan tourists have arrived Singapore and not practicing self quarantine ? It’s very sad to read that the latest news of wuhan nCOVs  confirmed case at Sengkang general hospital and the person might went to compass one. Report their travel history and bring awareness to the possible affected public to start wearing mask because you wouldn’t if you have contracted but at least u can wear mask to protect your family from getting it.

Due to this drastic action by the said doctors, the result is many people are now afraid to consult them when they are genuinely feeling unwell.  I understand that given the current situation, doctors would rather take precautions based on MOH's guidelines and err on the side of caution, than be guilty of not following protocols.  On reflection, I personally don't think that this is fair to the patient for being treated as a suspected case merely on the doctor's suspicions.

Children don’t need to suffers rapes just because the men feel that their vaginal are big from natural birth or after rapes abuses !!!!!!!!!!! Plastic surgeon can recreate vaginal beautifully to create maximum pleasure for men and please destroy it for fun as our children are raped and murder because they are raped and they feel it’s a insult which nobody can accept it !

Are there people who went for injection without booking? 2. Did the booking system block dates or timing if it is full? Or is it due to lack of staffs?

1.01589E+16,Kaye Ng,"Dear MOH, is it MOH intention or SOP to make elderly wait for at least 3 hours for vaccination?   Me, my hubby and kid went all the way from the south to the north to fetch my mum from Yishun to Woodlands Galaxy CC on Saturday 27 Feb. My mum waited 1 hr for a queue number ticket. The PA staff (I assume) advised the crowd to return home, register for a new date again and come back another day. Some were dismayed and argued with the staff, some feedbacked they don’t know technology. I told the staff that “this is last thing I wanna hear after coming all the way here”.  I was bewildered, if you have expected weekends to be so crowded and tedious waiting, why set these seniors appointments on Saturday? Not to mention young people are also allowed to register during this period which I thought is supposed to prioritize the seniors... if not for the staff to suggest we could collect a queue tix, leave for dinner and come back 2 hrs later to take the jab, I would be more annoyed. He has provided an App to show the queue status.   After returning to the CC, my mum had to wait for another hour seated in the indoor auditorium to get the jab.. we were all beat and exhausted, I am sure other seniors and their caregivers also feel the same.",Feb-28
1.01589E+16,Vivian Tan,"I can appreciate how SG has just started on the covid vaccination initiative for the elderlies.  someone just came to my door this morning... volunteers for the Covid-19 vaccination... supposedly meant to help elderlies make their vaccination appointments.   Regarding these volunteers who came to my door... How could MOH release / divulge my dad's personal data to them?  It wasn't a random knock on each residence, but they specifically came to look up my dad because they were given his name and address, and not sure what other data.  These are volunteers... Not MOH staff.. How could they be authorised to handle personal data?   Would this be considered a breach of PDPA?  And we have had cases of scammers/pranksters going around carrying out their act of deceit in the name of MOH during this pandemic.  It is unnerving to get strangers coming to one's doorstep without being first informed by MOH regarding this form of enthusiastic outreach towards the elderlies.  I look forward to receiving a verification from MOH at the soonest possible.  Gan Kim Yong Gan Kim Yong",Feb-23

We probably knew someone who was badly hit by the virus in one way or another. We lost our connectivity abroad. Some of us lost even more than that. Today, Singapore is on the road to recovery. We have the people and we know what needs to get done. Bring back our lives and build back better from it. I am extremely moved that the first dedicated facility for travellers has been opened. We have proven we can manage the risk and yet we can't afford to shake the confidence that we have in our community. I note that the task force constantly remind us to stay vigilant and we will indeed continue to stay alert. We have to stay safe and we have each other to cover our backs. This is our responsibility to save lives and we have what it takes.  We will be able to get it done. We have friends and neighbours who will support us and get behind us. ",Feb-19

1.01589E+16,Wilson EL Tan,"02月18日 新加坡疫情统计数据报告：新增确诊病例11，累计确诊病例59,879，(包括：累计境外及客工确诊病例56,888、累计社区确诊病例2,944、累计旅客确诊病例47)，累计重症住院病例20(其中累计危重症病例1)，累计死亡病例29，累计确诊轻症隔离病例104，累计治愈病例59,679，死亡率0.04%。 Roylab Stats World Map全球新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例超110,703,624，累计死亡病例超2,447,941，死亡率2.21%。 美国新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例28,462,145，累计死亡病例502,787，死亡率1.76%。占全球确诊率25.71%，占全球死亡率20.53%。马来西亚排列47、中国排列84、新加坡排列96。 正月初七食七样菜：华人新春传统习俗 相传女媧氏开天辟地，第一日作鸡、二日作狗、三日作豬、四日作羊、五日作牛、六日作馬、七日作人，因而把初七称为人日。古书记载正月初七为人日节，初七早上妇女就会采集菠菜、芹菜、茴香、蒜、蔥、韭菜、芥菜、白菜等七样菜共煮而食，这叫七样菜。南朝·梁宗懍《荊楚岁时记》云：“正月初七日为人日，以七样菜为羹。吃七菜羹、七菜粥的习俗在日本平安时代由唐朝传入日本，一直保留至今，日本人在新年期间(正月初七)吃的七种野菜为：水芹、荠菜、御形(鼠麴草)、繁缕、仏(佛)之座(稻槎菜)、菘(芜菁)、萝蔔。正月初七吃七样菜，这一古老的中原习俗在潮汕大地保留下來、历久弥新。潮汕人的七种菜配合主要为了过年图个吉利，一般包括芹菜、葱、蒜仔(蒜苗)、韭菜、菜头(萝蔔)、厚合菜(豬毑菜)、春菜、芥兰、飞龙菜(菠菜)。潮汕人吃七样菜在於它的好意头，它使人们吃出了好心情，同时又寄托了人们期盼财运兴旺、顺风顺水、吉祥如意的心愿。潮汕地区还有一首关于七样羹的民謠：七样羹，七样羹，大人吃了变后生(年轻)，奴仔(小孩)吃了变红芽(面色红润)，姿娘(女子)吃了如拋(朵)花。其实，人日吃七样菜，是有一定的科学根据的，此时春气生，天寒渐暖，菜蔬逐渐多起來。食混合菜，能使肠胃适应季节转变。而且初一到初六每个人都已吃到肚满肠肥，初七日吃多点蔬菜清清肠胃，对身体也有莫大益处!

1.01589E+16,Keeyan Ho,"MOH advise that we check with our doctor to see if we are suitable to take the vaccination but which doctor? The doctor at the pte neighbourhood clinic I pop into once in a while when I could not sleep, experienced tummy upset, or minor accidental injuries? Or the doctor in the cardiac clinic who sees me twice a year? Or the doctor in the otolaryngology clinic whose prescription solved my problem but caused another problem which still afflicts me to this day three months later?

1.01589E+16,Joseph Tan,"Is global mass vaccination really the best and only way forward? . Or is there some herd mentality among global leaders, and public health professionals, with biased favor for ""prestigious"" ""high-tech"" vaccines, instead of ""low-tech"" N95 masks? Or even some profit-driven interest in pushing widespread vaccination instead of widespread N95 mask usage? . Have countries like Singapore tried getting people involved in border control, to have strict N95 mask protocols, before deeming border leaks as inevitable? Or are people like bus drivers and quarantine-hotel staff free to wear whatever random low-effectiveness piece of cloth that they fancy? . Wouldn't widespread N95 mask usage effectively lead to ""herd immunity""? (Instead of other low-efficiency masks that keep the virus circulating in lower doses that reduce disease severity and thus evade detection.) . Vaccines: ~$20 each (cost of distribution not yet included). Pros deemed to outweigh the Cons, by the same global group of people who told us sars-cov-2 wasn't airborne, when evidence of airborne transmission of previous coronaviruses was already available but ignored. And while evidence of long-term safety of covid vaccines is absent. And are the ones who earlier rejected widespread mask usage as pointless, thus are psychologically predisposed to not consider widespread mask usage as the actual solution. . Future of reliance on vaccine: Lengthy global ""anti-social"" measures the next time a virulent airborne disease surfaces, while waiting for vaccine development. Potential for huge profits for Pharm industry if adverse long-term health consequences eventually surface with high frequency. . N95 Masks: ~$1 each, easily reused for a month. Much more politically/morally feasible to force entire populations to use them, compared to the vaccines. Pandemic could have ended months ago, with widespread N95 mask usage, achieving sufficient ""herd immunity"" for transmission to fizzle out globally. Probably can get 1 N95 mask per person for global population, in 1 month's time.  Child-sized N95 masks can be promptly implemented, unlike vaccines which are neither tested nor implemented on children. . Future of reliance on N95 Masks: Swift implementation to eradicate human-human transmission. Can be stored easily, and for years with negligible decrease in filtration efficiency. . According to scmp news:  An American firm is stuck with 30 million N95 masks, while 90% of mask factories in China were closed (2nd half of 2020).  U.S. guidelines still discourage general population from using N95s.  U.S. FDA still designates N95 masks as being in short supply.  https://www.scmp.com/video/coronavirus/3122177/us-stuck-30-million-locally-made-n95-masks-it-cant-sell  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/one-third-of-us-military-refusing-covid-19-vaccine-pentagon-14224202  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-health-care-worker-reluctance/  https://www.webmd.com/drug-medication/news/20190208/fluoroquinolones-over-prescribed-despite-dangers",Feb-19

1.01589E+16,Wilson EL Tan,"02月13日 新加坡疫情统计数据报告：新增确诊病例09，累计确诊病例59,833，(包括：累计境外及客工确诊病例56,843、累计社区确诊病例2,943、累计旅客确诊病例47)，累计重症住院病例34(其中累计危重症病例1)，累计死亡病例29，累计确诊轻症隔离病例119，累计治愈病例59,604，死亡率0.04%。 Roylab Stats World Map全球新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例超108,953,518，累计死亡病例超2,400,408，死亡率2.20%。 美国新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例28,125,957，累计死亡病例492,933，死亡率1.75%。占全球确诊率25.81%，占全球死亡率20.53%。马来西亚排列49、中国排列84、新加坡排列96。 疫苗作为抵御病毒全球大流行的终极武器，被人们寄予厚望，疫苗是解决新冠肺炎病毒最根本办法，不管哪个国家做出来疫苗，都不能供应全世界，这需要互相学习，且做出来后取长补短，可能要由很多厂家来生产，才能够供应全世界。世界卫生组织（WHO）呼吁全球合作伙伴共同发起全球合作加速开发、生产、公平获取新冠肺炎防控新工具的倡议。新冠病毒是一种新病毒，疫苗研发有很多不确定因素，多种技术路线并进才是多保险方案，为了更大限度地提升疫苗研发的成功率，在梳理分析不同的技术基础和可能性之后，科研攻关组布局了病毒的灭活疫苗、核酸疫苗、重组蛋白疫苗、腺病毒载体疫苗、减毒流感病毒载体疫苗这样5条技术路线。目前国际上绝大多数疫苗都处于临床研究阶段，中国有4种疫苗即腺病毒载体疫苗和3种灭活疫苗；美国有3种包括莫德纳药企的mRNA疫苗、辉瑞药企的mRNA疫苗、Inovio药企的DNA载体疫苗；英国有1种为牛津大学的腺病毒载体疫苗。 灭活疫苗是最传统的经典技术路线：即在体外培养新冠病毒，然后将其灭活，使之没有毒性，但这些病毒仍能刺激人体产生抗体，使免疫细胞记住病毒的模样，灭活疫苗的优点是制备方法简单快速，安全性比较高，它是应对急性疾病传播通常采用的手段，其缺点如接种剂量大、免疫期短、免疫途径单一等，而有时会造成抗体依赖增强效应（ADE），使病毒感染加重，会导致疫苗研发失败的严重不良反应。 腺病毒载体疫苗是用经过改造后无害的腺病毒作为载体，装入新冠病毒的S蛋白基因，制成腺病毒载体疫苗，刺激人体产生抗体。S蛋白是新冠病毒入侵人体细胞的关键“钥匙”，无害的腺病毒戴上S蛋白的“帽子”，假装自己很“凶”，让人体产生免疫记忆。优点是：安全、高效、引发的不良反应少。这种疫苗有成功先例，缺点，重组病毒载体疫苗研发需要考虑如何克服“预存免疫”，大多数人成长过程中曾感染过5型腺病毒，体内可能存在能中和腺病毒载体的抗体，从而可能攻击载体、降低疫苗效果。 核酸疫苗包括mRNA疫苗和DNA疫苗，是将编码S蛋白的基因，mRNA或DNA直接注入人体，利用人体细胞在人体内合成S蛋白，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于把一份记录详细的病毒档案交给人体的免疫系统。优点是：研制时不需要合成蛋白质或病毒，流程简单，安全性相对比较高，核酸疫苗是全世界都在积极探索的疫苗研发新技术，缺点是：无成功先例，多数国家无法大规模生产，可能因价格较贵而难以普及到低收入国家。 重组蛋白疫苗，也称基因工程重组亚单位疫苗，是通过基因工程方法，大量生产新冠病毒最有可能作为抗原的S蛋白，把它注射到人体，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于不生产完整病毒，而是单独生产很多新冠病毒的关键部件“钥匙”，将其交给人体的免疫系统认识。优点是：安全、高效、可规模化生产，有成功先例，重组亚单位疫苗的缺点是需要找到一个好的表达系统，这很困难。 病毒减毒活疫苗是非常重要的一类疫苗，是低毒性流感病毒戴上新冠病毒S蛋白“帽子”后形成的融合病毒，可以一石二鸟，既能防流感又能防新冠。 每逢佳节倍思亲，挥之不去的怀念，抹之不掉的回忆，音容不忘永常在。树欲静而风不止、子欲养而亲不在。高山仰望止于前、大海无边渡于岸。沉舟侧伴千帆过、病树前头万木春。子鼠疫年千家災、丑牛苗种万民安。",Feb-14

Are u just gonna let Covid positive people running around after u introduced it to them and then claim that ever1 else is being irresponsible? Another question I have for u. The Chinatown dude and son being positive a few days back. They still manage to go through their temperature screening counters in public?

1.01589E+16,Wilson EL Tan,"02月12日 新加坡疫情统计数据报告：新增确诊病例18，累计确诊病例59,824，(包括：累计境外及客工确诊病例56,834、累计社区确诊病例2,943、累计旅客确诊病例47)，累计重症住院病例33(其中累计危重症病例1)，累计死亡病例29，累计确诊轻症隔离病例157，累计治愈病例59,558，死亡率0.04%。 Roylab Stats World Map全球新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例超108,356,813，累计死亡病例超2,381,011，死亡率2.19%。 美国新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例28,002,240，累计死亡病例486,922，死亡率1.73%。占全球确诊率25.84%，占全球死亡率20.45%。马来西亚排列49、中国排列84、新加坡排列96。 灭活疫苗是最传统的经典技术路线：即在体外培养新冠病毒，然后将其灭活，使之没有毒性，但这些病毒仍能刺激人体产生抗体，使免疫细胞记住病毒的模样，灭活疫苗的优点是制备方法简单快速，安全性比较高，它是应对急性疾病传播通常采用的手段，其缺点如接种剂量大、免疫期短、免疫途径单一等，而有时会造成抗体依赖增强效应（ADE），使病毒感染加重，会导致疫苗研发失败的严重不良反应。 腺病毒载体疫苗是用经过改造后无害的腺病毒作为载体，装入新冠病毒的S蛋白基因，制成腺病毒载体疫苗，刺激人体产生抗体。S蛋白是新冠病毒入侵人体细胞的关键“钥匙”，无害的腺病毒戴上S蛋白的“帽子”，假装自己很“凶”，让人体产生免疫记忆。优点是：安全、高效、引发的不良反应少。这种疫苗有成功先例，缺点，重组病毒载体疫苗研发需要考虑如何克服“预存免疫”，大多数人成长过程中曾感染过5型腺病毒，体内可能存在能中和腺病毒载体的抗体，从而可能攻击载体、降低疫苗效果。 核酸疫苗包括mRNA疫苗和DNA疫苗，是将编码S蛋白的基因，mRNA或DNA直接注入人体，利用人体细胞在人体内合成S蛋白，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于把一份记录详细的病毒档案交给人体的免疫系统。优点是：研制时不需要合成蛋白质或病毒，流程简单，安全性相对比较高，核酸疫苗是全世界都在积极探索的疫苗研发新技术，缺点是：无成功先例，多数国家无法大规模生产，可能因价格较贵而难以普及到低收入国家。 重组蛋白疫苗，也称基因工程重组亚单位疫苗，是通过基因工程方法，大量生产新冠病毒最有可能作为抗原的S蛋白，把它注射到人体，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于不生产完整病毒，而是单独生产很多新冠病毒的关键部件“钥匙”，将其交给人体的免疫系统认识。优点是：安全、高效、可规模化生产，有成功先例，重组亚单位疫苗的缺点是需要找到一个好的表达系统，这很困难。 病毒减毒活疫苗是非常重要的一类疫苗，是低毒性流感病毒戴上新冠病毒S蛋白“帽子”后形成的融合病毒，可以一石二鸟，既能防流感又能防新冠。 ",Feb-12

1.01589E+16,Wilson EL Tan,新冠病毒是一种新病毒，疫苗研发有很多不确定因素，多种技术路线并进才是多保险方案，为了更大限度地提升疫苗研发的成功率，在梳理分析不同的技术基础和可能性之后，科研攻关组布局了病毒的灭活疫苗、核酸疫苗、重组蛋白疫苗、腺病毒载体疫苗、减毒流感病毒载体疫苗这样5条技术路线。目前国际上绝大多数疫苗都处于临床研究阶段，中国有4种疫苗即腺病毒载体疫苗和3种灭活疫苗；美国有3种包括莫德纳药企的mRNA疫苗、辉瑞药企的mRNA疫苗、Inovio药企的DNA载体疫苗；英国有1种为牛津大学的腺病毒载体疫苗。 灭活疫苗是最传统的经典技术路线：即在体外培养新冠病毒，然后将其灭活，使之没有毒性，但这些病毒仍能刺激人体产生抗体，使免疫细胞记住病毒的模样，灭活疫苗的优点是制备方法简单快速，安全性比较高，它是应对急性疾病传播通常采用的手段，其缺点如接种剂量大、免疫期短、免疫途径单一等，而有时会造成抗体依赖增强效应（ADE），使病毒感染加重，会导致疫苗研发失败的严重不良反应。 腺病毒载体疫苗是用经过改造后无害的腺病毒作为载体，装入新冠病毒的S蛋白基因，制成腺病毒载体疫苗，刺激人体产生抗体。S蛋白是新冠病毒入侵人体细胞的关键“钥匙”，无害的腺病毒戴上S蛋白的“帽子”，假装自己很“凶”，让人体产生免疫记忆。优点是：安全、高效、引发的不良反应少。这种疫苗有成功先例，缺点，重组病毒载体疫苗研发需要考虑如何克服“预存免疫”，大多数人成长过程中曾感染过5型腺病毒，体内可能存在能中和腺病毒载体的抗体，从而可能攻击载体、降低疫苗效果。 核酸疫苗包括mRNA疫苗和DNA疫苗，是将编码S蛋白的基因，mRNA或DNA直接注入人体，利用人体细胞在人体内合成S蛋白，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于把一份记录详细的病毒档案交给人体的免疫系统。优点是：研制时不需要合成蛋白质或病毒，流程简单，安全性相对比较高，核酸疫苗是全世界都在积极探索的疫苗研发新技术，缺点是：无成功先例，多数国家无法大规模生产，可能因价格较贵而难以普及到低收入国家。 重组蛋白疫苗，也称基因工程重组亚单位疫苗，是通过基因工程方法，大量生产新冠病毒最有可能作为抗原的S蛋白，把它注射到人体，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于不生产完整病毒，而是单独生产很多新冠病毒的关键部件“钥匙”，将其交给人体的免疫系统认识。优点是：安全、高效、可规模化生产，有成功先例，重组亚单位疫苗的缺点是需要找到一个好的表达系统，这很困难。 病毒减毒活疫苗是非常重要的一类疫苗，是低毒性流感病毒戴上新冠病毒S蛋白“帽子”后形成的融合病毒，可以一石二鸟，既能防流感又能防新冠。 ,Feb-12

1.01589E+16,Wilson EL Tan,"02月11日 新加坡疫情统计数据报告：新增确诊病例12，累计确诊病例59,806，(包括：累计境外及客工确诊病例56,818、累计社区确诊病例2,941、累计旅客确诊病例47)，累计重症住院病例36(其中累计危重症病例1)，累计死亡病例29，累计确诊轻症隔离病例168，累计治愈病例59,526，死亡率0.04%。 Roylab Stats World Map全球新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例超107,902,988，累计死亡病例超2,366,061，死亡率2.19%。 美国新冠病毒疫情统计数据报告：累计确诊病例27,885,171，累计死亡病例482,595，死亡率1.73%。占全球确诊率25.84%，占全球死亡率20.39%。马来西亚排列49、中国排列84、新加坡排列96。 核酸疫苗包括mRNA疫苗和DNA疫苗，是将编码S蛋白的基因，mRNA或DNA直接注入人体，利用人体细胞在人体内合成S蛋白，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于把一份记录详细的病毒档案交给人体的免疫系统。优点是：研制时不需要合成蛋白质或病毒，流程简单，安全性相对比较高，核酸疫苗是全世界都在积极探索的疫苗研发新技术，缺点是：无成功先例，多数国家无法大规模生产，可能因价格较贵而难以普及到低收入国家。 重组蛋白疫苗，也称基因工程重组亚单位疫苗，是通过基因工程方法，大量生产新冠病毒最有可能作为抗原的S蛋白，把它注射到人体，刺激人体产生抗体，相当于不生产完整病毒，而是单独生产很多新冠病毒的关键部件“钥匙”，将其交给人体的免疫系统认识。优点是：安全、高效、可规模化生产，有成功先例，重组亚单位疫苗的缺点是需要找到一个好的表达系统，这很困难。 病毒减毒活疫苗是非常重要的一类疫苗，是低毒性流感病毒戴上新冠病毒S蛋白“帽子”后形成的融合病毒，可以一石二鸟，既能防流感又能防新冠。 ",Feb-11

ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE, NATIONAL CENTRE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf  Sars-CoV-2 virus has not been isolated, purified and cultured. What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been isolated or cultured, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people with false positive results?",Jan-27

What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been isolated or cultured, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?",Jan-22

WE DON'T NEED PHASE 3 TRIALS FOR mRNA VACCINES—WE ARE NOT GUINEA PIGS.  THE mRNA VACCINE TECHNOLOGY IS NEW AND NEEDS CAREFUL AND EXTENSIVE SAFETY TESTING.  THESE WILL BE THE FIRST-EVER MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) VACCINES BROUGHT TO MARKET FOR HUMAN PATIENTS.  NO MRNA VACCINES HAVE EVER BEEN APPROVED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.  COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE DEVELOPMENT IS FRAUGHT WITH UNKNOWN SAFETY RISKS.  mRNA IS EASILY DESTROYED, AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY ENZYMES THAT WILL JUST BREAK IT APART.  PFIZER mRNA VACCINE WHICH HAS TO BE REFRIGERATED TO 70 DEG C—IT DOES NOT SUIT OUR NEEDS (PFIZER VACCINE NEEDS TO BE KEPT EXTREMELY COLD: MINUS 70 DEGREES CELSIUS, WHICH IS COLDER THAN WINTER IN ANTARCTICA).  MODERNA SAYS ITS VACCINE CANDIDATE IS STABLE AT REGULAR FREEZER TEMPERATURE (MINUS 20 DEGREES CELSIUS) FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS, AND AFTER THAWING IT CAN LAST IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR 30 DAYS, IT CAN ALSO BE KEPT AT ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR UP TO 12 HOURS—TAKE THAT WITH A PINCH OF SALT.  MODERNA SAYS THAT THEY HAVE MASTERED A STRATEGIC FORMULA OF LIPID NANOPARTICLES—THE STRUCTURAL BACKBONE OF THE VACCINE THAT DOUBLES AS A MODE OF TRANSPORTING THE DRUG INTO HUMAN CELLS...  OH YEAH ?  NO VACCINES HAVE BEEN MADE TO CURE HIV AFTER 40 YEARS OF RELENTLESS RESEARCH.  mRNA VACCINES INTERVENE DIRECTLY IN THE GENETIC MATERIAL OF THE PATIENT AND THEREFORE ALTER THE INDIVIDUAL GENETIC MATERIAL, WHICH REPRESENTS THE GENETIC MANIPULATION.  WARNING: A GENETIC DEFECT CAUSED BY UNTESTED mRNA VACCINE IS FOREVER—THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE mRNA VACCINATION WILL BE GENETICALLY IRREVERSIBLE !  THE VACCINE, DEVELOPED AND ENDORSED BY ANTHONY FAUCI AND FUNDED BY BILL GATES, USES EXPERIMENTAL mRNA TECHNOLOGY.  WE KNOW WHY BILL GATES TREATS PUNE SERUM INSTITUTE AS HIS TAJ MAHAL—STUD HORSE BREEDER POONAWALAS, YOU ARE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE TODAY.  ETHIOPIAN W.H.O. CHIEF IS A CRIMINAL, AND IS IN THE PAYROLL OF BILL GATES.  MESSENGER RNA OR mRNA IS THE RIBONUCLEIC ACID THAT TRANSFERS THE GENETIC CODE OF THE DNA OF THE CELL NUCLEUS TO A RIBOSOME IN THE CYTOPLASM, THAT IS, THE ONE THAT DETERMINES THE ORDER IN WHICH THE AMINO ACIDS OF A PROTEIN BIND AND ACT AS A MOLD OR PATTERN FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF THAT PROTEIN.  SCIENTISTS AT BIONTECH AND MODERNA INDEPENDENTLY DESIGNED A PIECE OF GENETIC SOFTWARE CODING FOR THE SARS-CoV-2 SPIKE (S) PROTEIN—THEY INSERTED THIS S PROTEIN CODE INTO A MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) MOLECULE.  WHEN THIS MRNA IS INJECTED INTO THE BODY, CELLS RECEIVING IT MAKE THE S PROTEIN AND DISPLAY IT ON THEIR SURFACE.  THIS PUTS THE IMMUNE DEFENCE SYSTEM ON HIGH ALERT FOR THE ACTUAL VIRUS, WHICH THE BODY MAY LATER ENCOUNTER IN A NATURAL INFECTION—THIS IS A NEAT TRICK OF BIOLOGY, ON THEORY, TO GET THE BODY TO PRODUCE ITS OWN VACCINE.  THE APPROACH USES MESSENGER RNA, OR mRNA, TO TURN A PATIENT'S CELLS INTO FACTORIES THAT MAKE ONE PARTICULAR CORONAVIRUS PROTEIN.  THE PFIZER AND BIONTECH VACCINE USES MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) TECHNOLOGY AND IS DESIGNED TO TRIGGER AN IMMUNE RESPONSE WITHOUT USING PATHOGENS, SUCH AS ACTUAL VIRUS PARTICLES.  TILL TODAY, A COMPLETE SINGLE VIRUS HAS NOT BEEN ISOLATED, PURIFIED AND CULTURED—SO, WHAT ARE ALL THIS VACCINES FOR ?
