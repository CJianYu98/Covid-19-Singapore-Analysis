Do the MPs and ministers actually patrol the ground and note how well these applicants integrate into our society? It is quite obvious many do not. I see Indian national applicants only hanging out with their kind and the wives making breakfast & lunch packs for their husbands & children to take to workplaces or schools because they cannot take to the local cuisine. My British friend with his Filipino wife and their 2 children have lived in SG for more than 10 years. They rent a HDB flat, their children were born here and attend local schools. They opened their homes to their neighbours and their children grow & play along with the local children. But they have been denied PR status 4 times. Perhaps it is due to him not having a degree, even though he is a professional in the IT industry. Meanwhile, the JP Morgan Indian national got his PR or maybe citizenship by marriage to a Singaporean and starts to insult the guard at his condo. Well, he is not the only one. So yes, I'm curious what standards the government employs to determine how well applicants integrate into our SG society. Please do tell."

101576728,86152100,Josephine Lee,Feb 1,"This Plannedemic is a hoax, whereby the death rate is just a mere 0.1%-0.3%, much similar to the flu.    Data has shown that the death rates both for overall diseases as well as for the elderly in 2020 are NO DIFFERENT to those recorded for between 2016-2019.   The Biden administration is now coming clean and admitting that the Covid death rates in America for 2020 had been grossly exaggerated (most probably to make Trump look bad); and that the PCR testing should not be used as a diagnostic tool for positive cases.    The AMA also recently advised that Doctors should go ahead to treat patients in their early stage with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine ‚Äî this, after rigging the results last April that there was no evidence for the effectiveness with the 60+ years old drug, followed by a ban of their sales in the US.    In other words, the whole world had been lied to by those intent on bringing down the world economy, and to oust Trump out of office.  Chief among these culprits :  China for trying to hide the virus while sending thousands of  infected Chinese out into the world, and Fauci of FDA, WHO, as well as the complicit media and corrupted medical staff for blatantly lying about the severity of this virus.

101575580,8462100,Shiling Xie,"Dec 15, 2020",This news now finally helps to make sense why dorm workers have been quarantined so long. It‚Äôs really sad. If it‚Äôs was Singaporeans locked up in their hdbs I‚Äôm quite sure within 1 week many of us will not be able to take it..
101575580,8462100,Jacob Peterson Lau,"Dec 15, 2020",Some of the comments here are sick. Just displaying the Singapore mindset which is really self centered and not compassionate. They should seek compensation from the sg government who largely ignored them until things gone way out of control.

101575580,8462100,John Lynn,"Dec 15, 2020",A fine example of what herd immunity would look like. Assuming all the previously infected won‚Äôt need vaccinations and have already developed natural antibodies.
101575580,8462100,Wong Hw,"Dec 15, 2020","Singapore is a live laboratory for the world to gain the needed data to design containment strategies for this virus. Other populations are too large or not sufficiently disciplined to squeeze out the desired result. So far other than us only China, Vietnam, Taiwan and Hong Kong have more or less succeeded in fighting the virus."
101575580,8462100,Raja Sundar,"Dec 16, 2020","Singapore as a govt did supported them(Work permit holders) over the period of time. Really have to be grateful for them. However not the local community did so. Everyone knows they are not being treated equally as a community. Of-course not all locals are but majority. Always treated as a outsider. A perfect example , look at the worker dorms location always AWAY from the HDB buildings and local communities. Like a lower class community will have to live in outside of the city in congested buildings. In the past, there were some dorms displaced from local community area to outside, I guess govt took such action due to immense pressure from the locals. "

101575580,8462100,Joel Lim,"Dec 15, 2020","I think it helps for one to read the full article, on why the numbers reported did not include those who tested positive via the serology test:  When it comes to reporting of Covid-19 practices, the ministries said that Singapore follows the World Health Organisation's criterion that only positive results from PCR tests are included in the case count, which ensures consistency in reporting cases across countries."
101575580,8462100,MC Lee,"Dec 15, 2020",It is no surprise but this information is good for future preventive measures. The migrant workers well-being should not be overlooked.

We did not take care of their well-being. Let's not forget, these are the people that take on work that you and I and our Children will NOT do. Easy to say that we have too many of time.   Imagine NOT having any of them at all. Can you picture what the HDB Estates will look like, Who's going to fill up your tank at the petrol station, Drive our buses and more importantly carry out the construction.   Please DO NOT underestimate their contribution and please DO NOT accuse them of taking over our jobs. We need to reflect on ourselves and ask why employers prefer these FT. The answer is simply our own  Arrogance and our High and Mighty attitude that turn off potential employers.   Yes, there are many of them in the IT and Finance (your reference to Changi Business Park) and the Banks. These guys are Good at what they do. So what's wrong with hiring them."
101575580,8462100,Loh Wai Poon,"Dec 15, 2020","If u apologized only when u are asked, then it is not much of an apology. The ""lockup"" of the dorms to restrict the spread of Covid-19 is a must but painful step. The FWs inside certainly feel painful or sad to be kept in the dorms all these times. The government has to do it because it is a crisis that must be contained. Both sides feel the pain n anger! What to do? Can we do otherwise?"

101575580,8462100,James Ang,"Dec 15, 2020",Half of the dorm workers are previously infected. MOH should conduct a study to investigate if they are immune to new infections or if they have antibodies that can be used to produce a cure for infected patients 
101575580,8462100,David Sim,"Dec 15, 2020",So statistic of 58 thousands is not accurate? Total is closed to 200 thousands?
101575580,8462100,Erphie Irfan,"Dec 15, 2020","The amount of xenophobic, accusatory comments here is astounding and disappointing.  You think they wanted to get sick? You think it was a light decision for them to go thousands of kilometres away to a tiny island in South East Asia away from all known family and friends?  We as a people have a long way to go. Have a little empathy and see if you think you can handle living a day in their shoes. If it's a resounding No, then clearly something is wrong.  Glad to see that steps are being taken to ensure our migrant workers are looked after. Humanity first."

101575580,8462100,Leslie Chan,"Dec 15, 2020",So the real number of covid infections in Singapore should be 152k instead of 58k?
101575580,8462100,Tuan Nguyen,"Dec 15, 2020",Very good model for containing the virus and stop infection spreading outside the dorms. Perhaps the rest of the population should move to live in these dorm models for better infection control.
101575580,8462100,Will Bryant,"Dec 15, 2020",I must say the SG government is at least partially at fault: mismanagement and disregard for the well-being of migrant workers.

We want both a good government and a good Parliament.   For 55 yrs, our Parliament do not have enough parties truly representing the people. Instead majority inside are of the same ruling party, representing not the people, but the PAP.   This means we, the SG voters, have sold ourselves to be slaves (because we sold our Voice) and not master of our collective destiny.   You may argue we have a good government but we don't have a good Parliament. Giving PAP supermajority in parliament is like selling away our birthrights as stakeholders of our SG. Result is you get a SG by PAP, for PAP and not a SG by the People, for the People.   You can have BOTH a good government and a good Parliament.   VOTE IN A STRONG PARLIAMENT"
