101577621,70932100,Kapo Sing,Mar 13 at 5:54 AM,"Every symptomatic patient should be made to swab compulsory and immediately. With the availability of resources, now is the best time to do crack down  rather than cover up."
101577621,70932100,Mary Adele Ng,Mar 12 at 10:33 PM,The Singapore government should make it compulsory to have a Swap Test upon arrival regardless of citizen or visitors. Of course not for anyone who can produce a Vaccination or swap test certificate.
101577621,70932100,Edwin Tan H T,Mar 13 at 6:50 AM,This FT case  has created alot of unnecessary  MOH diversion of attention/resources  to manage this event and made unnecessary  anxiety  to the close community. Hope GOV does not slacken off the control for foreign entry into SG as it impact many stakeholders in SG
101577621,70932100,Esther Leow,Mar 12 at 11:09 PM,He developed a runny nose on 1 March and sought medical treatment at a clinic on the same day but he declined to be tested for COVID-19. He was subsequently detected on 11 March and confirmed Covid-19 infection. Don’t know how many innocent people got the virus from him during the good ten days.
101577621,70932100,Rachael Percy,Mar 12 at 11:49 PM,Everyone working in that bank should be tested to prevent further spread into the community. They like to hold hands and go toilet together
101577621,70932100,Julia Schneemann,Mar 12 at 10:47 PM,"“The Indian national's serological test result is positive, which indicates a likely past infection.” - I assume hence why he did not want to get tested. He had had it in the past and thought that either he must be immune and can’t possibly have it."
101577621,70932100,William Teo,Mar 13 at 12:17 AM,So many cases showed positive after their 14 days quarantine... exposed themselves to the public and spread to our local community...   what is MoM and MOH planning to do about all this spreading ?  Can MOH increase the quarantine period for foreigners coming from certain countries as it had been proven that they are positive after 14 days....
101577621,70932100,Howe Wah Beng,Mar 13 at 12:10 AM,Mr Wong what say about this? Singaporeans fault for not being responsible? But its ok for FT n ceca? Amazing! these are the people that YOU gov let them in and after blame  the locals for being not responsible!!
101577621,70932100,David Lim,Mar 13 at 8:21 AM,"So after his digustingly irresponsible behavior and exhausting taxpayers resources and money to treat him and contact tracing, not discounting community spread, this ceca still gets to keep his IT job and even PR ???!"
101577621,70932100,Catherine Chia SH,Mar 12 at 11:35 PM,"Loophole in such imported cases . Some get covid 19 after SHN and decline to go for swab test. Pls set a new ruling . When one arrives from countries with high infection rates and get symptoms even after finishing SHN , they must see doctor and be swab. No choice to decline . "
101577621,70932100,ZhUo ZhAo,Mar 13 at 10:19 AM,"Declined the test on 1st march but I can see he visited temple, murugan shop and mustafa centre on 2nd march??? WTH!! ..6 March went to restaurant, Spa and so on!... More than 10++ places visited while carrying covid... Oh my....need to really trace and lockdown the close contact person....   https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annexes30af6fa4b1604dc1aa1e556bbd3859ad.pdf?sfvrsn=d4cf22c8_0"
101577621,70932100,Dave Kwan,Mar 13 at 7:43 AM,"For such cases, onus of treatment costs should fall on him. So for all we know, he has been infectious the last 10 days."
101577621,70932100,Arthur Loh,Mar 12 at 10:31 PM,Is it a culture thing where they feel like they can get away with anything? Is the Government turning a blind eye because of CECA? What’s happening to the Singapore I use to know?
101577621,70932100,Au Kah Kay,Mar 12 at 11:30 PM,"Had it not been for his scheduled trip back to India, he could be spreading the virus in the community. Very irresponsible of him 😤"
101577621,70932100,Tim Huang,Mar 12 at 10:43 PM,What has MOM got to say about this work pass holder community case?
101577621,70932100,Elise Sim,Mar 12 at 11:37 PM,"Declined to be tested even he was having flu symptoms not that he has no symptoms. Please revoke his working pass for high possibilities of spreading COVID19. Everyone traps in Singapore, works so hard to fight COVID19. Why is he exempted?"
101577621,70932100,Jade Lim,Mar 13 at 12:00 AM,"Doctors shld ask him to do the swab n must not give patient the choice to decline as long as patient show symptom of Covid. Infected patient if not swab n tested, he may go everywhere n infect others. This could cause a serious outbreak. MOH shld  make it compulsory for Doctors to order patient to take a swab without choice."
101577621,70932100,Chan Kwai Peng,Mar 13 at 7:02 AM,People from high risk countries must mandatory to take covid 19 test if there are symptoms and not let them choose. It is very very irresponsible for him to reject taking the test
101577621,70932100,Eunice Goh,Mar 13 at 9:26 AM,How can he decline swab test? His pass shpuld be revoked. He is more dangerous than those healthy ppl that flouted the safe distance rules.  He was a walking time bomb in the community.  Revoke n ban him fr working in spore.
101577621,70932100,Han Sandman,Mar 12 at 11:26 PM,"Dear MOM, he tested positive for his pre departure test to India. This is a good chance for you to export covid-19 back to them instead of always importing them. What say you next time escort them straight to their plane and wave bon voyage? Goodbye and good riddance!  Work in Singapore, went to India and returned in January. Bring covid-19 back to Singapore. Not enough still, in March going back to India for more? "
101577621,70932100,Vincent Ng,Mar 13 at 2:14 AM,I dun believe the bank can’t employ Singaporean to be IT engineer. 
101577621,70932100,Lik Ren Tian,Mar 13 at 2:03 PM,How can this FT can in out Singapore suka suka. like no body business. It seems like CECA can travel to and fro India freely only.
101577621,70932100,OC Yeo,Mar 12 at 10:44 PM,"Looks like Cecadians have special privileges, including rejecting the test.  Why?  If not privileged, then revoke his work permit."
101577621,70932100,Tsai Teck See,Mar 12 at 10:40 PM,"Just by reading the headlines , not difficult to guess where he hails from ... "
101577621,70932100,David Lim,Mar 12 at 11:35 PM,Very irresponsible! Having symptoms and still refused to take test

101577621,70932100,Sng Chiew Hwa,Mar 12 at 10:31 PM,"Shouldn’t he be punished for refusing testing ? No different from breaking SHN ,He should b ban from working here "
101577621,70932100,Fang Wei Lin,Mar 13 at 12:02 AM,Can decline to take test? I don't think anyone should be allowed to decline.
101577621,70932100,David Sim,Mar 13 at 9:43 AM,declined testing? can Govt decline his workpass application when expired? This irresponsible and anti social people shouldn't be allowed to work here.
101577621,70932100,Jay Tan,Mar 13 at 12:43 AM,Should quarantined him. After that send to changi for staycation. Then cancel Work Pass and deport and banned from stepping foot into sg for life.
101577621,70932100,Bill Ng,Mar 13 at 11:46 AM,"Please revoke his working permit. 5 days mc are not suppose to go out. Enough is enough, we must tell those working permits holders to respect our law. Singaporean fighting very hard against covid. If they don’t respect our law, they should be ask to leave"
101577621,70932100,KC Tan,Mar 12 at 10:37 PM,Make him pay for all his medical bills with heavy fine before kicking him out of Singapore for good!

101577621,70932100,Joseph Vo,Mar 12 at 10:58 PM,They can decline to be swapped? Didn’t know they have that power 👏🏽👏🏽
101577621,70932100,Jaslyn Tan,Mar 12 at 11:58 PM,So irresponsible of him. Why he can refuse a Covid test? If the doctor advise him to do a test based on his professional assessment then he should not be allowed to refuse the test. So after 5 days MC he actually wonder around before he go for his pre departure Covid test ?
101577621,70932100,Franky Zy AK,Mar 12 at 11:19 PM,His workpass should be cancelled and ban him from working in Singapore since he knew he already had positive covid 19 in the past.
101577621,70932100,Joyce Tan,Mar 12 at 10:23 PM,Another case of rejecting a swab test. When did it become possible for pple to reject a swab test if being a suspected case?
101577621,70932100,Ten Choy Yan,Mar 12 at 10:53 PM,"Revoke his pass, stubborn n not cooperate to take the test. Not welcome him in sh"

If they cannot afford to feed their family then don’t come to Spore! Stay in your country please! Stop snatching jobs fm us! We Sporean also need to feed our family! 一个来抢我们的饭碗还不够，全家都要来抢！天理何在？！"
101577621,70932100,Cattleya Tay,Mar 13 at 11:54 AM,I thought it is compulsory to take swab test when patient is having cough or runny nose or fever? I went to Raffles Clinic and this was what the doctor had told me. So who is the general practitioner that let him go?
101577621,70932100,Pauline Eri Na Na,Mar 13 at 9:49 AM,This type need to be ban from entering again. Refused to be tested ?
101577621,70932100,Rosnah Abdul Karim,Mar 12 at 11:49 PM,I tot got guidelines if anyone shows symptoms of respiratory must do covid test.
101577621,70932100,Basker,Mar 12 at 10:27 PM,"Story doesn’t make sense. He came in Mid Jan, finished SHN, and then caught COVID by early March ??? Are dates being reported correctly? If he caught it locally who did he catch it from?"
101577621,70932100,Vasanthan Kanagasundaram,Mar 13 at 10:38 AM,How can one deny to be tested? And what valid reason can someone give for the refusal? I am sure many residents would want to know the loophole in the system. We had no community cases for so long and this case changes everything.
101577621,70932100,Edwin Tan H T,Mar 13 at 8:52 AM,It is a learning to be taken .Putting robust guidelines  before  SG open up for travel . If this is not taken seriously it could upset sg gov plans which we had work so hard on
101577621,70932100,Kannagi Illamaran,Mar 13 at 3:57 PM,"If no action is taken against this fellow, won't it set a precedent for everyone to refuse the swab test, even when symptoms may be present? Something to ponder!"
101577621,70932100,Tom Tang,Mar 13 at 4:15 PM,"The government must impose a rule that ALL with possible symptoms must be tested. This means clinics and hospitals must execute this procedure. Anyone refusing to take the test, the employer (if he is employed) and MOM must be alerted immediately. His/her workpass must be suspended. The community’s hard work in obeying safety guidelines and taxpayers’ money invested in healthcare and COVID prevention steps all these months must not go to waste because of an individual’s selfish behaviour! "
101577621,70932100,Jerome Ong,Mar 13 at 12:26 AM,"A runny nose...pick a symptom which loads of people develop around the world daily, rebrand and rename it, spice it up a little and tadaaa, we have ourselves a deadly pandemic just like that! 🪄 🎩 🐇 "
101577621,70932100,Flash Lim,Mar 13 at 2:10 AM,"If he was not infected in Singapore, so from his arrival day 16th Jan to till End Feb, the covid 19 virus stays in his body without any detection. He must have eaten lots of curry but the magical urine lost its power gradually as it is not easy to get replenishment here"
101577621,70932100,Joven Ang,Mar 12 at 10:28 PM,How come he has a choice? Got symptom means MUST test!!!
101577621,70932100,William Tan,Mar 13 at 5:34 PM,He has been going round many places and office. Hope that he will not create a big clusters. We do not this kind of defiant foreign forces.
101577621,70932100,Julie Hughes,Mar 13 at 6:13 PM,"Of course he declined to be tested! If you test positive, you’re immediately whisked away and isolated for weeks. "
101577621,70932100,Kannagi Illamaran,Mar 13 at 3:50 PM,Wah! He had a choice? Isn't it compulsory? What an inconsiderate nincompoop! Repatriate him back!
101577621,70932100,Nicole Seetoh,Mar 13 at 1:10 PM,He is helping us get herd immunity  Saving us $$$ on vaccines.  Does it mean to say if we have a flu go to clinic we can choose not to have a swab test? More likely than not public will start to quote 11 March indian work pass holder case can refuse doing swab tests w flu like symptoms. If so then how do we control the pandemic without digging into national reserves again?  So please do clarify the benchmark and protocols here much appreciated.
101577621,70932100,Bridget Dorai,Mar 13 at 5:05 PM,MOH needs to give an explanation how folks can decline a swap test. Are these folks signing any declaration that they would be banned from re-entering if decline and indeed positive for the virus?
101577621,70932100,Richie Man,Mar 13 at 12:09 AM,"If the bloody FT reluctant to be tested, does MOH just let it off? Hope not. Should he be booted out since he doesn’t comply to MOH instruction. "
101577621,70932100,Kevin Yan,Mar 13 at 10:15 AM,"This person is irresponsible and a health hazard to all around him. The clinic SHOULD NOT have allow him to leave without a swab test. Honest, his WP should be revoke and not allowed to enter into SG anyone."
101577621,70932100,Casey Lee,Mar 13 at 10:02 AM,"Auntie like me got cough, doctor wants me to swap I just do accordingly for the shake of the community and loved ones. This type of behaviour belong to his home country what he likes and he does. This is mer selfish behaviour that are accepted here. No one will dare to go to the bank he works. All the staffs there will also get and bring it home. Wah lau! PR some more. People who share lift with you will get Convid 19. Nuisance! are you aware of that."
101577621,70932100,Holding On,Mar 12 at 11:57 PM,Can decline to be banned from entering Singapore in future as well?
101577621,70932100,Mervyn Quek,Mar 13 at 10:02 AM,"If you decline the test and you start a new cluster, can the govt claim back all the resources used against you?"
101577621,70932100,Michael Liew Khong,Mar 13 at 1:05 AM,Cancel his work pass and send him back to where he belongs permanently. 
101577621,70932100,Ivy Tay,Mar 13 at 10:41 PM,"If Singaporeans are fined for not wearing masks and not practising SD, such behaviour should receive heavier penalty. He deserves to be deported!"
101577621,70932100,Xiao Spring,Mar 13 at 1:45 PM,"The government should mandate covid swabs for all with flu symptoms. Especially those from india and other high risk countries. They may have interacted with those who just arrived, are infected but not detected"
101577621,70932100,Gary Tan,Mar 13 at 8:08 AM,"Strange he can simply reject a covid 19 test. During the time he was infected, he could have easily passed the virus to 1000 poor chaps. But then again, foreign talent so its probably fine because the government has a crush on this group of people."
101577621,70932100,William Tan,Monday at 11:53 AM,Send him back to his country and bar from entering be it travel  or work purpose.. we no need this kind of visitor at all...
101577621,70932100,Kwa Lai Pheng Karen,Mar 13 at 9:24 AM,Sent him back home!! Cancel his pass and ban him coming back to SG
101577621,70932100,Jason Tan,Mar 13 at 10:43 AM,Its time to review this....can anyone just decline to be swap; there seems to be a gap here....
101577621,70932100,Francis Lee,Mar 13 at 9:12 AM,"Incoming and can decline a test even when having symptoms? ... Ah... No wonder they dare to even take over our song and sing ""We can achieve, Inxxx"" 🤦🏻‍♂️"
101577621,70932100,Chan Kwai Peng,Mar 13 at 7:11 AM,I believe he knows he may have the virus that is why he refuses to be tested. Should bar him from re entering Singapore.
101577621,70932100,Noel Goh,Mar 13 at 9:17 AM,They r pests in Sg. Even they r white collar. To me they r rats in the ally.

101577621,70932100,ChinYau Lee,Mar 13 at 10:14 AM,Is it possible to refuse testing? That's a loophole.
101577621,70932100,Wong Yking,Mar 13 at 12:04 AM,This type of CECA IT engineer should terminate and send back to country belongings
101577621,70932100,Andy Koh,Mar 13 at 10:26 AM,"Lawrence Wong, are you aware of this? Or you are still eating your PRATA? He has a flu and  HE CAN DECLINE COVID TEST?"
101577621,70932100,Dennis Teo,Mar 13 at 7:25 AM,High risk group and yet can decline the test??.
101577621,70932100,Ck Franck,Mar 13 at 8:12 AM,let him go back to India and ban him from Singapore permanently. A total disrespect of Singapore health and law systems.
101577621,70932100,Tim Huang,Mar 13 at 8:54 AM,Should Deutsche Bank be taken to task for the irresponsible behaviour of their employee? This is also to show to the world that Singapore take covid19 precaution very seriously!
101577621,70932100,Rainah Rais,Mar 13 at 6:00 AM,IRRESPONSIBLE FT. Bar him from here forever. THEY NO LOVE OR CARE FOR SINGAPORE.

101577621,70932100,Rohith Rajamony,Mar 12 at 11:48 PM,How can anyone decline to be tested!?
101577621,70932100,Sam Wong,Mar 12 at 10:39 PM,Denying need for swab is a sovereign sign.
101577621,70932100,Papocalypse,Mar 13 at 11:04 AM,"‘working from home since his arrival from India in January’  Why did Deutsche Bank import him just to have him WFH? Why must he WFH in Singapore instead of WFH in India? Is it because Singapore has catchier songs? 🙃   Who is the Dr? Knowing this fine fellow’s travel history and knowing that his country of origin is high risk, why did the good Dr allow him to go untested?   Why does our wonderful government come up with a myriad of laws and fines for us locals but let CECAdians do whatever they like? "
101577621,70932100,Sg Patricamp,Mar 13 at 8:37 AM,Singapore no IT expert?? Need foreigners??
101577621,70932100,Cheapo CK,Mar 13 at 7:14 AM,"He choose not to test, and now we have a community risk of 9-10 days... how do I know how many he has spread to? These pass holder think they are here to work or holiday? We should have strict health rules and law to protect our own community. "
101577621,70932100,Tan Li Leng,Mar 13 at 9:46 AM,"And from March 1 to the say he departed, he would have infected so many other people 😡😡😡"
101577621,70932100,Tracy Tan,Mar 13 at 2:56 PM,"Why the doctor allow him to choose if wanna do swap test anot? If doctor suspect, shouldn’t that guy straight send to do test? Why give him 5 days MC instead? 🤔🤔🤔"
101577621,70932100,Dahlia Zee,Mar 13 at 12:12 AM,Can decline to test?? Even my baby having runny nose must take swab test. What is this MOH??’
101577621,70932100,Wong Soon Yee,Mar 12 at 10:47 PM,Well done.. seems like CECA can travel to and fro India freely. Anyway to them $$ to quarantine is nothing to them.

Yes, we must also have them for economic reasons but these are dangerous times. We need a reset. "

It is so unbecoming for those from the business community to sell out the face masks and up the prices in a crisis. This leave the poor with no face masks to buy and wear amid the global shortage. It is only in a crisis we can see the true colours of some Singaporeans who hoard everything for themselves.

Already got vaccines still so kiasi.  Some of the ktv in malaysia already allow ktv to open and can sing now. Malaysia cases are much higher than spore yet they already open but spore govt still scared to open.  I also realized our pay and pay govt like to follow what other countries do first before they decide which action to take. Sometimes can follow don't wanna follow, cannot follow then went to follow. 😅  Pay them so much salaries just to follow other countries. Even ah ma also know how to follow lah. 😅"

101577545,712100,Malaysia Third Force Third Way,Mar 11 at 1:02 PM,"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """

101577454,96492100,Qiu Lynette Khoo,Mar-05,"Well done! But you can do better! Get the TV to broadcast the usual questions asked. Verify name, check health records for allergy. Do this in rows, by ten cases at a time. Put  vaccine syringes on a tray. Go down the row of people with your trolley. We don't need individual curtained areas.  Curtains only required for jabs in the hips if requested. Modesty issue? Section the halls into male and female sections.   We need to  complete vaccination for 2 million people within 4 months. That's 4 million shots till we obtain Johnson & Johnson vaccine."

No side effects, no swelling, no fever, no itch, nothing... I actually ask the injector for vaccine kau kau, he laugh, say no such thing... 😊🤣. Update, Nothing unusual until 9 hrs late can feel the soreness at the injection location... Acceptable soreness feeling, normal activity not affected except pull up no strength.

101577454,96492100,Malaysia Third Force Third Way,Mar 11 at 1:00 PM,"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """

They just don't know how to calculate the change and they bring this deficiency into their adult lives, and live month to month from cheque to cheque. They don't know how to allocate their resourses and ration it across time, they only know how to gamble but never to invest.  These are the byproduct of cashless system, when the odds of making people transact so convient, with promotions and discount and entitlements.  When I look a these people, young, teenager, young adults, working adults, middle age and even the retired, they are all struggling with money, struggling with repayments while they are all so into these cashless system.  Sometimes they would call me old fashion when I say I don't have cashless apps, I don't transact that way, but when I show them my numbers, investments and property, they will realise how and why I have what I have and they don't.  I make my expenses inconvient to myself so that it gets retain longer for other usage. It will trouble me more if I would use it on impulse, it gives me time to reconsider my priorities."

With most elderly now venturing out of their homes after staying home the past year due to Covid, they are now enjoying the familiar conveniences and freedom of eating and travelling outside their homes. E-payments will not only undermine their mental alertness and capacity but will instead deteriorate their mental ability and reliabilty in the shortest and fastest time possible as their daily activities in the digital world will be reduced to merely ""tap and go"" be it for food payment, train or taxi rides, services... everything!"

101577427,49802100,Lisa Loh,Mar-04,Yes we still need cash.    Doing away with cash is not a possibility and is not that important .   My mum and her helper need cash to buy their daily stuff at the market and shops .   In fact my poor illiterate mum cannot even use ATM nowadays because it is no longer the simple same ATM screen that she can just memorise .   I have to withdraw cash every month on her behalf cos it is not practical for her to go to the bank to queue every month given that many bank branches especially POSB have closed down and the long queues of seniors at each POSB and DBD branch daily .   Chances of elderly seniors like her getting conned while queuing at the banks are very high.  Banks should not forget that that we are their customers and without the depositors they would not have the fund to lend to others and make their huge profits .    Our society needs to engage the elderly with little education.   Dementia will become a much more serious problem for the elderly if we remove cash from our lives .   By using cash for their daily purchases    those suffering from slight or moderate dementia are able to exercise some control and use their mental skills.   One of the best way to slow down the dementia process is to engage dementia persons in their early stages .  Getting cash allowances and paying in cash is also a good way to educate the young children about managing finances.

I have to download their app no other way about it. Are we supposed to download a hundred apps on our phone and drain our phone capacity? I am supposed to download a utility app just so I can pay my monthly bill. It’s like asking me to bring the AXS machine home so that I can pay my utility bill. #SimplyStupidity   If this is what digitalising the economy is all about please save it. Wasting everyone’s time.

He did most of his transactions online and had all the social media apps that his grandchildren had. He managed his bonds and equities portfolio himself and traded online as it was cheaper. He bought his new car himself without children's assistance and learnt how to use the apps in his lexus all by himself just reading the instruction manual as his previous lecxuscdodnvot have all those navigation etc software. He did most of his groceries and shopping online and helped his grandchildren during the circuit breaker online lessons and helped them out when they had problems with zoom or Google classroom  or TEAMS or whatever software their teacher's chose.  He even taught them to use electronic banking and helped them set up their banking accounts when they came of age. He helped them repair their phones, and for their computers repaired for his grandchildren. He taught them all the maths they know with them all getting As. Who says older folks can't handle today's software and cannot learn  He learnt all the software himself just through Google and searching on the net. It's a matter of willingness to learn. He always says retirees have all the time in the world so they have no excuse to not know as they have all the time to research."

101577390,8942100,Joseph Tan,Mar-02,"Singapore gov isn't bought, and relies on science. But what if the science was bought?  "" I did everything a doctor is supposed to do. I read all the papers, I critically appraised them, I understood them, I discussed them with the patient, and we made a decision together, based on the evidence. In the published data, reboxetine was a safe and effective drug. In reality, it was no better than a sugar pill, and worse, it does more harm than good. As a doctor I did something which, on the balance of all the evidence, harmed my patient, simply because unflattering data was left unpublished.  If you find that amazing, or outrageous, your journey is just beginning. Because nobody broke any law in that situation, reboxetine is still on the market, and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play, for all drugs, in all countries in the world. Negative data goes missing, for all treatments, in all areas of science. The regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us.  Sometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials, and when they see that the results are unflattering, they simply fail to publish them. This is not a new problem, and it’s not limited to medicine. In fact, this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science. It distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics, it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies, and despite everything that regulators, drug companies and even some academics will tell you, it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades.  In fact, it is so deep-rooted that even if we fixed it today—right now, for good, forever, without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation—that still wouldn’t help, because we would still be practicing medicine, cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best, on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is—as you’ve now seen—fundamentally distorted. ""  "" In the 1980s, U.S. doctors began giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to all patients who’d had a heart attack. This practice made perfect sense on paper: we knew that anti-arrhythmic drugs helped prevent abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that people who’ve had a heart attack are quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that often these went unnoticed, undiagnosed and untreated. Giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to everyone who’d had a heart attack was a simple, sensible preventive measure.  Unfortunately, it turned out that we were wrong. This prescribing practice, with the best of intentions, on the best of principles, actually killed people. And because heart attacks are very common, it killed them in very large numbers: well over 100,000 people died unnecessarily before it was realized that the fine balance between benefit and risk was completely different for patients without a proven abnormal heart rhythm.  Could anyone have predicted this? Sadly, yes, they could have. A trial in 1980 tested a new anti-arrhythmic drug, lorcainide, in a small number of men who’d had a heart attack—less than a hundred—to see if it was any use. Nine out of forty-eight men on lorcainide died, compared with one out of forty-seven on placebo. The drug was early in its development cycle, and not long after this study it was dropped for commercial reasons. Because it wasn’t on the market, nobody even thought to publish the trial. The researchers assumed it was an idiosyncrasy of their molecule, and gave it no further thought. If they had published, we would have been much more cautious about trying other anti-arrhythmic drugs on people with heart attacks, and the phenomenal death toll—over 100,000 people in their graves prematurely—might have been stopped sooner. More than a decade later, the researchers finally did publish their results, with a mea culpa, recognizing the harm they had done by not sharing them earlier:  When we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance. The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons, and this study was therefore never published; it is now a good example of ‘publication bias’. The results described here might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead.10  As we shall shortly see, this problem of unpublished data is widespread throughout medicine, and indeed the whole of academia, even though the scale of the problem, and the harm it causes, have been documented beyond any doubt. We will see stories on basic cancer research, Tamiflu, cholesterol blockbusters, obesity drugs, antidepressants and more, with evidence that goes from the dawn of medicine to the present day, and data that is still being withheld, right now, as I write, on widely used drugs which many of you reading this book will have taken this morning. We will also see how regulators and academic bodies have repeatedly failed to address the problem.  Because researchers are free to bury any result they please, patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine, from research to practice. Doctors can have no idea about the true effects of the treatments they give. Does this drug really work best, or have I simply been deprived of half the data? Nobody can tell. Is this expensive drug worth the money, or have the data simply been massaged? No one can tell. Will this drug kill patients? Is there any evidence that it’s dangerous? No one can tell.  This is a bizarre situation to arise in medicine, a discipline where everything is supposed to be based on evidence, and where everyday practice is bound up in medico-legal anxiety. In one of the most regulated corners of human conduct we’ve taken our eyes off the ball, and allowed the evidence driving practice to be polluted and distorted. It seems unimaginable. We will now see how deep this problem goes. ""  "" It’s also worth being clear that this data is withheld from everyone in medicine, from top to bottom. Most countries have organizations to create careful, unbiased summaries of all the evidence on new treatments to determine whether they are cost effective. In the UK the organization is called NICE (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence); in Germany it is called IQWiG, while in the U.S. insurers may make their own assessments. But these organizations are unable either to identify or to access data that has been withheld by researchers or companies on a drug’s effectiveness; they have no more legal right to that data than you or I do. In fact, as we shall see, some regulators, despite having access to this information, have refused to share it with the public or doctors. Others have hidden the information they hold behind walls of chaos. This is an extraordinary and perverse situation.  So, while doctors are kept in the dark, patients are exposed to inferior treatments, ineffective treatments, unnecessary treatments, and unnecessarily expensive treatments that are no better than cheap ones; governments pay for unnecessarily expensive treatments, and mop up the cost of harms created by inadequate or harmful treatment; and individual participants in trials, such as those in the TGN1412 study, are exposed to terrifying, life-threatening ordeals, resulting in lifelong scars, again quite unnecessarily.

But  * too much of it can be catastrophic, * particularly when it comes to judgment and decision-making. Research has found that overconfident leaders can have a negative impact on organizational performance, leading to everything from * introducing risky products that are unlikely to be successful * to poor decisions about mergers and acquisitions.  ""Human beings don't like to exist in a state of uncertainty and ambiguity."" Confident people give off an air of assurance and certitude and are perceived as being competent which makes us an easy target to influence.  Despite these findings, * overconfident people attain higher social status and are viewed as more competent, * allowing them to reap the reputational benefits. ""Confidence makes individuals appear more competent in the eyes of others, even when that confidence is unjustified and unwarranted,""  Taking it one step further, overplacement is the belief that you are better than others—more talented, smarter, less biased, more competent, even better drivers—even though you may not be. Overprecision is believing with complete certainty the accuracy of your judgments. This is the most ro­­­bust form of overconfidence with a wide reach: * it is seen across cultures, professions, genders, ages and levels of expertise. *  https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-to-resist-the-lure-of-overconfidence/"

101577356,7477100,Drake Snow,Mar-01,Those experts likely said to come up with vaccine will take years. Don’t listen to them. Stay positive 
101577356,7477100,Jake Ng,Mar-01,"70% to 90% of the whole world can be achieved, but at what cost?   Are the developed countries wiling to pump in more money to provide vaccines to the developing countries, assuming that the vaccines are produced fast enough, and in large enough quantities to supply everyone?  While the virus keeps mutating, and vaccine production have to play catch-up to cater to new variants popping up every now and then.  Not trying to sound pessimistic, but seeing what that had transpired over the past year, where richer countries secured in advance almost all vaccine production capacity at the expense of others, it may be years before we can finally overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.   😭😭😭"
101577356,7477100,Wilkie Ong Keng Soon,Mar-01,The virus would have been wiped off by then when it couldn't find hosts to replicate itself.  The world needs 7 years for life to go back to pre-2020 days.

101577334,99972100,Swee Png,Feb-28,"The nurse looking after that patient may already be working in a stressful environment, so if the patient still think he’s entitled to abuse the nurse, he’s wasting the nurse’s precious time to look after other patients who may need urgent nursing care. By stressing the nurse unnecessarily, the patient may cause the nurse to make medication or other errors pertaining to patient care which may have disastrous results for the patient or other patients. That patient would be wise not to abuse nurses if he doesn’t want his nurse to make mistakes in his care."
101577334,99972100,Phyllis Wong,Feb-28,"There's abuse everywhere, yes everywhere in every country. Even in offices! Just the recent case of the poor Myanmar domestic helper."
101577334,99972100,Mark Roche,Feb-28,"What I don’t understand is why do you accept this kind of treatment in the first place? Unless the person is suffering from mental illness or something uncontrollable. Shouldn’t you inform your supervisor and let them deal with it, failing which the police should be brought in? You people are health care workers. Not punching bags."
101577334,99972100,One Opinion,Feb-28,Observed how one patient ignored the nurse advice not to smoke in the women’s toilet. 
101577334,99972100,Serene Law,Feb-28,"Witnessed a patient's family member accusing the nurse at TTSH for stealing his mum's money. When he realized he had made a wrong accusation, he didn't even bothered to apologize to the nurse. Such ill bred upbringing"
101577334,99972100,Terrence Long,Feb-28,"No lah, such abuses happen both ways. It depends on luck who you encountered."
101577334,99972100,Elke Smith,Feb-28,And of course this way of treating others comes right from the parents who blame everything on teachers every time their child  do something wrong in school. So child grows up thinking they are always right
101577334,99972100,Stephen McGreevy,Feb-28,"Had an elderly, frail patient at my Hospital some years back - Court Ordered that he could only attend Hospital with a security guard, at his expense, due to his vile verbal abuse, hitting staff with his walking stick, slapping and spitting on staff - and there were those who continued to made excuses for him"
101577334,99972100,Umm Yusof,Feb-28,Medical institutions should have the right to decline to serve abusive patients (and patients whose relatives feel they have the right to abuse the staff).
101577334,99972100,Bhavani Ganesan,Feb-28,"No excuse to insult our healthcare workers. Patient’s condition should be assessed though. If they are found to be sane and choose to abuse our workers, upon discharge, they should be charged accordingly by our law. "
101577334,99972100,Noraidilah Sarhak,Feb-28,"Its a Singapore working culture. You got paid, you got the abuse (emotionally-most of the time).

101577334,99972100,Angelia Tan,Feb-28,"Some cases are impatience old folks or demantic old people and some of them do not know what they are doing. Even if you call police it's helpless. It's a common problem in aging society. What the public can do to help these nurses is to be encouraging and be thankful..if you see them in a situation like this, give some words of comfort and acknowledgement for their hardwork. Please and thank you goes a long way for all of us. Even if we cannot solve their problem, at least we be nice and not add on to their pain. "
101577334,99972100,Miyake Ja,Feb-28,Pls la.... there are also nurses who abuse patients verbally.... bully that patient just becos they are sick and helpless... those old bird nurses will know how to protect themselves. You don’t have to worry for them. Only those noob nurses make noise..
101577334,99972100,Yeow Ping,Feb-28,Encountered a real life case when I admitted to NUH A&E. An old man was berating a nurse that she is lazy and how useless she is hence he had to wait in the observation ward for so long and he keeps on emphasizing that he is class A ward patient. I decided to help her out by signaling to her that I needed her attention. She came over and I told her I was in pain and get her to inform the doctor.
101577334,99972100,Faryani Ziqry,Feb-28,"I remembered how 10 years ago I was being verbally abused when I was pregnant. He was really mean. Questioning my ability and whether I could handle him if he collapsed. He told me I was unfit to perform his scan and by that time I had tears down my cheeks. So, he asked me to call my manager to replace me. The nerve. My colleagues blamed it on my hormones. So evry pregnancy i fear i break down and appear unprofessional. But it doesnt happen again thankfully. So, he is just a big bully not my hormones.."
101577334,99972100,Adrian Roche,Feb-28,"It happens. Realize that there’s a reason why these people are in the hospital and that often means that they are not feeling great especially emotionally. Be prepared to deal with these things, it’s part of your job of being stronger than they are. As a health care professional you need to live up to what is required from you."
101577334,99972100,Valerie,Feb-28,That's the challenge frontliners face everyday to those unappreciative patients a.k.a haters ask yourself why is it that the nurses sacrificed their time and efforts to work long hours in their shift ? During the CB period all our hearts went out to them in times during the covid 19
101577334,99972100,Leah Davison-Singh,Feb-28,"Yes, patients are often in a vulnerable situation when visiting hospitals.. but doesn’t excuse them from acting like decent human beings. Our health care workers are a god send and should be treated with the respect they deserve for always being on the frontline 🙏"
101577334,99972100,Thilagavathi Thila,Feb-28,Its not only patients.. Nurses had also been negligent.. Esp in hospital.. With old patient.. I know what was done and not done.
101577334,99972100,Esha Batish,Feb-28,"There is  Usually an underlying reason why these patients are not acting socially normal. It could be and built up frustration , it could be how they were treated by hospital staff before,  It could be that they're simply mentally unsound. Its always good To look at causative factors instead of trying to fix a problem at the surface."
101577334,99972100,Kellie Koh,Feb-28,I will forever remember the day I whole stack of $50 notes was thrown at my face at A&E as a staff nurse for prioritizing a cardiac arrest patient over a broken toe of a kid. I left nursing shortly after. 😞
101577334,99972100,Vanan Govindasamy,Feb-28,"Every Nurses and health care sector deserves a great Respect without them the health care can collapse, if patients not cooperating and abuses, the Nurse should have all the rights not to attend. Any kind of abuse, be it physically or mentally, should not be tolerated or sweep under thr carpet."
101577334,99972100,Lisa Khoo,Feb-28,We need them the most but yet appreciate them the least 🥲 My mom was a self-less nursing sister before she succumb to cancer many years ago. Healthcare workers work the hardest but get back the least. Doctors r paid so many times more than nurses but yet the nurses r the ones r watching over the patient all the time 😔
101577334,99972100,Candi Chloe,Feb-28,"Being admitted in hospital is fearsome for many, so most patients may exhibit the need for attention, need for priority care, need to let out their frustrations.  In our health care, I must say our nurses and health care staff has the best tolerance and heart for all. They are human too, they will feel sad, drag their feet to work;   The employer needs to provide them enough manpower - so they can have more breaks in between; during the breaks. If there are more breaks in between, they will have some time to recollect themselves. Little do u know - they don't even have proper toilet breaks  They should have sufficient de-stress zone; comfy nap area, quiet zone to themselves."
101577334,99972100,Ann Lee,Feb-28,I heard of patients being bullied as well🙄
101577334,99972100,Noah Ben-Hanan Korakot Low,Feb-28,Some of you might not understand that in certain cases those who abuse healthcare workers could be mentally unsound. For example elderly dementia patient. For those cases even their own family have trouble taking care of them and their immediate caretakers are at the brunt of these verbal abuse. Sometimes they are well behaved other times they are extremely difficult to deal with. But if you don’t take care of them who will? They don’t even know they are in need of care. At the end of the day it boils down to perspective
101577334,99972100,Ken Jee Lum,Feb-28,"This calls for all medical institutions, clinics & hospitals regardless whether government or private sectors to make cases and press charges against those type of people who only know how to create problems"
101577334,99972100,Hwee Lee,Feb-28,"We need to set up a room for “bad abusive patients”. They will be served only by big size male nurse so they will tone down. The charges should be higher if they stay this room 😎  Some people are bully since young (even if they are older and weak they do not change)   Some are old folk with dementia issue that have fear and worries. So they should be treated differently, the nurse should have a good basic understanding on such sickness. If they don’t, they need to go to training again.  However it is good to send in the police off and on to “warn” the patient about their abusive attitude."
101577334,99972100,Yurihahn Johari,Feb-28,"It is sad that we have to go around, telling people to respect one another in this era."
101577334,99972100,Sai Gong,Feb-28,Teachers are abused by students and parents. Service staff are abused by customers. Healthcare workers are abused by patients.  So what's new?! 😪
101577334,99972100,Queenie Campbell,Feb-28,"There should be laws to protect healthcare workers from abuse, be it physically or verbally. If bus captains are protected by law, why aren’t healthcare workers?"
101577334,99972100,Xue-Jun Zhang,Feb-28,"“Normal” patients so “psycho” already, can’t imagine what’s the situation with “abnormal” patients... really respect our medical  frontliners, please protect them from abuse."
101577334,99972100,Valerie Stott,Feb-28,"Same, Norm. Respect is needed. I would NEVER be rude to anyone, let alone nurses or doctors who are trying to help. Yet it happens so frequently. Definitely not how I was brought up. "
101577334,99972100,Wilhelm Tong,Feb-28,I met good nurses.. but I had encountered more nurses who do not have the heart to work.  It is not right to abuse them regardless. But do not pity those who deserved to be penalised for poor service.. 
101577334,99972100,Xen Tasy,Feb-28,"Should have some law to protect the healthcare worker. Those who verbal abuse, shout or abuse the healthcare worker in anyway should be charged.  The other way god dam jab these abusers hard with injection as punishment LOL"
101577334,99972100,EeLin Kong,Feb-28,Nurse are also sandwich in between: organisation and pts with their family. Having to adhere to organisation's protocols and policies even when they actually feel for and empathise with the patients.

101577334,99972100,Au Kah Kay,Feb-28,It is no use for hospitals to say that healthcare workers should be treated with respect and dignity. Words without action mean nothing. Hospitals must take appropriate action against abusive patients by lodging police reports against the perpetrator on behalf of the staff. 
101577334,99972100,Catherine Choo Choo,Feb-28,"Sucks, the law do not protect us.   I work in polyclinic, a pt took my photo and put on Facebook. Made a police report, but the police also cannot take any action. Healthcare staff like us are not protected at all. We have to swallow."
101577334,99972100,Richard See,Feb-28,In 1960s the situation was reversed. People were scared of nurses. They were very fierce and would not hesitate to scold you for anything.
101577334,99972100,Muz Andrew,Feb-28,Sadly people are feeling more and more entitled to behave atrociously to others. No one has that right no matter what they think society owes them.

101577334,99972100,Kerry Teo,Feb-28,"Nurse also abuse patients. Some to the point of being charged. And when the visiting time is over, they all disappear and leave the patients to fend for themselves. Try staying with the patients for nights in the hospital and you can see it for yourself. "

Even patients and patient's family and friend got our mental intelligent insulted. I got it both from hospital and polyclinic.  Have the health care staff asked themselves why they got scolded, for being ""useless""!!?"
101577334,99972100,Tony Tan,Feb-28,"Sometimes when they scold you, it’s a reflection of their insecurities and flaws.  When they say you are “useless”, aren’t they also lying “useless” on the bed too?  When they scold you “stupid”, they are finding ways to make themselves feel smarter than you.  Be confident and professional about your role and you will never fear other people’s insensitive remarks. "

101577334,99972100,Jothio U. Nan,Mar-03,1) Nurses are inbetween doctors and patients 2) Nurses have to remember more cases of patients history rather than doctors.  3) Nurses are the one the first people patients will meet. 4) But i know some can be really rude 5) And i know some can really ignore you  But Please be Kind to them. Cause i really can see what they are going through... They really got alot to handle.  The worst bullied nurses are in IMH.
101577334,99972100,Jomon Palakkayam,Feb-28,There is no law in the System to protect health care workers... So bad to hear things like this.. Why this staff is always being accused by patients ? If someone get sick they thinks that they are the boss in the hospital... The people going to help them is their servants also... This concept should be changed. If they treating and caring they deserve an appreciation and respect more than any other profession.
101577334,99972100,Simon Cheng,Feb-28,"this are the ungrateful people, the hospital must have appropriate steps against this type of patients. Cheer up.....👍"

101577334,99972100,Hanna Sahari,Feb-28,Why do nurses have to put up with this? If all hospitals would collectively agree to refuse treatment to abusive patients (with gov backing) I’m quite sure patients will start behaving
101577334,99972100,Steph Koh,Feb-28,The nurses already trying their best and they very stress already. If they think they are useless. Then ask them come do their job lah

Other then medical requirement they expect nurses to be their maid at their demand. We know that it is very uncomfortable if one is sick but do they think hard how much can a nurse do when you are in that conditions, even a doctor can't help either. Spare a thought for these poor nurses, they did everything that your immediate family members dare not even do and they are neither your domestic helper also. Remember family members you pay for medical treatment but you don't pay for personal assistant and if you think your patient is not getting the attention needed then you can get your own private nurse.

It is not easy, and we rightly appreciate all healthcare workers.   On the other hand, it is not easy on the patient’s part. Sometimes they get frustrated due to their illness.

101577334,99972100,Shoba Bala,Feb-28,Nurses are at our service in hospital to take care of the patients. Of course patients will be vulnerable mentally & physically in the hospital. That doesn’t give the right for them to abuse the nurses. I have nothing but praises for all the caring nurses that I have encountered when I was hospitalised.👍🏽
101577334,99972100,Olivia Lee,Feb-28,"Why like that? Not many people wants to take up Nursing as its not only a dirty job, it's now very hazardous. People should appreciate that there are people who have this noble ambition to take care of people. Lets treat them with respect and appreciative heart.  Never heard of oxytocin?"
101577334,99972100,Susan Lim,Feb-28,Perhaps the patient is out of his mind and not knowing what he's doing...stay strong with such training you're facing. Smile with an open heart and you'll be alright as God is watching...🙏🙏

101577334,99972100,MamaKlein MeiPeng Tiw,Feb-28,"My personal experience. I have witnessed on a few occasions that the nurse actually pressed a button and many nurses came to the ward to 'tie down' (don't know what is the correct term) the abusive patient. I have also seen the level of high tolerance in nurses and some would actually take some time to gently talk to the abusive patient. This article seems to give the wrong idea about abusive and crying in the toilet for a senior nurse. I have spoken to some of them when my dad was warded for 12 days in December last year and 22 days in January this year. Most of their comments are very positive. It is not mean that they allow themselves to be abuse but they turned the ugly situations around and worked together to pacify the patient... For this, I respect them."

To get an appointment to see the specialist will take you 3 months. By the time you would have forgotten about it. When you reschedule the appointment again it takes another 3 months. Of course I will be abusive.

My mom fingers was broken and I’m not aware of it until after my mom was admitted to the nursing home. All those while my mom was in the hospital, I put all the trust in the nurses there.  Sadly my mom can’t talk and immobile so I have no idea what happened to her. I was wondering why they make my mom wore a mittens. She can’t hardly move. They said, they being care, afraid my mom would pull her feeding tube. I believed when my mom fingers was resting on the side, some of those new nurses, roll down the bedside handle bar which clamp my mom fingers in between. Since she can’t talk so they didn’t know. But later found out the injuries so they covered it with smitten.  This days when I look at her fingers which was blended, my heart break. Thinking how painful she must have suffered. But taking action over this matter which had happened for sometimes, it going to be a big battle with that hospital. Anyway, they have tons of bad reputation this days.  I just pray that the person responsible for my mom suffering will one day get the same. So I say, there are great nurses who I have my upmost respect and those who become a nurse for the sake of salary, I pray no one face any suffering from them like my mom did."

Make it serious ...being sick doesn't mean they can behave this way unless you sickness is a ""Mental"" one, then you're not in the right hospital , should be in IMH.🤣🇸🇬"
101577334,99972100,家族李氏,Feb-28,It is really a two-way effort.  Takes two hand to clap.  Healthcare workers need also to check your soft skills i.e.  EQ and attitude.  They should go for more training to handle difficult stakeholders and learn techniques to defuse and de-escalate issues.  This is seriously still inadequate even though I think it has improved. Certainly not enough.  Patients and family members come in anxious. Tired. Stressed.     It is about perspectives.

But for those who criticise and laugh at 'singing' and clapping' for healthcare workers...

As much as we want to be professional and compassionate, some people just want their way going against rules and want to abuse. I’ve seen permanent staff behaving less compassionate because of unruly people. We just can’t allow such things to happen to workers without consequences for offender and allow such poor work conditions from public to breed unabated.  Service is two-way, but sometimes I think the highway to necessary for some people, which is a few to rare.  Fortunately, entrance screeners work hard like bees and responds cohesive together. Beyond that, we call the security.   Heard of story from permanent staff that their colleague suicided after suffering abuse. Healthcare workers have their own pressure at work and at home which can build up. We are also human beings."

The doctor, after blood test insisted my dad to re-visit the doctor the next day or the coming sat. She told us to go to the registration counter ti make an appointment.  I went to the counter and tried to explain my dad's condition and told them the doctor advised to see them to get an appt for the next day or coming sat. They issued me with a queue number and to wait for our turn.   After 1 hr of waiting, the same admin staff told me there is no appt slot and the earliest is 3mths later. I re-explain about the doctor's request but she said the doctor cant see the system hence the doctor dont know.   Yes, I shouted at the staff but left without appt anf my dad did not visit the poly. He is now sick warded at the hospital. Due to the miscommunication between the admin staff and the doctor.   Who is the victim? The patient. So the healthcare personnel No Mistakes?? They are angels??   Dont only talk abusive patient. Instead ask why patients become abusive."

He questioned the skills of Reynolds. But he didn't retaliate unprofessionally. He waited until they were without an audience to ask Dr. Goodwin what the problem was.

We need very high EQ and great patience to work in healthcare sector. Is the new generation of health workers trained in this area? Given that we tend to see the younger generation in need of social skills, due to a technological wired environment, that lacks the human touch. So human and social skills are badly needed in the current era.   Agreed that some patients can be very difficult. So how do healthcare workers calm them down instead of being subject of abuse and cried in the toilet? Is a social skill we are lacking.   Those in retail with very TIP-TOP service always wear the slogan ‘The customer is always right’. It does not mean literally I guessed, but how do you make an unpleasant encounter to turn around and have a more pleasant customer experience, that is good customer service.  I think the hospitals and clinics need to work on this area instead of putting signages at their counter or on the wall, warning patients not to raise their voices at their staff.  This is very absurd, it only happens in Singapore.   Are you trying to hint that all patients are ‘monsters’ when they walk into your premise?  The person behind this idea of putting up ‘signages’ as a shield is already lacking the social skills to handle this kind of situation and has to resort to using signages to remind the public.🤔"

There are nursing who speak rudely to them knowing that these people are also frustrated because they are sick. If they are not sick, they wouldn’t be needing to be hospitalised. One always look at an issue to amplify the situation. You also read about how nurses have abused the patients in the news and does that mean there is also increase of patient abuse. Let’s be fair to what is reported especially right now when workplace safety has been an issue in this country and the number of cases of dead with see in this country. Unfortunately, choose to blame those who want the government to have stricter rules to protect the workers. That’s what’s wrong with this country now.

Scared what. It’s just a flu...most people recover anyway 3) the vaccines are here  If we really did a a good job, then continue to Mask On, Wash Hands and Keep a Safe Distance.

101577181,72472100,Thomas Chue,Feb-21,Also need more checks to be done at void decks where residents are openly smoking with large groups of people at the rest areas discriminately despite visible NO SMOKING signs are clearly seen. 
101577181,72472100,John Kt Koh,Feb-21,What's wrong with this picture!!? Allowing positive cases into our city is OK..but taking issues with our own citizens is plain BS!
101577181,72472100,Vincent Lee,Feb-21,"Loose, Grey and controversial rules:- 1. Holding any kind of drink/food in hand entitles one not to wear mask or unmasked. 2. Smoking while walking/holding a cigarette no need mask. The exhalation is a double whammy to people walking nearby. Threats of harmful smoke particles and potential virus droplets. 3. Wearing exercise gears without actual doing physically strain movements, an excuse to unmask. I bet their heart rate is even slower than my regular heart beats.  These ""loopholes"" should be plugged to avoid ambiguous understanding. How? I don't know. But the government can do something if they are determined enough. They have the resources and authority for it."
101577181,72472100,Rizwan Wan,Feb-21,"Just increase the sentence, a minimum 6 month jail term or $50k fine for 1st time offenders who don't wear mask. It's serious with regards to health. Surely will deter people. For work permit or foreigner, just deport them"
101577181,72472100,Ruby Lim,Feb-21,"Are these ""enforcers"" going to be held responsible should someone pass out from lack of oxygen due to mask wearing? 🤷🏻‍♀️ Just saying."
101577181,72472100,Tengku Chik,Feb-21,"After vaccination, still have to wear mask?? If yes, what the point of vaccination 💉?"
101577181,72472100,David Yoong,Feb-21,"Just a point to share base on what I saw. Old aunt inside MRT cabin told the other aunt don't sit beside her as keep a distance away. Majority Singaporean use public transport to work, school, one place to another. How to keep this practice as there's a timing to report to work, school & appointment. Not everyone own a car or can afford to take taxi or grab regularly. If you don't feel secure, it's better you stay at home permenatly.  $300 to those earning sky high salary may be peanut but will be very useful to those with a family to support.  Go out just put on a mask."
101577181,72472100,Benglay Shirley Tan,Feb-21,"Yes, catch them. Yesterday morning I was at Pek Kio market / hawker centre. Wanted to buy 1/2 roast duck home for lunch. But uncle stall holder wore his mask beneath his nose when I approach the stall amd he turned his head. I am not buying and walked away. Alot of such operators are not doing what is right. Especially they are selling us FOOD."
101577181,72472100,Nancy Wee,Feb-21,Should be more fines.

101577181,72472100,Steven Wong Chee Mian,Feb-21,I had a friend taking a bite near a friend table and was standing biting food and a ambassador approached her and saying that she is not putting on a mask??!! People here walking ard openly without a mask no ambassador taking action??!! Is it being fair?? Ambassador on duty here should know them but just ignore it!?? 
101577181,72472100,David Lee,Feb-21,Thats just the actual 10% that doesn't wear masks. I see them everywhere.
101577181,72472100,David Deshawn,Feb-21,Please increase the fine since $300 look like not very pain to some rich or stubborn Singaporean or FT 🙏🏻.
101577181,72472100,Chris Ong,Feb-21,"Usually the SDA will just remind us to put on the masks when we forgot to put them on after a meal. Those who were fined were probably too stubborn to adhere to the rules, not just mere forgetfulness."

101577162,91807100,David Da Wei,Feb-20,"I am starting to worry for my pal Meng Tat Chang after he claimed to have taken his first shot without allowing for any verification of any sort of this action after rallying fb users to take the vaccine by using words such as ""limpeh"" to portray an air of confidence and 霸气。  So, why am i worried?  He is starting to exhibit memory loss and cant seem to remember exactly the time he took the vaccine as reported by concerned observers.  I hope this is an isolated incident and this seemingly memory loss is not the side effects of anything.  Take nothing away from Tat Cheng even as he did not  allow any verification of him being among the first who volunteer to take the vaccine and faces debate to the authenticity of his profile.   He could very well be among the unsung heroes (maybe not that unsung since he has rallied people).   We are with you, Tat Cheng."

101577144,86007100,Eu Choon Leng,Feb-20,"Surely this is not based on facts or science! What does zero or next to zero mean? And 80% of ""local"" cases in the last six weeks happened to PRs or foreigners or work passes, and quite a few Singaporeans either working at Changi airport attending to inbound travellers, or marine people going onboard foreign ships for work. Have there been any cases of infections during train or bus rides, from shopping malls, from coffee shops, from schools, from places of entertainment or worships?"
101577144,86007100,Jan Mere Janu,Feb-19,So far so good 🙂🙂🙂
101577144,86007100,Loh Wai Poon,Feb-20,"I support this extension. Since it proves effective in containing the Covid-19 spread, we should extend the restrictions longer to maintain the momentum of reduction. If we can tolerate the measures during CNY, then it is a small price to pay for  getting rid of Covid-19 sooner!"

101577096,69227100,Phyllis Wong,Feb-17,Parents should feel blessed that their children are healthy and well instead of chasing after A*. I guess not really totally our fault bcoz we are constantly subjected to all the competition / stress /pressures in life. During this CNY were you asked ' how's your child PSLE / O Level / A level results?' Many a time is not a genuine concern but to conclude how smart your child is. I hope adults will allow the children to enjoy their childhood but is it their choice?
101577096,69227100,Anuratha S Kanniah,Feb-17,You’ll be fine soon little champ. All our prayers for you to get well soon...❣️
101577096,69227100,Chua Lee Kheng,Feb-17,There are some Singaporean parents who force their child to attend pre-school when their child don't want to and the child is always crying loudly when his/her parents force them and the pre-school staffs are also not respecting the child's wish. I am referring to PAP Sparkletot Pre-School in Punggol West.

101577056,8967100,Kok Siong,Feb-15,"I'm not convinced by this comparison. It's like comparing apples to oranges. During WWII, many of the Chinese in Singapore were born in China. They considered themselves, first and foremost, Chinese rather than Singaporeans. How could the people in Singapore during the war be united when a large number of the population were loyal to their birth country, hoping they will return to their birth country someday? They were probably enduring and living in fear, not knowing what happens tomorrow. Facing the strong and brutal Japanese soldiers, what could the people do? If the intention of Mr Wong is to motivate Singaporeans to soldier on in the fight against the virus, WWII is not exactly a good example for Singaporeans to draw lessons from."

101577056,8967100,Jay Tan,Feb-15,"Care of soldiers sir.  If u dont care for them, they will not fight for/with you. Likewise, as a leader, if you do not look after the average man on the streets, they will not fight for you. Stop sucking from the citizens and paying yourself millions. Stop giving lip service and not walking the talk. Stop saying you care when you dont actually genuinely do. That will swing the votes and support. Get your moral compass right.  I believe if another war were to happen here, many will still fight... for their family, neighbours & countryman...but not for the present govt."

Our forefathers, including my parents, barely survived, just getting along with basic necessities. So I personally think it is obscene how we are treating the elderly from that generation. They each get $600 for the whole of last year's $100 billions spent. What a shame."

Which means even if 100% of the others in Chinatown use them tracing will still be impossible. Implementation failure for all to fear.

When this government knew that there is an increasing number of COVID-19 countries, they don’t even stop allowing people to get in so that they can keep the economy going. Yet you scold the people from going to work when they are sick. You think the government can be supporting them? You think companies will be sympathetic towards them. If this government is acting irresponsibly with their actions with people’s approval, then they just have to live with the fact that people need to keep their money flowing even when they are sick. They are just following the leaders. If want to blame, guess who is first to be blame? Only the rich can have the right to earn money at whatever cost?

101576922,16787100,Lee Lilian,Feb-09,So the virus is heading back to where it belongs Europe n US with more infected cases n deaths
101576922,16787100,Desmond Ang,Feb-09,"Perhaps they should not just look at China, but some other countries simultaneously. There were other reports of the virus detected in sewer samples collected months before wuhan outbreak in Spain and Italy. Meantime, in the USA....  ""Despite extensive testing of multiple specimens, no specific pathogen was identified as the cause of the outbreak.""  Eventually they blamed it on rhinovirus  because a few early samples tested positive for that. At the point of time, nobody knows of covid yet. The county is just 50 miles from fort detrick labs which were shut down after lapses were found around the same time.   By the way,  link is from US government website. Not some Chinese sites.  ""Outbreak Investigation at Assisted Living Facility in Springfield | Health"" https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/health/outbreak-investigation-assisted-living-facility-springfield"
101576922,16787100,Jerome Ong,Feb-09,Boo to the WHO for calling this a pandemic in the first place. It should have been called a scamdemic. Time to call a spade a spade.
101576922,16787100,Kasimani Baskaran,Feb-10,"For Singapore the first case came from Wuhan, ie Jan 20, 2020 detected on Jan 23, 2020. Singapore Government was very pro active and spent a lot of resources to contain the virus. I guess we should appreciate the efforts by our government and the health workers rather than fact finding through WHO - which might not lead us anywhere."
101576922,16787100,David BK Tan,Feb-09,"WHO actually went to Wuhan in Feb and Jul last yr for investigations and hence it is the third time Wuhan now. Singapore was involved for the Feb investigation, see WHO report : https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf  Hence it is not true WHO only investigates Wuhan one year later with the evidence no longer in existence.  The current trip is significant as the scientists have more knowledge of covid-19 a year later and also covid-19 has been discovered in other parts of Europe even before Dec 2019, thus lending credence to the notion that Wuhan may not be the source of the outbreak. Hence during today's press briefing, the WHO team concurred that there is evidence that Covid may have emerged outside of Wuhan. So it is imperative that they must go to places outside China which had reported covid-19 before Dec 2019 to do the tracing.  Covid-19 first emerged in China because the Chinese healthcare system mandates the doctors to input pneumonia cases into a computer system to track the possible recurrence of SARS. So the above-average no. of pneumonia cases in Wuhan in Dec 2019 triggered an alert to the Chinese healthcare authority for investigation and hence we came to know that covid-19 first emerged there. But if one looks at US pneumonia records in the winter 2019, it was reported there was a higher than usual no. of deaths then. But the Americans thought that they were just flu-related pneumonia and so they did not take action like what the Chinese did.   Hence in a nutshell, some time during the winter of 2019, covid-19 virus managed to spread globally but China discovered it first bec it had been ready to act for the possible recurrence of SARS which mirrored the symptoms of covid-19.  On the question why the European countries did not have the outbreak like Wuhan did before Dec 2019, one possible reason could be Wuhan is densely populated and also the Chinese life style of socialising means that many people were exposed to it for a long period in the winter and so R0 was higher compared to European cities which discovered traces of covid-19 before Dec 2019.  But we came to know that Italy had covid-19 cases in Feb 2020 which showed that R0 would build up over time as long as people were unaware of this silent pandemic. "
101576922,16787100,Edwin Lim,Feb-09,"It was them who 99% chance created/started/spread covid-19. Few days aft cny 2020, wuhan supposed to be lockdown. Many wuhan ppl took panadol (or equivalent fever medicine) to escape temperature scanner n fled wuhan.  They kpkb for what. The virus just “饮水思源” (remember its roots) and went back to its “发源地” (place of origin). 😅"
101576922,16787100,George Varughese,Feb-09,"1. No doubt, the virus originated from an animal. (The Chinese did very well to contain the human infections.)  2. This natural origin virus may be happy in cold chain environments. (China and America do cold chain Level 4 bioweapon research; Wuhan, etc.)  3. In any case; this natural, possibly cold chain, virus may be just starting to warm up to the planet. (The human herd entire immune system needs an upgrade.)  Everywhere."
101576922,16787100,JC Gwido,Feb-09,"1 year later when China finally allows you to investigate Wuhan, you expect to find anything incriminating of China? You may be intelligent but you are certainly foolish."

101576921,6177100,One Opinion,Feb-09,"Why need to disembark to kena? There is no safe distancing at all on the plane. Once onboard it’s a test of one’s immunity. Point is there is no quarantine for air crew and once back in Singapore, they take public transport, 7 days self-isolation only -does that mean that they still can go about for essentials? Think best is they order groceries online / Grab food and stock up home with essentials before flight so as to avoid spreading to community if very unfortunately they get infected. Or family members help run errands. They could be asymptomatic. Bopian job hazard but we got to take precautions. It should be part of the mitigated risks."

101576906,71862100,Jessica Lim,Feb-09,"If both parties had their mask on throughout the journey and the bus driver is watching his personal hygiene, the likely reason of the spread is due to virus being airborne and carrier and driver being confined in the same space over a period of time.  If govt wants to continue importing, they should take care of the welfare of these frontline workers whom comes into contact with these imports regularly. Maybe can look into whether there are more stringent measures other than disinfecting the bus at the end of the day.  But then again such transmission makes me worry about commuters who travel on public transport everyday, since it’s the same logic.  😰😰😰"
101576906,71862100,Sun Poh,Feb-09,The govt has said this is the calculated risk which we can take. We cannot shut our border totally
101576906,71862100,John Wan,Feb-09,Good luck to those Switch off TT app and don't carry TT tokens. Those people are worse than imported c19 patients because they increase the speed of spreading the virus and decease the speed of contact tracing.

101576906,71862100,Eu Choon Leng,Feb-09,"Anyone seeing a pattern here? The last two ""local"" cases involve people attending to supposed negative (they must have a negative certificate from an approved medical facility - hahaha) inbound travellers. Onetyingscanners to these people, and the other to transport them to a quarantine facility. The pattern is if the imports are infected when they arrive, there is a greater chance they will infect the local workers attending to them.  I hope Lawrence Wong and Gan Kim Yong can see the pattern too!!!"
101576906,71862100,Leong Lim,Feb-09,So much thanks to the imported cases as the bus driver is the unfortunate one fetching these people coming into SG to SHN facilities!
101576906,71862100,Faith Sun,Feb-09,"It takes a while for the vaccine to work. Also, as explained before, a person who has been vaccinated can get the virus but the body will have the immunity system to fight off this virus. Besides, even without the vaccination, one can have the immunity system in the body to fight off the virus. It really depend of the health of the individual. That’s why there are these who are asymptomatic as they have their own antibodies in their system to fight off the virus on their own."
101576906,71862100,Brendan Kai,Feb-09,"Could it be due to the “quality” of the vaccine that the engineer received? In other words, every dose of vaccine may differ in terms of its efficacy? 🤔"

And while it's easy to say be kind and helpful, I'm not a healthcare worker and won't be on the front line managing the patients. I don't know if the writer is a healthcare worker, but try to imagine that they'll be the ones taking care of these patients while you just write to the forum."
101576821,91657100,Sue RaeLynn,Feb-05,"and then when we have a sudden crisis/spark of cases, we run the risk of burdening our healthcare? Unlike those other countries quoted, we are a tiny nation. This pandemic is far from over. We can help in other ways in terms of sending supplies, but to bring them in, esp when the virus is easily passed on and we risk an outbreak at anytime, we shouldn't get greedy about global standing til we risk healthcare availability. We can boost standing in other ways and we have been doing fine all along. Tbh I'm not surprised IF private hospitals are already doing it because money talks, but to open up our govt/public hospitals to imports is a plain no."
101576821,91657100,Judy Lee,Feb-05,"Definitely no u never know pandemic situation in Singapore May get worse and we need them ourselves.

Our Govt had already huge budget deficit incurred for this covid."
101576821,91657100,Sen Tinel,Feb-05,Morally noble but impractical & dangerous proposition. Be very careful what we ask for because things can change for the worst very fast.

101576821,91657100,Erika Covet,Feb-05,No.   Unless the neighboring countries contribute to the healthcare workers directly into their paycheck/pockets.
101576821,91657100,Radha Ghosh,Feb-05,A tiny country like Singapore help a populus nation like indonesia? The ICU maybe devoid of COVID-19 patients. But there are plenty of Singaporeans who need critical care due to other illness. You must be out of your mind.

101576821,91657100,Umm Yusof,Feb-05,"I support sending our neighbouring countries medical aid (medicine, equipment, volunteer doctors/nurses).   But shipping in the critically ill (and their families) will put those in SG at greater risk, especially the flight crews manning those airplanes.   Those who could pay/bribe their way into SG would be the rich and well-connected. Not exactly the sort of ""charity work"" we want to be doing."

101576821,91657100,Ralph Chan,Feb-05,"Rather than taking in ICU patients which I don't agree with, SG can help in other ways like helping neighbouring countries build new hospitals fast like what China and UK did. But first these countries must themselves want to build new facilities for their own population.

101576821,91657100,Chee Ling Choong,Feb-05,"If our current healthcare system and capabilities can take on more COVID-19 patients and not overwhelmed by local, I thought we could extend help to our neighboring countries. We may said that each country should take care of their own people. However, we are not living in this world alone, we depended on others to support our others needs also. Especially in this time of pandemic, if we can why not. In the long run we will definitely, be it directly or indirectly, benefit from our generosity. Lets ask ourselves this question - if we are in trouble do you like to see a helping hand coming along the way? “We may win a battle but lose the war”. 😅"

There will be a hike in covid cases in Singapore if you open your borders and accept patients, because I can almost guarantee that many Malaysians are very stubborn and loose. You may send medical resources, but accepting patients is a hazard to Singapore in itself."

There is also another benefit - it will improve Ramon Greep global standing.  Who knows, writer may be another Tan Tock Seng (the hero)"
101576821,91657100,Jeff Leong,Feb-05,"No. We have adequate prevention and control measures in place doesn’t mean we have the capacities when we may needed it.  People must understand that this disease of COVID-19 and SARS-n-CoV-2 is a cunning and mutating virus.   Even recently, the most secured countries like New Zealand and Taiwan had local community cases while the previous secured ones like Japan and South Korea had fallen with Japan’s healthcare system on the brink. It is not the number of ICU beds that matter but the number of quality people needed to run them.  We must not be over-confident that we are good, we can do always do more. This is our healthcare security, it is not for trading for diplomacy; it is not a trading card.  “This is not a game of cards! This is your life and mine!”"

101576821,91657100,Alan Kho,Feb-05,Strictly NO . Perhaps Singapore can consider sharing experience of ICU management of COVID-19 infected patients with neighbouring countries 
101576821,91657100,Jonathan Ng,Feb-05,"It would not make sense to do this. And it’s probably not feasible logistically.   A better alternative perhaps, is to provide medical personnel, pharmaceutical and healthcare support to neighboring countries in solidarity with good ASEAN principles."

If not, instead of good notion, it becomes a political issue. Therefore I think it is only practical if we have the capacity which our country are sizeable (in term landscape) to build the extra infrastructure to accommodate."
101576821,91657100,Brenda Chin,Feb-05,Erm. No covid icu patients doesn’t mean no patients in the icu. We may have the infrastructure but do we have enough healthcare workers to support? Food for thought 🙂

101576821,91657100,Ho Sim Sim,Feb-06,"I don't think is right for the writer to compare Singapore with big countries like Germany and Austria.  Singapore is a small country with resources just enough for the current population of 5 millions. With 1 million infected in indonesia, it is already 20% of our overall population. We can help, but the question is how much help?  Our key consideration should always be for our own survival first before lending a helping hand."
101576821,91657100,Hayden Ali,Feb-05,"NO, I definitely do not wish to see our government importing these additional patients from different countries into our ICU units. There are too many unforeseeable circumstances. Touchwood, what if there were a sudden surge of local cases, where to put the locals then? Expo, under void deck? Since the ICU units are full with foreign patients.                                                                                                                       Germany and Austria are able to accept fellow 'EU' citizens into their ICU units, because of their shared currency. Perhaps, if Bruneians were to come here, I guess this article wont be filled with angry individual comments. Till, majority of our population here in Singapore were to receive vaccinations, and our local communities do not contribute to any much cases within a year or so, by then if our government wants to lend a hand to our neighbours by accepting some of their citizens, I would understand. If not, I guess this article contributes to societal annihilation of locals.  "

As much as humanitarian efforts should be applauded, there isn’t as much resources that can be spared, compared to other big countries eg. China, America, Russia.

Also bear in mind that community outbreaks can quickly escalate and is highly unpredictable. It is therefore important that our ICU be available in stand-by mode to cope with sudden outbreaks. If want to help, perhaps consider sending volunteers to neighbouring countries to set up temporary hospitals, or sending trained medical staff to volunteer at overseas hospitals."

Those r the two examples you cited. I don’t have to remind u our population compared to the neighbouring countries. U r trying to sink our healthcare.
101576821,91657100,Dezzie Lim,Feb-05,"Yes, but on the context that the foreign government or the patient must pay the full foreign rate.

Given the large number of patients, our assistance will be too small scale, but carries too much risk.  Being the only “safe” country in the region doesn’t benefit us.

Saying ""just help la help la, help others la"" is easy.. but ever spare a thought of those that really do the ground work (healthcare workers)? I'm sure by now theyre very drained (emotionally exhausted too, ""draw a safe distance w their loved ones"" to continue to work tirelessly to care for the sick)..  Help others, and drained all SG resources? Who pay? Us? Sporean pay tax to government, should use the $ to help our citizen first!  If drained $ liao, crisis striked again, how?

Doubt there is any space left. Also, those European countries are so large that they would have multiple gov hospitals. Singapore is so small (landmass 782km²), how can we even help Indonesia (1.9 million km² landmass).. lol! The author might have failed common sense"

Singaporean are getting tire of all the restrictions and start to get relax on it. Once the virus start spreading in community our healthcare worker going to suffer again. Also how u select which country ICU patients to help? Both Indonesia n Malaysia are over stretch. U help one never help another later that country not happy.

I’m sure there are patients in ICU, maybe not covid 19 patients but there are other illnesses that need ICU treatment! Also if you look at the number of imported cases by our wonderful gov , I’m sure it’s a matter of time before we end up in stage 1 or 2 again! Looks like we are already excepting unlimited infected cases from certain high risk countries like India and Indonesia already so maybe the author needs to do some better research! The author obviously hasn’t been to hospitals of late as there is a long wait for a bed daily at A&E in SGH. My friend who’s a doctor said most medical staff are scared and overtired! "

101576821,91657100,Vincent Ng,Feb-05,"The definitive answer would be NO. Our country can provide help to our neighbors in other ways such as providing excess medical supplies or advise on how to manage their local crisis. We simply do not have that excess capabilities to provide such a request. Remember, this pandemic will be a protracted and unpredictable undertaking that requires cooperation from all quarters of our society to overcome. Moreover, I'm surprised that indonesia has had not erected any temporary hospitals in their provinces to provide the necessary medical relief to the locals given their vast amount of resources both from the public and private sectors."

Once you bring one critical case over,  more will want to come. If we can't control the outbreak & our own critical case shoots up & we run out of ICU beds  then how ? Sent them back ?  It would be more practical to help them to set up ICU over there."

101576821,91657100,Gabe Seah,Feb-05,What is the impact on future Singaporean medical cost?  Will taking in more foreign patient led to an increase in insurance of medical professional and reduce the access to medical facilities causing health care cost to increase?  Will local be deprive or receive low priority medical care since they have to compete with rich foreign patient? (See what happens to the housing market) So many potential pitfall if this issue is taken too lightly and decision is based on profit or economic gains.

Since we had the plan to establish ourself as a regional medical hub thus this is perhaps the most valuable time that we advertise and promote ourselves to the world... In business and financial term we add in revenues and jobs...in humane term we are helping to save life.."

In the current climate, I don’t think Singapore is capable of taking them in.   Our poor medical workers are already dealing with the daily import cases plus existing patients.   Even without Covid, to fix one appointment with public hospital to see the specialist takes months.   Comparing the A&E in Sg vs A&E in Australia, we pale in comparison to efficiency. I think we are really not in any possible to support the neighbours.  "
101576821,91657100,Teresa Wong,Feb-06,To me - purely NO.  The private hospitals already have their fair share of arrivals fm overseas already.  So why want to burden our public health care more.

That's assuming that the private hospital market is decoupled from the healthcare resources available for locals.

It brings in revenue for local hospitals and provides more opportunities to train local doctors. Of course, only the wealthy patients can afford it."

We can’t afford to overstretch our medical frontliners. No amount of money you throw at them can help them get back their health if they are overworked and we need their dedicated care. There definitely will be some black sheep but they should not be put in a position such that they try to push work from one shift to another shift and negligence. Quality of healthcare will go down.

Doing a kind act is good for the soul, but Singapore is a small country of no natural resources, with many patients of its own - patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, Covid-19, etc. Big countries with many natural resources and manpower like Indonesia, Australia, could do more and better in this aspect, so as to gain global standing. However, I think rich patients could seek help from our private hospitals in this difficult time."

Lest we became even burden with the cost which they couldn't even pay up or refusal to pay, then all  Singaporeans have to borne their fees. Thus covid19 might be with us till 2025. It is presumed worst by some ""Predictions"" that Earth Population would be half by then;  taking away bad and evil people... We have no rights to compare either Germany，Netherlands etc. Let's not talk about what the Nazis did during WWII .... while Netherlands has it's problems dealing with extremist for decades within as a friend from Netherlands once told me... and China's upcoming brings White Supremacists eyes red.... Learn to say No ! Your closest neighbours might not be your friends,  as they're just taking advantage of you again and again. If you cannot love and protect yourself, you might not even have a life to live anymore. There are other ways to help than talking covid patients from Indonesia.  Answer is No ! Just ignore Raymond Greep will do. He's trying to be very famous, because he need not pay a single cent out from his own pocket while Singapore International stand is so bleek in his eyes. He probably wouldn't know how much help Singapore had done to help it's neighbouring countries since...."

Considering the fact that we arent really out of the woods yet (community cases are still popping up), i dont think its wise thing to do. You wont know if we might yet face another CB.  Also, ICU isnt just for covid. So its not like icu wards are empty everyday jist because there are no covid patients."

101576821,91657100,Paul Stara Tan,Feb-05,Which idiot writes this forum? No ah.
101576821,91657100,Au Kah Kay,Feb-05,"The writer’s argument is severely flawed. He cited EU countries which take in patients from other member states. EU citizens have freedom of borderless movement within the EU and their national health insurance is portable throughout all EU countries.   ASEAN is different from the EU. There are wide socio-economic gaps between different ASEAN countries.  There is no free borderless movement of ASEAN nationals between member nations. National health benefits are not portable within ASEAN member nations.   Indonesia has a large population. There are many rich Indonesians who can afford to fly to Singapore for medical treatment and this was evident at the beginning of the pandemic when a severely ill patient flew into Singapore by air ambulance for treatment only to succumb a few days later. Since then, MOH has put a stop to ‘COVID-19 medical tourists’ requiring a health declaration to be submitted ahead of a planned visit to Singapore for medical consultation.  Although transmission within  Singapore is relatively low and ICU beds are readily available, allowing foreigners including Indonesians to seek treatment for COVID19 in Singapore will overwhelm the healthcare system. ICU beds are also required for other medical conditions besides COVID19. Hospitals in the UK have had to convert normal wards and operating theatres into COVID19 ICUs. We must never allow this to happen by opening the flood gates to foreign COVID19 cases.   The ability to pay for private medical care shouldn’t even be a consideration. Singapore’s hospital facilities should be reserved for Singaporeans and residents in times of a pandemic.   Because of the pandemic, hospital appointments and elective surgery for non-COVID19 related conditions have been put on hold for months. There is still a backlog of elective procedures to be performed."
101576821,91657100,Kong Mun Chung,Feb-05,"The writer is remotely aware of the cost and manpower resources to take care of 1 patient in ICU?  And there's no telling how long is the hospitalization needed each patient taken.  The article below indicates it can range from $40K for Covid icu patients staying hospitalised less than 1 week to more than $460K for those needing more than 15 days  https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/average-cost-hospital-care-covid-19-ranges-51000-78000-based-age  If just 100 patients were taken then all of them needing ICU hospitalization of more than 15 days. These 100 patients will cost more than 46 million to care for?  Perhaps, how will the writer think if this money which will go towards caring for sick Singaporeans be channeled to these guest patients?"
101576821,91657100,Ivan Yong,Feb-05,"We were lucky that all I can say, 5years ago Singapore don't have so many bed yet ,don't talk about ICU!  My mother was waiting at the corridor for more than 8,hrs before the hospital manage to give a bed . That was the time that Singapore hospital. Cannot cope with the high influx of the FT and their families."

101576821,91657100,Alex Alexeverae Lim,Feb-05,"This is a stupid feedback, if done out of goodwill. It's not just about expressing neighbourliness; C19 is an ongoing fight in which one breakout can rapidly multiple across clusters. And SG has not even achieved 80% population immunity yet, either vaccinated or recovered.   Furthermore, there is also the issue of foreign policy. Taking in another country's patients and rejecting others does not spell partiality on the side of our Singapore.  A better way would be to offer technical assistance/funding/ equipment to the most needy countries within ASEAN. This will not place our medical system under potential undue stress, minimise possible transmission of variants of C19, and not jeopardise foreign relations."

101576755,15407100,You Liang Koo,Feb-02,Poor leadership. A lot of “Jiak Liao Bee” ministers in their cabinet. I don’t think they can ever find out the cause and nip the bud. Will keep on extending the MCO. Who suffers? The Malaysians! Haiz...  Their only hope is the vaccine. I dun think their government can ensure that every citizen is vaccinated. I think they must fly a plane and scatter the vaccine in the air like Agent Orange.

101576754,50752100,Irene Lum,Feb-02,This is why our government has to be very clear about setting areas for smoking. So many bus drivers smoke at the area next to Punggol MRT Station. It is high time container units be used for smokers. The smoke can be contained inside and this keeps non smokers safe.
101576754,50752100,Nyetzy Yip,Feb-02,No point highlighting what everyone already know. What are the authorities going to do about it? Everyday I experience second hand smoke from neighbours who are inconsiderate. With the windy conditions prevailing in Sg now. One person smokes 30 other people feel like they are smoking too. 
101576754,50752100,Albert Wong,Feb-02,"Based on the official statistics, the severity of breaking smoking laws warrants Total Prohibition of Cigarette Sale in Sg. As we all know, there are tens of thousands witnessing of illegal smokings went by without being officially complaint. Come on PM, 🚭Declare Banning of Cigarettes Smoking in Spore for the good of all🙏 "
101576754,50752100,Jerome Ong,Feb-02,Allow smoking in more areas so people don’t have to enjoy the pleasures of tobacco from their high-rise units. Problem solved!
101576754,50752100,Jeff Leong,Feb-02,An important source of revenue. Not going to change anything. No violations = no fines = no revenues.
101576754,50752100,John Tang,Feb-02,"Ban lah! smoking, except for travellers at airport and hotel. Stopping smoking means saving hard earned money for the family's marketing needs and also free up the other family members and neighbours from inhaling second-hand, cancerous smoke. This will put an end to the complaints."
101576754,50752100,Delvin Chuah,Feb-03,"Just ban cigarette, ban alcohol than all no complaints.. wait maybe ban bicycle also since so many complaints also🤔"
101576754,50752100,Peter Tan,Feb-02,"I could see the smoke flying from my balcony no thanks to the ah pek who puff every morning,afternoon night sometimes sitting at the stairs maybe to escape the nagging wife who was well known for using the most obscene hokkein words at times I saw him sitting near the bicycle parking lot,some neighbors home outside as long as there is a place to sit on even at the CC one day as I was going to the market.I am glad the wind is blowing the smoke away from my balcony not inside when I was doing some exercises each morning."
101576754,50752100,Inconsiderate and Noisy Neighbours,Feb-02,"If commitment in catching the offenders and convicting them is raised, situation will improve"
101576754,50752100,Kris Pan,Feb-02,"Me also a smoker. Complainants about secondhand smoke, please dun blame the smokers. Blame that useless MP and authorities for being brainless. Just ban import into this place and all smokers or smokers will not argue further. FULL-STOP!"
101576754,50752100,Li Ly,Feb-02,"Maybe ban smoking. Smokers will get used to it, just like chewing gum. Some more now we can't enter Msia to buy chewing gum and no one seems to be dying from it. I know they are 2 different things but what I meant is this is all just a habit."
101576754,50752100,Myke Muk K C,Feb-02,It seems that 99.99% of smokers felt that dropping of a tiny butt is no big deal . But NEA cannot be everywhere all the time .
101576754,50752100,Philip Chew,Feb-02,NEA should take stern actions against such people and not just showing figures.
101576754,50752100,Robert Lim,Feb-02,Are smoking allowed in hawkers centres? I have noticed that some hawkers and friends smoke at hawker centres and the secondary smoke wafting to other tables next to it. The public members suffer in silence breathing in the secondary cigarette smoke while eating their meals. Maybe the MPs of Town Council may want to look into this.
101576754,50752100,Teo Jack,Feb-02,No lei. It is tissue paper more common.
101576754,50752100,Lance Bernard Goh,Feb-02,But.. wat did NEA do? That’s more important. Arrested anyone

101576732,48477100,Irene Lum,Feb-02,"I hope BCA investigates A Treasure Trove Condo in the evenings. There are easily 20 to 30 children, teenagers and adults almost every evening; running, shouting and screaming in intergroups. It is strange how this has been going on for months; with emails to the MP and feedback to OneService with NO law enforcement. I understand you cannot charge the children, but surely you should charge the parents who do not heed the guards' warning and let their children and teenagers continue in such manners."
101576732,48477100,Bernard Ong,Feb-01,Why only a $300 fine for the rest? Whereby each one of them breaking the COVID19 laws and have the intention to cheat the public and the cheat the law? If there are no pictures posted online.. isn't that there will go scot-free? Where's the laws.. I just feel that is a double standard. Extremely disappointed with the outcome
101576732,48477100,Mary-Anne Loo,Feb-01,"Why only fine $300 for the others?  They probably won't know when they were invited, but should leave when they reached there and saw the crowd... unless they assumed the remaining 8 persons stay in the same household?"

101576694,81957100,Wah Yong Chee,Jan-31,So says the editor who published an illegal poll results. Talk about unity.
101576694,81957100,George Varughese,Jan-31,"(Great work, Singapore. Not easy to be an oasis of reason.)  The mathematics behind this idea is interesting enough to be a significant footnote in the development of the human herd entire. (More data controls begets the need for more data.)  Everywhere."
101576694,81957100,Pat Eng,Jan-31,It was One United People under the Old Guards. I doubt we know where we are heading now.
101576694,81957100,Meng Tat Chang,Jan-31,"Limpeh Singapore is the best managed country in the world hor. Since 1965... We have punch way above our weight in the world guided by the best government in the world. No resources but acquired deep reserves thru near zero corruption and CPIB enforcement. Safest country, racial harmony, HDB, CPF, only 7 percent gst versus NZ  gst 15% & Finland gst 24 %. Majority of citizens pay no income tax vs Finland average tax rates of 54%. In Singapore, PM invite top tier talent with good character and upbringing to serve as Minister with coffee sessions until they agree to give up their dreams. In most other countries, first and second tier talent are chasing their first billion dollars. Only 3rd tier talent or below are serving as Ministers. Our secret formula... The best as Ministers, oppies pick up the losers in life"
101576694,81957100,Faith Sun,Jan-31,Why call for that when the media themselves are causing division with their flipping news? It would be good that one take a good look at themselves at why they are doing before going to tell others what to do. Those who pick crumbs and look at the carrots and all for the economy are flocking together and United as one. This chief person who is playing politics can’t be trusted for unity. 
101576694,81957100,Ko Shan Zhou,Jan-31,"Diverse my foot, the truth is Singapore without Chinese will become like any watershed city in south east Asia."

101576618,49142100,Max Tan,Jan-28,"MAS and the 3 local banks could perhaps develop an App that contains Ang POWs. Each bank can then insert their logo, different animals to depict the year and designs if the bank wishes. Bank customers can send these Ang pows to those people whom they want to give the red packets to. Giver can insert some auspicious words to the receiver and also key in the amount to give. When receiver received the red packets they click the Ang pows to open and read the words and the amount received. Needs one off programming and yearly updates depending on which animal year. This may eradicate the yearly queueing and printing of red packets and new notes. For elderly Singaporeans the children who are more savvy may help them with the process. "

The chevroned shape of the fenders certainly imply that they are intended for mounting the decks of craft smaller than them thereby forcing them into the water...up-armouring the forecastle around the bridge area certainly implies they are expecting to confront aggressors who return fire after non-response to warnings...  ...curiously...the red-painted racing stripes livery down the front of the hull seems to imply they are likely to be handed over to PCG asset control in the near future...

For example, whisking up a meringue is introducing air bubbles as well as denaturing proteins such as albumin by mechanical force. The difference between baking soda and baking powder is that the former needs something acidic in the recipe (lemon juice, cream of tartar, brown sugar, yoghurt, buttermilk etc) for CO2 to be produced and therefore the baked goods to rise while the latter only requires an aqueous phase as the acidic component is already present. Sugar is not just for taste but is part of the building blocks for the structure of cakes, stabilises your meringue, as well as tenderise your baked goods. The various flour are different because of particle size and protein content which affects the texture and flexibility of the baked products. Butter contains water and if you want to brown your butter, you have to remove the water content before the protein solids in butter will brown... There’s so much science in there. Baking is essentially chemistry. Baking bread is chemistry plus biology. Last but not least, I teach my daughter that for every change and adjustment she makes to her attempts at a recipe, she should document it. Documentation is one of the most important thing in scientific experiments. For whatever results and conclusions drawn is moot if the process is not documented in detail."

I was on World Dream 9 days ago and I will presume that Quantum has the same exact measures in place, it just so happened Quantum had an unlucky moment in which a passenger was tested positive.  People I believe who go on these cruises know the risks they are getting into, but unlike international cruises, HighSeas/NoWhere/ cruises with no port of call have already been around a long time way before even Singapore had a casino and are generally safer since there will be no interaction with none other than Singaporeans/PRs (not including crew and the fly cruise passengers before the pandemic)  If you personally ask me, the definition of stupid in this pandemic is one who gets complacent, flouting the rules, not practicing the social distancing, etc etc. It’s not people who chose to go on the ship. So don’t blame these people or the government. In my opinion, Covid 19’s virus (TO ME) is not the problem, but the people are the bigger problem (especially those I mentioned above)."
101575456,14482100,Tan Kok Tim,"Dec 9, 2020","The cruise....a half voyage... No place is safe so long as this virus remains and continues to be alive among human beings. Vaccines not a cure but a means of prevention only. We are in 174th day since phase 2 re-opening of the CB but there is no sign of ending the virus pandemic? Do we want to go on another 174 days or 400 days? Do we have the solutions? Or is it the vaccine is our hope? ====== No cure for the common cold.Is there a medical treatment or medical cure for COVID-19?. However, worldwide mankind has crossed the 365th day and the infection has gone up in some big countries and cities, latest there were more than 10m infection, and more than 1m deaths.Will this madness go on for another 12 or 24 months, and will deaths go up to 2 or 3m? What are our plans? What are our yearly roadmaps for the coming 10 years to 2031? Who will ask for it in Parliament? ====== Mask-wearing…do we see the bigger picture?Is the vaccine a cure or a prevention measure?Will red dot encourage the UN and the WHO to do this 40 thing?Should the UN and WHO get all countries to cooperate and shut down for 40 days and 40 nights to stamp out COVID-19? The best of time is now for the countries in the northern hemisphere during this wintry period [Christmas, New Year 2021, and the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays] to shut down for 40 days [like in the olden days of the leprosy infection to quarantine the new arrivals until the all-clear signal to let them out].Now is the time to do just that for the all-clear of infected persons to stamp out COVID-19 and force it to have a natural ending.As for all other counties, those at the equator and those in the southern hemisphere [summer time], all should unite and comply to shut down too for 40s day to stamp out this disease well and good. Can the UN and WHO obtain this universal cooperation by all countries around the world to shut down this earth for 40 days and 40 nights at the same time? Time for the whole world to go into hibernation for 40 days. If we don’t do we want to continue with the madness for another 400 or more days worldwide affecting the economy and all aspects of human lives. Choose wisely to have a suffering of 40 or 400 days physically, mentally, economically and socially, or do we want more?"

Think, cameras n machine can detect you when you make attempts to withdraw or use it. Best for the card owner, destroy it. Save the trouble for all. Report police also create problem.

101573974,94632100,Terry Wong,"Sep 29, 2020","I have mixed views on this. Pretty disappointed they scrap the flights to nowhere but its up to SQ and their management system to decide. Even if it does launched. It might not take off very well, scrapping it may be a good cause. Looking at the situation now and never forget recently SQ and other airlines let go alot of their staffs. It is really a very difficult time to everyone in the airline industry. But the introduction of an A380 dining experience sounds good. I never boarded or entered an SIA plane before and will wish to enjoy this experience if it kicks off."

It would be even more amazing to have tours of the airplanes - I am sure kids and adults alike would love to see the airplanes up close and go around, especially the cockpit. But they just copy one another. You wanna make money? Use the kids! Give them an airplane as a playground and they would go craaaazy! Let them see the cockpit. Let them meet the Pilots and the Stewardesses and stewards and they would gooo crazyyyyyyy. Why do they need to copy other companies? I know so many kids (mine included) that would have the time of their lives touring a real airplane"

101573974,94632100,Jack Yu,"Oct 1, 2020","I know many people on Facebook, including my personal friends, are mocking Singapore Airlines' offer of the $498 First Class meal. Yes, paying top dollars for a 10-course meal to be delivered to your home may seem absurd to most of us. However, they miss a very important point.   These meals are not targeted at people like us, mortals who fly Economy Class and pay for a $300 round-trip ticket to Bangkok with complimentary meals and customer service. These $498 meals are First Class fare, which has been curated by top, world-renowned chefs and come with premium wine and premium toileteries normally given out to First Class passengers.  We find a $498 meal expensive but top honchos who don't bat an eyelid to splurge $10,000 on an air ticket and $800 for a night in Shangri-la or Sheraton will beg to differ. I have met some of these high flyers (First Class passengers, PPS frequent flyers, etc) and I know these meals may appeal to them. These guys understand real value and they don't have time to waste browsing Facebook.  I'm not mocking or undermining my good friends here but I'm saying we're simply looking at things from our own perspectives. The world is much, much bigger than we think. Apple-to-apple comparisons are important."

Fly to Heathrow Airport.  1. Land in Heathrow Airport for a couple of hours.  2. NO exit to the country. No going thru Immigration. 3. Do a package Tour in the Airport plus meals and shopping etc. 4. After all is done, take a flight home.  I am sure Shopping Flights to Dubai, Tokyo, Seoul and even winter shopping in Geneva etc will attract a new kind kind of flying and shopping or even lifestyle..  It is win for SIA, its pilots, its staffs, its planes and win for these airports as well.  I wud be keen if you have one that flies to HongKong or any China cities for a “Shopping Flight”!!"

Riders must always keep to the the left of expressway to avoid such accidents. Noticed that motorcyclists loves to ride on the middle lane of expressway instead of on the left. Motor cyclists please take care and note that you are prone to injury unlike when you are in a car whereby you are protected by the vehicle. Be safe
101573835,93497100,Joseph Lee,"Sep 24, 2020","When driving on the fastest lane of an expressway, do you drive in the centre of the lane?? Try doing that in Malaysia, you will be in trouble. There is an invisible lane between the middle and outer lane and there you are expected to drive closer to the right to give way to the numerous fast motor cyclists. For years, one never drive too close to the right for safety reasons, just in case there is some small obstacles which is usually on the side. Now along PIE, there are so many fast motor cyclists and they expect you to give way. During heavy traffic, the problem gets worst. "

(Don’t assume that since he isn’t serving the military/army, so he is immune from such a fate. During the last World Wars, millions of untrained, civilian young men & teenage boys were snatched from their parent, dragged from their homes at gun-point, and sent to the borders to face the enemy machine-guns). Would you like to see your daughter/sister repeatedly gang-raped by enemy soldiers till she faints, and then dragged by her hair to the brothel to satisfy the army’s lust, or else face execution? Well this is exactly what happened to countless ladies when the ‘League of Nations’ (predecessor of the United Nations) was disbanded by ultra-nationals like Hitler & Mussolini which inevitably led to the WW2. Would you ever want to wake at the middle of the night with an ear-exploding burst to see your neighborhood carpet-bombed? And before you realize, your ceiling collapses on you, fracturing your thigh bone & ribs………you are trapped in the rubble and knowing fully well you’ll meet a horrible end…..no one left to even quench your thirst, let alone rescue you. Everything is happening all over again: We are inevitably moving towards WW3 as Nationalist leaders (like Trump et al) are destroying the United Nations. Remember Nostradamus’s spine-chilling prophecy? He predicted WW3 at around 1998-1999 A.D. If anything had stopped/delayed it for so long (since 1945) then it is the UNITED NATIONS. Don’t repeat the horrors of history. Save the UN before it is too late. Only then can you save your own family. Don’t let your vote-hungry leaders play with your National pride. We are all humans, a very closely related species, and certainly an intelligent species capable of turning our planet into paradise. Don’t turn your brothers & sisters around the World into blood-thirsty monsters in the name of Nationalism. It’ll turn our planet into hell. By the way, today United Nations turns 75. Happy Birthday, dear UN! Let’s sing together for peace, prosperity and unity.  One World. One human race.

I tried to be strong just for them but many times I would fall apart, my heart was filled with sorrow and pain because I really loved my husband and our home? So I decided to search for help online and I came across Mama Morgan. I wanted to get my husband back so I felt I should give this a try. I contacted Mama Morgan and she was able to help me as soon as possible, she told me what to do and I did it? After some time my husband called me and told me that he missed me and the kids so much, I was overwhelmed!! and I asked him if he could come back to us, which he accepted, few days after he was home, he apologized for the pain he caused me and the kids. Then from that day, our marriage has been now stronger than how it was before, All thanks to Mama Morgan. She is so powerful and I decided to share my story on the internet that Mama Morgan  is a trustworthy powerful spiritual healer who I will always pray to live long to help anyone in the time of trouble, If you are here and your life is ruined, there""s hope, contact Mama Morgan she will be able to help you Call or Watsapp +27784502035."

I believe  the chairs, the handrails and the bell have already been contaminated, maybe by the previous passengers who had  alighted in previous stops, or some virus carriers (doesn't mean that it is the index patient) who probably sit at the back in the compartment had touched the bus facilities after touching his nose/mouth/mask. Infection by contact and droplets should be the main reasons for the spreading of the illness."

All the problems China has with her neighbours like ‘Diaoyu island’ with Japan and borders with India, tension in South China Sea, or the THAAD crisis with South Korea are directed or created by US deliberately as a means to contain China. As RCEP schedule to sign within this year, you can expect US will make use of the politician in Japan, South Korea, or countries in ASEAN countries who are pro US to create trouble and dispute between these countries with China in the hope to kill the RCEP. Leaders of Asian countries should have the wisdom not to fool by US strategy to split Asia countries so forever there won’t be an ASIAN era to compete with the west."

According to MOM website, foreign levy is imposed to ensure a fair jobs opportunity between the local and the foreigners as there is a Employer CPF contribution for the local.  So how local graduate and PMET going to compete jobs fairly with Employment Pass with zero levy and no quota??

In fact Raymond Koh has raised the issue as far back as 2013 and was admonished by former Temasek Holdings MD Michael Dee - a foreigner and was defended by Pritam Singh instead.  If CECA has not jeopardised employment opportunities why continue to publish statistics aggregating Singapore citizens and PRs together? Senior management jobs are not at all in the Fair hiring framework because of intra corporate transfers exemption under CECA. You ministers are not paid millions to be on auto-pilot and be obsequious to MNCs or subscribe to your own propaganda that Singaporeans are not talented except yourselves.  Ngiam Tong Dow has said this policy is not sustainable for Singapore in the long term as MNCs are totally unsentimental.

In the absence of solid numbers to be made transparent by the authorities/MOM, we the citizens of Singapore, have no choice but to present assumptions, bearing in mind, the unfair employment practices. To begin with, there are information circulating that there are aplenty of India Indians in Temasek, in the banks especially DBS. People witnessed aplenty India Indians came out of the office of one of the big 4s. The batches coming in and out of condominiums and the hordes seen in Changi Business Park, MBFC, Alexandra, etc etc. When research was made to the CECA, there are specific clauses that allow free flow of India Indians to work in Singapore. One clause allows freedom to bring in families and communities. Another allows free flow replacements as well. So what say you? 1 plus 1 = 2 right?  Go read the other analyses which were done weeks ago when we are hit by the pandemic. The authorities/MOM lump Singapore citizens with PRs as Singaporeans, forgetting that it is mandatory that Singapore citizens enlist for National Service and Singapore citizens cannot withdraw certain CPF contributions until death! Therefore, it has come to our realisation that the authorities/MOM seem to have no qualms to allow foreigners to take up jobs supposedly meant for Singapore citizens. Sad ending for Singapore citizens after 55 years of toil by the Pioneer and Merdeka generations. Free for all and all for free to enjoy the 1st world infrastructure in Singapore while the true blue Singapore Singaporeans are burdened with housing loans and financial commitments for the schoolers and elderlies."

With that being said, it is timely to open our borders to countries further afield in light of the approaching holiday season. We have a sizeable expatriate population in Singapore and it would only be fitting if they could be reunited with their loved ones during Thanksgiving and Christmas. These are two very significant annual holidays and the common theme running through them is family reunions. Surely, we would want to enable rather than disable this. In addition to the expatriate workforce on this island, we too have Singaporeans who are married to a spouse of another nationality and would need to head back to Europe etc for Christmas."

It doesn't ask you for your passport/work passes before it does its ""job"". Everyone is suffering in one way or another. Who are we to decide & judge whose suffering is ""better or worse"". It's not a competition/game/contest to see whose story commands a higher sympathy.   Rather then comparing & judging each other, this should really be the best time to be EMPATHETIC to support, care or at least understand each other instead.   The reporters are just doing their job, to share stories of who they had encountered. Every single one of us has our own story that's worthy to share. In fact, newspapers will become thick like encyclopedias if we could all share.   Even in times of a crisis, we don't need to be always trying to fight over whose turn is it to share, or whose Life is higher/better than others. HELP each other instead, that's what we ALL need most right now, to eventually rally TOGETHER & pull ourselves up from these multiple crises (pandemic, recession, mental depression, etc.)."

Singapore paid a high price , for not implementing confirm to barracks based on Singapore military recruit camp for the foreign workers dormitories during the Pre Lock Down . ENFORCEMENT!!!!!! Self discipline and social distancing within dormitories compounds ......   This not about human right , the workers have right to choose the way they want to live in a crisis .   It should apply the same California smoker rule , if you want to smoke , smoke some other places , we as non smokers have the right to use the space before the smokers .

I am so embarrassed to see this kind of sickening news. I have been disciplined as a young child by my parents which actually helped me fix my bad habits and bad attitude towards other people....but hitting a 9 year old girl with a metal stick and trying to drown her are really disgusting and evil.   Many S.Koreans come to Singapore for a better, safer life with good education and career opportunities, etc. We should respect the laws, the people, and show a good side of Korea instead of having to receive criticism and stereotypes due to bad manners, bad behavior and even having to end up on the National news like this Korean family with bad parents.   Yes, Korean society has been hierarchal where the elder/senior always has the say and authority but once again, there is a LINE that no human being (regardless of race, culture or religion) should CROSS.   Hope my Singaporean friends out there don't stereotype ALL Koreans are violent, ill-mannered and low-class.

He will accused or frame other PM with false allegation just to make sure he gets control again n he actually wants his son (Muhkris) to be the next PM so that he can continue his evil deeds by giving all project to his son n cronis. As far as i know all alegation against Najib till now got no prove n evidence to charge him. Just look at Anwar Ibrahim...Mahathir promise to pass him the PM job after 2 yrs but what happen..he purposely resign so that Anwar can't get it n now he wants to be PM again

101570989,91687100,Sharingan Ismadi,"Jun 5, 2020","Unlikely to happen. The funpack contents already pre-arranged from months back from sponsors. Also if cannot find sponsor for the souvenir, have to self buy which is a cost."
101570989,91687100,Tsai Teck See,"Jun 5, 2020","We took more than 2 months to figure out a design and production of masks . Do you think they can come up with a meaningful souvenir within less 2 months ? Even then , the sheeps man will tell you in his next NDP related topic that it’s so hard to get the materials for the proposed souvenir ! "
101570989,91687100,Liaw Sze Keong,"Jun 5, 2020","A 5th Budget called Sustainability Budget, with extra cash for everyone. NDP55 is a reminder of how far Singapore has come, and how much further Singapore has to go."
101570989,91687100,Janette Ng,"Jun 5, 2020","NDP Funpack is a waste of public fund and stop those costly fireworks. Are'nt they non-essential?   The idea of a small meaningful souvenir is not bad but anyway, it's too late now."
101570989,91687100,K Thiam Cheong,"Jun 5, 2020","With the current economy situation, please do not waste money. Please do away with such inessential. Thank you. "
101570989,91687100,Pinkz Indira,"Jun 5, 2020",Y waste $$ buying things which is not useful. We hoped that we were given cash/grocery vouchers for us to use during this period of pandemic.   Stay safe guys
101570989,91687100,Jiahui Luo,"Jun 5, 2020","The government usually plan things ahead. If they want to give every family a goodie bag. The goodie bags would have been packed by the NS man already and stored somewhere months ago. Collection of goodie bag would probably be the same as distribution of masks. Self collect at CC or RC. If you don’t want, can don’t collect."
101570989,91687100,Nickie Woo,"Jun 6, 2020","Not to mention stil have to call for public tenders, a minimum of three quotes, and the whole tender award process.."
101570989,91687100,Daisy Tng,"Jun 5, 2020","Perhaps give us a face mask with Singapore logo on it. Yes, sanitizer is useful too. Don't give out  plastic stuff at all, not environmentally friendly. Simple and practical😘"
101570989,91687100,Alvin Chua,"Jun 5, 2020",What author is saying is that he wants government to void all the contacts that they have promised to the suppliers of the NDP. Then replace them with another contract to produce souvenirs.   Pls ask author to explain what would those business do with the raw materials and supplies they would have ordered?
101570989,91687100,Bernard Ong,"Jun 5, 2020",4th round nation wide distribution on mask or 2nd round of hand sanitizer which is more practical in the current situation. #justsaying
101570989,91687100,傅茗芬,"Jun 5, 2020","I think a bigger clock will be better instead of a small clock as suggested by the writer. For me time reminds me of the numerous challenges we had faced and overcome such as what was spoken by Dr Ng Eng Hen that Singapore had still held parades “through every troubled period”, including the 1988 Asian Financial Crisis, the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2008 global financial crisis. "
101570989,91687100,Dare Chia,"Jun 5, 2020",On one hand you complain about the reserves bleeding away. On the other hand there's frivolous spending like this. Of cos you invite questions.   PS pls cancel F1 too. 
101570989,91687100,Pauline Tan,"Jun 5, 2020",Don't waste money on giving out fun packs. The only thing people want out of it is probably the bag which will be used for a few months and the tidbits or drinks. Save the money in government piggy bank. We may need to draw funds from it again in who knows when.
101570989,91687100,Fifi Susanto,"Jun 5, 2020",Yes. A unique mask faceshield and ppe wd be something they will keep to commemorate 2020 ndp
101570989,91687100,Goh Chok Chai Ricky,"Jun 5, 2020","We're in no mood for fun. What we're most in need of is fund. Stop wasting fund in such dire time as now for fun, not funny at all. So for a meaningful souvenir would just have to be at least a $5.50 if not $55.00 in a printed Ang Pow to commemorate the 55th NDP, for true blue Singaporeans if not all. Useful and meaningful in such a time like this, period."
101570989,91687100,Felicia Tan Shu Fen,"Jun 6, 2020",No need. Why must gov forcing and insisting to spend on this ? There will be resources required to pack these items . I believe they be willing to distribute food n necessaries to needy people instead.
101570989,91687100,Trevor Willkickyourass BadLi,"Jun 5, 2020","Some have already expressed that they do not wish to receive fun packs as lots of resources needs to be channeled there. Bearing this same principle, there's no need for this. We appreciate the thought, but to bluntly put it, no need be so extra..."
101570989,91687100,Pat Eng,"Jun 6, 2020",Total waste of money coming. Funpack when there is no fun.
101570989,91687100,Mok Malvin,"Jun 5, 2020","Oh 55 liao, can maintain minimum sum in the reserves, and withdraw the excess for spending... that's the situation now... Some spent on cinawomen, some go batam, got one spend on MW"
101570989,91687100,Mohammad Ammar Azhar,"Jun 5, 2020",Funpacks are a waste of millions of dollars. They only benefit the manufacturers of the funpacks. Most probably affiliated to the gov.
101570989,91687100,Harry Chia,"Jun 5, 2020","Too late for such alternative, we are to collect the funpacks from CC"
101570989,91687100,Nur Idah,"Jun 5, 2020",Yes its a good idea a memorable gift instead of funpacks! I agree..self collect at cc will b good
101570989,91687100,Lau Wing Keong,"Jun 5, 2020","Others are planned but the most expensive issue are the fire works, pls stop it for this year & saving up the money"

101570989,91687100,Ah Hong,"Jun 5, 2020",Maybe can transfer all these funds for making the souvenirs into the bank accounts of Singaporeans? I'm self employed n hv appealed for SIR. So.. Yes... Waiting

101570989,91687100,Teo PC,"Jun 5, 2020",not a good idea... souvenir will end up in rubbish unless it is a gold coin or gold bar. 
101570989,91687100,Jon Bong,"Jun 6, 2020",Might be more meaningful to give it as food vouchers or etc to the needys. They will need it more then any of the 80% especially during this period and or after the phase 2.
101570989,91687100,Evan Tan,"Jun 5, 2020","The best fun packs must have MASK, SENITIZER, SGD1000 Note for 2020 NDP. Every Singaporean will remember the year 2020 NDP by heart! Hahaha"

101570989,91687100,Ruth C Fong,"Jun 5, 2020",Not even souvenirs pls. Practical giving to the nations will remain in their heart forever especially during these days.
101570989,91687100,Terence Ng,"Jun 5, 2020",Whu is there a need for memorable sovenir? Can I eat it? What do u want me to do with it? Chuck in one dark corner in my warddrobe? Rather u use the money to provide for the needy & under priviledged.
101570989,91687100,Andrew Chan,"Jun 5, 2020",Better to replace with super market voucher. $10 or $15 also good

I find her story kind of far fetched. Not sure if she is over exaggerating her struggles in her younger days.  She gave tuition to two-three groups of students after schools and even bought herself a motorcycle. On weekends, she works as promotor. If work like this, have time to revise her homework? And in her study years, she can struck up a partnership to run canteens at construction sites in 1980s? It's not as easy to do business when you are studying. Which partner can trust her? Or which partner can verify this incident?  The most exaggerating story - in 1991, she went on a trip on an old plane to an Indonesia town so remote that she cannot recall it's name. One of the propellers malfunctioned and the pilot used a broom stick to force the propeller to turn!   If she went through so much in her early life, will she takes such a risk to go to a remote town in Indonesia to source for business by herself at an age of 29 during the 90s?   Some tall story here. And this shows why a rag-to-riches tale turns sour in no time for this lady."

I am tickled that there are still people today who view rainbows as divine promises.   Sorry, the ancient Hebrew tale of a worldwide flood is fictitious.  Just because it is part of the first book of the Hebrew Torah, and also the larger Tanakh, and the Greek Septuagint that was based on it, and which in turn became the scriptures on which the writers of the eventual Koine Greek New Testament based their so-called messianic prophecies, does not mean that it is a historically factual tale."

Businesses that have folded or will fold or are on the verge of folding and collapsing.  I ask you, whose in the mood to celebrate? If i was the government, i would rather use the money to help those families whose breadwinners have lost their jobs, help companies that are going to fold or going under to quickly pull them up and tide them till phase 2 or 3 when services return to normal.  Trust me, no one is in the mood for fireworks, tanks rolling by, marchpass, fly pass, funpacks and the lot as its neither going to bring the people who have died from Covid-19 back, nor bring the jobs of people that have lost it back.

Shields with the Singapore 2020 logo emblazoned on it is not only practical but also symbolic of the fighting spirit  the entire country has shown during this crisis. It also serves as a simple but powerful reminder never to take what we have for granted even as we go about (hopefully) our lives semi-normally by then.

Giving is also happiness. While participants have free tickets, occasionally I have them to less fortunate kids that are kept away from their parents due to offences/abuses etc, they are excited as well.

Use zoom tele conference to sing along and also don't need put out fireworks this year as we can always catch up fireworks from YouTube video from any of the previous NDP shows can alrdy!

Think logistic, events, security and others. Spending by the government is one of the ways to boost the economy in a recession  If the government don’t spend, who does?  Everyone say we should save money in this difficult times. Yes as an individual you need to watch your spending but as a country, you need to spend to let money flow into the economy and circulate.   Yes you can give money to the people to spend but is the result the same? Are you as an individual going to organise an event or hire security for your home?   The NDP cost $40m last year. Give that out to every individual in the country and everyone gets less than $10.   This same goes for infrastructure projects and other projects. If the government doesn’t spend, who does?"

Gov spend so much on anti covid and assist us on so many fund as well as free healing for those kena unknowingly.  I think those goody bag n fireworks can safe on already.. before anything in our essential needs or living standard raise after the ordeal.  If really need a goody bag    I think.. those hygiene equipment can be considered.  Like.. 1 box of mouth mask. 5 pieces of face mask per household on average. Hand sanitizer, food vouchers and etc..  This will curb any left over covid virus in August... assuming that the virus are under 99 percent control and  less then 2 infected per day and nothing else..  That's my thought. "

Now, new Local Community Infections (among Singaporeans and PRs) seem to be cleverly hidden in the article and only discreetly appear deep in the news article.  When community infections were in the low single digits, state media loved to announce them proudly in the news headlines.

Only fools believe and support this shameless clown who lies through his teeth and contradicts himself at everyturn. #TrumpLiedPeopleDied   Trump and his government have failed their citizens so badly in the Covid-19 crisis that they have resorted to pointing fingers at the WHO and China to shift attention from their own failings and incompetencies.   The decrepit West.   Trump and his government is the biggest health threat to US citizens and the world. Countries must ban flights from the US to be safe.  Trump's US is now the world's epic centre for Covid-19 despite having months of lead time to prepare in advance. 🤦🏻‍♂️  Yes, continue to smear China and the WHO for your own incompetencies and failures.   US is now the champ for Covid-19 deaths and the global epicenter for the virus. You deserve it. 🏆  Continue on with the good work. #MAGA indeed. 👌  //  Trump Hopes You Forget How He Praised China And The WHO Before Blaming Them.  For months, he applauded China’s coronavirus response before he and his reelection team flipped to blaming that country.  President Donald Trump’s stepped-up efforts to blame China and the World Health Organization for the coronavirus pandemic’s toll may require collective amnesia of his recent lavish praise of both to work.  “The World Health Organization failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts,” Trump wrote in a new letter to the WHO threatening to end U.S. funding permanently. “The World Health Organization has been curiously insistent on praising China for its alleged ‘transparency.’  What the five-page letter, dated Monday, fails to note is his own repeated praise of both China and its dictator, Xi Jinping ― including for that same “alleged transparency.”  “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,” Trump wrote in a Jan. 24 Twitter post. “The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!  It was neither the first nor the last such tribute. On Jan. 22, the first day Trump spoke publicly about the coronavirus, he told Fox News there was nothing to worry about. “It’s all taken care of. And China is working very hard on the problem. We spoke about it and China is working very hard on it.”  Even two months later, Trump was still lauding China and Xi. “Look, I have a very good relationship with President Xi and they went through a lot. You know some people say other things. They went through a lot. They lost thousands of people. They’ve been through hell,” he told reporters on March 24.  Josh Schwerin, senior strategist with the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, said Trump’s ploy is obvious.  “Trump’s failure to act let the virus spread like wildfire in America and he now hopes that if the whole world is set ablaze, nobody will notice the damage he did at home,” Schwerin said. “Trump lies to distract from his early failures but his ongoing failures should worry us just as much.”  ...  “It’s jarring to see Trump’s letter invoke many of the data points that were publicly available in December and January to which he continued to turn a blind eye long after the WHO started sounding the alarm about the impending pandemic,” said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and a spokesman for the National Security Council under President Barack Obama. “You don’t have to believe the WHO’s response was perfect ― it wasn’t, of course ― to find fault with Trump’s deeply flawed approach, which essentially amounted to empty praise of Beijing until his sudden 180, after which he’s offered nothing but blame.”  https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-china-reversal-coronavirus-blame_n_5ec44c7bc5b61e42ad3d8876"

If any virus lands on any part of his suit, it will land on his mode of transport and also he needs to go thru sanitising shower before anyone can help him to remove the suit. Otherwise he’ll just be carrying the virus around on his suit and helping to pass it around. Without cleaning his suit frequently, especially the gloves portion that’s in contact everywhere, it’s really useless.   So far, the info is still best to keep hands clean and maintain social distancing."

However, in this aspect there's a possibility of scarcity of raw materials and question of labour to work on machines due to locked down. There's a question of speed of production to meet the lapse in orders of various countries due to different locked down at different times. (No uniformity)  No wonder countries which are underdeveloped or developing will face a different magnitude and they may hoard/stock food as what their individuals do. A contribution to chaos in this instance. Just simply that there's not a readily supplies if shutdowns continue and there's  shortage of experienced labour. There's a scarcity of anything if there is unusual  surges of demand.  The consequences maybe due to transformation of industries and retrenchments and turnovers of reliable labour"

During peak hrs we have to squeeze and stand shoulder to shoulder to another person, without knowing whether the person is sick anot?   In another instance, In the bus 335 which I took recently, a elderly man board the bus, sitting next to me shortly after which coughing he covered his mouth with his hands but after that he held the railing. How can we maintain hygiene?   One more instance, in public library, although there are temperature checks and scanning of identification card, a lot of times sick people may not appear sick at that point in time. Even if the staff noticed a man who is sick , he doesn’t have the rights to ask the man to go away / reject his entry.  I was in jurong west library where I noticed a sick old man wearing a mask, he was coughing and looking sick and out of breath in the library, why is he being able to enter the library?   All the tv ads and signage to educate people to be socially responsible - probably this has more impact in the long run.   Don’t you feel we need drastic measures? Sometimes I wonder if Mr LKY is still alive today, what measures would he undertake? I am sure he would put Singaporeans’ health at high priority. Why are we taking so long to react , only reading a week of news with daily 30-40 imported cases , only upon then we start to implement restriction on entry ? We should have expected this when we announced free covid19 treatment in the news isn’t it? Why are we being reactive than pro-active ? Shouldn’t we be more decisive in measures to contain the virus before it spread ? Perhaps all these social distancing measures should have implement when it was raised to orange, and not weeks after that, don’t you feel It’s too late.   Do you feel over the past 5-10yrs , Singapore cleanliness has deteriorated, or improved ?   Rem the times when LKY implement fine system for litter bugs.. in today singapore , Spit and throw your mask , nothing happens.

Yet we allow them to stay here for extended periods of time, during their productive / working years earning lucrative salaries, paying low taxes compared to their home countries, enjoying almost the same privileges as Singaporeans (housing, subsidies,etc) and then heading home for a comfy retirement and in all likelihood renting out their property here and living on it.

What if whatever they prayed for doesn't materialise.. will it waver their faith? And.. is it blind faith?  With so many devotees.. so many wishes.. how would the deities decide who to bless (if they do bless)? Would they bless those in poor health? Would they bless the poor? Would they bless the rich? Would they bless kind souls? Would they bless nasty souls? Etc. Why are there still poor people.. unhealthy people around then? Its cause and effect.. deities can't help..   Rather.. praying is just a mark of respect for the Saints' teaching.. and remembrance to follow closely to the teachings.. does the teaching include praying to the Saints? Or people misinterpreted and pray more because they want this life to be smooth sailing for them? Is that what the Saints taught? In actual fact, the Saints want people to work towards liberation.. stop the painful cycle of rebirth..   How to liberate? Follow what the Saints do.. morality and meditation..

Like leaving the tap running while they soap the dishes, leaving the tap running until the pail overflows coz they're too impatient to wait around for that few seconds. Flushing the backyard with copious amounts of water until it's clean instead of just using water and a broom which will go a long way to save water and still clean up the floor. These are just some of the few ways they go about NOT saving water coz hey they're not the ones paying the bill at the end of the day so why should they care?"

101568204,51157100,Bernadette Noujaim Baldwin,"Mar 10, 2020",Also maybe it’s because people with a maid have extremely high expectations around cleaning and when they have to do it themselves drop standards because it is too much work

I thought at times like this we should be social distancing and being more clean? I mean without helper we eat out more and clean less often because we have no that much time after work and if we clean in the night will wake children. The person compiling the report doesn’t really think or know how to interpret data does he/she? If you wanted to do a real comparison you should really drill down with data on how much pail of water is used to clean the house (floor, bathroom, kitchen) and how much water is used to clean per plate etc for accurately determine if it is a domestic helper that used more water then needed. This reporting is simply lazy at best."

That majority fail to see the significance of this study on household usage of water, and when water security is a national and global issue, especially with the threat of climate change already upon us. It is a local survey on water consumption habits. Possibly PUB has controlled for the number of people in household when analyzing the data, and one factor that stood put (amongst others but not mentioned in article) is the presence/absence of maid. Is there a tendency for maids to use lots of water for daily household activities? Perhaps there is? At least one of the more recent comments does suggest so... So perhaps educating and perhaps even passing some savings from the cost of water usage to your maid might be an added incentive to save water and money."

101568204,51157100,Chrissam Ng,"Mar 10, 2020","Generally the consumption of utilities is depending on headcount in a family unit. Much depend on the lifestyles and the usage  of the members of the household unit and the prevalent weather existing.  Sometimes, there're people who've to bathe twice or more because of reasons unkown. Members  who are sporty, more washing is required for their sweaty clothings. Retirees and elderly  folks at home who watch TV with fans on on hot weather  as a source of pastimes consumed much  electricity. (Usually, these are members who have no aircon units at homes). Of course there're people who do not stay at home and always on the move. Their meals rely on outside stalholders.  The consumption of utilities may be curtailed for this household unit. Boiling of water for broth, washing of utensils and cleaning because of hygiene purposes make up the consumption of household utilities. Bills in expenses on utilities in household or expenditures whether for homes or external for social circles  will ever go up because of 'family bonding,' social cohesion and social circles and different activities. This is what a society is make up of. People who stay at home will have the household expeneses more whereas those who are working/not at homes may have the expenditures more. No income without savings will diminish the nest of accumulated wealth of past savings. Just from my observation, it is the transfer of costs and expenses and expenditures whether households, shops or factories or even transports cannot be quantified as utilities are.

I've received floods of msgs from friends and relatives worldwide (US, Canada, Australia and parts of Europe) on the escalation of brazen sinophobic racist attacks, insults and discrimination they suffered since the start of the Coronavirus episode. Anyone denying this is an ignorant fool with his head buried in the sand.  Even Asians like the Japanese, Vietnamese and Koreans are not spared the malice as many of them look like Chinese.  Poignant.  We concluded that at end of the day - you are still a ""chink"" to the racist West regardless of your self-proclaimed allegiance to them and/or total severence of your own Chinese/Asian roots to adopt Anglophone culture, language and narratives.   You may know your Homer and Shakespeare better than Western scholars, speak perfect Queen's English & fluent French, graduate from the most prestigious Western universities, drive top end German cars, be an immaculate gentleman in a bespoke suit from Savile Row and know every good vintage of Napa, Burgundy and Bordeaux - but still be despised and trampled over just because of the color of your skin. As evident by the countless cases of racism against Chinese and Asians worldwide during this Coronavirus period.  Time for Chinese and Asians worldwide to wake up and unite - stand firm and voice out against racism.  #StandAgainstRacism #SayNOToSinophobia  --------------  ""Chinese in UK report ‘shocking’ levels of racism after coronavirus outbreak.  Born and bred in Manchester, home to more than 7,000 Chinese people, the legal adviser said the level of anti-Asian racism the coronavirus had unearthed was “shocking”.  “People seem to have put a whole race behind it and it’s exposing all these underlying prejudices towards Chinese people, or at least anyone who looks Chinese. It’s shocking in this day and age. It was so blatant,” Ngan said.  Ngan’s mother runs a Chinese restaurant in Heywood, in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. There had been “a real downturn” over the lunar new year period, particularly since cases were confirmed in York last week, he said. “It’s been very noticeable, far fewer customers since all this started.”  Despite only four confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the UK, Britain’s 390,000-strong Chinese community have noticed a markedly racist response to the global health crisis.  In Sheffield, a postgraduate student was reportedly verbally and physically harassed in the street for wearing a face mask, while in Leicestershire two students – mistakenly thought to be Chinese – were pelted with eggs on the street in Market Harborough. The Manchester Chinese Centre has received scores of complaints of racist incidents targeting children in schools across the region.  North Yorkshire police confirmed they had received two reports of verbal abuse where individuals of an “Asian appearance” had comments about coronavirus shouted at them in York, and there was a further incident where staff at an Asian tea house had been verbally abused.  Last week the University of York, home to around 2,000 Chinese students, issued a statement calling for respect and tolerance after xenophobic and racist comments were published on the anonymous confessions page Yorfess.  The site was shut down, but the student newspaper York Vision reported that comments ranged from stating that the risk of the virus spreading was minimal because Asian students were “cliquey and unwilling to integrate”, to one user not wanting to share cutlery with their international housemates.  ...  The deeper prejudices exposed by the coronavirus are symptomatic of a long history of demonising Chinese people, according to Jex Wang, a Chinese-Australian DJ and writer, who was sent threatening, racist abuse after writing about the coronavirus on Instagram.  “Stereotypes of Asians as submissive and non-aggressive make them a target that people think they can make fun of and laugh at. I’ve seen posts saying Chinese people are dirty, disgusting, uneducated, we ‘deserved’ the virus because of our ‘weird’ food habits,” she said.  “I kept seeing memes and jokes being shared which really upset me. There was even a coronavirus-themed club night in Sheffield that got shut down – they were offering ‘traditional Chinese hats’ to the first 100 people. What is a traditional Chinese hat??”  After calling out the problematic behaviour and language surrounding the coronavirus on Instagram, her inbox was soon flooded with such “hateful” messages that she had to turn comments off on the post. “People accused me of eating bats, told me to go back to China, that I had betrayed the west, I was even accused of fraternising with the Chinese Communist party.” One message said: “China needs to be cancelled. Period.”  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/09/chinese-in-uk-report-shocking-levels-of-racism-after-coronavirus-outbreak"

101567998,86827100,James Tan,"Mar 2, 2020","Actually before the Wuhan virus, there are several known hawker center and wet market which are “famous” for mynah infestations. The birds are so brazenly brave they would literally stand watch above you to finish the food and come down immediately to pounce on the left-over within seconds.   Some would search for food in nearby rubbish chute, or along the wet floor of the wet market picking up whatever falling to the floor from fish guts to meat intestines left over. And the birds will continue to come back to hawker center tables nearby to continue their feast.  In fact, the food source for Mynah birds is no longer worms or flies in the field but left-overs in our hawker centers and wet markets. Generations of Mynah birds are now born to only hunt for food this way.  Most of you would have encountered this by now and someday, some type of virus would jump onto the Mynah birds and onto human.  Complaint to SFA and NEA but they say cannot do culling because environmental protectionist say its cruelty to animals.

101567837,17392100,Leong Lim,"Feb 26, 2020",There’s great conflict in this report as the couple having no symptoms but had already contracted the disease yet all of us are advised not to wear masks unless feeling unwell. What the story tell?  Another point is the report seemed to say that it’s not spread by the senior pastor then was he having symptoms when he was conducting services and meeting people? Does he know that he need to consult a doctor or wear a mask when feeling unwell? What’s the story behind? The report seemed to bring the attention to the couple (who went to Life Church) attending the CNY gathering and to a worker (who works in Grace Assembly) so as to release the attention on the main culprit for the cluster transmission in Grace Assembly!

This type of person and his party cannot be trusted at all. Bersatu party is self-interest has no interest to work with PH for Malaysia recovery. How on earth UMNO can accept them?

It doesn’t take a lot of reading to find that this was in fact a scheme set up by other ppl in PKR who are power hungry, it was not Mahathir and Mahathir is being made the easy scapegoat.  Even the ruling coalition partners Lim guan eng and anwar have acknowledged this.  Why don’t you emphasise this?  Anyway the coalition partners remain supportive of mahathir."
