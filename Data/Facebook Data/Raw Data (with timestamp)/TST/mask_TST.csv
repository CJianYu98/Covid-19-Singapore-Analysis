101570827,91987100,J SP Filmer,"Jun 1, 2020","I think for those who have nothing nice to say, they should just not say anything. I have come across quite a few freshly minted citizens who were initially all enthusiastic about doing something in gratitude for what they have been given, but soon after seeing the venom and nastiness thrown their way by such comments, they don't see the point in investing the time, and they stop and get on with what's important for them. Some of you need to realise that these people gave something up to become part of this country, and it's because they see potential in this place being a good home and settling place for their family. What attracts people to our country is the level of good governance, stability, reasonable taxes among many other things. Until you have lived elsewhere you will not appreciate how good you actually have it.  So be kind or just shut it. We need Singaporeans who are enthusiastic about building a community, and not breaking it with presumptions leading to racism and xenophobia. So let these people help out where they want, it benefits all of us."

Studies have shown a 90% reduction of severe symptoms just by taking Vit D. Cleaning up your diet by eating whole foods and reducing processed foods works too.  Weigh the benefits and risks by asking the doctor to list them out to you. Don't just believe that the 'benefits outweigh the risks' narrative repeated everywhere. The ONLY benefit I could see so far is the reduction in severe illness.  Another reminder. Other than the 29 deaths here, all the rest of the survivors recovered.

Smoking while walking/holding a cigarette no need mask. The exhalation is a double whammy to people walking nearby. Threats of harmful smoke particles and potential virus droplets. 3. Wearing exercise gears without actual doing physically strain movements, an excuse to unmask. I bet their heart rate is even slower than my regular heart beats.  These ""loopholes"" should be plugged to avoid ambiguous understanding. How? I don't know. But the government can do something if they are determined enough.

Majority Singaporean use public transport to work, school, one place to another. How to keep this practice as there's a timing to report to work, school & appointment. Not everyone own a car or can afford to take taxi or grab regularly. If you don't feel secure, it's better you stay at home permenatly.  $300 to those earning sky high salary may be peanut but will be very useful to those with a family to support.

Majority of citizens pay no income tax vs Finland average tax rates of 54%. In Singapore, PM invite top tier talent with good character and upbringing to serve as Minister with coffee sessions until they agree to give up their dreams. In most other countries, first and second tier talent are chasing their first billion dollars. Only 3rd tier talent or below are serving as Ministers. Our secret formula... The best as Ministers, oppies pick up the losers in life"

The more people who were listed as having (and dying from) the Wu Flu, the more taxpayer money went into the pockets of the doctors and hospitals making the reports.  Meanwhile, governors were sending infectious patients into nursing homes populated by highly vulnerable and susceptible old folks. "

To the authorities, please step up the enforcement and public education. Bring back the campaign days of old, like how well we did with the courtesy campaign. I think it is very relevant today because our demographic is more diverse. We need to develop a Singaporean core value."
101577181,72472100,Zhi-Bin Chiam,Feb 21,"People will not risk their lives for no good reason. The fact that you need enforcement officers to enforce the measures, show that the risk to health is extremely small. The survival rate in the event of a covid infection is 99.95%.

101577181,72472100,John Kt Koh,Feb 21,What's wrong with this picture!!? Allowing positive cases into our city is OK..but taking issues with our own citizens is plain BS!
101577181,72472100,Vincent Lee,Feb 21,"Loose, Grey and controversial rules:- 1. Holding any kind of drink/food in hand entitles one not to wear mask or unmasked. 2. Smoking while walking/holding a cigarette no need mask. The exhalation is a double whammy to people walking nearby. Threats of harmful smoke particles and potential virus droplets. 3. Wearing exercise gears without actual doing physically strain movements, an excuse to unmask. I bet their heart rate is even slower than my regular heart beats.  These ""loopholes"" should be plugged to avoid ambiguous understanding. How? I don't know. But the government can do something if they are determined enough. They have the resources and authority for it."
101577181,72472100,Rizwan Wan,Feb 21,"Just increase the sentence, a minimum 6 month jail term or $50k fine for 1st time offenders who don't wear mask. It's serious with regards to health. Surely will deter people. For work permit or foreigner, just deport them"

101577181,72472100,David Yoong,Feb 21,"Just a point to share base on what I saw. Old aunt inside MRT cabin told the other aunt don't sit beside her as keep a distance away. Majority Singaporean use public transport to work, school, one place to another. How to keep this practice as there's a timing to report to work, school & appointment. Not everyone own a car or can afford to take taxi or grab regularly. If you don't feel secure, it's better you stay at home permenatly.  $300 to those earning sky high salary may be peanut but will be very useful to those with a family to support.  Go out just put on a mask."

101577181,72472100,Steven Wong Chee Mian,Feb 21,I had a friend taking a bite near a friend table and was standing biting food and a ambassador approached her and saying that she is not putting on a mask??!! People here walking ard openly without a mask no ambassador taking action??!! Is it being fair?? Ambassador on duty here should know them but just ignore it!?? 
101577181,72472100,David Lee,Feb 21,Thats just the actual 10% that doesn't wear masks. I see them everywhere.
101577181,72472100,David Deshawn,Feb 21,Please increase the fine since $300 look like not very pain to some rich or stubborn Singaporean or FT 🙏🏻.

Smoking while walking/holding a cigarette no need mask. The exhalation is a double whammy to people walking nearby. Threats of harmful smoke particles and potential virus droplets. 3. Wearing exercise gears without actual doing physically strain movements, an excuse to unmask. I bet their heart rate is even slower than my regular heart beats.  These ""loopholes"" should be plugged to avoid ambiguous understanding. How? I don't know. But the government can do something if they are determined enough. They have the resources and authority for it."

Majority Singaporean use public transport to work, school, one place to another. How to keep this practice as there's a timing to report to work, school & appointment. Not everyone own a car or can afford to take taxi or grab regularly. If you don't feel secure, it's better you stay at home permenatly.  $300 to those earning sky high salary may be peanut but will be very useful to those with a family to support.  Go out just put on a mask."

Smoking while walking/holding a cigarette no need mask. The exhalation is a double whammy to people walking nearby. Threats of harmful smoke particles and potential virus droplets. 3. Wearing exercise gears without actual doing physically strain movements, an excuse to unmask. I bet their heart rate is even slower than my regular heart beats.

Majority Singaporean use public transport to work, school, one place to another. How to keep this practice as there's a timing to report to work, school & appointment. Not everyone own a car or can afford to take taxi or grab regularly. If you don't feel secure, it's better you stay at home permenatly.  $300 to those earning sky high salary may be peanut but will be very useful to those with a family to support.

Wearing exercise gears without actual doing physically strain movements, an excuse to unmask. I bet their heart rate is even slower than my regular heart beats.

Majority Singaporean use public transport to work, school, one place to another. How to keep this practice as there's a timing to report to work, school & appointment. Not everyone own a car or can afford to take taxi or grab regularly. If you don't feel secure, it's better you stay at home permenatly.  $300 to those earning sky high salary may be peanut but will be very useful to those with a family to support.  Go out just put on a mask."

101577221,297100,Keith Wood,Feb 23,"Actually, it was largely political MULTIPLICATION.  The more people who were listed as having (and dying from) the Wu Flu, the more taxpayer money went into the pockets of the doctors and hospitals making the reports.  Meanwhile, governors were sending infectious patients into nursing homes populated by highly vulnerable and susceptible old folks. "

To the authorities, please step up the enforcement and public education. Bring back the campaign days of old, like how well we did with the courtesy campaign. I think it is very relevant today because our demographic is more diverse. We need to develop a Singaporean core value."

Smoking while walking/holding a cigarette no need mask. The exhalation is a double whammy to people walking nearby. Threats of harmful smoke particles and potential virus droplets. 3. Wearing exercise gears without actual doing physically strain movements, an excuse to unmask. I bet their heart rate is even slower than my regular heart beats.  These ""loopholes"" should be plugged to avoid ambiguous understanding. How? I don't know. But the government can do something if they are determined enough. They have the resources and authority for it."

Majority Singaporean use public transport to work, school, one place to another. How to keep this practice as there's a timing to report to work, school & appointment. Not everyone own a car or can afford to take taxi or grab regularly. If you don't feel secure, it's better you stay at home permenatly.  $300 to those earning sky high salary may be peanut but will be very useful to those with a family to support.  Go out just put on a mask."
