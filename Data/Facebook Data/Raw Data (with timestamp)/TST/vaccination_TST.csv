101577552,31917100,Eng Lee,Mar-10,"By right, vaccines are only approved AFTER the trials have been completed.   But for the Covid vaccines, the trials are still ongoing till 2023. That’s why these Covid vaccines approved for Emergency Use ONLY.   So those willing to be vaccinated are actually volunteering to be part of the ongoing study for the drug companies. Everybody responds or reacts differently to the vaccination.  This is the reason why they can’t confirm: how long the these vaccines will ”protect” you especially if the virus mutates or whether you can still transmit the virus if infected.   Hence, masks and social distancing and the usual hygiene steps are still required even after being vaccinated."

101577526,96297100,Zam Soha,Mar-09,It really puzzle me why all the serious side effect and death obviously caused by the vaccines are brushed off as ‘not linked to the vaccines’. It seems getting everyone vaccinated hence opening up the border as soon as possible and get the economy running is more important then human life.
101577526,96297100,Torking Kok,Mar-08,"""found no link"" doesn't mean there's no link. U just can't find it. Anyway Spore don't have AZ vaccines"

101577526,96297100,Tinn Elle,Tuesday at 4:11 PM,The only way to “prove a link” is if they go into shock IMMEDIATELY- that is the only way they will even CONSIDER a link. 
101577526,96297100,Her Yh,Mar-09,"These vaccines astrazeneca, moderna, pfizer, coronavac, sinovac, sputnik they all used mRNA of a virus and some genetically modified.  The character of a virus is to inject its RNA/genetic code to a host cell in the body. RNA is a single strand, that means there is no cross checking. The fighter cells thinks it's harmless because the virus disguise itself in the host cells.  The DNA (humans) is hard to copy because it has double strands, it means there is a cross checker. That's very difficult to replicate. If you inject these vaccines, aren't they making the body as virus factories?  Fatalities may rise since the priorities are the senior citizens and the vulnerable (those who has underlying sickness). If they die (God forbids) it's easy to cover it up or mask the cause of death since they will make old age and their underlying sickness as an excuse.  These vaccines are rushed and even the clinical trials. It may be good on paper but human trials are different.  Now, we must monitor rise of deaths related to the vaccinated people. We do not really know the severity of its side effecs as it may take years to come. There are reports of people dying from nursing homes in different countries after the injection.  There are also doctors and nurses who had a severe side effect and who had died. It's worrisome because the priorities of these vaccines are also the frontliners, if they die (God forbids) what's gonna happen to us? We'll have a shortage of doctors expert in their fields and nurses, security personnels and other frontliners."
101577526,96297100,Eng Lee,Mar-08,"Their answer does not instill any confidence at all. Just because they don’t know doesnt mean there is no link.

101577524,71537100,Wee Kuah,Mar-08,I don't know if a list of screening questions is all that render a person suitable for vaccination when the health authority have almost all of our medical record to determine if invitations should be sent. Another hard question is if opting out will affect an essential sector worker's job.

101577524,71537100,Yong Thian,Mar-08,"Be vaccinated, moh should have a certify statement written to clarify that the so n so person already go thru medical screening n with blood tested that he is fit n have no any allergies to the vaccine.

101577524,71537100,Malaysia Third Force Third Way,Mar 11 at 11:37 AM,"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """

The whole process took less than 2 hr and it was done at neighbouring community center, TAMAN JURONG . Kudos those involved 👍👍👍"
101577518,18602100,OC Yeo,Mar-08,"who administer the shots at vac centres? Trainees, SAF medics, ... ?? Who??? Must say lah!!"
101577518,18602100,Freddy Chin,Mar-08,I personally would  prefer vaccine to be proceed in community center rather then polyclinic.  This will minimise the risk between prevention and suspect infection. On top of this polyclinic have busy task with other sickness on hand.
101577518,18602100,David Da Wei,Mar-08,"For anyone who still requires motivation to go for the vaccine after assessing its risk-rewards,  look no further than to my former pal Meng Tat Cheng.   This profile loves nothing more to champion for propaganda.   I remember fondly how this profile peppered his posts with ""limpeh"" in vaccine related posts months ago to portray an air of confidence and superiority in a bid to garner support.   Man, he even volunteered to be among the first to get vaccinated.  Alas, this Raffles Institution alumni (as he claims to hail from)  recounted different times of his vaccination to different concerned netizens.  How could he even forget the time of his vaccination?  For those who love to be the follower, this profile is the profile to turn to. He could very well be the beacon of light in your life."

101577518,18602100,As Df,Mar-08,"Yea right. My dad booked a 3pm appointment at a vaccination centre, and was met with hours long queues.  What's the point of having appointment time slots when you have to queue for hours after you reach there at the designated time to get a queue number to queue (again) to actually get a jab?  My parents had mobility issues and ended up changing his appointment time (after a 45min queue at the counter for enquiries) but a neighbor who persisted with the whole process ended up getting his jab only at 830.   5 hours after the designated appointment time, much of it spent in close proximity with minimal/no safe distancing among high risk groups.  I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up with ""vaccination centre clusters"" after this."

101577366,93977100,Wee Kuah,Mar-01,"""On Dec. 25, the scientists running the CoronaVac trial in Turkey held a press conference to announce that the vaccine had an efficacy of 91 percent. Although a total of 7,371 volunteers were involved in the trial, the efficacy data was based on only 752 volunteers who got a real vaccine and 570 who received the placebo. Such a small number of volunteers may make the efficacy rate less accurate. The Turkish scientists did not share the results in writing. Two weeks later, researchers in Brazil announced that CoronaVac has an efficacy of 78 percent. None of the vaccinated volunteers in their Phase 3 trial developed severe or moderate cases of Covid-19. However, shortly afterwards one of the scientists clarified that the efficacy estimate was based on the vaccine’s performance in just one subgroup of volunteers. The overall efficacy turned out to be lower."""

China was using its growing wealth, strength and might to influence SG. The Terrex incident was a symptom of the pressure, and not just an import & export issue. Also, PM LHL was not invited to the insugural OBOR Summit. For awhile, there was a face off between a giant and a little shining red dot.  Fortunately, our national leaders did not blink n was prepared to work closer with the US, India and Russia, three of China’s key strategic rivals to establish geopolitical balance n equilibrium.

Johnson & Johnson has also applied for their vaccine to be part of the WHO’s COVAX programme.  End of the day, it isn‘t just the price but also the effectiveness of the vaccine that counts.

101577263,16742100,Cheng Chua Pang,Feb-25,"My understanding of vaccines:  If vaccinated, the body's resistance to the virus increases, then: 1) The chance of getting the virus decreases. 2) Even if you get the virus, most people don't need medical attention to recover. 3) Even if medical care is required, most do not need to be in hospital. 4) Even if you need to stay in a hospital, most will not be life-threatening.  According to information from the online Sinovac vaccine trial results (12,396 people took part in the trial): 1) The chance of getting the virus is reduced by about half 2) Only 16.3 per cent of those who have been infected with the virus require medical treatment (83.7 per cent do not require medical treatment to recover). 3) No one who needs medical attention needs to be in hospital or life-threatening."

101577232,53562100,Iminathi Faith,Feb-24,"Love does not come to those who seek it, but to those who give it... It comes with lots of challenges like lost marriages, lost love, financial and job problems and so many more, But still there has always been a solution to every challenges that we face in life. Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my husband. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached home, I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to our bedroom. I didn't knock the door because i wanted to surprise him because he wasn't expecting me at the time,But when i opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in our house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, He followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away.Out of shame my husband stopped picking my calls and finally blocked me. I used to cry day and night not until i had to explain everything to my best friend where had gone to have a peace of mind. she told me to fight for my man and not lose him to another woman. She gave me contact of Mama Sarah 603764121 and told me Mama Sarah +27603764121 will bring back my husband to me and love only me. So i contacted Mama Sarah +27603764121 and told her everything, she made a love and binding prayers for me and in just 3 days of the prayers my husband came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again. The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby,He cried and smiled with joy and happiness. We are back together and so much in love and waiting for our baby to arrive. Thanks so much Mama Sarah +27603764121 your prayers indeed work. You can call or whats-app Mama Sarah +27603764121 in case you are passing through the same situation. Don't be discouraged by what people may tell you that even don't know the situation you are going through, all that matters are the results so feel free to contact her."

101577144,77812100,Jerome Ong,Feb-19,"Meanwhile in other news, during the development of the Boeing 737 Max back in 2011, engineers were pushed to submit technical drawings and designs at twice the normal pace. When staff members left the team, Boeing leveraged employees from other departments to ensure that the Max project stayed on schedule."
101577144,77812100,Jorial Cheng,Feb-21,"When you apply for covid vaccination there will be a few health questions.  Adverse allergic reaction means choking, swelling and very sick from past vaccine jabs. It excludes rashes. So ppl with hypertension, on aspirin etc., can take covid vaccine jabs."

101577144,77812100,Peter Tan,Feb-19,"Not the most important thing to worry maybe compare to those who are shaking their legs,looking at the clear sunny sky with white clouds of all shapes sizes floating across east to west,north to south dreaming when their dream job door is opening something more to be worry about than the vaccine.Eventually everyone will get their turn,chance no one is left behind of course if you think its not necessary and wish to opt out its voluntarily not compulsory but strange as it may sound why isnt it not compulsory>?The authorities are pretty good at making everything well almost compulsory how come this is not?Voting is compulsory,NS is compulsory,wearing mask is compulsory,littering caught fined,spitting same same,stealing public fruit from trees also wrong,borrow $ from ah longs lagi wrong,only legal shops operating in the heartland,air conditioned legal,illegal betting 4D also break the law,visiting toto outlets anywhere inside supermarkets,toto outlets solely for gamblers perfectly fine the more times you visit the most welcome.But vaccine not compulsory?>"
101577144,77812100,Meng Tat Chang,Feb-19,"Covid vaccine save life. Covid also cause brain damage, like stupidity. If stupid already, I suppose not necessary to be vaccinated anymore. To all limpeh sarcastic followers, I receive my 2nd covid vaccine shot under the healthcare frontline priority group on 16 Feb. At 8 am and no symptoms thus far. From first Jab 21 days ago, the injection location sore feeling only comes in after many hours later. Edit. No side effects at all from the 2nd Jab. For 36 hrs already. Not even soreness of injection location. However, feel sleepy, lethargic on second day. 3rd day like a dragon already."
101577144,77812100,David Da Wei,Feb-19,"I am starting to worry for my pal Meng Tat Chang after he claimed to have taken his first shot without allowing for any verification of any sort of this action after rallying fb users to take the vaccine by using words such as ""limpeh"" to portray an air of confidence and 霸气。  So, why am i worried?  He is starting to exhibit memory loss and cant seem to remember exactly the time he took the vaccine as reported by concerned observers.  I hope this is an isolated incident and this seemingly memory loss is not the side effects of anything.  Take nothing away from Tat Cheng even as he did not  allow any verification of him being among the first who volunteer to take the vaccine and faces debate  to whether he is a real profile or not?   He could very well be among the unsung heroes (maybe not that unsung since he has rallied people).   We are with you, Tat Cheng."
101577144,77812100,Yu Soon Tang,Feb-19,"I've completed mine under aviation group. 1st Jab on 26 Jan noon, only started to sore on the injection arm during night time till the next day and got better by that evening. Though of course if someone accidentaly hit or pressed that area then will feel shock sensation even on third day but after that alright. And 2nd jab on 16 Feb at around 3.30pm.  No sore arm but felt sleepy the same day but next day felt fatigue, headache and chilling. Really hope to stay in bed whole day but was working that day. Thank God managed to tahan until went home and sleep. Did not take panadol but still got better on the third day."

101577144,77812100,VideographerSg,Feb-20,"Guys please take note;  This happened to a friend yesterday and it is an important information for our age group.  A friend had his 2nd dose of the vaccine at the vaccination center, after which he began to have blurred vision on the way home.  When he got home, he called the vaccination center for advice and asked if he should visit a doctor, or be hospitalised.  However, he was asked to go back to the vaccination center immediately as he had left his glasses behind."
101577144,77812100,Paul Wigman,Feb-19,"I booked mine on the 1st March and looking forward to it. For those afraid or have concerns, remember you have a choice just like anyone, so nobody will blame you if you chose not to but many people like me will thank you for making the queue shorter. I know there may be a risk of allergic reaction but i rather take my chance because millions of people have taken with very few cases of allergy, on the other hand, millions have died after contracted covid19. Do your math. Finally you can choose to stay indoors for the rest of your life so to lessen the chance of getting covid19."
101577144,77812100,Bobby Kumaran,Feb-19,I am over the fence whether to take it not. Not because of the side effects but rather due to the virus mutating to form various strains just like HIV. Hence might need to take shots again
101577144,77812100,Martin Tan Abdullah,Feb-19,Thanks to PAP government and the team involved in getting the vaccine 👏👏👏
101577144,77812100,Elaine Underwood,Feb-19,The headline should read 'if all goes well 1 million more adults WILL have been vaccinated.'
101577144,77812100,Wong Yking,Feb-19,Good.. those ages must prepare for one week MC..if working..better let you boss know first
101577144,77812100,Jerome Ong,Feb-19,"As the Covid-19 vaccine is purely voluntary, there should be laws to safeguard and uphold this freedom. In addition to the usual questions on allergies and pre-existing conditions asked before one gets the shot, this additional question should be introduced:  “Are you receiving the Covid-19 vaccine as a result of your own free will without being coerced through any form or manner by either individual or organization?  Any form of coercion must be thoroughly investigated and the relevant party taken to task. This will also act to safeguard organizations potentially if something unfortunate happens and an employee decides to falsely accuse the employer of forcing the vaccine upon staff.  Singapore is well known for its multitude of laws covering almost all aspects of daily life. I am pretty sure that a similar legislation to better safeguard the process could be passed in a reasonably quick timeframe."
101577144,77812100,Charlie Tang,Feb-20,"Everyone will be advised to ""voluntary"" take it."

Who's going to be responsible? Oh stupid me I forgot. If they die that it's because they die from their existing sickness got nothing with the vaccines.

101577144,77812100,Eu Choon Leng,Feb-19,Our civil and public services are among the best in the world. We are a rich country so it was a disappointment to learn only 4.5 % of our population had been vaccinated - compared to 80% in Israel with a ten million population. In fact both the US and the UK with much higher population have a much higher rate of vaccination. Hope we can ramp up our vaccination effort. Maybe can use the SAF national servicemen for help.

101576853,40337100,Edmund Lam,Feb-06,Many more types of vaccines are sure to flood the market. The companies were at first worried the virus will just go away when vaccines are ready and will lose lots of monies. Now that there are tremendous profits to be made you can see the tide turning. So many more in P2 moving to P3. 
101576853,40337100,Anton Lep,Feb-06,"All Vaccine companies must share openly vaccine formulas and License to the world than each country can produce vaccine for their population. This is not normal time, no time for profit. There is no way that these few companies can produce vaccines and distribute all around the world, not logical.  Each country must produce and manufacture their own vaccine. This is the only way and this will safe the world. "
101576853,40337100,Jacob Peterson Lau,Feb-06,"So you’ll be fine if you just get the vaccination. 2 or 10 years, it won’t really matter."
101576853,40337100,Steven Fu,Feb-06,"The current rate is very low. Cannot use the current rate as denominator to calculate la. When more vaccinations result is out, people will be confident to take it, production of vaccine can speed up. "
101576853,40337100,Sivadas Krishnan,Feb-07,"30, 40 years ago when there was so much less overseas travelling for recreation and vacation, people generally would not have been so depressed and worried. Now in the last 2 decades, the world has become a 'much smaller place' because of the ease  and economy in travelling.  Prior covid, overseas holidays regionally and even cross continent were not  unvommon for many with convenient immigration procedures. Now with covid, there is a sudden and radical change in this norm.  Its going to be ""cold turkey"" fot many!"

101576853,40337100,Guan Hock Teo,Feb-06,Myopic answer.  The key question is when can herd immunity be achieved.  I believe that COVID viruses and its mutations have probably been in existence since life on earth began.  
101576853,40337100,Gary Marshall,Feb-06,Making any predictions based on current rates is pure sensationalism. No one expects current rates to remain as they are.

101576822,57322100,Planterson Pat,Feb-05,"7 years??? 😂😂😂 I don‘t understand the logic behind this? What is the ultimate goal we are trying to achieve with the vaccine? I thought the ultimate goal is to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed, which it never was to begin with.  Well, if enough people of the vulnerable(!) population groups in Singapore are vaccinated, I would consider that goal as achieved. Latest by the end of this year life in Singapore should be pretty much back to normal, even if the “pandemic” is still “raging” in other countries.  If the goal is to completely eradicate the virus, well, that will not be achievable with a vaccine.  No seasonal respiratory virus has ever been eradicated with a vaccine!  So what exactly was the goal again?  Please remember, all currently available vaccines are said to only prevent a severe outcome, but won’t stop you from getting infected and passing on the virus to others. "
101576822,57322100,Hussain Bin Shamsuddin,Feb-05,Countries where structural corruption is prevalent will sit back in order to pressure the richer countries and charitable organisations to sponsor their vaccination program.

They see the vaccination program as possibly the last opportunity to corrupt big money.

101576721,13037100,Theint Honey Htut,Feb-01,"What is going on with Myanmar?   1947, General Aung San was assassinated. 1948, Myanmar gained its Independent from the British Empire. 1958, Ne Win captured power through a coup d'etat.  1962, Another coup led to the end of democratic form and Myanmar became a military dictatorship under the Burma Socialist Programme Party. 1988, Unitary Parliamentary republic under military dictatorship & 88 generation students group 2010, Start of Democracy movements in Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest. 2020, Elections in Myanmar   1st of February 2021 Plan:  Democratically elected politicians and non-democratically elected military spokespersons meet in Naypyidaw to form a new government that will lead the country for the upcoming 5 years.   What actually happened:  1. Democratically elected politicians who were supposed to meet up, got kidnapped, by the military.  2. Citizens and public figures such as singers and writer got kidnapped for using their right of free speech to speak in favour of democracy.  3. Phone signals got cut off around 3 am in Naypyidaw.  4. The rest of the country followed.  5. Tv, radio and some internet providers got cut off. 6. Road to the airport got blocked.  7. ATMs and all banks are closed.  8. MWD announced that Myint Swe is the new President 9. The coup is official, and the country is in an emergency rule and the military will have full control over the country for at least one year.   We are worried about where they took our heroes such as our president and our grandma Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all the other politicians and public figures. At the same time, we fully support what they stand for and we are praying for them and also taking notes on how to become a great leader without fear.   We would like to encourage especially students to step up and scream for those who cant speak for such a time as this.    We do not know when they will cut off the internet in all part of the country and close the borders, but we still believe that together we can work towards a more sustainable future for Myanmar and see Myanmar become democratic.   Lets all help in any way we can.  Crd  #aungsansuukyi"

It is hard to be a Christian because you have to do what the Lord Jesus Christ commands instead of doing whatever you like.  The Lord Jesus Christ commanded His disciples to love one another.  Christians forgive people because of their love for them.  God does not forgive you when you do not forgive people.  A person who follows the Lord Jesus Christ has to do what pleases God instead of what pleases himself or any other person such the parents, the spouse, the children and all other people.  We must love one another and forgive each other because all of us are far from being perfect.  Let us remember to love one another so that everyone can live peacefully together."

He said that he never wanted to stay with me again and that she no longer loved me. So he unpacked he bags and caused severe pain to me and my children. I tried every possible way to get him back after much begging, but to no avail and he confirmed that he had made a decision and never wanted to see me again. When I got home from work on Tuesday, I met an old friend who asked about my husband. I explained everything to him, so he told me that the only way to get my husband back was to visit a magic diffuser that helped him get through difficult times. I've never believed in spells, but I have no choice but to take your advice. the pitcher assured me that I will get my husband back the next day. What an amazing statement! I never believed, so he spoke to me and told me everything I had to do, and the next morning, surprisingly, my husband, who had not called me for the last 7 months, called to let me know he would be back. So awesome !! So he came back the same day, with much love and joy, apologizing for his mistake and for the pain he had caused me and our children. As of today our relationship is stronger than before, thanks to the help of a pitcher. So there I will advise you if you have any problem, I recommend that you contact MAMA GHANDI, I guarantee 100% that she will help you solve your problems contact her on his WhatsApp number +27679011466"

101576534,30697100,JZ Cai,Jan-26,"Singapore being a small island to shut her border completely is very easy. However it must be noted that SG is not self sufficient especially in food supply. Also Singapore is very reliant on foreign workers for constructions, hospitals, domestic helpers, restaurants, hotels and so on. SG don’t have natural resources to depend on. We need to have a open economy n therefore we cannot completely closed our border."
101576534,30697100,Julie Bayfield,Jan-26,As much as I can't wait to move to NZ (Aussie citizen in UK)- well done to Jacinda on protecting her people by taking the WHO elimination advice - early and decisively. She has saved many many lives and kept NZ as a functioning country where the people can live relatively normal lives. The UK did the opposite - too little too late and we are now paying the price with the highest death rate in the world and a collapsing economy. What an amazing leader you have 
101576534,30697100,Frank Ye,Jan-27,"that should be the way. apart from our foreign workers and supplies, our borders should still remains closed to tourism. Our country are pretty much safe but other countries are still badly affected, shouldn't open for any tourism in and out."
101576534,30697100,浜中正志,Jan-26,Fully open the local economy with strict boarder management is the key to survive for all the countries. Opposite strategy would kill not only their citizen but also the economy in longer term. 
101576534,30697100,Ram AirTurbine,Jan-28,Closed borders and lockdowns not long term solution. What more could have been done? Been almost a year. 😔

101576508,42322100,One Opinion,Jan-26,"Didn’t we just recently honour this Malay male nurse who is working in Infectious disease team. His mother passed away and due to the nature of his work he could not visit her and didn’t get to say the last goodbye?   First, we applaud and honour the heroic self-sacrifice of our frontliners.   Next, we have those dependent, short term visit pass holders jetting around, as well as students returning for a one month school holiday from high risk countries putting the whole nation at risk.   Ironical in my personal opinion. Is fairness one area we need to work on for the next 4-5 years? Pilot test with this. Are we fair to our medical frontliners for their self-sacrifice?"

Thus, this just shows that even after tested negative for Covid-19 initially can still be tested positively later. Now we know how the local community contracted the virus. All thanks to the government to open the border too soon to infest the community with the virus. People like that girl and her family acted so irresponsibly and we have ignorant people supported such act that had caused inconvenience to the people in the country. This is just sick."

101575888,96782100,Boh Guat Sim,"Dec 31, 2020",Expected this to happen to SIA. Are all the staff include the cabin crew and pilot being tested every time they travelled back to Singapore?
101575888,96782100,Alvin Tan,"Dec 30, 2020",Undoing the good work done by the population. Never learn the mistakes in HK several months back where they allowed ferry crew to move around and spread.   Creating a false sense of security to allow the crew to move around.  What makes the crew totally safe on the aircraft? Toilets or meals etc.....
101575888,96782100,Kelly Tan,"Dec 30, 2020","Someone blasted at me when I mentioned crew should also go through sahn to keep us safe. And that someone said that we should believe the air  crew will adhere to the stringent measures when they are overseas. Fact is: The hotel staff/people around them there may also be infected so even if they really stay in the rooms, they may also be infected. Better safe than to be sorry and hope they really think for the rest of us in Singapore when they open the skies."
101575888,96782100,Tiffany Yong,"Dec 30, 2020",Air crew should receive vaccines they fly with the imported infected cases daily.
101575888,96782100,Lyn WY,"Dec 30, 2020","Those who worry about daily numbers should just get vaccinated and move on with life. Now that a vaccine is readily available, everyone aged 21 yrs & above should get vaccinated, mandated by law so that we can just move on as a nation. Quit the reporting of these daily stats. Is there any point to this click bait?"
101575888,96782100,Sui Walter,"Dec 31, 2020",Kinda silly that gahmen is strict  with those breaking SD n drinking after 1030pm in eateries when it’s been zero cases in community but so lax in allowing the bigger danger of letting  air crew coming in without quarantine just bcoz it’s too troublesome n tedious for the airline n staff. Obviously whatever the reasons for doing so isn’t working.
101575888,96782100,Jenson Lim,"Dec 30, 2020",Why SQ never learn what happen in EVA Air 🤨

101575888,96782100,Sheliya Wong,"Dec 30, 2020","In my opinion, the strict itinerary that air crew goes through when overseas is a false sense of security. Making sure air crew take designated ground transfer and stay in their hotel away from city centre - what does it help if on the plane already you are in close contact with Covid positive passengers? Even the cups and eating utensils, the toilet cubicles are contaminated   Don’t get me wrong. Strict itinerary overseas is critical. So is quarantine when crew flies back home."
101575888,96782100,Yvette Cruise,"Dec 30, 2020","To all patients, stay positive, keep fighting! To all medical people, thank you.  From manila phils., sending you ❤!   We are all in trying times. Let us win this fight together as citizen of the world."

In my humble personal opinion and most urgent plea - Air crew should not be running around after flights. #21DaysQuarantine. If Singapore go into another lockdown. Imagine what the economy will be like. Air Crew are not the only ones who need work. We all also need to work and earn a living, kids need to go to school. Possible to put air crew second in priority after NCID for vaccination? Safer for their families as well. Please advise them not to go gym or exercise, jogging without masks please. Think about it. If this continues Singapore Airlines reputation also gone. See Philippines also close door to Singapore now. It goes to show the perception this has created"

To avoid me playing the bad person, I ask her to go ask the hospital. Just want to point out... please be considerate lah... elderly patient in life threatening condition already went through 2 swabs and visitor is spouse of high risk personnel still insists on visiting. Just raising an awareness and hope people will be more considerate in everyday life matters. I was put in a difficult position how to say No? Please do not put our medical frontliners as well as patients and caregivers at risk.#BeConsiderate"

101575569,19052100,Wen Tian,"Dec 14, 2020","1. It will be better if restriction is lifted in phase 2, and delay phase 3 till Jun 2021, when almost 60% population are vaccinated and trace together hit 90%. This is because,  most people will take phase 3 as pre covid-19 situation and we can celebrate. There is no phase 4 and thus, it is easily mistaken,  it is all under controlled and be complacent.  This is a bad mistake.  2. This is the mental misconception which gives covid-19 more chance to grow silently even before vaccines are already injected. The war with covid-19 is not over with Asian countries having multiple waves.    3. The moment we let our guard down and focus to open up too soon, we will suffer longer. Now we must acknowledge that covid-19 is more severe and hard to break compared to SARS,  MERS,  EBOLA,  H1N1 or other coronovirus.   4. Covid-19 is the king cobra,  deadly and easy to transmit when crowds gather and vapour float around.  Washing hands and personal hygiene is not a past and must remain a habit forever."
