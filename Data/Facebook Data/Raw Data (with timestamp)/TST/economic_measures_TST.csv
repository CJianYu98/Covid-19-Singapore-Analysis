Will these 11 themes be effective and sustainable to address the crisis which we have gone through the past year? And why are you not interlocking these 11 themes so that one shapes or drive the other? Eg focus on med labs/test kits; green solutioning, have these been thought through on the education system? On green solutioning; why can't we develop and produce our own EV and tie to development of our young from a R&D perspective? Similarly on the medical front; there are so many other critical areas that are lacking during the pandemic. Have we looked at those? Strengthen global hub??? Have you not learned enough that this strategy is not sustainable? Why are you not creatively looking at how we can be self reliant?  A true Singaporean who cares"

101577524,89702100,Tan Kok Tim,Mar-08,"What should NTUC do for their members? Is insurance the answer? What else is missing? What did I write on this in 2011? ====== Forum: A good insurance plan can help the jobless, while avoiding pitfalls PUBLISHED6 HOURS AGO on 8th Marh 2021 in ST Forum FACEBOOKTWITTER The idea of implementing an unemployment insurance scheme in Singapore has been mooted several times over the years, and it was again discussed at a recent Parliament session. The pushback on its introduction has always been that such a scheme may lead to the unemployed not wanting to seek employment. However, implementing this scheme and encouraging the unemployed to actively seek employment need not be mutually exclusive if the insurance scheme is carefully thought out and calibrated to avoid unintended pitfalls. A potential unemployment insurance scheme could base its premium on policyholders' declared monthly income. In the event of verified unemployment, the monthly payout could be pegged at a certain percentage of the insured's last drawn monthly salary, subject to a maximum of 24 months' payout. The payout could be calibrated in such a way that it would not see the insured falling into immediate financial hardship, but yet not be lucrative enough to discourage the insured from actively seeking employment, since the payout would be only a fraction of his last drawn monthly salary, and will last for only a period of time. As the economy transforms and the employment landscape goes through structural changes, I believe more people will go through periods of unemployment during their career. Such a scheme will go a long way in helping individuals and families to weather periods of uncertainty in their lives. Luo Siao Ping"

Since then, the Malay fertility had rose from 1.62 to 1.8 while the Chinese fertility rate had dropped from 1.08 to 0.98 in 2019 (from 2012).   I had read the many comments from my article and 2 points stood out why Malay has a higher fertility rate and they are because of their  1) family support 2) faith where they believe the child is a gift from God  If our Government can improvise ways to mimic similar reasons for Chinese to have children, we could increase the fertility for SG. There are many other reasons why couples dont have to have children."

They need to do the calculation and decide they could afford and be willing to take care of children properly. With so many cases of divorce and child abuse, the victims will always be the children who will grow up to become dysfunctional adults. Thus, no amount of money can get couples to have children when they are not ready to comment themselves to a great responsibility."

You can get a freehold condo in New York for $200-300 psf.   Land sales is a  contribution to our state revenue, AKA taxes.  2) Singaporean men have to serve NS- it takes away 2/40 income producing years. I consider this as a tax, the low stipend given represents a cost saving on the state (the opposite of taxes)   So if you take all of this into account, our taxes are very high indeed.

Commercial vehicle EVs up to a certain payload should be widely available and service approved in Europe and USA by then too.  So the benefit is lower noise and zero actual emissions of the vehicles.  Makes only net CO2 balance sense if electric power comes from renewables, will Singapore import renewable power by then from Malaysia /Indonesia or some offshore wind / solar farms?  Currently 95% of Singapore power generation according to latest data is nat gas, so carbon based. Makes no sense really to feed EVs with such power, only real benefit is better air quality in Sing.

The experts here can only GUESS the 'possibilities' of what is happening.  There are many ways of improving your own immune system to act as immunity against any viral infection. Studies have shown a 90% reduction of severe symptoms just by taking Vit D. Cleaning up your diet by eating whole foods and reducing processed foods works too.  Weigh the benefits and risks by asking the doctor to list them out to you. Don't just believe that the 'benefits outweigh the risks' narrative repeated everywhere. The ONLY benefit I could see so far is the reduction in severe illness.  Another reminder. Other than the 29 deaths here, all the rest of the survivors recovered. We are certainly not in any emergency. This experimental drug is not approved by FDA. Go check it out yourself. It's only approved for Emergency Use. Understand the difference!"
