Aren’t you a newspaper, aren’t you supposed to be unbiased and double, triple checked your facts and contents before publishing? What’s the point of sowing contempts and spreading misinformation when you don’t even understand the root of the problem. Can you even call yourself a newspaper? What happened to the journalism integrity?Everyone is protesting peacefully, following the rules and regulations of the countries they are in. No one is even protesting in your country, so don’t get involved. No one dares to protest in your country which lacks freedom of speech and freedom to voices one’s own opinions. And again, do proper research that’s befitting of a ‘national’ newspaper. If not, take a seat and stay out of this."

Those people have to take leave from work or if they are paid hourly they won’t be able to earn anythjng which might have a huge impact on them. But we have to because we cannot do it in our country. If we do, there will be another blood shed. Maybe u can look up 8888 uprising n understand why we r trying to do this as peacefully as possible. Maybe u might think we r disturbing your peacefulness in ur country which I understand. But last thing we want is having to go through what our parents/grandparents went through for the last 60+ years again. We r fighting for our future for our children/grandchildren. We do not want to be in the dark again and shut us out from the world. Unlike u all many of us have to live in fear not knowing what they r going to do us.

ST is getting very unprofessional these days.  Myanmar people are told to stay home, keep calm and not to involve in riots. There have been such messages sharing among Myanmar people. Riots and violence is what military is trying to seek and incite. This is how the military will take it as an excuse to seize control of power as if it is trying to save the country from collapsing. This has been done 2 times in history and now is already 3rd time. People already know enough to not fall into this trap again.

101576747,91237100,Aye Chan Oo,Feb-02,"‼️To The Straits Time‼️ You need to look at your facts straight before posting something controversy at this critical moment of Myanmar.  Yesterday, the peaceful protests of Myanmar citizens happened in front of Myanmar Embassy in Thailand. Many Thai citizens and Thai pro-democracy activists also joined this movement as they recognize the pain of oppressive military junta( if you follow the news, there were huge uprisings all over the Thailand in past few months against Junta Dictatorship). And yesterday, Thai police came to the scene and tried to break the crowd by force. That's when Thai citizens in the crowd and Thai police had a clash. NOT WITH MYANMAR PROTESTERS. We are not stupid, why would we fight with Thai police while we are residing in their country? During these few weeks, Thai people are also not pleased with government way of handling Covid 19 and delay of vaccination. So, Thai protesters took the opportunity to voice out their grievances against government. Meanwhile, Thai protesters helped Myanmar protesters to leave the scene by blocking and confronting the police force. The lady in the 1st pic is also Thai citizen who was complaining about the Government's Covid19 response.  All of my information come from localThai news sites who keep updated at the scene yesterday from Bangkok.  We Myanmar citizens are now having a very hard time and please do not make it worse by false news and accusations."

101576747,91237100,Htet Htet Wai,Feb-02,"I have never  my voice against this matter since some are making their own accusations & assumptions. Firstly, we did not support any harms which happened to Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State. Media platforms (most of them affiliated with Military forces) did not state anything about it until the world found out.   Briefly, Madam Aung San Suu Kyi took all the blame after that & defended against the world to protect the civilians as well as the country. Indeed, she couldnt stop the genocide without any control power over the military. The world did have a bad image about Myanmar & the military forces make it worse again. It was the dirty trick which created by them to take control over this country while other countries are looking down on us regarding Rohingya matter. Moreover, our country has not only Rohingya Muslims (war refugees) in Rakhine State which caused by armed & dangerous people, accordingly; our ethnic groups from Multiple states are getting the same treatment. Heres also a brief explanation about Rohingya Muslims, lets go back to the beginning of the story. At first, the military officials illegally allowed them (without civilians knowledge) in order to gain human labors & make religious-related-riots here or there. Decades later, Rohingya Muslims requested for their own land with their own government so on & so on which messed things up. Even after all those thing happened, like I said, most of us still dont know about it until the world did. Thus, i think it is crystal clear that they are illegal migrants from wherever it is. Although they lived in Myanmar for generations, they cannot even speak Burmese at all which is unrealistic. Which is also why, some of us cant accept them as our citizens. In the end, the world thinks we all (civilians) are supported those people in killing people.  Helllllll noooo. It is so unfair to even think like that. Its Dictatorship, people. Millions are starving & getting killed with limited healthcare within the country. Limited access of internet in the rural areas. We still has difficulties with transportation system, hygiene food, clear water & etc., as well. We all are on the same boat. Thus, do not ever say on this matter through googling shits online.   (Ps- My bad if its too long.)"

The current President of our country is U Win Myint. Declaring a state of emergency and handing over power without the order of President Win Myint is completely illegal. I do not accept the re-appointment of the government at all. I totally disagree. As results of the 2020 general election, we will hold the third session of parliament and accept the appointment of a new government.  ဒီကေန႔ ကာကြယ္ေရးဦးစီးခ်ဳပ္ မင္းေအာင္လွိုင္ကေန အသစ္ဖြဲ႕စည္းခန႔္အပ္လိုက္တယ္ဆိုတဲ့ အစိုးရအဖြဲ႕ဝင္ဝန္ႀကီးေတြကို လုံးဝလက္မခံပါဘူး။ငါတို့တင္ေျမာက္ထားတဲ့ နိုင္ငံေတာ္သမၼတဦးဝင္းျမင့္ကို ရာထူးမွႏွုတ္ထြက္ေစခ်င္တယ္ဆိုရင္ ျပည္ေထာင္စုလႊတ္ေတာ္ထဲကေနပဲ အေျခခံဥပေဒလုပ္ထုံးလုပ္နည္းမ်ားအတိုင္းသြားရမွာျဖစ္ပါတယ္။ဖြဲ႕စည္းပုံအေျခခံဥပေဒလုပ္ထုံးလုပ္နည္းအတိုင္းဆိုရင္ တတိယအႀကိမ္လႊတ္ေတာ္ေခၚၿပီးေတာ့ အစိုးရအဖြဲ႕သစ္ဖြဲ႕စည္းၿပီးမွပဲ လက္ရွိနိုင္ငံေတာ္သမၼတႀကီးဦးဝင္းျမင့္ရဲ့ရာထူးသက္တမ္းဟာ ကုန္လြန္မွာျဖစ္ပါတယ္။ ငါတို့ျမန္မာနိုင္ငံရဲ့လက္ရွိနိုင္ငံေတာ္သမၼတႀကီးဟာ ဦးဝင္းျမင့္ပဲျဖစ္ပါတယ္။ သမၼတႀကီးဦးဝင္းျမင့္ရဲ့အမိန႔္နဲ႔မဟုတ္ဘဲနဲ႔ အေရးေပၚအေျခအေနေၾကျငာျခင္း၊အာဏာလႊဲေျပာင္းေပးျခင္းမ်ားဟာ လုံးဝတရားမဝင္ပါဘူး။ ထပ္မံခန႔္အပ္တဲ့အစိုးရအဖြဲ႕ဆိုတာကို လုံးဝလက္မခံပါ။လုံးဝသေဘာမတူပါ။ ၂၀၂၀အေထြေထြေရြးေကာက္ပြဲကရရွိတဲ့ မဲရလဒ္မ်ားအတိုင္း တတိယအႀကိမ္လႊတ္ေတာ္မ်ားက်င္းပျပဳလုပ္ေပးၿပီး အစိုးရအဖြဲ႕သစ္ဖြဲ႕စည္းခန႔္အပ္တာကိုပဲ လက္ခံပါမယ္။ကာကြယ္ေရးဦးစီးခ်ဳပ္မင္းေအာင္လွိုင္ရဲ့အမိန႔္နဲ႔ ခန႔္အပ္တဲ့အစိုးရအဖြဲ႕ဝင္ေတြကို ဆႏၵမဲေပးပိုင္ခြင့္ရွိတဲ့ နိုင္ငံသားျပည္သူတစ္ဦးအေနနဲ႔ လုံးဝ လုံးဝလက္မခံ သေဘာမတူပါဘူးလို့ ေျပာခ်င္ပါတယ္။  #Save #Myanmar 🇲🇲  #Save #Burma 🇲🇲  #Reject #the #Military !!! #We #need #democracy!!! #Help #us #and #support #our #Leader,  #Aung #San #Suu #Kyi #government!!!၀"
