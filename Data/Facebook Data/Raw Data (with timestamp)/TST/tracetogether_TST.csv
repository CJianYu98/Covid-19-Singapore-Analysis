Photo 1, 2 and 4 are not Myanmar people protesting against Thai riot police. These are the photos of the Thai people protest that happened a few months ago. The Myanmar protesters in Thailand didn't make any violence at all and so do the people in Myanmar. I recommend the Strait Times editors and the personnel to review the authenticity and better research futher more details about this. I can see there are already lots of comments pointing this out and you are still not reviewing it. Shame on you to spread this false rumor. How could this media platform be reliable when you are posting such misleading information? "

101576747,91237100,William Kyaw Zaw,Feb-02,"We are not protesting violently. I do not even think those pictures are even true. You cannot believe everything you see online. We just want to raise awareness on what is happening so that they will have international pressure on them.  We do not want to do this kind of protest of course. Those people have to take leave from work or if they are paid hourly they won‚Äôt be able to earn anythjng which might have a huge impact on them. But we have to because we cannot do it in our country. If we do, there will be another blood shed. Maybe u can look up 8888 uprising n understand why we r trying to do this as peacefully as possible. Maybe u might think we r disturbing your peacefulness in ur country which I understand. But last thing we want is having to go through what our parents/grandparents went through for the last 60+ years again. We r fighting for our future for our children/grandchildren. We do not want to be in the dark again and shut us out from the world. Unlike u all many of us have to live in fear not knowing what they r going to do us. U do not understand what they are capable of. Only the international pressure can help us. We have shed enough blood. "

ST is getting very unprofessional these days.  Myanmar people are told to stay home, keep calm and not to involve in riots. There have been such messages sharing among Myanmar people. Riots and violence is what military is trying to seek and incite. This is how the military will take it as an excuse to seize control of power as if it is trying to save the country from collapsing. This has been done 2 times in history and now is already 3rd time. People already know enough to not fall into this trap again.

101576747,91237100,Aye Chan Oo,Feb-02,"‚ÄºÔ∏èTo The Straits Time‚ÄºÔ∏è You need to look at your facts straight before posting something controversy at this critical moment of Myanmar.  Yesterday, the peaceful protests of Myanmar citizens happened in front of Myanmar Embassy in Thailand. Many Thai citizens and Thai pro-democracy activists also joined this movement as they recognize the pain of oppressive military junta( if you follow the news, there were huge uprisings all over the Thailand in past few months against Junta Dictatorship). And yesterday, Thai police came to the scene and tried to break the crowd by force. That's when Thai citizens in the crowd and Thai police had a clash. NOT WITH MYANMAR PROTESTERS. We are not stupid, why would we fight with Thai police while we are residing in their country? During these few weeks, Thai people are also not pleased with government way of handling Covid 19 and delay of vaccination. So, Thai protesters took the opportunity to voice out their grievances against government. Meanwhile, Thai protesters helped Myanmar protesters to leave the scene by blocking and confronting the police force. The lady in the 1st pic is also Thai citizen who was complaining about the Government's Covid19 response.  All of my information come from localThai news sites who keep updated at the scene yesterday from Bangkok.  We Myanmar citizens are now having a very hard time and please do not make it worse by false news and accusations."

The ruling party is not. The military started the whole ethnic cleansing mess and Aung San Suu Kyi was forced to deal with it. She didn't have any real power either. Before y'all priviledged people sitting in your cozy house start making judgements like ""oh but she could have voiced out..."" SHE COULDN'T. You guys just don't understand how evil 3rd world military dictators can be. If she spoke anything off the script, the coup would have come sooner. And it's obvious the smear campaign was successful because the west eats up whatever the media feed without thinking critically or doing any researching, stripping off the Nobel Prize and titles, making her the figurehead of the genocide.  ""Oh she was racist against muslims.."" Nope. Her right hand man was a burmese muslim who got assassinated by the military because he was in the process of drafting a new constitution that renders the military with less power. He was also a very respected man in the country. (Search U Ko Ni)  This coup is extremely bad. Before you know it, not only are the Rohingyas going to actually be ethnically cleansed, there will be Karens, Arakens, Shans and other ethnic minorities who will be genocided by the military . ASSK and the NLD was the best hope is uniting the country (and between the ethnic minorities). She was in the process of gaining more power so that she can work towards it.

The ruling party is not. The military started the whole ethnic cleansing mess and Aung San Suu Kyi was forced to deal with it. She didn't have any real power either. Before y'all priviledged people sitting in your cozy house start making judgements like ""oh but she could have voiced out..."" SHE COULDN'T. You guys just don't understand how evil 3rd world military dictators can be. If she spoke anything off the script, the coup would have come sooner. And it's obvious the smear campaign was successful because the west eats up whatever the media feed without thinking critically or doing any researching, stripping off the Nobel Prize and titles, making her the figurehead of the genocide.  ""Oh she was racist against muslims.."" Nope. Her right hand man was a burmese muslim who got assassinated by the military because he was in the process of drafting a new constitution that renders the military with less power. He was also a very respected man in the country. (Search U Ko Ni)  This coup is extremely bad. Before you know it, not only are the Rohingyas going to actually be ethnically cleansed, there will be Karens, Arakens, Shans and other ethnic minorities who will be genocided by the military . ASSK and the NLD was the best hope is uniting the country (and between the ethnic minorities). She was in the process of gaining more power so that she can work towards it. The military didn't like it.  So you guys saying uninformed statements like ""she is evil"" or ""karma"" is really ignorant and unhelpful in anyway. Please read and research more.

101576747,91237100,Htet Htet Wai,Feb-02,"I have never  my voice against this matter since some are making their own accusations & assumptions. Firstly, we did not support any harms which happened to Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State. Media platforms (most of them affiliated with Military forces) did not state anything about it until the world found out.   Briefly, Madam Aung San Suu Kyi took all the blame after that & defended against the world to protect the civilians as well as the country. Indeed, she couldnt stop the genocide without any control power over the military. The world did have a bad image about Myanmar & the military forces make it worse again. It was the dirty trick which created by them to take control over this country while other countries are looking down on us regarding Rohingya matter. Moreover, our country has not only Rohingya Muslims (war refugees) in Rakhine State which caused by armed & dangerous people, accordingly; our ethnic groups from Multiple states are getting the same treatment. Heres also a brief explanation about Rohingya Muslims, lets go back to the beginning of the story. At first, the military officials illegally allowed them (without civilians knowledge) in order to gain human labors & make religious-related-riots here or there. Decades later, Rohingya Muslims requested for their own land with their own government so on & so on which messed things up. Even after all those thing happened, like I said, most of us still dont know about it until the world did. Thus, i think it is crystal clear that they are illegal migrants from wherever it is. Although they lived in Myanmar for generations, they cannot even speak Burmese at all which is unrealistic. Which is also why, some of us cant accept them as our citizens. In the end, the world thinks we all (civilians) are supported those people in killing people.  Helllllll noooo. It is so unfair to even think like that. Its Dictatorship, people. Millions are starving & getting killed with limited healthcare within the country. Limited access of internet in the rural areas. We still has difficulties with transportation system, hygiene food, clear water & etc., as well. We all are on the same boat. Thus, do not ever say on this matter through googling shits online.   (Ps- My bad if its too long.)"

As results of the 2020 general election, we will hold the third session of parliament and accept the appointment of a new government.  ·Äí·ÄÆ·ÄÄ·Äî·Ä±·Ä∑ ·ÄÄ·Ä¨·ÄÄ·ÄΩ·Äö·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä±·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·ÄÖ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫ ·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Ä°·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äú·Äæ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äî·Ä± ·Ä°·Äû·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Ä°·Äï·Ä∫·Äú·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äù·Äî·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äê·ÄΩ·Ä±·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Åã·ÄÑ·Ä´·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑·Äê·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äô·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äë·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äû·Äô·Äπ·Äô·Äê·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äõ·Ä¨·Äë·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äô·Äæ·Äî·Äæ·ÄØ·Äê·Ä∫·Äë·ÄΩ·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÖ·Ä±·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äõ·ÄÑ·Ä∫ ·Äï·Äº·Ää·Ä∫·Äë·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÖ·ÄØ·Äú·ÄΩ·Äæ·Äê·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äë·Ä≤·ÄÄ·Äî·Ä±·Äï·Ä≤ ·Ä°·ÄÅ·Äº·Ä±·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Ä•·Äï·Äí·Ä±·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äë·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äî·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äû·ÄΩ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äõ·Äô·Äæ·Ä¨·Äñ·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·Åã·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä°·ÄÅ·Äº·Ä±·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Ä•·Äï·Äí·Ä±·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äë·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äî·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äõ·ÄÑ·Ä∫ ·Äê·Äê·Ä≠·Äö·Ä°·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä≠·Äô·Ä∫·Äú·ÄΩ·Äæ·Äê·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Ä±·Ä´·Ä∫·Äï·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∑ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äû·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äô·Äæ·Äï·Ä≤ ·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äõ·Äæ·Ä≠·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äû·Äô·Äπ·Äô·Äê·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äõ·Ä¨·Äë·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äû·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äê·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·ÄÄ·ÄØ·Äî·Ä∫·Äú·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Äæ·Ä¨·Äñ·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·Åã ·ÄÑ·Ä´·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑·Äô·Äº·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Ä¨·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äõ·Äæ·Ä≠·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äû·Äô·Äπ·Äô·Äê·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äï·Ä≤·Äñ·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·Åã ·Äû·Äô·Äπ·Äô·Äê·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·Äô·Ä≠·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äô·Äü·ÄØ·Äê·Ä∫·Äò·Ä≤·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Ä°·Äõ·Ä±·Ä∏·Äï·Ä±·Ä´·Ä∫·Ä°·ÄÅ·Äº·Ä±·Ä°·Äî·Ä±·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä±·ÄÑ·Äº·Ä¨·ÄÅ·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Åä·Ä°·Ä¨·Äè·Ä¨·Äú·ÄΩ·Äæ·Ä≤·Äï·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Ä±·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äê·Äõ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äô·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Åã ·Äë·Äï·Ä∫·Äô·Ä∂·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Ä°·Äï·Ä∫·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äê·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Åã·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äû·Äò·Ä±·Ä¨·Äô·Äê·Ä∞·Äï·Ä´·Åã ·ÅÇ·ÅÄ·ÅÇ·ÅÄ·Ä°·Äë·ÄΩ·Ä±·Äë·ÄΩ·Ä±·Äõ·ÄΩ·Ä±·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äï·ÄΩ·Ä≤·ÄÄ·Äõ·Äõ·Äæ·Ä≠·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äô·Ä≤·Äõ·Äú·Äí·Ä∫·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏ ·Äê·Äê·Ä≠·Äö·Ä°·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä≠·Äô·Ä∫·Äú·ÄΩ·Äæ·Äê·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Äï·Äº·ÄØ·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äï·Ä±·Ä∏·Äï·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äû·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Ä°·Äï·Ä∫·Äê·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äï·Ä≤ ·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Äô·Äö·Ä∫·Åã·ÄÄ·Ä¨·ÄÄ·ÄΩ·Äö·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä±·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·ÄÖ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Ä°·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äú·Äæ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·Äô·Ä≠·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫·Ä°·Äï·Ä∫·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äê·ÄΩ·Ä±·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·ÄÜ·Äî·Äπ·Äí·Äô·Ä≤·Äï·Ä±·Ä∏·Äï·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÅ·ÄΩ·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äõ·Äæ·Ä≠·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äû·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äï·Äº·Ää·Ä∫·Äû·Ä∞·Äê·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Ä¶·Ä∏·Ä°·Äî·Ä±·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂ ·Äû·Äò·Ä±·Ä¨·Äô·Äê·Ä∞·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äú·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑ ·Äï·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·Åã  #Save #Myanmar üá≤üá≤  #Save #Burma üá≤üá≤  #Reject #the #Military !!! #We #need #democracy!!! #Help #us #and #support #our #Leader,  #Aung #San #Suu #Kyi #government!!!"

As results of the 2020 general election, we will hold the third session of parliament and accept the appointment of a new government.  ·Äí·ÄÆ·ÄÄ·Ä±·Äî·Çî ·ÄÄ·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Äº·Äö·Äπ·Ä±·Äõ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·ÄÖ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Ä∫·Ä≥·Äï·Äπ ·Äô·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Ä±·Ä°·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äú·ÄΩ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÄ·Ä±·Äî ·Ä°·Äû·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·ÄÖ·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Ä°·Äï·Äπ·Äú·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äê·Äö·Äπ·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äù·Äî·Äπ·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä±·Äê·Äº·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Åã·ÄÑ·Ä´·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑·Äê·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä±·Äª·Äô·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äë·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Äû·Äô·Åº·Äê·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äª·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Äπ·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äõ·Ä¨·Äë·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äô·ÄΩ·Çè·ÄΩ·ÄØ·Äê·Äπ·Äë·Äº·ÄÄ·Äπ·Ä±·ÄÖ·ÄÅ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äê·Äö·Äπ·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äõ·ÄÑ·Äπ ·Äª·Äï·Ää·Äπ·Ä±·Äë·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÖ·ÄØ·Äú·Çä·Äê·Äπ·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Äë·Ä≤·ÄÄ·Ä±·Äî·Äï·Ä≤ ·Ä°·Ä±·Äª·ÄÅ·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Ä•·Äï·Ä±·Äí·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Äë·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Äî·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·Äô·Ä∫·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äû·Äº·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äõ·Äô·ÄΩ·Ä¨·Äª·Äñ·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Äπ·Åã·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·ÄÖ·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·Äï·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä°·Ä±·Äª·ÄÅ·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Ä•·Äï·Ä±·Äí·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Äë·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Äî·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äõ·ÄÑ·Äπ ·Äê·Äê·Ä≠·Äö·Ä°·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·Ä≠·Äô·Äπ·Äú·Çä·Äê·Äπ·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Ä±·ÄÅ·Åö·Åø·Äï·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Ä∑ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·Äû·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·ÄÖ·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·Åø·Äï·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äô·ÄΩ·Äï·Ä≤ ·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äõ·ÄΩ·Ä≠·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Äû·Äô·Åº·Äê·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äª·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Äπ·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äõ·Ä¨·Äë·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äû·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äê·Äô·Äπ·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·ÄÄ·ÄØ·Äî·Äπ·Äú·Äº·Äî·Äπ·Äô·ÄΩ·Ä¨·Äª·Äñ·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Äπ·Åã ·ÄÑ·Ä´·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑·Äª·Äô·Äî·Äπ·Äô·Ä¨·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äõ·ÄΩ·Ä≠·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Äû·Äô·Åº·Äê·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äª·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Äπ·Äï·Ä≤·Äª·Äñ·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Äπ·Åã ·Äû·Äô·Åº·Äê·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äª·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Äπ·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·Äô·Ä≠·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Äî·Ä≤·Çî·Äô·Äü·ÄØ·Äê·Äπ·Äò·Ä≤·Äî·Ä≤·Çî ·Ä°·Ä±·Äõ·Ä∏·Ä±·Äï·Åö·Ä°·Ä±·Äª·ÄÅ·Ä°·Ä±·Äî·Ä±·Åæ·ÄÄ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä¨·Äª·ÄÅ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Åä·Ä°·Ä¨·Äè·Ä¨·Äú·Çä·Ä≤·Ä±·Äª·Äï·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Ä±·Äï·Ä∏·Äª·ÄÅ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äô·Ä∫·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äü·Ä¨ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äê·Äõ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äô·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Åã ·Äë·Äï·Äπ·Äô·Ä∂·ÄÅ·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Ä°·Äï·Äπ·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äê·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Åã·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äû·Ä±·Äò·Ä¨·Äô·Äê·Ä∞·Äï·Ä´·Åã ·ÅÇ·ÅÄ·ÅÇ·ÅÄ·Ä°·Ä±·Äë·Äº·Ä±·Äë·Äº·Ä±·Äõ·Äº·Ä∏·Ä±·ÄÄ·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äï·Äº·Ä≤·ÄÄ·Äõ·Äõ·ÄΩ·Ä≠·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äô·Ä≤·Äõ·Äú·Äí·Äπ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏ ·Äê·Äê·Ä≠·Äö·Ä°·ÇÄ·ÄÄ·Ä≠·Äô·Äπ·Äú·Çä·Äê·Äπ·Ä±·Äê·Ä¨·Äπ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä¨·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Äï·Äª·Äï·Ä≥·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Ä±·Äï·Ä∏·Åø·Äï·ÄÆ·Ä∏ ·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·Äû·ÄÖ·Äπ·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·ÄÖ·Ää·Äπ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Ä°·Äï·Äπ·Äê·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äï·Ä≤ ·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·ÄÅ·Ä∂·Äï·Ä´·Äô·Äö·Äπ·Åã·ÄÄ·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Äº·Äö·Äπ·Ä±·Äõ·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·ÄÖ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Ä∫·Ä≥·Äï·Äπ·Äô·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä∏·Ä±·Ä°·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äú·ÄΩ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·Äô·Ä≠·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Äî·Ä≤·Çî ·ÄÅ·Äî·Çî·Äπ·Ä°·Äï·Äπ·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑·Ä°·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä°·Äñ·Äº·Ä≤·Çï·Äù·ÄÑ·Äπ·Ä±·Äê·Äº·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ ·ÄÜ·Çè·Åµ·Äô·Ä≤·Ä±·Äï·Ä∏·Äï·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÅ·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Äπ·Äõ·ÄΩ·Ä≠·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑ ·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Äπ·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äû·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äª·Äï·Ää·Äπ·Äû·Ä∞·Äê·ÄÖ·Äπ·Ä¶·Ä∏·Ä°·Ä±·Äî·Äî·Ä≤·Çî ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù ·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äù·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äô·ÄÅ·Ä∂ ·Äû·Ä±·Äò·Ä¨·Äô·Äê·Ä∞·Äï·Ä´·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏·Äú·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑ ·Ä±·Äª·Äï·Ä¨·ÄÅ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Äπ·Äï·Ä´·Äê·Äö·Äπ·Åã  #Save #Myanmar üá≤üá≤  #Save #Burma üá≤üá≤  #Reject #the #Military !!! #We #need #democracy!!! #Help #us #and #support #our #Leader,  #Aung #San #Suu #Kyi #government!!!·ÅÄ"
