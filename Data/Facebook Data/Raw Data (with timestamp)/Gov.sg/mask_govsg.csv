This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

The amount of air intake required at this level of exertion is no less than that for slow jog. Here's my question:  Will I be fined for doing my brisk walk without wearing the mask?

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay.

My opinion if we are in a place with more then 5 or 10 and going for essential shopping use a mask. As long we exercise walk, brisk walk or vigrous no need mask.

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay.

Please bring spare dry masks if you run longer so you can use the fresh one when you enter the lifts and public area.   For some of us exercise is key to being healthy.  Some of us have problems with some of member of the house but can’t afford to get another housing for example they do need some space ...

A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?

A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay.

Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse. General travel bans can make things worse”"

Please bring spare dry masks if you run longer so you can use the fresh one when you enter the lifts and public area.   For some of us exercise is key to being healthy.  Some of us have problems with some of member of the house but can’t afford to get another housing for example they do need some space ...

A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense.

All it takes is for these exemptions to spread the virus. From single digits to double digits to triple digits and more?  Don't get me wrong. The measures are good long awaited for. Better late than never. But have some sense on the matter. These exemptions actively breaths, pant. If they are carriers. It is as bad as coughing and sneezing everywhere they went. All that cross their path gets infected and infect those they go back to. All those people who are the country's essential workers and those who needs essential services.  Is it not what the circuit breaker is all about."

I do it at a pace of 6kph, sometimes faster, in order to gain as much aerobic benefits as possible. This pace is even faster than some of the very slow joggers. The amount of air intake required at this level of exertion is no less than that for slow jog. Here's my question:  Will I be fined for doing my brisk walk without wearing the mask? I am now 68 and have a lower back problem, making it rather risky for me to jog. Owing to this, I have stopped jogging.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

101582904,34863600,Alan Tan,"Apr 15, 2020","The government took a gamble asking Singapore residents to wear mask only when one is sick. This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine. I hope the government can reflect and do better when they make policy changes."

All it takes is for these exemptions to spread the virus. From single digits to double digits to triple digits and more?  Don't get me wrong. The measures are good long awaited for.

I do it at a pace of 6kph, sometimes faster, in order to gain as much aerobic benefits as possible. This pace is even faster than some of the very slow joggers. The amount of air intake required at this level of exertion is no less than that for slow jog. Here's my question:  Will I be fined for doing my brisk walk without wearing the mask?

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it.

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it.

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.

In a randomized trial in Vietnam, healthcare workers who wore cloth masks acquired more respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses than their colleagues who wore surgical masks.

If you all keep telling us not to wear masks, then we healthy ones will fall sick. So many of us have no choice because we have to protect ourselves against those sick ones who don’t wear masks.   MPs and government don’t take mrt everyday to get to work so honestly you all don’t understand.  Wearing a mask is uncomfortable but why do you think they are being snapped up?   It’s annoying to keep hearing our leaders say only wear if you are unwell. If you encounter what normal citizens have to face daily with sick ppl sneezing and coughing in the mrt carriages, then you won’t keep telling us only wear if we are unwell.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense.

I do it at a pace of 6kph, sometimes faster, in order to gain as much aerobic benefits as possible. This pace is even faster than some of the very slow joggers. The amount of air intake required at this level of exertion is no less than that for slow jog. Here's my question:  Will I be fined for doing my brisk walk without wearing the mask? I am now 68 and have a lower back problem, making it rather risky for me to jog. Owing to this, I have stopped jogging.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse. General travel bans can make things worse”"

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it.

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.

In a randomized trial in Vietnam, healthcare workers who wore cloth masks acquired more respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses than their colleagues who wore surgical masks.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?

A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

However, the quality and the comfort of the reusable masks is really disappointing. The first one I got, it was so small, i can't even wear it as the masks automatically snaps off my face. The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it. Also, maybe it is more prudent to only provide for those who are struggling to make ends meet, but need to go out to work and will need the reusable masks more than me or a good percentage of Singaporeans and PRs."

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.  HOWEVER, you need to soak the cloth mask in hot boiling water with detergent IMMEDIATELY upon returning. Then wash the mask thoroughly and disinfect it before reusing each time. Otherwise you are simply re-wearing a soiled dirty mask with the virus on it.  ‘...“A separate study, from 2015, casts additional doubt on homemade masks. In a randomized trial in Vietnam, healthcare workers who wore cloth masks acquired more respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses than their colleagues who wore surgical masks.   Lab tests showed that 97 percent of particles got through the cloth masks, compared to 44 percent with surgical masks.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it.

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.

In a randomized trial in Vietnam, healthcare workers who wore cloth masks acquired more respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses than their colleagues who wore surgical masks.

If we dont wear, we will most definitely become unwell. Can you blame citizens for accusing the leaders for sitting in their ivory towers and not understanding the problems healthy ones are facing in the trains?  In these circumstances, the way to stay healthy IS to wear a mask."

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it.

If you all keep telling us not to wear masks, then we healthy ones will fall sick. So many of us have no choice because we have to protect ourselves against those sick ones who don’t wear masks.   MPs and government don’t take mrt everyday to get to work so honestly you all don’t understand.  Wearing a mask is uncomfortable but why do you think they are being snapped up?   It’s annoying to keep hearing our leaders say only wear if you are unwell. If you encounter what normal citizens have to face daily with sick ppl sneezing and coughing in the mrt carriages, then you won’t keep telling us only wear if we are unwell.   If we dont wear, we will most definitely become unwell.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse. General travel bans can make things worse”"

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it.

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.

In a randomized trial in Vietnam, healthcare workers who wore cloth masks acquired more respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses than their colleagues who wore surgical masks.

Are there no plans to combat the crisis should it develop further besides talking about mask?

101582904,34863600,Alan Tan,"Apr 15, 2020","The government took a gamble asking Singapore residents to wear mask only when one is sick. This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine. I hope the government can reflect and do better when they make policy changes."

All it takes is for these exemptions to spread the virus. From single digits to double digits to triple digits and more?  Don't get me wrong. The measures are good long awaited for.

I do it at a pace of 6kph, sometimes faster, in order to gain as much aerobic benefits as possible. This pace is even faster than some of the very slow joggers. The amount of air intake required at this level of exertion is no less than that for slow jog. Here's my question:  Will I be fined for doing my brisk walk without wearing the mask?

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it.

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.

101582566,51953600,Paula Nazarene Evangelista Say,"Apr 5, 2020","Hi, just a few pointers:  1. Please don’t use staples especially if disassembly is suggested after wearing. If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3. Not sure how breathable the waterproof totebag side can be 😅 I just tried putting a waterproof totebag over my nose and mouth - I can’t breathe at all 😂  Cute initiative though! But perhaps its safety can be looked into just a little more, before releasing it out to the public. Many may try this and may do more harm than good.  To everyone else: collect your free reusable facemask from the government asap! Maskgowhere.sg  Thanks! 🙂"

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense.

101582904,34863600,长宁,"Apr 15, 2020","I need an answer from the Task Force to this 👇  I do my one-hour brisk walk everyday. I do it at a pace of 6kph, sometimes faster, in order to gain as much aerobic benefits as possible. This pace is even faster than some of the very slow joggers. The amount of air intake required at this level of exertion is no less than that for slow jog. Here's my question:  Will I be fined for doing my brisk walk without wearing the mask? I am now 68 and have a lower back problem, making it rather risky for me to jog. Owing to this, I have stopped jogging.  I believe other brisk walkers like me are equally keen to know the answer too."

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse. General travel bans can make things worse”"

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it.

For a small land space and denser population, and 13 confirmed cases, probably 3rd highest in confirmed cases by now, are we at higher risks than the rest that numbers are falling behind us?   In view of these, will we be willing to temp close border to perhaps Non-essential visitors from China into Singapore? Likewise that we have advised all Singaporean not to travel to China for Non Essential visit, certainly for good reasons, isnt it?"

101582566,51953600,Paula Nazarene Evangelista Say,"Apr 5, 2020","Hi, just a few pointers:  1. Please don’t use staples especially if disassembly is suggested after wearing. If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3. Not sure how breathable the waterproof totebag side can be 😅 I just tried putting a waterproof totebag over my nose and mouth - I can’t breathe at all 😂  Cute initiative though! But perhaps its safety can be looked into just a little more, before releasing it out to the public. Many may try this and may do more harm than good.

I have my own masks at home at all times (due to annual haze).  If I wear one in crowded places & public transport to protect myself from the potential bugs in the air, will people think I'm the one who is sick (since I'm wearing a mask) & ostracise me instead?  If you do not want people to mis-use the FOUR PRECIOUS SURGICAL MASKS PER HOUSEHOLD you are dishing out now, you can tell people to USE THOSE 4 MASKS only when they are sick cos those 4 masks are meant to be used that way.  Please do not dish out such generic advisory to make it sound like it is wrong to wear mask if well.  It can potentially mislead the ignorant in the public to think anyone wearing a mask must be sick.  Such advisory just serves to further stigmatise mask-wearing & promote wrong behaviors.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay.

It doesn't care about your age or what you are doing! It just want to find a host and replicate itself. It does not care less. Can you identify that those exemptions are 100% free from the virus or not carriers? If not the more stringent measures that you say will be futile. When the rest of Sg are abiding. All it takes is for these exemptions to spread the virus. From single digits to double digits to triple digits and more?  Don't get me wrong. The measures are good long awaited for. Better late than never. But have some sense on the matter. These exemptions actively breaths, pant. If they are carriers. It is as bad as coughing and sneezing everywhere they went.

I do it at a pace of 6kph, sometimes faster, in order to gain as much aerobic benefits as possible. This pace is even faster than some of the very slow joggers. The amount of air intake required at this level of exertion is no less than that for slow jog. Here's my question:  Will I be fined for doing my brisk walk without wearing the mask? I am now 68 and have a lower back problem, making it rather risky for me to jog. Owing to this, I have stopped jogging.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it.

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.

In a randomized trial in Vietnam, healthcare workers who wore cloth masks acquired more respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses than their colleagues who wore surgical masks.

101582566,51953600,Paula Nazarene Evangelista Say,"Apr 5, 2020","Hi, just a few pointers:  1. Please don’t use staples especially if disassembly is suggested after wearing. If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3. Not sure how breathable the waterproof totebag side can be 😅 I just tried putting a waterproof totebag over my nose and mouth - I can’t breathe at all 😂  Cute initiative though! But perhaps its safety can be looked into just a little more, before releasing it out to the public. Many may try this and may do more harm than good.  To everyone else: collect your free reusable facemask from the government asap! Maskgowhere.sg  Thanks! 🙂"

I have my own masks at home at all times (due to annual haze).  If I wear one in crowded places & public transport to protect myself from the potential bugs in the air, will people think I'm the one who is sick (since I'm wearing a mask) & ostracise me instead?  If you do not want people to mis-use the FOUR PRECIOUS SURGICAL MASKS PER HOUSEHOLD you are dishing out now, you can tell people to USE THOSE 4 MASKS only when they are sick cos those 4 masks are meant to be used that way.  Please do not dish out such generic advisory to make it sound like it is wrong to wear mask if well.  It can potentially mislead the ignorant in the public to think anyone wearing a mask must be sick.  Such advisory just serves to further stigmatise mask-wearing & promote wrong behaviors.  Folks like myself who take precautionary measures to protect ourselves & our family (while we are still not sick) are being civic minded."

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?

A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

However, the quality and the comfort of the reusable masks is really disappointing. The first one I got, it was so small, i can't even wear it as the masks automatically snaps off my face. The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it. Also, maybe it is more prudent to only provide for those who are struggling to make ends meet, but need to go out to work and will need the reusable masks more than me or a good percentage of Singaporeans and PRs."

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.  HOWEVER, you need to soak the cloth mask in hot boiling water with detergent IMMEDIATELY upon returning. Then wash the mask thoroughly and disinfect it before reusing each time.

It’s annoying to keep hearing our leaders say only wear if you are unwell. If you encounter what normal citizens have to face daily with sick ppl sneezing and coughing in the mrt carriages, then you won’t keep telling us only wear if we are unwell.

101582566,51953600,Lee YS,"Apr 6, 2020","Proposed by a GROUP of student researchers 🤦🏻‍♀️  My goodness. You sure this is washable? Why need to wash your hands before making and not washing the mask after making? If you wash your hands before making, you need to make sure you need to wash all the tools before using as well. Isn’t using needle and thread way better than using staples which can pose a risk when you wear or wash the mask? And with that masking tape, confirm damage after one wash. With the use of thread, staples and masking tape become redundant 💆🏻‍♀️  Yes, its simple but not practical (and ugly). But it’s definitely a good project to work for should my kid’s kindergarten’s next project is making mask from recycled material."

101582566,51953600,Paula Nazarene Evangelista Say,"Apr 5, 2020","Hi, just a few pointers:  1. Please don’t use staples especially if disassembly is suggested after wearing. If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3. Not sure how breathable the waterproof totebag side can be 😅 I just tried putting a waterproof totebag over my nose and mouth - I can’t breathe at all 😂  Cute initiative though! But perhaps its safety can be looked into just a little more, before releasing it out to the public. Many may try this and may do more harm than good.

I have my own masks at home at all times (due to annual haze).  If I wear one in crowded places & public transport to protect myself from the potential bugs in the air, will people think I'm the one who is sick (since I'm wearing a mask) & ostracise me instead?  If you do not want people to mis-use the FOUR PRECIOUS SURGICAL MASKS PER HOUSEHOLD you are dishing out now, you can tell people to USE THOSE 4 MASKS only when they are sick cos those 4 masks are meant to be used that way.  Please do not dish out such generic advisory to make it sound like it is wrong to wear mask if well.  It can potentially mislead the ignorant in the public to think anyone wearing a mask must be sick.  Such advisory just serves to further stigmatise mask-wearing & promote wrong behaviors.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?

A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

However, the quality and the comfort of the reusable masks is really disappointing. The first one I got, it was so small, i can't even wear it as the masks automatically snaps off my face. The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it. Also, maybe it is more prudent to only provide for those who are struggling to make ends meet, but need to go out to work and will need the reusable masks more than me or a good percentage of Singaporeans and PRs."

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.  HOWEVER, you need to soak the cloth mask in hot boiling water with detergent IMMEDIATELY upon returning. Then wash the mask thoroughly and disinfect it before reusing each time. Otherwise you are simply re-wearing a soiled dirty mask with the virus on it.  ‘...“A separate study, from 2015, casts additional doubt on homemade masks. In a randomized trial in Vietnam, healthcare workers who wore cloth masks acquired more respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses than their colleagues who wore surgical masks.   Lab tests showed that 97 percent of particles got through the cloth masks, compared to 44 percent with surgical masks.

Why need to wash your hands before making and not washing the mask after making? If you wash your hands before making, you need to make sure you need to wash all the tools before using as well. Isn’t using needle and thread way better than using staples which can pose a risk when you wear or wash the mask? And with that masking tape, confirm damage after one wash. With the use of thread, staples and masking tape become redundant 💆🏻‍♀️  Yes, its simple but not practical (and ugly).

101582566,51953600,Paula Nazarene Evangelista Say,"Apr 5, 2020","Hi, just a few pointers:  1. Please don’t use staples especially if disassembly is suggested after wearing. If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3. Not sure how breathable the waterproof totebag side can be 😅 I just tried putting a waterproof totebag over my nose and mouth - I can’t breathe at all 😂  Cute initiative though! But perhaps its safety can be looked into just a little more, before releasing it out to the public. Many may try this and may do more harm than good.

If I wear one in crowded places & public transport to protect myself from the potential bugs in the air, will people think I'm the one who is sick (since I'm wearing a mask) & ostracise me instead?  If you do not want people to mis-use the FOUR PRECIOUS SURGICAL MASKS PER HOUSEHOLD you are dishing out now, you can tell people to USE THOSE 4 MASKS only when they are sick cos those 4 masks are meant to be used that way.  Please do not dish out such generic advisory to make it sound like it is wrong to wear mask if well.  It can potentially mislead the ignorant in the public to think anyone wearing a mask must be sick.  Such advisory just serves to further stigmatise mask-wearing & promote wrong behaviors.

Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay.

My opinion if we are in a place with more then 5 or 10 and going for essential shopping use a mask. As long we exercise walk, brisk walk or vigrous no need mask.

They do not recommend wearing mask or anything people need to do to prevent themselves from getting the sickness because up to now they are still monitoring the extent of Human transmission. It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse. General travel bans can make things worse”"

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it. Also, maybe it is more prudent to only provide for those who are struggling to make ends meet, but need to go out to work and will need the reusable masks more than me or a good percentage of Singaporeans and PRs."

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.

In a randomized trial in Vietnam, healthcare workers who wore cloth masks acquired more respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses than their colleagues who wore surgical masks.

Why need to wash your hands before making and not washing the mask after making? If you wash your hands before making, you need to make sure you need to wash all the tools before using as well. Isn’t using needle and thread way better than using staples which can pose a risk when you wear or wash the mask? And with that masking tape, confirm damage after one wash. With the use of thread, staples and masking tape become redundant 💆🏻‍♀️  Yes, its simple but not practical (and ugly).

101582566,51953600,Paula Nazarene Evangelista Say,"Apr 5, 2020","Hi, just a few pointers:  1. Please don’t use staples especially if disassembly is suggested after wearing. If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3. Not sure how breathable the waterproof totebag side can be 😅 I just tried putting a waterproof totebag over my nose and mouth - I can’t breathe at all 😂  Cute initiative though! But perhaps its safety can be looked into just a little more, before releasing it out to the public. Many may try this and may do more harm than good.

I have my own masks at home at all times (due to annual haze).  If I wear one in crowded places & public transport to protect myself from the potential bugs in the air, will people think I'm the one who is sick (since I'm wearing a mask) & ostracise me instead?  If you do not want people to mis-use the FOUR PRECIOUS SURGICAL MASKS PER HOUSEHOLD you are dishing out now, you can tell people to USE THOSE 4 MASKS only when they are sick cos those 4 masks are meant to be used that way.  Please do not dish out such generic advisory to make it sound like it is wrong to wear mask if well.  It can potentially mislead the ignorant in the public to think anyone wearing a mask must be sick.  Such advisory just serves to further stigmatise mask-wearing & promote wrong behaviors.

101583122,68858600,Miel Rommel,"Apr 21, 2020",just wondering why need to hand out flyers. it can get contaminated and still cause spread. virus spread is by contact on any surface. how about ask them to bring out their phone and flash a QR code and make sure person read the webpage in front of you.
