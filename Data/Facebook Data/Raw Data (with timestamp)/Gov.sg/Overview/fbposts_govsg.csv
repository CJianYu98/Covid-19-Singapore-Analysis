Got my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine today, together with Director of Medical Services A/Prof Kenneth Mak. We got vaccinated early to show Singaporeans we are confident that the vaccine is safe and effective.

Prof Mak and I were monitored for 30 minutes after the jab, just in case we developed any side effects, e.g. allergic reactions. Happy to report that we both felt fine.

Today we started vaccinating healthcare workers from public healthcare institutions. We aim to start vaccinating elderly people from February, and then other Singaporeans and long-term residents.

Vaccinations are voluntary, but I hope that when itâ€™s your turn, you will go for it. It will be free, it will protect you and your family, and it will help keep everyone safe. â€“ LHL

[Joint statement by the Singapore Tourism Board, Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Police Force]

Following yesterdayâ€™s announcement that all entertainment venues will be closed from 26 March, 2359 hours till 30 April, we are aware a number of nightlife operators intend to host â€œfarewellâ€ events tonight that could result in large numbers of people congregating. These events undermine the fight against COVID-19 and increases risk to public health. If you are planning to attend, we urge you to seriously reconsider, if not for your own health, then for the health of those around you.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforceâ€™s decision to enforce stricter safe distancing measures aims to significantly reduce the risks of seeding new local COVID-19 clusters, which could strain our healthcare system further.

From now until the stricter measures kick in on 26 March 2020, 2359 hours, nightlife operators must continue to strictly implement safe distancing measures announced by the Ministry of Health on 20 March 2020. Events with 250 or more participants must be suspended, while operators of events with fewer than 250 participants must implement all necessary precautionary measures, including ensuring a distance of at least a metre between all participants and reduce mingling amongst participants.

These safe distancing measures are enforceable. Officers from government agencies including the Singapore Police Force will be on the ground to monitor the situation and carry out enforcement action over the next two days. The Traffic Police will also be conducting island-wide enforcement operations against drink-driving during this period. We will not hesitate to take action against anyone who fails to comply.

During this time, we appeal to Singaporeans to exercise good judgement and social responsibility. This will play an important part in keeping fellow Singaporeans and our loved ones safe in the midst of this global pandemic.",25/3/2020 14:32,17,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10158214063088686,101582140,63088600

[POLICE DO NOT CONDUCT ROAD BLOCKS TO ENFORCE ELEVATED SAFE DISTANCING MEASURES]

There are messages circulating via text messaging services making false claims that members of the public had been stopped at police road blocks and fined for not complying with the elevated safe distancing measures. This is not true. The Police have not conducted road blocks specifically to enforce the elevated safe distancing measures, and no passengers have been fined at road blocks for not complying with these measures.

The Police conduct road blocks to detect offences such as for drink-driving, and other law enforcement purposes, such as to detect wanted persons. Nevertheless, if the Police come across motorists and passengers flouting the elevated safe distancing measures when conducting such road blocks, the Police may take enforcement action.

The Police urge the public not to spread unsubstantiated information which may cause public alarm.

Of these, the vast majority are dormitory residents who were tested during their isolation/quarantine period, even though they are asymptomatic. They are amongst the final batch of workers being cleared and they come from dormitories with a relatively high prevalence of COVID-19. Hence MOH expects the daily case counts to be high for the coming days, before tapering down thereafter as the Inter-agency Taskforce completes the dormitory clearance.

MOH remains on track to clear all the dormitories by 7 August, except for a few standalone blocks in the dormitories that serve as quarantine facilities.

This new measure comes as Singapore prepares to reopen international travel through green lanes with various countries and regions.

[Budget 2020: Dealing with the Immediate Challenges]

Our immediate concern is to protect you and your families. We will put in every effort to slow down the spread of the virus.

Frontline ministries have been fighting and containing the outbreak. We will set aside an additional $800 million in this Budget to support these efforts, with the bulk of this going to the Ministry of Health, Singapore.

With these uncertainties, Singaporeans are worried about the impact on our business and jobs. Families are also concerned about rising expenditures.

To stabilise the economy and provide assurance to Singaporeans, we will introduce two packages, totalling $5.6 billion.

The first is the Stabilisation and Support Package for workers and enterprises.

The second is the Care and Support Package for households, to support our people through these uncertain times, and alleviate concerns over cost of living. More help will be given to the less well-off.

Those participating in strenuous exercises such as jogging or running are also allowed to remove their masks temporarily when engaging in such activities.

He emphasised that face shields should only be worn in some situations where the wearing of masks may not be practical.

Such examples include:
- Children, 12 years and below, who have difficulty wearing masks, or keeping a face mask on for prolonged periods of time.
- People who have health conditions that may result in breathing difficulties or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for prolonged periods of time.
- People who are speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture style setting where they are largely remaining in a single spot from which they are speaking and are able to maintain a safe distance away from others.

Face shields worn on top of a mask can also provide some additional protection to prevent the masks from getting wet and minimise people touching their face. However, masks will continue to be the default situation for all.

In the first prong, dormitories with existing clusters will be locked down and the movement of workers within the dormitories will be restricted. In the second prong, these safety distancing measures will also be applied to dormitories with no clusters to further prevent the spread of the COVID-19 infection. Lastly, workers in essential services have been placed in separate housing facilities instead of dormitories and have undergone medical screenings to ensure that they did not have symptoms before moving into alternative accommodation.

Misinformation can spread faster than a virus in an outbreak. To combat fake news amidst COVID-19, Singapore leverages technology to disseminate accurate information in an innovative and efficient way. Official government channels like Gov.sg's Whatsapp and Telegram deliver latest news updates right into the hands of Singaporeans, while web portals, such as Urban Redevelopment Authority's SpaceOut and GovTech (Government Technology Agency of Singapore)'s MaskGoWhere and FluGoWhere, provide timely information on key COVID-19 initiatives.

Beyond these efforts, Singapore also tapped on AI technologies to gather essential information crucial to the fight against COVID-19.

In order to further reduce the risk of importation of COVID-19 cases to Singapore, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce has announced additional border restriction measures.

From 16 March 2359 hours, all travellers entering Singapore with recent travel history to ASEAN countries, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued with a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

However, given our close proximity to Malaysia, the 14-day SHN will not apply to our land and sea crossings with Malaysia. Singaporean and Malaysian workers who commute between Singapore and Malaysia daily will still be able to do so. The latest restrictions will also not have an impact on the supply of food and other essentials between Singapore and Malaysia as drivers of goods vehicles will be able to enter as per normal.

These new measures are necessary to ensure that our healthcare system does not get overwhelmed by people entering Singapore for the sole purpose of seeking treatment in Singapore. We will continue to monitor the situation closely as it develops globally. CCS

Test methods will comprise PCR and serology testing to detect both currently infected workers, as well as those who have recovered from COVID-19. This helps to clear affected dorms thoroughly of the infection.

At the same time, he noted that many currently infected workers are recovering well, with an estimated 20,000 workers set to be discharged by the end of May. This will put Singapore in a favourable position to begin taking steps to reopen the economy in a cautious and calibrated manner.

Ministry of Health, Singapore
26 January 2020 at 00:28 Â·

As of 25 January 2020, 10pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed another imported case of Wuhan coronavirus infection in Singapore. Three confirmed cases were earlier announced on 23 and 24 January.

The fourth confirmed case is a 36 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family on 22 January. He is currently warded in an isolation room at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) and his condition is stable.

The case reported that he was asymptomatic during the flight to Singapore. He subsequently developed a cough on 23 January, and presented at SKH Emergency Department on 24 January. He was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection at about 9.30pm on 25 January.

Prior to hospital admission, the case stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa.

MOH has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with him.

Ministry of Defence, Singapore (MINDEF)
7 May 2020 at 02:56 Â·

Clarifications Regarding Infections in Expo CCF Published by Singapore States Times on 6 May 2020 of an NSF Infected with #COVID19

MINDEF refers to the 6 May 2020 Facebook post by the Singapore States Times, on infections among staff at the Community Care Facility (CCF) at Singapore Expo. That post contained a number of errors. There has been no reported case of infections among staff under the SAF deployed to take care of COVID-19 patients at the Expo. The 20-year-old male Singaporean citizen cited by the post, who was confirmed by the Ministry of Health in their News Release (5 May 2020) to be COVID-19-positive, works under a different healthcare group. Neither is he a Full-Time National Serviceman (NSF), as claimed by the post, but a trained nurse from a private agency. The Singapore States Times also claimed that none of the national servicemen deployed by the SAF at the CCF had any experience in the hospitals. This is again wrong. Some of them are doctors and medics with prior hospital experience.

The SAF recognises the inherent risk to all its staff deployed in the CCF to care for recovering COVID-19 patients. Careful attention had been paid to the training and preparation of all staff to institute and maintain protocols to protect themselves against infection. These protocols are emphasised repeatedly. Nonetheless, as with all healthcare and administrative workers on the frontlines against COVID-19, risks of infections are continually present. The SAF will step up its vigilance and do its utmost to prevent such infections.

Given its history of repeatedly communicating multiple falsehoods, the Singapore States Timesâ€™ Facebook page has been designated as a Declared Online Location by the Ministry of Communications and Information, with effect from 7 May 2020.

When the COVID-19 outbreak began, A*STAR tasked our researchers and engineers to channel their focus towards coming up with innovations that would contribute to Singaporeâ€™s fight against #COVID19.

These have included work on diagnostic test kits, therapeutics, in-silico modelling, and the employment of computer vision and deep learning to detect lung infection on chest x-rays, among others.

One ground-up initiative that has emerged is that of a DIY mask, the result of brainstorming from student researchers.

The DIY mask can be easily assembled using everyday items. This is timely, and will support the ongoing safe distancing measures.

WORKER MOVEMENTS AT S11 DORMITORY ON 5 JULY 2020

The Ministry of Manpower is aware of a video circulating online, on migrant workers gathering at S11 Dormitory on Sunday, 5 July 2020.

The migrant workers who gathered were dormitory residents who are residing in a cleared block for recovered workers.

On that day, the dormitory operator was re-assigning rooms in the block, to group workers based on their employers and worksites, as part of the Safe Living measures that dormitory operators must implement. The measures are to reduce the risks of reinfection of COVID-19, and to enable migrant workers to return to work safely.

The initial instructions from the dormitory operator had caused some confusion amongst the migrant worker residents, which led to them gathering at the common area. The dormitory operator immediately tried to resolve the situation, and was able to disperse the gathering within 30 minutes. All the residents involved were wearing masks.

We have received many queries from good-hearted charities, social service agencies and ground-up groups whether they can continue community service outreach during the Circuit Breaker.

During this period, we want to ensure that vulnerable people continue to get essential support. At the same time, all of us need to stay home, reduce our social interactions to the minimum, and go out when absolutely necessary. Only then can we reduce the spread of COVID-19.

To strike a sensible balance, charities, social service agencies and ground-up groups can approach the National Council of Social Service if they need their activities that provide essential aid, such as food and financial support, to be whitelisted. NCSS will coordinate and work with you to ensure that our vulnerable get support during the Circuit Breaker, while ensuring that they are kept safe and your volunteers and staff achieve stringent safe distancing. Some activities must continue, others can be modified or temporarily suspended.

Meanwhile, essential social services by MSF (e.g. our SSOs, residential homes, designated community services providing critical care) will continue to serve our most vulnerable among us.

<<Supporting Singaporeans during crisis>>

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit many Singaporeans hard. For those who are affected financially, we want to provide support.

We have received more than 500,000 applications for the Temporary Relief Fund, and applications have closed. The TRF provided interim assistance for those affected by COVID-19â€™s economic impact, until schemes like the COVID-19 Support Grant and the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) come into effect.

We recognise that Singaporeans may need more support after this month. That is why we have decided to enhance the COVID-19 Support Grant when applications open from May to 30 Sep 2020.

When we first announced the Grant, it was intended to support local employees who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 situation. Now, it will be extended to support:

a. Employees placed on involuntary No-Pay Leave (NPL) for at least 3 consecutive months, and

b. Employees who have had sustained salary reduction of at least 30% for 3 consecutive months.

Those who have lost their jobs, or are placed on No-Pay Leave for at least 3 months, may receive up to $800 a month for 3 months. Those who have lost their jobs can also receive employment and training support from Workforce Singapore (WSG) or Employment and Employability Institute (e2i). Others on involuntary NPL will have access to relevant courses subsidised by SkillsFuture Singapore. You may apply for the Grant from Monday, 4 May.

Those who have had their monthly salaries reduced by 30% or more for 3 months may receive up to $500 a month for 3 months. You may apply for the Grant from Monday 11 May.

We encourage you to apply online at go.gov.sg/CSG (goes â€˜liveâ€™ only from 4 May) with your supporting documents. You can email Ask_SSO@msf.gov.sg or call the ComCare hotline at 1800-222-0000 if you require assistance to apply online. If you are unable to email or call, you can approach your nearest SSO (go.gov.sg/ssolocator) for help with the online application.

Do note that full-time National Servicemen, interns, and self-employed persons such as taxi or private-hire drivers, insurance agents and delivery persons are not eligible for the COVID-19 Support Grant. Self-employed persons may be assisted under the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (www.ntuc.com.sg/sirs/).

We are also proactively helping existing ComCare clients. If your ComCare assistance is ending between now and July 2020, we will extend your assistance for a further 6 months without the need for further review. Families on ComCare whose circumstances have worsened during the COVID-19 situation may approach SSOs to review and possibly increase your current level of ComCare support.

New ComCare clients will also generally receive at least six months of assistance.

With the enhanced COVID-19 Support Grant and proactive ComCare assistance, my colleagues and I want to give you and your families more support as you seek new employment and training opportunities during this crisis.
