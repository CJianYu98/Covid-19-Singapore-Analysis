Should deploy EHS personel & SAF personel to enforce on these areas so that to help contain the spread. Kudos, to the people/agencies actively & diligently involved.👏👏"
101582725,8808600,Csk Cxq,"Apr 10, 2020","Can government send masks to the dormitories? At this critical time, masks should be given immediately to prevent spread in the dormitories. Cant wait for social initiative to finish the sewing of cloth masks. Be practical and timely else we may see the daily numbers hitting thousands."

101582725,8808600,洪福明,"Apr 10, 2020",I request the workers be given reusable masks. It will be economically viable as they reduce spread to those helping them eg police and army.

101582725,8808600,Ken Ken,"Apr 10, 2020","Circuit breaker is too weak a term used to stop people from moving around to start with, using the wrong term doesn't reflect the seriousness of issues here. The right term is ""lockdown"". Where on earth people want to use circuit breaker to term some event not related to electronic or electrical.  I wonder why our multi million paid minsters cannot coin the right term?   Tell the people seriously that it is in fact a lockdown and they are to stay at home, stop telling people ""CB"",there is no emotion attached to ""CB""."

A few posting I noticed were taken by one of the workers themselves and some even end up at BBC news and  labelling our  effort negatively. I hope the workers appreciates our effort and the enormous amount of resources put into them, by directing their unhappiness to the right channel to rectify any problems, rather than shaming our effort internationally."

Challenge is to manage equal opportunities for both.

No EQ...its a lesson to all civil service that issue a laptop for admins. Even school students have laptop. So in terms of crisis we can work from home.

This  will also help to prevent the wide spread of virus in the crowded dormitory and easier to contain the virus."

Not the ones who sit in big chairs and get the big bucks. Our frontliners are the real heroes. After the crisis and things go back to normal, they will be treated like dirt and still be paid with dirt. It is really time to relook our employment and economic models to treat and pay those that really matter. Security guards, cleaners, hospital staff, transport people etc. We can see clearly now who are the essential people in our system. Stop increasing the top and start paying more to the bottom. They deserve much more than what they are getting now. No need for clapping and no need to sing songs. Just pay them for their worth and no one can deny they are essential."

One at the worksites where different nationalities work together. Two, when they socialise especially among their own races during weekends and holidays. Good that the vast majority are young and robust and will recover very quickly. In normal terms, it take about 14 days to have a clear view of the infection. Some may take longer, so a safe time will be 2 cycles, 28 days. So hang in there and things will be all right."

101583432,48228600,Chua Swee Hua,"Apr 27, 2020",Thank you Mr Gan and team for taking care with many efforts to try and resolve the problems of the COVID 19 Situations
101583432,48228600,Siew Chng Tan,"Apr 29, 2020","According to MOH, they conduct 3000 tests every day, daily confirmed cases on average are approx. 850 cases, so as a  %, should be about 30%; if at the pace MOH is testing and to test all the 300k migrant workers it would take 3  months to finalise and if the 30% ( a constant) apply on each batch, the time lag between incubation, symptoms and infected in the midst of testing, the asymptomatic carriers and the virus carrier without symptoms ( granted the presence of the carriers and inexorably rising ) will continue to infect the healthy workers we will see new infected cases  grow higher each day and tally at approx 70k by end of 3 months  .  Am I on the right computation.  How long the incumbent authorities are going to isolate the migrant workers in the dorms in cramped quarters with movement control, won't the length of times in sort of movement control would put the mental and emotional health of the migrant workers to test.  Have the incumbent authorities show solicitudes for the workers.  Can the migrant workers endure the lengthy time in isolation, may be Mr. Gan, JT, and the other taskforce members should experience a one week stay in the quarter of the dorms to have a direct experience."

Especially the patience and tolerance in allowing the citizens to still have a way of life, though limiting. Yet, be demoralized day after day by irresponsible behaviour. Even if there is to be full blown restrictions, many will still disobey and try their luck. No idea which part of this pandemic do they not understand. The fact that someone not showing symptoms can possibly infect another? The possibility of contracting pneumonia and being isolated in hospital hooked up to a ventilator to help you breath? The possibility that it can get critical and no loved ones can be with you? When all it takes is to stay home, only buy whats needed, keep a distance and come home immediately. Do the authorities have to detail everything out or even make it more strict to keep people at home? Just because last week they didnt wear a mask and nothing happened doesnt mean it cant this week. To these irresponsible people who are practically demoralizing the authorities, healthcare workers, putting them at more risk, having to chase after you, putting other citizens who want to be responsible at risk, is inappropriate. And then complain the Gov has no control? When no matter what is done, they still dont bother? People out there have familes, children and loved ones who dont want this, and neither does the Gov who is trying to protect us all. Stupidity doesnt account for bravery when risks are involved. Neither does heroism if you survive"

101582572,79793600,麻蒼葉,"Apr 6, 2020","I appreciate the efforts of the joint-ministries task force. A big thank you to all our medical, healthcare & other frontline staff (the police, contact tracing team & researchers etc.) who have helped Singapore in our fight against COVID-19.  The plans to manage the huge dormitory clusters are quite comprehensive but there is something more that can be done to halt the transmission of COVID-19 amongst the dormitory residents. Run more COVID-19 detection tests on all close contacts of current dormitory confirmed cases now, within capacity that our lab team can currently cope & run them now. Because simply confining the dormitory workers in their crammed dormitory will not prevent further COVID-19 transmission amongst the dormitory workers especially if they continue to stay together in the high density crammed conditions, now that we can almost be certain of  asymptomatic carriers who unintentionally infect others as they do not realized they are sick.  The bigger clusters is a result of dormitories having higher density   crammed. Enclosed space and closed proximity has remain the constant theme for transmission. It would be ideal if density at these dormitories are reduced significantly. But even doing so is not enough against insidious spread of COVID-19.  More can be done now to ""actively attack"" the virus transmissions at these dormitories, the top priority now is to identify & isolate any more potential infected carriers especially asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who may not realized they are carrier. Most men(which the bulk of these dormitories workers are, would probably have been more busy with their work at workplaces previously)& will tend to be less fastidious about COVID-19 prevention measures like safe distancing with others in dormitories & enhanced hygiene measures, so health officials may need to come out with programs to educate & emphasize to them the importance of personal hygiene(not touching face without thorough washing of hands with soap & water & after visiting toilets & before meals etc.)in their native languages for any who have difficulty comprehending English. Facilities owners will need to increase frequencies of toilet/bathing area cleaning at these dormitories as well.  With current developments of Singapore's own rapid test kits which we have been sharing with our neighboring countries, this is the time to ramp-up production of these accurate testing kits as there may now be a need to conduct more tests on any potentially infeyuuúcted dormitory  workers for early detection & isolation to prevent an even higher transmission numbers.  Contact Tracing/ Investigation Teams will need to work quickly to establish & identify any previous close contacts of current confirmed cases from the dormitories. We need to quickly mount a larger scale COVID-19 testing on these close contacts of the dormitories' confirmed cases. As many people may appear healthy now but they maybe rapidly infecting others. We need to be able to quickly identify & isolate any such persons from the crowded dormitories.  Please work out plans to test more of our dormitory  workers who had previous close contacts to current confirmed cases now."
