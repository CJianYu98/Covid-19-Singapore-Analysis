1.01589E+16,"COVID-19 vaccination for seniors will commence island-wide from next Monday, 22 February.

Over the next three weeks, seniors aged 70 years and above can expect to receive personalised letters inviting them to sign up for vaccination. We will start by inviting seniors living near polyclinics or vaccination centres, so that they can be conveniently vaccinated at a vaccination site near their home. All seniors will be able to receive their vaccination by mid-March when we have opened a vaccination centre in each town. We expect all the letters to reach our seniors aged 70 years and above by the first week of March.

Thereafter we will move to vaccinate the seniors aged 60 to 69 years. They will receive their invitation letters around the middle of March, and the vaccination will commence from around end-March onwards.

Upon receiving the invitation letter, seniors can register online for their vaccination at vaccine.gov.sg, and then receive an SMS with a unique link to book their vaccination appointments. Those who require assistance booking their vaccination appointments can bring their invitation letter to any community centre/club from today.

We will also be setting up more vaccination centres. By the middle of March, 31 vaccination centres will be in operation, with at least one vaccination centre in each town. In total, there will eventually be around 40 vaccination centres. These centres, together with the polyclinics and selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), will ensure that every Singaporean and long-term resident in Singapore who is medically eligible can receive their vaccinations conveniently.

Vaccination is critical to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19. This collective protection will become more effective as more people are vaccinated and is a key enabler allowing us to return to normalcy. We strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated when your turn comes, so that as a society, we can keep each other safe from the disease.

In the next few days, seniors above 70 years old will progressively receive notification to book appointments for their Covid-19 vaccination. Since late January, selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) across the island have been providing COVID-19 vaccination to healthcare workers.

The PHPCs have been playing an integral role in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, from providing subsidised consultation and treatment for acute respiratory infections to conducting COVID-19 swab tests to help us quickly detect cases.

As we ramp up our vaccination efforts, some of these will now play a new role as vaccination sites. These selected PHPCs, along with our 20 polyclinics and vaccination centres, ensure that everyone has convenient and easy access to COVID-19 vaccination.

Vaccination is crucial in protecting ourselves and our loved ones against COVID-19, as well as others who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. When your turn comes, I strongly encourage you to get vaccinated if you are medically eligible! This collective protection will become more effective as more of us are vaccinated and will enable us to return to normalcy.

Good news! We received our first shipment of Moderna vaccines this afternoon. This follows another batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that arrived this morning. These shipments will enable us to progressively roll out our vaccination programme, with vaccination for seniors in the community set to begin later next week.

More vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech will arrive over the coming months. We will continue to monitor our supplies closely, to meet our target of vaccinating all Singaporeans and long-term residents by the end of this year.

Spring to Health This Chinese New Year

Koh Poh Koon - 许宝琨
11 February at 08:00 ·

Happy New Year in the Year of the Ox! 牛年大吉！Here’s wishing all Singaporeans good health and happiness over the festive season.

It wouldn’t be Chinese New Year without our favourite treats and snacks. With some simple modifications, you can still enjoy them while keeping your health in check. When shopping for treats, choose those with the Healthier Choice Symbol as these have less sugar, salt or fat. Or prepare a healthier Yu Sheng (raw fish salad) with less oil, sauce and flour crisps. (Remember to wear a face mask while tossing Yu Sheng! And recite the usual auspicious phrases during Lohei in your heart but not aloud). You can also use healthier and/or fresh ingredients for your reunion dinner like wholegrains, lean meat, fish and vegetables.

This HealthHub article has more great ideas on how you can keep to a balanced diet even during the celebrations: https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/194/spring_to_health_CNY

Do also stay safe during this festive period by keeping to the CNY safe management measures. Connecting digitally with your family and friends is encouraged, but if you’re going on physical visits, there is a cap of 8 visitors per household per day. Keep your house visits to family members and to not more than 2 other households a day.

You’re already familiar with these measures too: when dining out, wear a mask when not eating or drinking, and keep your voices down. Don’t make multiple table bookings (applicable to reunion dinners too), except for those from the same household, and even then, there shouldn’t be inter-mingling across tables.

By keeping to these measures, we can still enjoy our CNY celebrations while doing our part to keep the virus at bay!

新年快乐！牛年大吉！祝福所有国人身体健康，大家佳节期间都过得开开心心！

这几天如果没有吃到我们最喜爱的美食和零食, 就感觉不像在过年。其实你只须要做一些简单的调整，就可以健康地享用这些新年美食。在选购这类新年美食的时候，请记得找那些贴有“较健康选择”标签的食品，因为这些食品有比较少的糖、盐或者脂肪。如果要捞鱼生，也可以选择较健康的版本，少油、少酱料、少炸脆饼。大家也要记得捞起时还是要戴着口罩，在心中默念贺词，而不要大声说出来。大家吃团圆饭时也可以选择较健康或新鲜的食材，例如全谷类、瘦肉、鱼肉和蔬菜等。

你可以阅读这篇文章，了解如何在喜迎佳节时，做到饮食均衡。https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/194/spring_to_health_CNY

假节期间，大家也要保障彼此的安全，遵守相关的安全管制措施。我们希望鼓励大家通过上网或虚拟的方式与亲友保持联系。如果你选择出外拜年，每户家庭每天只能接待最多八名访客。请尽可能只去和自己的家人亲戚拜年，一天内也不要去超过两户家庭拜年。

大家对其他的措施应该已经非常熟悉了，包括出外用餐时，如果不是在吃东西或喝饮料就应该继续戴着口罩，也要控制自己的声量。如果你不是同住的家人，就不能预定超过一张餐桌的位子，包括吃团圆饭也不行。就算是同住的家人，也不应该在不同餐桌之间来回。

大家配合遵守这些措施，我们欢庆佳节的同时，也能尽一份力去抑制病毒的传播。",11/2/2021 17:06,,,,,51,3,0,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158891441500631,[],10158891441500600

It is important that everyone remain vigilant and adhere to the safe management measures. The number of visitors per household per day is limited to 8 distinct persons. We encourage everyone to connect digitally with their family and friends instead of going on physical visits. For those who plan to do house visits, they should limit their visits to family members and to not more than 2 other households a day. Face masks must be worn during lohei, and there should not be any verbalisation of the usual auspicious phrases. If we all play our part, we can continue to keep the number of cases in our community low.

If you feel unwell during the festivities, we encourage you to visit your GP or a 24-hour clinic for minor, self-limiting conditions. Seek medical treatment at a hospital’s Accident & Emergency (A&E) department only for serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness, and uncontrollable bleeding.

If you have symptoms of an acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose) as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, you are strongly encouraged to visit a PHPC and get swabbed early when advised by your doctor. It is important to test for COVID-19 early for early detection, management and containment to prevent further spread of the disease, to help protect your loved ones and vulnerable members of the community.

1.01589E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the global COVID-19 situation and will tighten border measures for travellers from Vietnam, given the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam. At the same time, with the improvement in the COVID-19 situation in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, we will adjust our border measures for travellers from NSW, Australia. In addition, to minimise the risk of potential incubating cases leaking into the community for travellers, we will tighten border measures for the Business Travel Pass (BTP) scheme.

From 12 February 2021, 2359 hours, Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs) and Long-Term Pass holders entering Singapore with travel history to Vietnam within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore, will be subject to an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, and a PCR test before the end of the SHN period. Short-term travellers holding an Air Travel Pass (ATP) with travel history to Vietnam within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore, will not be allowed to enter Singapore. All travellers who are not SCs or PRs will need to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure. These travellers will still be required to undergo an On-Arrival Test (OAT) and serve their SHN upon arrival and be tested at the end of SHN.

From 10 February 2021, 2359 hours, SCs, PRs and Long-Term Pass holders returning from NSW, Australia will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at the airport in lieu of a 7-day SHN, and if the result is negative, they will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore. Short-term visitors travelling from NSW, Australia can also apply for an ATP for entry into Singapore on or after 16 February 2021.

Travellers on the BTP scheme are now required to undergo COVID-19 PCR Tests on Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14 of their return. An additional serology test will also be required on Day 3.

As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community.

I visited the COVID-19 vaccination centre at the former Hong Kah Secondary School yesterday and saw that the operations are proceeding well. A team of doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants from Parkway Shenton, which runs the vaccination centre, have been working closely to ensure a smooth process. Beyond the day-to-day operation, the team is also constantly looking at how to improve the experience for those coming in for their vaccinations, from planning for contingencies to minimising wait times and exploring how to ensure the centre is accessible for the elderly.

Our vaccination centres, alongside our polyclinics and selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics, will allow us to scale up our vaccination efforts as we progressively vaccinate our entire population. Each vaccination centre is able to perform 2,000 vaccinations per day on average. We will be setting up around 40 vaccination centres to ensure that everyone can be conveniently vaccinated. They will be located in high population catchment areas as well as along public transport routes for greater accessibility.

Getting vaccinated is critical to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19. When your turn comes, we encourage you to get vaccinated, so that as a society, we can keep each other safe from COVID-19.",5/2/2021 18:55,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/146814139_3727239904008824_3042811947029256770_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=nC77rAV_efoAX83vRRH&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=5d5d64904e3dca57595cd6147f3bf46a&oe=6054A331,,,,240,21,12,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158874976670631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/146814139_3727239904008824_3042811947029256770_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=nC77rAV_efoAX83vRRH&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=5d5d64904e3dca57595cd6147f3bf46a&oe=6054A331', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/147340154_3727239954008819_8559475817346885534_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=ex10GOAhtL8AX8Gn1fG&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=8e646731bb09b366d41f477e5ca4e808&oe=6055CBEC', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/146285413_3727240004008814_6266175746124511999_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=oFdipFDs-loAX-w-BU0&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=ce40f02cd87c8d68f015fbad4bd60a0f&oe=6056C949']",10158874976670600

Today is World Cancer Day. This year’s theme is #IAmAndIWill, which recognises that our commitment to act is key to progress in reducing the impact of cancer.

The Global Burden of Disease 2019 study found that cancer was the leading cause of mortality and ill health in Singapore. As cancer risk increases with age, the number of people with cancer would rise as our population ages.

An important part of fighting cancer is early detection and treatment, through regular screening. Our national screening programme Screen for Life provides subsidies for cervical, colorectal and breast cancer screenings for eligible individuals, to make screening affordable and accessible. The best time to go for screening is when you still feel fine, so do check out https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/61/Screen_for_Life for more information.

Moving upstream, continued innovation and research are crucial in the fight against cancer. Cancer remains one of the priority disease areas of our Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 (RIE2025) plans, and the National Medical Research Council provides funding for programmes to advance our knowledge of various cancers and discover better ways to treat patients.

We will continue to support these programmes, to create better health outcomes for Singaporeans in the long run.",4/2/2021 19:33,,,,,40,0,3,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158872125415631,[],10158872125415600

With a Degree in Mathematics and Engineering and a Master of Science in Smart Product Design, Mr Jason Lim made an atypical career choice when he became an Occupational Therapist.

Jason spent most of his career outside of healthcare. He started out as an aircraft technician, before working as an engineer. Later on, as a researcher, he had many conversations with patients on how they were coping with their illnesses, and he was deeply inspired by their determination and strength. At the same time, he also volunteered to tutor children with cancer.

These experiences nudged him towards a career in healthcare. He found out about the healthcare Professional Conversion Programmes, and with encouragement from his wife, applied for the Professional Conversion Programme for Occupational Therapists (PCP-OT). He graduated in 2018, and began his journey as an Occupational Therapist at Ren Ci Hospital where he works now.

Jason said his switch was not without its challenges, but his passion for his work never wavered. “When work gets tough, I do ask myself why I made the switch. However at the end of the day, I still enjoy providing the therapy sessions, interacting with the patients and seeing them achieve their goals,” Jason shared.

If you are keen to make a mid-career switch into healthcare like Jason, consider applying for the Professional Conversion Programme for Allied Health Professionals (PCP-AHPs). Applications are open until 19 March, and these programmes provide training for mid-career PMETs to become a Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist (OT) or a Diagnostic Radiographer. In addition to the current Accelerated PCP for Physiotherapy, we will be introducing a new Accelerated PCP-OT degree programme from this year, where eligible candidates will be able to complete their degree in three years instead of four.

You can find out more about the PCP here: https://go.gov.sg/pcp-ahp.

1.01589E+16,"The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) granted an interim authorisation today under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to be used in Singapore for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals aged 18 years and above. Its review of available clinical data found that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the known risks, and the vaccine demonstrated a high vaccine efficacy of 94%.

The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has also independently reviewed the vaccine’s safety and efficacy data for different population segments in Singapore, and endorsed HSA's recommendation of the suitability of use in individuals aged 18 years and above.

The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is the second COVID-19 vaccine to be authorised for pandemic use by HSA, after the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. We will progressively roll out the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for individuals aged 18 years and above when shipments of the vaccine arrive. We expect the first shipment to arrive around March 2021, if there are no disruptions to the shipment schedule. More vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech will arrive over the course of the year. We will continue to monitor our supplies closely to ensure that we will have enough vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore by the third quarter of 2021.

As of 2 February 2021, more than 175,000 individuals have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. About 6,000 of them have also received their second dose of the vaccine, and completed the full vaccination regimen.

Vaccination is critical to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19. Vaccination also protects those in our community who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. While COVID-19 vaccination will be voluntary, we strongly encourage everyone who is medically eligible for vaccination to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered, to better protect ourselves and our loved ones.

29 January at 09:33 · Singapore ·

Got my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at Singapore General Hospital this morning. With that I have completed the full vaccination regimen.

Just like my first jab, it was quick and painless. The doctors watched me for 30 minutes afterwards, just in case. Happy to share that I feel fine.

We are ramping up the vaccine programme and opening more vaccination centres. Do go for your vaccination when your turn comes. It will protect not only yourself, but also your family, friends and everyone you come in contact with. – LHL

1.01589E+16,"MOH and Health Sciences Authority are closely monitoring the safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as it is being administered to our population.

Among the more than 113,000 individuals who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, there were three reported cases of anaphylaxis that were quickly resolved by our healthcare professionals. As all vaccinated persons in Singapore are closely monitored, the symptoms in these three individuals were promptly detected and treated. All have recovered from the episode and were discharged from the hospital after a day’s observation or treatment.

Currently, the benefits of getting vaccinated to protect oneself from the effects of severe COVID-19 disease and its complications far outweigh the risk of any potential adverse events known to be associated with vaccination. MOH and HSA will continue to work with the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination to closely monitor the safety of the vaccine and ensure the vaccines used in Singapore are safe for our population groups, as we roll out our vaccination programme.

While we expect few to need this, MOH will nevertheless introduce a vaccine injury financial assistance programme for COVID-19 vaccination to provide financial assistance for affected persons in the rare event of serious side effects that are assessed to be related to COVID-19 vaccines administered in Singapore. This programme will give a greater peace of mind for those taking the vaccination.

To ensure that seniors can conveniently receive their vaccinations, we will set up more vaccination centres over the next few weeks to ensure that everyone can conveniently receive their vaccinations. To support the start of vaccination for seniors, we have set up a new vaccination centre at Tanjong Pagar Community Centre from 27 January, while Teck Ghee Community Centre will also be operational from 1 February. Come 1 February, all 20 polyclinics across Singapore will also begin offering COVID-19 vaccinations. To reach out to seniors with mobility issues and hence may find it challenging to visit a vaccination site in-person, we will set up mobile vaccination teams to deliver the vaccines to these individuals.

Vaccination is critical to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19. We strongly encourage Singaporeans and long-term residents to come forward for vaccination when their turn comes, so that as a society, we can keep each other safe from the disease.

I was happy to be part of a panel discussion at the Singapore Perspectives 2021 Conference where the central topic of discussion was on the vision of politics we have for Singapore in 2030.

The politics of our country is determined by our people and the values we hold. In the years ahead, the partnership between citizens and the Government will play an even larger role to achieve our shared ideals and aspirations. We will need to continue having open discussions on various issues to recognise the diversity of opinions and be productive in seeking common ground and solutions.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a test of our values. We came together as a country to fight the pandemic on various fronts - our healthcare and social workers have been stepping up to help those in need, we recognise the sacrifices of our front-liners as we rightfully should, we are looking into ways to help those whose livelihoods are affected by the pandemic and, at the same time, we are looking at the opportunities brought about by the pandemic. The unity, resolve and adaptability of our people give me hope for Singapore.

Years from now, I hope that we are able to look back at 2021 and recognise that we were in a bright spot in terms of our politics, economy, social issues and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and be an even brighter spot in 2030.",26/1/2021 11:26,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/140747699_3700150840051064_8081657175037178394_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=43GY5-gbe4MAX_ZHoFe&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=569920f5a354e9f4527ea034f7a1097f&oe=60553537,,,,116,2,5,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158839501150631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/140747699_3700150840051064_8081657175037178394_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=43GY5-gbe4MAX_ZHoFe&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=569920f5a354e9f4527ea034f7a1097f&oe=60553537'],10158839501150600

I visited the Community Care Apartments exhibition held at HDB Hub today with Sim Ann 沈颖 and Amy Khor and was happy to meet with some participants of the focus group discussions that were held earlier to gather feedback on this new public housing concept. We had a lively discussion and I was encouraged to learn that our seniors like the concept of communal living, with opportunities for social interaction – essentially fostering a ‘kampung spirit’.

Our seniors have also shared that they prefer to age-in-place independently within communities that they are familiar with – an aspiration that the Community Care Apartments aims to fulfil. To provide frailer seniors who need some support, there will be a Shared Caregiving Service too, a unique feature of the Community Care Apartments that provides round-the-clock assistance for seniors with moderate disability, as well as medical reminders and assistance with simple errands. To ensure such services are affordable and accessible, we will provide eligible seniors with up to 80% means-tested subsidies to offset the monthly service cost.

Glad to know that the exhibition has received healthy interest since its launch and I invite you to drop by to take a look too.

8 visitors a day and no shouting while tossing yusheng: 8 ways CNY will be different this year

Koh Poh Koon - 许宝琨
23 January at 11:00 ·

Chinese New Year celebrations this year will be a little different, and we seek Singaporeans’ understanding to work together to mitigate the increased transmission risks in the community during this period.

Why not connect digitally with family and friends instead of going on physical visits? If you’re going on house visits, take note that there will be a cap of 8 visitors per household per day from 26 January 2021. This is aimed at further mitigating the risk of large community clusters arising from infections that spread within a household and through them to all their contacts. When going on house visits, limit your visits to family members and to not more than 2 other households a day.

Social gatherings outside the house will remain at a maximum of 8 people for now, but keep your social circle small instead of mixing with multiple social groups.

When dining out this CNY, do wear a mask when you’re not eating or drinking, and keep your voices down. While tossing yusheng, wear face masks and don’t verbalise the usual auspicious phrases during lohei. The current rules at F&B establishments will also apply to reunion dinners – there must not be any multiple table bookings, except for those from the same household. But even in such instances, there should not be any inter-mingling across tables.

As we get ready to usher in the Lunar New Year, let’s continue to play our part to keep our loved ones safe!

下个月，我们即将迎来农历新年，大家按习俗会到亲戚朋友家拜年，也会吃团圆饭。但今年的新年会和以往有点不同。我们希望这段期间可以得到大家的谅解，一同努力降低冠病病毒在社区里传播的风险。

大家何不尝试在佳节期间，通过数码的方式和亲友联络感情，而不用特地到他们的家里拜年？如果你还是选择要去拜年，也请大家注意，从1月26日起，每户家庭每天只能接待最多八名访客。这个限制是要尽可能避免病毒从一个家庭里，传到其他的社交接触者，然后有大规模传染群的形成，所以大家去拜年的话，请限制自己只去亲戚家，而且一天内，最多只能探访另外两户家庭。

在住家外的社交聚会，人数顶限目前会维持在八人，但也恳请大家，尽量把社交圈子维持在小规模，不要和多个不同的群体交际。

新年期间出外时，如果不是在吃东西或喝东西，请把你的口罩戴上。在外用餐时也尽量控制声量。捞鱼生时也要戴上口罩，不要大声说出祝语。餐饮场所目前的限制，也适用于团圆饭。包括不能预约超过一桌，除非你是同住的一家人。但是，就算是同住的一家人，餐桌之间也不应该来回交流。

在我们准备农历新年之际，请大家要继续尽本分，保护我们彼此的至亲的安全和健康。",23/1/2021 20:46,,,,,125,6,15,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158827883670631,[],10158827883670600

The recent community cases remind us that the war against COVID-19 is far from over. With Chinese New Year coming up, we have decided to tighten up to keep everyone safe.

Starting next Tuesday, each household may only receive eight visitors per day. If you are visiting others, please limit yourself to visiting two households a day, and visit family members only. If tossing yusheng, please keep your masks on and don’t shout out the auspicious phrases – say them in your hearts instead.

These stricter measures will surely disappoint all of us looking forward to celebrating CNY. But we must psychologically prepare ourselves to celebrate CNY differently this year. Just look at the countries near and far experiencing repeated surges in cases, and you will see why we need to stay vigilant.

It’s exactly 1 year since our first confirmed COVID-19 case in Singapore. The year has gone by at breakneck pace, as we all struggled to cope with the unprecedented chaos and disruption to our lives. Through immense effort and sacrifice, we’ve got ourselves to a stable situation. Our vaccination programme is underway, with seniors starting to get their shots next week.

Let us continue to protect ourselves and our loved ones by adhering to all the measures. – LHL

<Tightened Safe Management Measures>

It has been nearly a month since we entered Phase 3. We had anticipated then that there could be more cases in the community due to increased activities; and that we would need continued adjustments to our measures.

Indeed in the recent two weeks, new cases and clusters have emerged. They are likely the result of increased activities over the year-end period (typically new cases present themselves with a 1-2 week lag). Our vulnerabilities have gone up, and we cannot afford to take any chances. The situation can escalate rapidly especially with Chinese New Year coming up soon. Remember cases spiked after CNY last year, and we had many clusters then linked to CNY activities and gatherings.

So we are making a pre-emptive move now to tighten our measures. Under the current rule, home visits are allowed for up to 8 visitors at any time. From 26 Jan onwards, we will limit such visits to 8 distinct visitors per household per day. For those who are planning to go out visiting, we strongly advise that you minimise your physical gatherings. In particular over the CNY period, visit your family members only, and do not exceed more than two visits per day.

When dining out, keep your masks on if you are not eating/drinking, and refrain from singing or talking loudly. So during the lohei, masks must remain on, and there should be no shouting of auspicious phrases. For reunion dinners, keep to one table of not more than 8 pax and ensure there are no multiple table bookings, or intermingling across tables.

I know many will be disappointed at these new restrictions especially over the festive season. But I hope everyone understands why they are necessary. The virus is raging everywhere in the world. Many places in Asia that have successfully controlled the infection are now seeing a rise in cases. Places like China, Taiwan and Hong Kong have all imposed curbs on their CNY celebrations.

Likewise, we must be mentally prepared that CNY this year will not be the same as before. It will be quieter and more subdued. We will need to stay disciplined and vigilant. I seek everyone’s cooperation on these new measures. If we all do our part, we can continue to keep the infection under control until we roll out our vaccination programme and get everyone in Singapore vaccinated.",23/1/2021 1:15,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/139873998_4913901448651159_1066664831674527737_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=d3UWbjIbqkwAX-Zer0z&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=652d69ad75a2baa39e049228f0ac65c7&oe=60567A19,,,,775,42,145,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158825653675631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/139873998_4913901448651159_1066664831674527737_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=d3UWbjIbqkwAX-Zer0z&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=652d69ad75a2baa39e049228f0ac65c7&oe=60567A19'],10158825653675600

1.01588E+16,"We have made good progress in our COVID-19 vaccination programme. As of 22 January, more than 60,000 individuals have received their first dose of the vaccine.

From 27 January 2021, we will commence vaccination for seniors, starting with pilots in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar, where larger numbers of our seniors reside. The aim of these pilots is to enable us to iron out all the operational processes before scaling up nationwide. Vaccinations will be progressively extended to seniors across the island from mid-February 2021. More vaccination centres will be set up over the next few weeks to ensure that all seniors can conveniently receive their vaccinations at a centre near to where they live.

All seniors will receive personalised letters inviting them to make an appointment for their vaccinations. They will be able to make appointments online, or they can also visit selected Community Centres near them to book an appointment in-person. Community volunteers from the People's Association, as well as our Silver Generation Ambassadors, will be conducting house visits and tapping on existing grassroots events, to answer queries and help our seniors to book an appointment if necessary.

Vaccination is critical to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19. Vaccination also protects those in our community who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. This collective protection will become more effective as more people are vaccinated and is a key enabler allowing us to return to normalcy. https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/tightening-safe-management-measures-and-update-on-vaccination-plans

This will take effect from 26 January 2021. Individuals should also limit themselves to visiting at most two other households a day, as much as possible.

We will also step up enforcement checks at F&B establishments, malls and other crowded public spaces during the upcoming Chinese New Year period. Strict enforcement actions will be taken against individuals and operators who do not comply with safe management measure.

As community interactions are likely to increase in the leadup to Chinese New Year, we will carry out surveillance testing for stallholders, shop owners, persons in the food and beverage industry, as well as food delivery persons, who are operating in and around Chinatown. The testing will take place from 8 February to 9 February 2021.

We seek the cooperation of all Singaporeans to remain united and disciplined in our fight against COVID-19. Observe all safe management measures, see a doctor and get tested when sick, and be vaccinated when it is offered to you. Together, we can look forward to a safer and healthier 2021.

We are seeing more new infected cases in the community in recent days. For the first time in several months we have a local cluster linked to a police para-vet. Unfortunately there were also several recent cases who did not seek medical treatment despite falling ill with flu-like symptoms.

Our contact tracers are working hard to identify all the possible contacts, ring-fence the potential cases and prevent them from spreading further. We are also monitoring the situation carefully and considering if additional measures are necessary to ensure the infection remains under control.

Meanwhile please cooperate with all the safe management measures - wear your masks, see a doctor when sick, and do your part to reduce transmission risks. The virus is still circulating silently within our community and we cannot afford to let our guard down.

SingHealth Polyclinics - Punggol Polyclinic Vaccination Centre. Several staff walked me through the process. Our polyclinics will ensure a smooth process for vaccinations.

Senior Staff Nurse Tan Lay Kian, as a vaccine administrator, helps to ensure that the vaccines are prepared properly, and keeps a steady hand when administering the vaccine. Prior to vaccination, her colleague Senior Enrolled Nurse Ms Siti Hajar Binte Kamarudin screens arriving patients to ensure they are medically eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. Another colleague, Enrolled Nurse Ms Nurul Sakinah Binte Amir Hamzah, monitors patients during their 30-minute observation period. They work as a closely knit team with their colleagues at the clinic.

From 24 January 2021, 2359 hours, all travellers, including Singapore Citizens (SC) and Permanent Residents (PR), will need to take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore. The prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements, including the PCR test at the end of the SHN, will continue.

From 18 January 2021, 2359 hours, until further notice, all returning SCs and PRs from the UK and South Africa will be subject to an additional 7-day self-isolation at their place of residence, following their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities.

From 31 January 2021, 2359 hours, visitors applying to enter Singapore under the Air Travel Pass and Reciprocal Green Lanes will need to have travel insurance for their COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000.

The COVID-19 pandemic has irrevocably changed the way we live and work, including the way we do business. But we should continue to find new ways to adapt and thrive in the new normal. I had the opportunity to hear from representatives from various healthcare and biomedical companies in Singapore about the challenges they face and to explore solutions to overcome them together, at the Emerging Stronger Conversation organised by MTI yesterday. This was part of a session hosted by DPM to engage the business community on the broader strategy moving forward.

In our exchanges, we talked about encouraging public-private partnerships to help companies internationalise and develop new care models; and supporting closer collaborations between local healthcare and biomedical companies. We also discussed a range of topics, including digitalising healthcare for future healthcare delivery; attracting global healthcare talent while continuing to cultivate our local core to drive innovation; and how regulators and regulations can catalyse medical technology innovation.

I would like to thank the representatives from the healthcare and biomedical companies for the fruitful discussion. The exchange yesterday has allowed us to better understand the challenges ahead, and identify opportunities and how we can stay nimble and ultimately emerge stronger together.",15/1/2021 10:46,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/138779926_5592228597469781_8541902765531580814_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=6mUkdLdc5hIAX_06Yiw&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=5243c0981fd62b587cdc73c81494028a&oe=6055E5B9,,,,149,4,0,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158804388160631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/138779926_5592228597469781_8541902765531580814_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=6mUkdLdc5hIAX_06Yiw&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=5243c0981fd62b587cdc73c81494028a&oe=6055E5B9'],10158804388160600

Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 not only protects yourself but also your loved ones.

This was the key reason why Ms Mabel Ong, Deputy Director of Nursing Administration at National University Polyclinics, decided to take the vaccination. Ms Ong was vaccinated yesterday by her colleague Senior Staff Nurse Kim Rui Ning, who was vaccinated last week, as part of the progressive rollout of vaccinations in our public health institutions.

In line with the recommendations of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, healthcare workers and COVID-19 frontline workers are prioritised for vaccination as they are at higher risk of being infected by COVID-19 and hence most in need of COVID-19 vaccination.

Vaccination is a key strategy in our fight against COVID-19, along with safe management measures, contact tracing, and testing. While vaccination is voluntary, we need to have as many people vaccinated as possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and protect those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons.

We strongly encourage you to get vaccinated when your turn comes, to protect yourself, and your loved ones. Let’s work together for a safer and healthier 2021.",13/1/2021 20:39,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136376878_3666027883463360_1452037111360677190_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=zpu9AHe8EtgAX_y4_71&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=34d580345c929ab9b1690ea8c316e239&oe=605722C7,,,,953,16,56,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158800124305631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136376878_3666027883463360_1452037111360677190_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=zpu9AHe8EtgAX_y4_71&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=34d580345c929ab9b1690ea8c316e239&oe=605722C7', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136400058_3666027920130023_853161025450570882_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=e-6vOvhw9QMAX8sG-eM&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=3da5f0958e6fe346da17062790273694&oe=60583587', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/137039099_3666027943463354_2292168656753996909_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=v13WaSeXzsMAX_AYsuT&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=3c34559f2425e1e24ba44842888d2b86&oe=605791DE', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/137332366_3666028046796677_2019052938850311699_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=YKZYvFf-EdMAX8zWl7z&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=d1bc23b700bd6932b3eecd506d2a8c1b&oe=6054EB41']",10158800124305600
1.01588E+16,"To support Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts, the government is setting up four COVID-19 vaccination centres this month, starting with two – located at Changi Airport Terminal 4 and Raffles City Convention Centre – which have started operations today. Two more vaccination centres, located at the former Hong Kah Secondary School and Woodlands Galaxy Community Centre, will be ready for operations next week.

We expect to set up more vaccination centres over time to support the vaccination efforts. We are on track to have another four vaccination centres by the end of February. These centres, together with polyclinics and selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics, will ensure that every Singaporean and long-term resident here who is medically eligible can receive their vaccinations conveniently.

We have started vaccinating our healthcare workers and frontline workers, including those at our border entry points and those involved in the COVID-19 response. As of 12 Jan, more than 6,200 individuals have received their first dose of the vaccine. These numbers are expected to rise substantially in the coming weeks as we continue to ramp up our vaccination operations. On 12 Jan alone, we vaccinated close to 2,800 individuals, including around 2,500 healthcare workers.

This afternoon, Multi-Ministry Taskforce Co-chairs Gan Kim Yong and Lawrence Wong visited Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital (KWSH) to observe the vaccination operations, and joined healthcare workers at KWSH to receive the COVID-19 vaccination.

Later this month, we will also progressively commence vaccination for seniors. Letters will be progressively sent to seniors to invite them to book an appointment for their vaccination. Residents and clients in the community care sector will also progressively be vaccinated.

We are making provision for all Singaporeans and long-term residents here to be able to get vaccinated by the third quarter of 2021, if there are no unforeseen disruptions to vaccine shipments. Vaccination will be progressively rolled out and is voluntary. We strongly encourage everyone in Singapore who is medically eligible to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered to you so that as a society, we can keep one another safe from COVID-19.

In the meantime, let’s stay vigilant and disciplined in our fight against COVID-19, by continuing to observe safe distancing and safe management measures and wearing a mask when out of the home.",13/1/2021 18:22,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136375946_10158799903225631_4618900220272400347_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=EgiwnXzKuG4AX_OmNS3&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=10c2e540d9b86280a1036106d6ab54d1&oe=6056F11A,,,,7297,227,0,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158799922900631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136375946_10158799903225631_4618900220272400347_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=EgiwnXzKuG4AX_OmNS3&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=10c2e540d9b86280a1036106d6ab54d1&oe=6056F11A', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/137256932_10158799903440631_4535906341536289281_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=b9v6GmiAWwIAX-eJXdy&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b5a46e4c9c1e8de86e280871de03ee92&oe=60567267', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136767084_10158799903545631_7915750713563837974_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=zcHkdcmFVUoAX_ZUwra&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=2b3ebf673896628fab57a514f95c72db&oe=605640D4', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136675095_10158799903905631_6318190878628332924_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Q3pKwimoCdsAX950eyV&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=757ccf33403d29763730c29c9eda9ed3&oe=60571A8D']",10158799922900600

The Ministry of Health, Singapore launched the Action Plan for Successful Ageing in 2015, a national blueprint for population ageing. This year, we’re working to refresh the Action Plan, and we want to hear more from you and to tap on your insight and ideas to co-create initiatives and programmes so that we can continue to make Singapore a great place to age in together.

We kickstarted our first Focus Group Discussion (FGD) session on the Action Plan yesterday – and what a fruitful discussion we had! 💪 Many of you at the session shared your aspirations for a Singapore that cares for our seniors, an empathetic and enabling society that is able to walk in our seniors’ shoes while bringing our resources together to plan for ageing early. Many of you also expressed your desire to help seniors with mental health conditions, such as by ensuring that there is infrastructural support for seniors with dementia and their caregivers.

I’m very encouraged by the ideas shared today, and heartened to hear how some of you have stepped up to support seniors in your own ways. Your ideas, energy and commitment are critical to making Singapore a better place to age in, and the Government will work with you, together, to provide support to our seniors. A whole-of-society effort will help us to build an inclusive society that celebrates and embraces our seniors.

There will be more FGD sessions on the Ageing Plan in the next 2 months, where we will continue to seek views and co-create initiatives and programmes with many other participants. For those who joined the FGD yesterday, I encourage you to step forward and start deeper conversations with one another beyond today’s session. And to everyone else, I want to encourage you to join the conversation in your own way, whether with your family and friends, or in your workplace or neighbourhood.

Look forward to having more of you join this conversation in the coming weeks!",12/1/2021 14:31,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/137270281_1726834447477565_5927166361835264166_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=tsRv6F3H4J8AX8dsoiP&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=17595e3f698f763fb60ebfc998981c17&oe=6056D318,,,,65,0,0,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158797397345631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/137270281_1726834447477565_5927166361835264166_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=tsRv6F3H4J8AX8dsoiP&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=17595e3f698f763fb60ebfc998981c17&oe=6056D318', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136642065_1726834427477567_232732342641248484_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=3daSnmzMu7kAX-2cH1g&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=db27722ce8ab18382511566cd9703e0d&oe=6057E158']",10158797397345600

The first vaccinations for nursing home staff started today, beginning with Ren Ci @ Bukit Batok St. 52. Other nursing homes and intermediate and long-term care (ILTC) providers will also progressively start vaccinations for their own staff in the coming weeks.

Our colleagues in the nursing homes and ILTC sector have been working hard in the past year to ensure continuity of care for our seniors throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and I’ve been encouraged by the tremendous efforts and sacrifices made. Many of them are in direct contact with our seniors, who are vulnerable to severe complications should they fall ill with COVID-19. Hence staff across the nursing homes and ILTC sector are prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination, so they can be protected and have an additional line of defence as they continue to serve and care for our senior loved ones.

COVID-19 vaccination is a critical aspect of our fight to tackle COVID-19. While it is voluntary, I strongly encourage everyone who is medically eligible for vaccination to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered to you, so that we can protect ourselves and our loved ones against COVID-19.

Meanwhile, let’s stay vigilant and disciplined in our fight against COVID-19, by continuing to observe safe distancing and safe management measures and wearing a mask when out of the home.

Yesterday, I joined clinicians and experts in maternal and child metabolic health at a conference organised by KK Women's and Children's Hospital to discuss the importance of promoting healthy lifestyle habits in children, mothers and mothers-to-be.

In recent years, more children are becoming overweight, putting them at risk of future health issues, such as diabetes, in adulthood. The probability of childhood obesity also increases when a mother is overweight before pregnancy. Nudging healthy behaviours earlier in the lives of children, their mothers, and mothers-to-be, can lead to more health benefits in the long-term, such as increasing the number of years lived in good health.

Over the past few decades, Singapore has made good progress in maternal and child health.

If you’ve been using MediSave500 to pay for your chronic disease treatment, you could benefit from the higher withdrawal limits that kicked in yesterday. As part of our efforts to keep outpatient and primary care affordable for Singaporeans, the Ministry of Health, Singapore launched the MediSave700 scheme on 1 Jan 2021, to raise the yearly withdrawal limit from $500 to $700 for patients with complex chronic conditions. As many as 176,000 patients will benefit.

The new $700 limit applies to those who have had visits for two or more conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Plan (CDMP), or one CDMP condition with complications within a year. The CDMP covers 20 chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, stroke and depression.

Under MediSave500 and MediSave700, you can use MediSave for other existing approved treatments, such as vaccinations and health screenings. You can also continue to tap on your own and family members' MediSave accounts, up to your own annual withdrawal limit.

We will continue to ensure that MediSave withdrawal limits remain adequate for Singaporeans.

As part of our efforts to help patients make more informed decisions about their care options in the private healthcare sector, the Ministry of Health, Singapore has published the Fee Benchmarks Advisory Committee’s (FBAC) recommendations on reasonable ranges for anaesthetist fees for about 190 procedures, and doctors’ inpatient attendance fees for their consultations and reviews of patients in different ward settings.

The fee benchmarks will give patients and payers, such as insurers, more complete information on the reasonable range of doctors’ fees for surgeries and hospital stays. They will also serve as a guide for private sector healthcare providers to charge appropriately.

Importantly, this latest move facilitates the delinking of private anaesthetists' fees from surgeon fees to better reflect the scope and complexity in managing anaesthetic risks in surgery. While anaesthesia fees have commonly been set as a proportion of surgeon fees, anaesthetists can now determine their own fees based on the risks associated with the surgery and any added complexity arising from the patient’s condition, independent of the complexity of the surgery.

Thank you to the members of the FBAC for your time and contributions in making this possible, and to all stakeholders who provided feedback through the numerous consultation sessions. The FBAC worked hard to ensure that the benchmarks reflect a fair range of professional fees that are representative of the risks and effort undertaken by doctors, while at the same time, ensuring that fees charged are fair and reasonable.

The latest fee benchmarks, together with the surgeon fee benchmarks for common surgical procedures published by MOH in 2018, will provide the public, the healthcare providers, as well as the insurers transparency, clarity and guidance. It is part of our larger strategy to ensure that healthcare costs remain affordable and our healthcare system sustainable.

As 2021 beckons, it’s also an opportune time to take stock of the year’s happenings. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a far-reaching impact globally. Locally, our government agencies, including the Ministry of Health, Singapore have spared no effort in keeping Singaporeans safe from the virus.

While MOH’s focus was taken up substantially by COVID-19 efforts, we have also been driving other developments to better the health and lives of Singaporeans.

Since joining MOH, I’ve had the opportunity to work on effecting legal changes to build greater trust in the doctor-patient relationship; extending MediShield Life coverage to better support patients for large hospitalisation bills; and growing our healthcare workforce with new job opportunities. I’ve also met with important stakeholders like the Traditional Chinese Medicine community, General Practitioner leaders and fellow medical practitioners to foster closer partnerships and thank them for their hard work.

The coming year ahead will pose new challenges, but I’ve no doubt that with the resilience that Singaporeans have shown thus far, we will only get stronger.

MediFund has been helping needy Singaporeans with their medical bills since 1993 and this year is no exception. From 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020, a total of $159.1 million was disbursed to more than 1.2 million successful applications to assist Singaporeans who were unable to afford their medical bills, after receiving government subsidies and using their insurance and MediSave.

We have provided more assistance this year through MediFund, an increase of $2.6 million from the $156.5 million in FY2018. The increase was because of greater support extended to patients in the intermediate and long-term care facilities, including the elderly. I hope the assistance has supported them in focusing on their treatment and recovery, and alleviated their worries about their medical bills.

These key stats and more were shared in the Annual Report of the Medical Endowment Fund (MediFund) for FY2019, which colleagues at the @Ministry of Health, Singapore had submitted to Parliament on 28 Dec.

Research has shown that those who do not start smoking before 21 years of age are less likely to ever become smokers. And the younger one first starts smoking, the higher the probability of him or her becoming a habitual smoker.

Tobacco use continues to be one of the key contributors to ill health and premature death in Singapore. To encourage Singaporeans to stay smoke-free and to denormalise smoking among youths, we are raising the Minimum Legal Age (MLA) for the purchase, use, possession, sale and supply of tobacco products from 20 to 21 years old with effect from 1 Jan 2021.

For smokers, it is not too late to stub out now. You can call the national toll-free QuitLine at 1800-438-2000 to receive customised smoking cessation counselling from certified Quit consultants.

Besides the change in MLA, we remain committed to encourage tobacco-free living in Singapore through a comprehensive and multipronged approach which includes public education on the harms of tobacco use.

More than 30 staff from across the NCID family will be vaccinated today, including clinical, nursing, allied health, ancillary and administration staff.

The first healthcare worker vaccinated today was Miss Sarah Lim, 46, a senior staff nurse at NCID. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, she performed pre-screening, triage and carried out procedures such as blood-taking and ECG, and coordinated clinic operations at the Special Precaution Area at NCID’s Clinic J. With the COVID-19 outbreak, Sarah carries out screening for suspect COVID-19 cases at Clinic J.

Other NCID staff vaccinated today included Dr Kalisvar Marimuthu, a 43-year-old senior consultant who manages suspect and confirmed COVID-19 cases, and Mr Mohamed Firdaus Bin Mohamed Salleh, 38, a senior staff nurse who works in the ICU at NCID.

If you are receiving acupuncture for lower back pain and neck pain at a specialist outpatient clinic in one of our public healthcare institutions, I’m happy to share that from today, patients like you will receive means-tested subsidies and MediSave coverage under a pilot arrangement by the Ministry of Health.

About 2,000 patients a year – or more than 70% of patients who receive acupuncture for lower back pain and neck pain – will stand to benefit from this.

Under the pilot, acupuncture treatment is subsidised by up to 70%, and Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors get additional subsidies of 50% and 25% off their remaining bill. Patients can also use Flexi-MediSave, which allows those 60 and older to withdraw up to $200 per year from their own, or their spouse’s MediSave Account to pay for outpatient treatments.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) plays an important complementary role in our healthcare system, and we hope this pilot will help make treatment more affordable.

We are also invested in nurturing the next generation of TCMPs in Singapore. Yesterday, I visited the NTU Chinese Medicine Clinic at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore to meet the administrators of the NTU Double Degree programme in Biomedical Science and Chinese Medicine. We discussed how the programme could be further enhanced to address challenges of the evolving healthcare landscape, including the need for more clinical research to support evidence-based practice. I look forward to more fruitful engagements with our partners in the TCM community, so that we can further advance the development of TCM in Singapore.",29/12/2020 19:52,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/132581634_5519716818054293_8418203363127646028_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=6OdVnAcuGCYAX8QWT5f&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=194bcfc60e0b959d84c39446137d1f8e&oe=60583170,,,,182,5,16,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158762966490631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/132581634_5519716818054293_8418203363127646028_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=6OdVnAcuGCYAX8QWT5f&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=194bcfc60e0b959d84c39446137d1f8e&oe=60583170', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/133068520_5519716768054298_1943480124355918166_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=_jVreXmRBHkAX-yxj8y&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=9100f06c69cd9579c0134072903f95da&oe=605536F3']",10158762966490600

These include recommended fee ranges for anaesthetists for about 190 procedures, as well as doctors’ inpatient attendance fees for consultations and reviews of patients in different ward settings.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) has accepted these recommended fee benchmarks in full and published them on MOH’s website at www.moh.gov.sg/billsandfees.

This is the second tranche of fee benchmarks, following the surgeon fee benchmarks for common surgical procedures published by MOH in 2018. The two tranches of fee benchmarks when used together, will give patients and payers (e.g. self-paying patients and insurers) more complete information on total doctors’ fees for surgeries and hospital stays and enable better informed decisions. They will also serve as a guide for private sector healthcare providers in charging appropriately.

1.01588E+16,"The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has submitted its recommendations to the government on the overall COVID-19 vaccination strategy for Singapore on 24 December 2020. The government has accepted its recommendations in full, and will begin vaccinating healthcare workers progressively from 30 December 2020.

As announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 14 December 2020, the government has made provision for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore to be able to get vaccinated for free by end-2021, if there are no unforeseen disruptions to vaccine shipments.

As vaccine stocks are expected to arrive in Singapore in batches over several months, vaccination will take place in a progressive manner, with priority given to the following groups, as recommended by the Expert Committee:

a) Persons at high risk of being infected by COVID-19, including healthcare workers and workers at the frontline of our national COVID-19 response.

b) Persons who are most vulnerable to severe disease and complications if they fall ill with COVID-19, including the elderly and persons with medical comorbidities.

We will begin the vaccination exercise with healthcare workers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on 30 December 2020, and roll out to more healthcare institutions in the subsequent weeks. We aim to begin vaccinating the elderly, starting with those aged 70 years and above, from February 2021. Thereafter we will vaccinate other Singaporeans and long-term residents who are medically eligible for vaccination. More details will be shared in due course.

Comprehensive vaccination coverage in the population will ensure that our population is protected from COVID-19. This will also indirectly protect those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. In the longer term, this will enable us to re-open further both as a society and as an economy, and expedite our recovery from the pandemic. While COVID-19 vaccination will be voluntary, we strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered.

In the meantime, we seek your cooperation to remain vigilant and disciplined in our fight against COVID-19, by observing safe distancing and safe management measures, and wearing a mask when out of the home. If we all work together, we can look forward to a safer and healthier 2021.

1.01588E+16,"The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has submitted its recommendations to the government on the overall COVID-19 vaccination strategy for Singapore on 24 December 2020.

The Expert Committee has independently reviewed the clinical data on the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and has assessed that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is suitable for use in persons aged 16 years old and older in Singapore for the prevention of COVID-19.

The recommendations are:

a) To achieve as high a level of population coverage for COVID-19 vaccination as possible. When vaccines become more widely available, everyone residing in Singapore who is medically eligible for vaccination should be vaccinated, although vaccination should remain voluntary.

b) To prioritise these groups for vaccination using the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine: (i) Persons at high risk of being infected by COVID-19, including healthcare workers and workers at the frontline of our national COVID-19 response, and (ii) Persons who are most vulnerable to severe disease and complications if they fall ill with COVID-19, including the elderly and persons with vascular medical comorbidities.

c) Ongoing public health measures such as safe distancing, mask wearing and good hand hygiene should continue to be practised, until a significant proportion of the population is vaccinated and more data is available on the vaccine’s duration of protection and its ability to generate a response in the body to prevent infection from the outset.

As information on more vaccines becomes available, the Expert Committee will assess and make further recommendations on the subsequent population groups to be vaccinated. It will also continue to monitor and review the use of COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore as more data become available over time.

I joined Public Free Clinic Society (PFCS) last Saturday to mark their 46th anniversary milestone, where I met some of their volunteer Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners who have been providing affordable and quality TCM services to lower-income families, and learnt more about their work.

I am also heartened to learn of PFCS’ efforts to further TCM research, which is important to help build up TCM research evidence to ascertain the efficacy of TCM treatments and advance TCM practice. PFCS recently upgraded their electronic clinical record system to kick off their research initiative to evaluate the efficacy of TCM treatments given to their patients. Efforts like this help to build a bridge between TCM and modern medicine, and will ultimately strengthen the complementary role of TCM in our healthcare system.

My heartiest congratulations to PFCS on its 46th anniversary, and I hope PFCS will continue to keep up the good work in the development of TCM in Singapore!

昨日有幸参加了大众医院欢庆46周年生日, 认识了一些为低收入家庭提供负担得起的优质中医服务的义务中医师，也让我对他们的工作有了更深的了解。

我欣闻大众医院通过其新的电子诊病系统，已为开拓中医药的调研工作踏出第一步，为传统中医学的疗效提供依据。这有助于建立中医药研究证据，确定中医治疗的成效，以及推动中医的执业。这也帮我们在中医和现代医学之间搭建桥梁，最终加强中医在我国医疗体系中的辅助作用。

1.01587E+16,"The Government has accepted the MediShield Life Council’s recommendations on the MediShield Life 2020 review, and will implement them in March 2021. The changes will ensure that MediShield Life continues to provide adequate and meaningful protection to Singaporeans in light of medical advancements and healthcare cost inflation.

The key enhancements are:

- Refreshing and refining the claim limits to provide better coverage;
- Raising the policy year claim limit from $100,000 to $150,000; and
- Higher daily claim limits for the first two days of acute hospital stays.

The actuarially determined premium adjustments are necessary to support the rising number of claims and payouts as well as the enhanced benefits, and will ensure that MediShield Life remains sustainable in the coming years.

The government has committed about $2.2 billion for premium subsidies and support over the next three years to help Singapore residents with their MediShield Life premiums, including a $360 million COVID-19 subsidy for all Singapore Citizens for two years. This will keep the net premium increases for Singapore Citizens to no more than about 10% in the first year.

We understand Singaporeans’ concern about the premium increases given the economic impact from COVID-19. MediShield Life premiums can be fully paid using MediSave, and the vast majority of Singaporeans have sufficient MediSave for their premiums. Nonetheless, to further allay concerns about premium payment during this exceptional period, we will defer premium payment until end December 2021 for Singapore Residents who have insufficient MediSave balances and are unable to pay their premiums. The financially needy are encouraged to apply for Additional Premium Support for assistance with their premiums. No one will lose their MediShield Life coverage due to inability to pay.

We will also enhance the annual MediSave top-ups for Pioneer Generation (PG) seniors, so that all PG seniors who are 86 years old and above in 2020 will continue to have their MediShield Life premiums fully covered by the special PG premium subsidies and MediSave top-ups, while younger PGs will have about two-thirds of their MediShield Life premiums covered.

We would like to thank the Council for the time and effort committed to the comprehensive review.

1.01587E+16,"The first shipment of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines arrived in Singapore this evening at about 8 pm. Its arrival marks a significant milestone in Singapore’s fight against COVID-19.

This is the culmination of months of discussions with pharmaceutical companies and the hard work of many public officers working behind the scenes to secure early access to safe and effective vaccines for our population.

The vaccines will undergo a thorough inspection to ensure that they are received in good condition, and that the cold chain was maintained during transportation from the manufacturing plant to Singapore. Thereafter the vaccines will be placed in a storage facility with capabilities to handle ultra-cold storage at about -80°C, until we begin vaccination. At that point, the vaccines will be thawed and transported to the vaccination site, where it can be kept in refrigerators at 2°C to 8°C for up to five days.

Only vaccines that meet strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness will be used for our population. We have procured enough vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore to get vaccinated by end 2021, if there are no unforeseen disruptions to vaccine shipments. We will progressively vaccinate our population, starting with healthcare workers and COVID-19 frontline workers, who are at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 and hence most in need of COVID-19 vaccination.

While COVID-19 vaccination will be voluntary, we strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered to you.

A COVID-19 vaccine will expedite our recovery from the pandemic, but it is not a silver bullet that will immediately end the pandemic. It will be some time before the world returns to pre-COVID normalcy.

With the COVID-19 outbreak, some of our community care service providers have accelerated their use of technology to deliver tele-rehab services and tele-consultations for their patients, so that patients can continue their recovery journey safely even during the pandemic.

SATA CommHealth was one such example. To ensure the smooth delivery of services, their therapy assistants would give seniors a phone call days before their therapy session, and guide them to set up the programme. Through Zoom, patients walked through their home environment with the therapists to ensure it’s suitable for tele-rehab. This also meant that therapists had to think out of the box, guiding patients to repurpose items found at home - like canned food or chairs - for their strength-training exercises. Over time, the team at SATA CommHealth ironed out the kinks and their tele-consultations have allowed seniors to continue with their treatment while saving them time and avoiding unnecessary visits to the physical centres.

These efforts were made possible by the Agency for Integrated Care - AIC Singapore’s Video Consultation Infrastructure Fund under the #ReadyTogether initiative – aimed at helping home and centre-based community care service providers leverage technology as another means to engage their clients, especially during this COVID-19 period. So if you’re a community care provider on the look-out for digital solutions as you pivot your services for your clients, do reach out to our AIC colleagues or find out more on their website. We will continue to work closely with and support our community care providers as they care for our loved ones.",18/12/2020 19:32,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/131094735_1706419982852345_2284834358710381963_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=8XPRAFBh3HQAX-\-\5R-j&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=58be75669bf546c01f1c46cac9b9f4ad&oe=6056D580,,,,127,0,4,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158736270805631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/131094735_1706419982852345_2284834358710381963_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=8XPRAFBh3HQAX-\\-\\5R-j&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=58be75669bf546c01f1c46cac9b9f4ad&oe=6056D580', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/131448484_1706420012852342_8339093116691517324_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=6vxdb6gCZgsAX8UFU9o&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=5178d11a94ee18aa35cbb364e8d2a9df&oe=6054F9D2', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/131006528_1706420066185670_7424015566812727128_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Bogai_jNIDUAX-FZiqz&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=56de1a32f7ca9154b70c75ffe540e9d7&oe=60559C1C', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/131036855_1706420036185673_8558520827841129214_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=u6XQwAgis08AX_ZoZbm&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=5e5014f6cfd0eadb77e01b8286a81770&oe=60562860']",10158736270805600

It has been a long year. But because of our collective efforts against COVID-19, we are ready to enter Phase 3 on 28 December. This is only possible because everyone has made so many sacrifices, to bring our situation under control.

We will be providing free, voluntary vaccinations for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for pandemic use, and the first batch will arrive this month. We also have other vaccines on order, and by 3Q2021 should have enough to vaccinate everyone.

I encourage you to get vaccinated, to protect not just yourself but also those around you.

The announcement of Phase 3 will bring some year-end cheer to us all, but please stay vigilant as the virus is not yet eradicated. It might be a year or more before we are in the clear, but at least we can see light at the end of the tunnel. – LHL

1.01587E+16,"To secure early access to safe and effective vaccines for our population, we have signed Advance Purchase Agreements with Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac, and are in discussions with a few other pharmaceutical companies.

We have made provision for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore to be able to get vaccinated by end-2021, if there are no unforeseen disruptions to vaccine shipments. While COVID-19 vaccination will be voluntary, we strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered to you. To ensure the accessibility of the vaccine and enable us to achieve a higher rate of vaccination for the population, this vaccination will be free for Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore.

Vaccine supply will be limited globally at the outset and will arrive in Singapore in batches over several months as manufacturers ramp up production of vaccines. Therefore, we will progressively vaccinate our entire population, with our first priority for those who are at greater risk and hence most in need of COVID-19 vaccination, such as healthcare workers and COVID-19 frontline workers, and vulnerable groups, in terms of age and health, at greater risk of severe disease from COVID-19 infection.

The Health Sciences Authority has since received enough scientific and clinical data, evaluated the available evidence and granted the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine interim authorisation under the Pandemic Special Access Route, after the vaccine was assessed to demonstrate that it meets the required safety, efficacy and quality standards, and that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the known risks.

The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has also endorsed the use of this vaccine in Singapore in individuals age 16 years and above, after having reviewed its safety and efficacy data for different population segments in Singapore. The Expert Committee further recommends that Singapore should achieve as comprehensive a coverage of COVID-19 vaccination as possible across its entire population.

1️⃣ Social gatherings will be allowed to comprise up to 8 persons, an increase from 5 persons today. Households may also receive up to 8 visitors at any point in time.
2️⃣ For malls and large standalone stores, we will increase the capacity limit from 10 square metres per person to 8 square metres per person; attractions may also start applying to the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to increase their operating capacity from 50% to up to 65%.
3️⃣ All Religious Organisations may increase their capacity for congregational and other worship services to up to 250 persons (in zones of up to 50 persons each for congregational services). Congregational and other worship services as well as religious rites/ prayers conducted at places of worship may involve live performance elements with the necessary safe management measures in place.
4️⃣ For marriage solemnisations held in the home, the hosting household will be able to invite up to 8 visitors (excluding members of the hosting household, the solemniser and vendors), even if this exceeds the existing cap of 10 persons.
5️⃣ Marriage solemnisations (in indoor venues only), funerals and funerary-related activities will also be allowed to have live instrumental music (except for wind instruments) with the necessary safe management measures in place.
6️⃣ We will allow indoor live performances to have up to 250 persons in zones of up to 50 persons each. We will also expand outdoor live performance pilots to 250 persons in zones of up to 50 persons each, to ensure that venues are still able to safely manage larger outdoor performances and mitigate the gathering of peripheral crowds.

We will continue to conduct pilots in some higher-risk activities and settings such as busking and live performances in outdoor venues, karaoke, nightlife, which will allow us to assess how these activities can take place and scale up safely.

If the local COVID-19 situation remains stable and we are able to deploy more of our enablers to allow more activities to resume safely, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will consider allowing further resumption of activities, over the course of Phase Three.

Even as we cross this milestone, we must continue to remain vigilant in the coming months and avoid an uncontrolled resurgence of cases which could slow or even reverse our progress.

I joined Minister Chan Chun Sing and Minister Josephine Teo for a visit to the NUS Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies yesterday. We had the opportunity to see some of our Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) nursing students in action as they simulated emergency care rendered to a patient who is injured in a road traffic accident. The teamwork they demonstrated brought back memories of the times I had to respond to trauma activation in the ER as a surgeon.

A job in healthcare is not a ‘career’, it is a ‘calling’. Our frontline healthcare professionals are driven by values and ethos in giving their best everyday to make an impact in the lives they touch. Everyday brings new challenges; every patient is a new opportunity to serve.

This year, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are seeing more mid-career individuals interested in joining our nursing PCPs. In the last 3 years, an average of 90 mid-career locals enrolled in our nursing PCPs each year. In comparison, the total enrolment this year is over 130, nearly 1.5 times more. To cater for more mid-career switchers to enter into nursing and allied health roles, we plan to open up close to 900 training places over the next three years.

The next PCP intake would be the degree-level PCP-RN intake in August 2021, and applications will start later this month. If you are interested, I encourage you to attend Workforce Singapore - WSG's virtual Career Previews to learn more about the PCPs available, and to consider a meaningful career in the healthcare. You can find out more about it here: www.go.gov.sg/pcp-rn-deg.

The hiring outlook for healthcare also continues to be positive. Employment opportunities in healthcare will continue to rise as we build more healthcare facilities, and also due to an ageing population and rising chronic disease incidence.

Jointly developed by the Ministry of National Development, Ministry of Health and Housing & Development Board, the new Community Care Apartments, located at Bukit Batok West Avenue 9, will be launched for sale in the February 2021. The new housing-cum-care model, where additional health and social support services can be layered on as needed, will give seniors and their caregivers peace of mind as they age.

With the new apartments, our seniors can look forward to living independently even as their care needs change, and enjoy more opportunities to stay active and take charge of their health through specially curated programmes and services. Seniors and caregivers will also be better able to navigate the range of social and health support services with the help of an on-site community manager.

If you are interested in applying for a Community Care Apartment, do visit the HDB Hub from 14 December 2020 to 31 March 2021 to view the exhibition which will feature 3D models of the apartments and a mock-up of the communal space. Visitors can also get more details on the service packages, eligibility conditions and flat prices at the exhibition. The safety of visitors to the exhibition is a priority, and prevailing safe management measures will apply. Visitors need to book an appointment via HDB InfoWEB before visiting the exhibition.

The SARS epidemic in 2003 was a trial-by-fire for Singapore – we saw how an epidemic can threaten social stability and regional economies, and it showed us the importance of Urban Health Emergency Preparedness.

At the WHO European Healthy Cities Annual Business Meeting and Technical Conference organised by WHO Regional Office for Europe, I spoke about how the SARS experience shaped the attitudes of Singaporeans and informed our policies on emergency preparedness. Many of our SARS policies were precursors for our COVID-19 responses, such as implementing the public health principles of timely tracing, testing, quarantine, isolation and treatment in preventing COVID-19 transmission.

We will learn from past experience, here in Singapore and from around the world. Being connected to the global community means that we can benefit from international expertise and best practices.

As we continue on the long road ahead of us in the fight against COVID-19, let’s continue to work together and stay vigilant to keep our fellow Singaporeans safe.",10/12/2020 16:47,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/131020253_3580006922065457_2141151258164790981_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=zn0Dlb-p22YAX8X9maJ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=67f895565e25c2c57d56b3807b9846de&oe=60564EF8,,,,92,3,0,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158715208705631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/131020253_3580006922065457_2141151258164790981_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=zn0Dlb-p22YAX8X9maJ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=67f895565e25c2c57d56b3807b9846de&oe=60564EF8', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/130232981_3580006932065456_5729488895233528072_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=6ZfiiK-ktQEAX_DcNv0&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=101ccbf250d9a704d0cc7370404b4874&oe=6054BC2B', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/130239759_3580006968732119_788964101126140678_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=n_L4-gmdgmAAX_ha3ng&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e46969c19990c6db6541f5031fe68b3c&oe=6054C963']",10158715208705600

This year’s awards recognise the winners for their contributions made in 2019.

President Mdm Halimah Yacob and Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong spoke at the virtual award ceremony to congratulate the award recipients and recognise their courage and efforts in providing care and comfort to the sick and infirm.

The recipients’ inspiring stories of compassion and selflessness remind us that even as we embrace technology and innovation to bring quality care to all, what often makes the biggest difference to the lives of the ill and frail is the human touch.

Longer life expectancy is a gift to celebrate, and we can do more of the things we enjoy if we stay fit and healthy. Starting from 2021, seniors can look forward to a new baseline service at eldercare centres that will be rolled out nationwide. As part of the service, each eldercare centre will serve as the go-to point for all seniors in their community and provide a comprehensive “ABC” suite of services which include Active ageing programmes, Befriending or buddying, and information and referral to Care services.

With the new baseline service model, seniors will have more opportunities to stay active and take charge of their health. Seniors and their caregivers will also be better able to navigate the social and health support available. I look forward to eldercare centres adding to the vibrancy of each community, and seniors participating or volunteering actively to help other seniors in their midst.

To allow eldercare centres sufficient time to ramp up their resources and level up their capabilities before transiting to the new model, eldercare centres will be brought on board the new model in phases from 2021 to 2024. We will also incorporate feedback from stakeholders to refine the model and its services along the way.

We commenced investigations in respect of potential breaches of SMMs upon receiving information that Case 58401 had tested positive for COVID-19 infection after having dinner with 12 other family members at the restaurant on 21 Nov 2020. Investigations against the restaurant, as well as Case 58401 and his family members are ongoing, and further enforcement action may be taken pending the outcome of investigations.

We will not hesitate to take enforcement action against operators and individuals who fail to comply with the safe distancing and safe management measures. We urge everyone to continue to exercise social responsibility, and to comply with the prevailing measures. A resurgence of COVID-19 cases and clusters can easily emerge in our community if we let our guard down and become lax in adherence to SMMs.

The TraceTogether app and token as well as SafeEntry have become essential digital tools for us to get around amid the COVID-19 pandemic. But this transition may not be that simple for some of our seniors.

That’s why since October when outreach activities resumed, our Silver Generation (SG) Ambassadors from the Silver Generation Office have been hard at work visiting our seniors at home, to help them adapt to the new normal by embracing digital tools and staying connected with the community. For seniors whose lives were impacted by COVID-19, the SG Ambassadors also connect them to available support grants to help them to tide over this challenging period.

Our SG Ambassadors are easily identified by their Silver Generation Office (SGO) Polo T-Shirts and photo ID tags.

Yesterday, I met general practitioner (GP) leaders and representatives from the College of Family Physicians Singapore and Singapore Medical Association virtually to thank the primary care community for their hard work in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. We had a candid discussion on our continued efforts to battle the pandemic and GPs’ role in anchoring care in the community.

GPs are the first point of contact with patients and our first line of defence against COVID-19. They have been providing care and also swab tests, which have helped us to detect, isolate and provide early care for persons with COVID-19. So if you are unwell, do visit a GP and get swabbed if advised to do so.

Beyond COVID-19 efforts, GPs are the frontline of care in providing accessible care for patients – for their acute and chronic conditions, regular health screenings and coordinating their care needs with other providers. Since 1 Nov 2020, GPs on the Community Health Assist Scheme provide free childhood developmental screenings and subsidised recommended vaccinations for Singaporeans of all ages.

Having a regular family doctor is important for the continuity of care across various stages of life. The Ministry of Health, Singapore will continue to work closely with GPs to bring affordable and quality healthcare to Singaporeans.

I attended a virtual conference with the Palestinian Authority’s Health Minister Mai Al Kaila on Tuesday, to exchange our experiences on managing the COVID-19 situation. We had a fruitful discussion and reaffirmed our warm relations. The Palestinian Authority also thanked Temasek Foundation for donating 3,000 COVID-19 Fortitude 2.0 tests to the Palestinians in July 2020.

I shared that the majority of our cases now are imported and all detected during their isolation period. The number of community and dorm cases has remained low.

This was made possible as Singapore’s fight against COVID-19 is a whole-of-society effort, with active participation and support from the wider Singapore community. We implemented “Circuit Breaker” measures on 7 April when cases spiked and since then, we have been taking a phased approach for the safe resumption of activities.

As we are continue in our journey towards Phase 3, to allow for more events and activities with larger group sizes, we hope Singaporeans will continue to work together to adhere to safe distancing and safe management measures, and support one another to keep Singapore and our loved ones safe.",28/11/2020 21:57,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/127232441_1689748614519482_6617522129101850090_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=fsZ2hTH0X_QAX98R8Lh&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=fee535b8be285971307dfb41f45766d7&oe=60580F04,,,,103,0,4,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158686253000631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/127232441_1689748614519482_6617522129101850090_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=fsZ2hTH0X_QAX98R8Lh&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=fee535b8be285971307dfb41f45766d7&oe=60580F04', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/127971370_1689748644519479_3848619260206597286_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=muzowgc1EVgAX_ZhAir&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=d4217a69bfbe6afdc89ed3720e56e99e&oe=6055985D']",10158686253000600

Many of my medical colleagues have been troubled by the methods adopted by DoctorXDentist (DxD) to promote doctors who paid for their services. It is also unclear whether some of the patient “reviews” on the DxD website are genuine and consistent with the relevant rules and regulations. Following discussions with the Ministry of Health, Singapore, Singapore Medical Association and Singapore Medical Council, DxD will now remove all doctors and dentists from their website listing unless the doctor or dentist has opted in.

MOH and SMC are continuing to monitor the situation and will make further investigations into the DxD website where appropriate. We will not hesitate to take further action if necessary. We must safeguard the integrity of the profession and protect the interests of patients.

In the meantime, I urge all doctors, dentists and in particular patients to be cautious and circumspect when using the DxD website and any other platforms purporting to present reviews or directories of medical practitioners.

The Taskforce has been progressively conducting testing operations for identified community groups, such as stallholders, food delivery personnel and cashiers across the island. These operations aim to provide a better picture of population prevalence and facilitate the early containment of cryptic cases in the community, especially as we continue to reopen our economy and allow more activities to resume. More than 5,000 individuals have been tested at Marine Parade, Ang Mo Kio and Taman Jurong since September 2020, and all who have participated in these voluntary testing exercises have tested negative for COVID-19.

Government agencies will be reaching out to other identified community groups to offer COVID-19 testing on a one-time basis. We are offering COVID-19 testing to stallholders in and around Tekka Centre this week. In the coming weeks, we will also be offering COVID-19 testing to individuals working at key delivery centres (e.g. Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre) and key logistics delivery companies.

We strongly encourage individuals in these identified community groups to come forward and utilise the testing services offered. The costs of these tests will be fully borne by the government.

As there has been a recent increase in cases reported by Finland and Turkey, all travellers entering Singapore from 28 November 2020, 2359 hours, who have a travel history in the past 14 days to Finland and Turkey will be required to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities, even if they have obtained approval to opt-out earlier. This is revised from our announcement on 27 October that travellers from Finland and Turkey were allowed to serve their 14-day SHN at a suitable place of residence.

We will continue to review and calibrate our border measures to enable a safe reopening of our borders, while facilitating the resumption of key economic activities which are critical for livelihoods.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) plays an important complementary role in our healthcare system, and Ministry of Health, Singapore has been working closely with the community to improve the industry’s standards and professionalism.

I met some of our TCM community partners virtually last month where we discussed the growth of the TCM community and how to raise the standards of TCM in Singapore for the benefit of patients. It was a fruitful exchange and we also took stock of what we have done so far this year. We implemented the Compulsory TCM continuing professional education earlier this year to support TCM practitioners in their professional upgrading. We have also supported the Academy of Chinese Medicine Singapore to set up a TCM Research Office that will provide strategic direction and promote TCM research. To further raise the standards of TCM practice, the TCM Practitioners Board has also set up working committees to start the review of TCM acupuncture practice standards.

All these would not have been possible without the support of the TCM community, and I look forward to many more opportunities to work with our partners and the community.

中医药在我国的医疗体系中扮演重要的辅助角色。卫生部一直以来都与中医药界密切地合作，致力于提高中医药业界的专业水平。

我上个月在线上与一些中医药界的社区合作伙伴进行交流，讨论有关中医药界在本地的发展方向以及如何提高本地中医的水平，好让病人从中受惠。我们也总结了今年所落实的措施。我们推行了强制性中医延续教育，协助中医师提升专业水平。另外，我们支持新加坡中医研究院.设立了中医药研究办事处, 为中医研究提供战略方向，以及推动中医药研究。此外，中医管理委员会也成立了工作小组，着手检讨中医针灸的行医水平。

中医药界的鼎力支持，让这些计划得以落实。我期待接下来有更多的机会能与中医药界及合作伙伴们携手合作，再结硕果。",25/11/2020 17:43,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/126453498_5368888789803764_4280771279126264373_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=H99ldpcjeToAX-LwJqe&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=c7112a85958680e50c4226aa4bd0687c&oe=60557C2E,,,,200,5,9,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158678618385631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/126453498_5368888789803764_4280771279126264373_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=H99ldpcjeToAX-LwJqe&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=c7112a85958680e50c4226aa4bd0687c&oe=60557C2E', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/126059389_5368888923137084_3844868494884772336_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=OlhgQ24OK8wAX9TA0Xm&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=ab6c0a0ef7b5922515ed2005601d412c&oe=60583D91', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/127162504_5368889033137073_6265147698856890223_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=W7OR1BiMYiEAX8Oehxh&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=de8d3bee6769e8c96ca36126fee0c02e&oe=6055265C']",10158678618385600

Community transmission of COVID-19 in Singapore has been very low the past few weeks. This has been no accident, and is the result of everyone’s efforts in adhering to safe distancing and safe management measures. As we resume more activities and work towards Phase Three, we need to continue to work together to fight COVID-19.

While it has been more than 10 months since Singapore saw our first case, I know there are still many questions about COVID-19 on our minds - Why must we continue to wear masks? When will Phase Three start? Is a vaccine the silver bullet to end the pandemic?

I chatted about these and more with Warna 94.2FM DJs RZ and TG on their Dinamika Warna programme, alongside A/Prof Lim Poh Lian, Senior Consultant from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Catch our discussion today at 5pm, where we will share more about Singapore’s COVID-19 situation, the new-normal, as well as Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccine strategy.

Nurses are our everyday heroes, touching the lives of their patients through their dedication and care. Yesterday, we honoured 10 of these heroes at the 14th Tan Chin Tuan Nursing Award for Enrolled Nurses, which recognises promising and talented Enrolled Nurses (ENs) who are dedicated to advancing the nursing profession locally.

One of the award winners was Ms Fatimah Binte Taha Suhaimi, a Principal Enrolled Nurse at Changi General Hospital (CGH). Fatimah once cared for a patient who had suffered injuries from a road traffic accident, and she remained in contact with the patient even after discharge so as to provide her with support and reassurance. Her passion in nursing has even inspired both her children’s choices of careers in nursing and social work!

ENs like Ms Fatimah play an integral role in our healthcare system. Not only do they touch their patients directly with their care, they also help to ensure safe and patient-centred clinical care for all patients.

My warmest congratulations to all of the 10 award recipients!

Nearly half a billion people across the globe live with this diabetes. In Singapore, 1 in 3 individuals is at risk of developing this invisible chronic disease in their lifetime and among those with diabetes, 1 in 3 is not aware that they have it.

On Sunday, I joined Diabetes Singapore at their #WorldDiabetesDay celebration, which seeks to raise awareness of diabetes as a major public health concern. Even as we continue our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, we must not lose sight of our war on diabetes. I’m glad that we have community partners such as Diabetes Singapore standing with us in this fight. To commemorate World Diabetes Day, they organised a series of activities, including health screenings for the community. They also launched BE SMART, an evidence-based community programme that motivates seniors to make sustainable lifestyle changes.

All of us can contribute to the War on Diabetes. We can take greater responsibility of our own health and encourage our family and loved ones to adopt a healthy lifestyle, and go for regular health screening, which is now more affordable and accessible through the Screen for Life programme. For individuals living with diabetes, let’s encourage and support them to better manage their disease, to avoid further complications.

As a nation, I believe we will triumph over diabetes as long as we work together and look out for one another. Together, let’s beat diabetes!",16/11/2020 12:22,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/124813816_1678659298961747_1323054426074750751_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=86un-1mQXvkAX-ZEmwI&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e81900b3765cc4c2727435b16567ad32&oe=6057DC8E,,,,149,4,4,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158657094410631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/124813816_1678659298961747_1323054426074750751_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=86un-1mQXvkAX-ZEmwI&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e81900b3765cc4c2727435b16567ad32&oe=6057DC8E', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/125195550_1678659328961744_1534962687780434166_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=c2wfIt0EALgAX_0XAoz&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=0a952de4f613bf11793d8d1d3174675f&oe=60579F3F', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/125059763_1678659392295071_6046876599719268393_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=2jZ4baLTUFYAX8s73RL&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b1eb993dc5289504ae7a26b289f71161&oe=6054F6B0', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/125121439_1678659358961741_4317758307801673352_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Jzn0LEi3b3wAX8T6kPn&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=f9609c7b150f71f9144964ad1fe5cc35&oe=60583C66']",10158657094410600

A very good Monday morning to all!

A busy start to the week as my colleagues and I join some 200 industry and community partners onsite and 300 others virtually at the inaugural MCI Insights Conference today.

It’s apt that the conference is themed ""Creating new opportunities, forging a thriving digital future for all"" today. As we gradually move into a new normal, more events will resume. So for our inaugural MCI-Insights Conference, we piloted the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) for all physical attendees as their health and safety remains our top priority. A relatively painless process, the ART involves a nasal swab to obtain a sample from the lower part of the nose, which will be sent for an onsite analysis. The result will then be released via a text message in less than 30 minutes.

A big thank you to the group of swabbers from Jaga-Me, who put our participants at ease and ensured a smooth process. I am also grateful for the cooperation from our onsite participants for this pre-event testing. They had to come a little earlier for the pre-test but were happy to do so all in the name of safety and doing our part to regain some normalcy in our lives. This speaks volumes of the resilience of Singaporeans and I look forward to a fruitful day of discussions ahead!

The new hospital will be located next to the Bedok North MRT station, bounded by Bedok Reservoir Road and Bedok North Road.

Minister Gan Kim Yong announced the location of the new integrated hospitals today on the sidelines of his visit to Outram Community Hospital (OCH). OCH is one of SingHealth Community Hospitals, and is one of the latest additions to the SingHealth family. SingHealth will also operate the new general hospital in Bedok North.

The development of the new hospital in Bedok North is part of the Ministry of Health’s continued efforts to improve Singaporeans’ accessibility to healthcare services. We will continue to invest in our healthcare infrastructure and facilities so that we continue to meet Singaporeans’ projected and current healthcare needs, as well as enable the public to continue to conveniently access affordable and quality care.

The safety of Singaporeans is a top priority in all our vaccination efforts. To ensure the safe and efficacious use of the vaccines in our population, we have set up an Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, comprising experts in infectious diseases, immunology, and other relevant fields, to closely monitor the vaccine clinical trials data as they become available globally, to advise on the suitability, safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines and to recommend the vaccination approach for the different segments of our population.

1.01586E+16,"As we progressively re-open our borders and resume more social and economic activities in Phase Three, we should expect to see the number of cases increase, beyond the current single digits or even low teens each day. This is why we need to double down on our surveillance and testing efforts to nip the seeds of transmission to prevent further spread.

To support a larger range of needs as we resume more economic and community activities, we will now make COVID-19 testing more accessible for all. From 30 November 2020 2359hrs, any company or individual who requires a PCR test will be able to procure such services from approved providers. This includes individuals who require pre-departure testing. Individuals will no longer be required to seek approval from MOH for pre-departure tests. The list of clinics and providers approved to provide COVID-19 testing at off-site locations can be found on https://go.gov.sg/covid19pcrtestproviders. We are also conducting pilots on pre-event testing using antigen rapid tests to enable more large-scale and higher-risk activities to resume in a safer manner.

The most important enabler is safe management. By keeping our social groups small, maintaining safe distancing and exercising social responsibility, we are all contributing to the nationwide effort to prevent spread.

While testing and safe management can help to mitigate spread, it is not foolproof. This is where a strengthened contact tracing regime incorporating both SafeEntry and TraceTogether is important. We encourage everyone to download and use the TraceTogether App or collect a TraceTogether Token for use at TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (ToS) premises, when ToS is implemented. ToS will only be enforced after everyone who prefers to use the TraceTogether Token has had the chance to collect one at a Community Centre/Club in their constituency.

With the cooperation of Singaporeans and businesses, we have brought the situation under control and kept community transmission low.

We need to re-open our borders safely to safeguard our aviation hub status which is essential to many of our businesses, our jobs and our future, and support our social and community needs. In re-opening our borders, we must do so safely so that we can facilitate more travel while minimising the impact on public health. We have taken a risk-managed approach to our border controls, based on the assessed risk of importation and onward transmission in the community.

To further reduce importation risk from high-risk countries/regions, from 17 November 2020 2359 hours, all inbound travellers who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, except those from lower-risk countries/ regions, will need to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure. These travellers will still be required to serve their SHN upon arrival in Singapore and be tested at the end of their SHN.

Singapore’s border measures will evolve as the global situation changes. We encourage everyone to check the Safe Travel website (https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg) regularly for the latest updates.

Many are excited to read about the positive outcomes of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine trials. While we await the final results of the trial, getting vaccinated today against vaccine-preventable diseases can reduce the risk of outbreaks in the community. Like how Uncle Lee, in this video by Health Promotion Board, Singapore stays ahead of vaccine-preventable diseases by getting vaccinated: https://bit.ly/36p7Yec

Over the years, the Ministry of Health, Singapore has also made it more affordable for Singaporeans – young and old alike – to get nationally recommended vaccinations. From 1 November 2020, we have extended subsidies for vaccinations under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) and National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS), which were previously available at polyclinics, to all Community Health Assist Scheme general practitioner clinics.

At CHAS GP clinics, eligible Singaporean adults only have to pay these amounts, after subsidies, for the range of nationally recommended vaccinations:

- Pioneer Generation cardholders: capped at $9 to $16 per vaccination dose
- Merdeka Generation, CHAS Blue and Orange cardholders: capped at $18 to $31 per vaccination dose
- Other eligible adult Singaporeans: capped at $35 to $63 per vaccination dose

At polyclinics, eligible Singaporean adults will receive up to 75% subsidy for NAIS vaccinations. Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors will receive an additional 50% and 25% subsidy off their subsidised vaccination bills respectively.

All eligible Singaporean children enjoy full subsidies for NCIS vaccinations and childhood developmental screening at CHAS GP clinics and polyclinics, to ensure that they receive the necessary developmental assessments together with their childhood immunisations from their family doctor.

Do make appointments with your preferred clinics for vaccinations before visiting!

Did you know that the global symbol for diabetes awareness is a blue circle? It signifies the unity of the global diabetes community in response to the diabetes epidemic. It is also the logo of World Diabetes Day, which falls on 14 November this year. I’m glad to join Diabetes Singapore in lighting the Singapore Flyer in blue, to show support for those living with diabetes, and raise awareness of the importance of diabetes prevention and management.

We also flagged off the inaugural 5K Virtual Run which will take place from 6 to 15 November 2020. This is a meaningful symbolic endeavour as a healthy and active lifestyle is key to preventing and controlling diabetes.

Diabetes is an invisible chronic disease that requires us to work together as a nation to fight it. We can encourage one another to make healthier food choices and stay active. We can also remind our loved ones to go for regular health screenings, which are now more affordable and convenient, to better monitor and manage their health.

All of us can contribute to the War on Diabetes. Let us work together to create a healthier Singapore for all, and help those with diabetes to manage their condition well!",9/11/2020 19:49,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/124398845_2874753009414174_954527133957831385_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=feVnWHxMCjAAX82PO9s&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=5e1d10bd6ee3a7868ee2d13ecd9588f1&oe=6054669F,,,,169,1,5,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158640000285631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/124398845_2874753009414174_954527133957831385_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=feVnWHxMCjAAX82PO9s&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=5e1d10bd6ee3a7868ee2d13ecd9588f1&oe=6054669F', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/123742601_2874752992747509_5971499529967073829_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=hYxbJzzLZg8AX_3r6Kk&_nc_oc=AQlgirIIrzdUJwqUIgYGdMvbDAR6AJhefdQF3T8AQ6dr_V_Y-7K1ys-_48n3CM2ERz8&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=dbbedab2a4678dbd9e4b1ac661aef1df&oe=6055DAA7', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/124142680_2874753022747506_622811547676141683_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=e_NmvM3YmS0AX86QW7P&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=9fffd7820eae4041501312fe5fb7dcd2&oe=60578B51', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/124230823_2874753026080839_1965645793198018667_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=wO2hClG_xzUAX_FNHvZ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=36a37957cc57bae074f79b2fdc8ad6c2&oe=60547FDC']",10158640000285600

Ever since joining Ministry of Health, Singapore in July, I’ve had the opportunity to witness the resilience, strength and professionalism of our healthcare colleagues. The healthcare fraternity is a diverse community united by a shared calling to care for the ill and frail, and to help the well remain healthy. And this community of ours is growing.

As our population ages, Singapore’s healthcare needs are expanding. Correspondingly, the sector continues to offer meaningful employment opportunities. If you share our passion to serve and care, do consider joining the healthcare sector! On Monday, we launched the Healthcare Virtual Career Fair page – a one-stop platform for jobseekers, featuring over 2,000 jobs in public healthcare and community care, as well as a variety of mid-career training opportunities. You can also take a peek into what various healthcare roles are like through informative videos.

Working in healthcare gives you the chance to make a difference in people’s lives. Our healthcare institutions and partners are looking fill a wide range of positions, from nursing, allied health and support care roles to administrative and ancillary positions. They are open to fresh graduates and mid-career jobseekers from both healthcare and non-healthcare backgrounds alike.

Spent a pleasant evening with 50 passionate citizens where we discussed how we can age well in the “new normal”, as part of the SG Together Emerging Stronger Conversation (ESC). The participants were from diverse walks of lives, and shared their varied experiences and views as healthcare providers, caregivers, active volunteers and concerned members of the public. We had a lively and rich discussion on what we can do individually and collectively as a society to make Singapore a good place for us to age healthily, meaningfully and gracefully. From improving intergenerational bonding to bridging the digital divide, all participants shared their personal experiences and aspirations on how we can enable our seniors to leverage the opportunities brought about by COVID-19 to participate digitally and stay connected to their loved ones, in this “new normal”.

Let us journey together to co-create the Singapore that we want for our children and their children.

Earlier today, I had the opportunity to offer my well wishes to newlyweds Aishah and Sufian at their wedding, which was also one of the events where pre-event testing was being piloted. Other than the safe management measures in place, the couple and all guests also underwent COVID-19 antigen rapid tests before the wedding. The process was smooth and straightforward, with most guests receiving their results within half an hour.

As we gradually resume more community activities in a safe manner, Ministry of Health, Singapore is currently conducting pre-event testing on a small number of weddings for couples who have voluntarily agreed. MOH will work together with the couple to understand their wedding plans and other considerations, to ensure that their special day will continue to run smoothly. So far, we have received positive feedback regarding the process for pre-event testing from attendees at other public events where this was carried out. We hope that pre-event testing paves the way for larger weddings to take place in the future.

For the moment, pre-event testing is only required for weddings that are involved in our pilots. Weddings can be held safely with 100 people as long as appropriate safe management measures are adopted. If you are planning an upcoming wedding, you can find out more at www.rom.gov.sg and www.romm.gov.sg.

I’d also like to reassure couples that there’s no need to delay marriage (and parenthood plans too!) because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The uncertainties of today remind us all to cherish our loved ones even more.

My heartiest congratulations again to Aishah and Sufian on this happy occasion in celebration of their union! Thanks to them and the guests for stepping forward to pilot the antigen rapid tests at this joyous occasion too.

1.01586E+16,"The Ministry of Health has advised healthcare providers and medical practitioners that the use of two influenza vaccines – SKYCellflu Quadrivalent and VaxigripTetra – can be resumed as the vaccines have been assessed to be safe for use. This follows a thorough review of the information from the South Korean health authorities as well as the Health Sciences Authority’s (HSA) further review of the quality and safety profiles of the two vaccines.

Based on information released by the South Korean health authorities on 29 October, the likelihood of a causal link between influenza vaccination and the deaths reported was determined to be low.

HSA has reviewed the local adverse event reports as well as global safety data of SKYCellflu Quadrivalent and VaxigripTetra vaccines. The reported adverse events for the two vaccines are consistent with the known safety profile of influenza vaccines. In addition, HSA has reviewed the test reports of all batches of the two vaccines supplied in Singapore and based on the available data, the two vaccines distributed in Singapore meet the quality standards.

To date, there are no safety and quality concerns with all influenza vaccines available in Singapore for the Northern Hemisphere 2020-2021 influenza season – Fluarix Tetra, Influvac Tetra, SKYCellflu Quadrivalent and VaxigripTetra.

Influenza vaccination provides protection against seasonal influenza viruses, and is effective in reducing the risk of complications and deaths due to influenza. This is especially so for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, the young, pregnant women, those with certain pre-existing medical conditions. Those who are recommended to receive influenza vaccination are strongly advised to do so for their health and well-being.

Happy Community Care Day! 🎉 This year has no doubt been a challenging and unprecedented one, and I am proud to say that our community care sector has remained committed, dedicated and resilient. You responded swiftly to changing requirements, rallied one another, and came up with new ways to reach out to seniors under your care, such as through the use of technology. You even found ways to improve on processes to better safeguard the health and wellbeing of our seniors and improve care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was heartening to hear your stories and motivations for going beyond the call of duty and connecting deeply with our seniors at today’s Community Care Day 2020 virtual celebration. To each and every one of you: thank you for your personal sacrifices and for your sustained and extraordinary contributions in caring for Singaporeans! And my heartiest congratulations to all recipients of this year’s Community Care Excellence Awards for the well-deserving recognition of your efforts.

I’m also glad to know that many supporters and friends have stepped up to journey with the community care sector in various ways. The Agency for Integrated Care - AIC Singapore introduced a new Friends of Community Care Awards this year, to pay tribute to these supporters. I want to congratulate and thank all award recipients for their efforts and support. Everyone can play a part, and such whole-of-society efforts help ensure that the good work of the sector continues to reach those in need of help. I encourage more to step up and to support the sector in our own ways, for no effort is too small.

This year, we recognised five outstanding healthcare professionals and a team who have made significant achievements in advancing healthcare, improving the standards of patient safety and driving research and education, which ultimately improve people's lives. My congratulations to the winners of the National Medical Excellence Award (NMEA) 2020!

Among the NMEA 2020 winners are Associate Professor Sum Chee Fang, who was recognised for excellence in clinical care, given his exemplary contributions to developing and advancing diabetes and endocrinology care. In the area of research excellence, the NMEA honoured Professor Yong Eu Leong, whose research in women’s health and human fertility pushed the frontiers of knowledge in the area.

This year’s awards also recognised Associate Professor Keson Tan, for his vision, passion and dedication in developing future generations of dentists; Associate Professor Nicholas Chew, for his exemplary contributions in advancing graduate medical education; and Dr Chow Mun Hong, for his dedication in advancing system-wide quality and safety for patients.

The KKH team comprising Dr Chua Mei Chien, Dr Pooja Agarwal Jayagobi and Ms Wong Anng Anng, was also lauded for establishing a national Donor Human Milk Bank programme to help premature and critically-ill babies in Singapore.

Their commitment to excellence and sense of purpose will no doubt inspire the wider healthcare family.

Singapore ranks first globally for life expectancy (LE) at birth and healthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth, with the lowest Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100,000 population in the world. This was based on the findings of the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study, which quantifies the magnitude of ill health and premature deaths due to diseases, injuries and risk factors across countries and through time.

Singapore has the highest LE at birth (84.9 years) and HALE at birth (73.9 years) in the world in 2019. This is an increase from 1990, when Singapore was ranked 26th in the world for LE (75.6 years) and 16th for HALE (66.6 years)

In line with the improvement in Singapore’s HALE at birth, Singapore also has the lowest age-standardised DALY burden, at 15,045 per 100,000 population in 2019.

Non-communicable diseases made up approximately 80% of the total disease burden in Singapore in 2019. Importantly, the study also found that approximately 35% of the DALY burden in Singapore can potentially be reduced by early intervention on modifiable risk factors such as smoking, poor diet, low physical activity and high blood pressure.

We will continue to work with our partners and stakeholders to further reduce disease burden among Singaporeans, by strengthening our existing initiatives and developing health interventions. Together, we can continue to keep ourselves healthy over our lifetime, stay disease-free, and foster a healthier Singapore.

With the enhanced surveillance regime in place, we will also adopt a risk-based approach and allow more travellers from Estonia, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Norway, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:

a. Travelled to no other country than above-mentioned countries, in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and
b. Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.

Travellers from the abovementioned countries may apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities from 2 November 2020, for arrivals on or after 4 November 2020. All travellers who opt to stay at their place of residence for SHN must remain in their declared place of residence at all times. They will be subject to close monitoring of their whereabouts and strict enforcement action will be taken against those who breach the requirements of the SHN or make false declarations.

From 1 January 2021, all incoming travellers will also be required to pay for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, and will be responsible for their inpatient medical bills if they have onset of symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days of their entry to Singapore. This includes all returning Singapore Citizens/ Permanent Residents/ Long-Term Pass Holders travellers who last left Singapore before 27 March 2020.

Singapore’s border measures will evolve as the global situation changes. We will continue to monitor the global health situation closely and update our border measures in accordance with the public health risk assessment.

As a precautionary measure while HSA is assessing the implications of the reported deaths in South Korea, MOH has informed healthcare providers and medical practitioners to temporarily stop the use of these two vaccines. Healthcare providers and medical practitioners may continue to use the two other influenza vaccines that have been brought into Singapore for the Northern Hemisphere 2020/21 influenza season.

Persons recommended to receive the influenza vaccination, including those recommended under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) and National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS), may continue to receive their influenza vaccination using other brands of influenza vaccines.

SIEW is the first 250-pax event we are piloting as we gradually resume more economic activities.

One of those measures is a compulsory Covid-19 antigen rapid test for all participants attending the event in person.

The Youth Mental Well-being Network is full of activities, and now has over 1000 members. Since it started in February this year, we had several discussions and conversations with many ideas that we now need to turn into action.

Had a zoom session with over 200 members this morning and we discussed many issues such as mental health literacy, peer support in schools and workplaces, and better relationships with our families, friends and colleagues.

Eric Chua helmed the session last Saturday and Sun Xueling will be helming the next one on 31 Oct.

Ms Zabrina Kng took to the skies for 14 years as an air stewardess, but has always harboured an interest in healthcare since she was young. The patience and dedication of the nurses who cared for her mother when she was hospitalised left a lasting impression on her. In 2018, she enrolled in the Professional Conversion Programme for Registered Nurses (Diploma) – an accelerated two-year mid-career conversion programme and today is a staff nurse with Woodlands Health Campus. She is currently deployed at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) while the campus is being built.

“Nursing is not only a stable career but one with career growth and opportunities,” Zabrina shared. “Being a nurse also has its merits at home because I am in a better position to care for my family should the need arise.”

The Professional Conversion Programme for Registered Nurses (Diploma) helps and supports mid-career PMETs to acquire the relevant training to be registered nurses. It is offered by Workforce Singapore - WSG, in conjunction with Ministry of Health, Singapore and supported by MOH Holdings. Funding will be provided by WSG, MOH and a co-sponsoring organisation for successful candidates to undergo the Diploma in Nursing (Accelerated) at Nanyang Polytechnic. Trainees will also receive training allowances ranging from $1,700 to $2,050 per month throughout the two-year training period, pegged to their years of prior work experience.

Applications for the programme’s April 2021 intake is ongoing and will close on 30 Oct 2020.

One of the biggest misconceptions Ms Bay Teck Cheng had about osteoporosis was that it only affects older people. But after she attended an online workshop on bone health, she realised that it was important to start ‘saving up’ calcium from young to build strong bones and avoid this condition in old age.

Ms Bay is one of 300 Bone Health Ambassadors who will be trained by the Health Promotion Board, Singapore (HPB) and Osteoporosis Society of Singapore (OSS) to support community events and public education sessions by healthcare professionals. The inaugural online workshop, held last month, saw some 120 participants learn more about bone health through interactive talks and role-play.

These ambassadors will be deployed at community events where they will play an important role in raising awareness of fall prevention among those over the age of 50, with information such as nutritional tips for good bone health and simple weight bearing exercises, as osteoporosis can increase the risk of fractures in older people.

As we commemorate World Osteoporosis Day today, let’s start practising these key habits to prevent osteoporosis: 1️⃣ increase your intake of calcium-rich foods, 2️⃣ exercise regularly, 3️⃣ avoid smoking and excessive alcohol. Health is wealth, and it’s never too early or too late to work towards a fit and fab you!",21/10/2020 12:10,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121704489_1650390125121998_4973193625563803201_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=7iRlRNtvYt8AX8DubJS&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e3a6fa8bab1be3f50de4b102a5b50b76&oe=6056CEAD,,,,153,1,2,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158590868755631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121704489_1650390125121998_4973193625563803201_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=7iRlRNtvYt8AX8DubJS&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e3a6fa8bab1be3f50de4b102a5b50b76&oe=6056CEAD', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/122134276_1650390141788663_5442479845876454095_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=muD_CR34VWMAX-YmZab&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=daaf5bd6d3a372c74cc0b4a05a50c9c4&oe=6056D102', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/122142000_1650390178455326_7449214902987264487_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=dq-nrtMjNNEAX-2DaAb&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=3f8de42902bf1d2aef4132b9f6cffe8f&oe=60561154']",10158590868755600

1.01586E+16,"It has been more than half a year since we entered the Circuit Breaker, and more than 4 months since we started our gradual reopening. To continue our journey of safe re-opening towards Phase Three, several conditions and enablers need to be in place. In particular, we must continue scaling up testing and tracing efforts as well as adhering to the safe management measures.

To ensure that the situation remains under control, we will each have to keep up the habits and practices that we have painstakingly put in place over the past few months. These include keeping group sizes small, maintaining a safe distance and practising social responsibility such as mask-wearing.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce is piloting the use of pre-event COVID-19 testing for larger-scale and higher-risk activities to reduce the risk of a COVID-19 case being present at the event. Given the need for shorter turnaround time, we are exploring the use of antigen rapid tests, which can return fairly accurate results quickly.

We also need to continue to strengthen our contact tracing regime, leveraging our two key digital contact tracing tools – SafeEntry and TraceTogether. We need greater participation in the TraceTogether Programme to help us quickly identify close contacts of COVID-positive cases.

With the above conditions and enablers in place, we will be able to move to Phase Three. But the exact timing of these changes will depend on our collective ability to cooperate with the requirements.

In Phase Three, the group size for gatherings outside the home could be increased from the present 5 persons to 8 persons. The number of visitors allowed to homes could similarly increase to 8. Capacity limits for events like congregational worship and weddings could be increased to multiple zones of 50 persons.

As we make these adjustments towards a new COVID normal, the Taskforce will continue to explore parallel tracks such as vaccines, treatment, testing and other technologies which could enable us to further ease restrictions and resume connectivity with the world in a safe manner. The journey ahead may be long, but with the cooperation of everyone, we are confident of transiting smoothly to Phase Three and beyond, emerging stronger from this experience.

If you’re looking for a career in the community care sector, the opportunities available are just a click away. Yesterday, we launched the Community Care Virtual Career Fair page on the MyCareersFuture portal, which has over 1,000 vacancies in more than 200 positions: https://vcf.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/vcf/community_care_jobs_oct20.

Our colleagues at WSG have prepared a range of useful content for job seekers, such as articles on upskilling and emotional well-being.

It doesn’t matter if you’re a fresh graduate or a working professional looking for a career switch; both clinical and non-clinical roles are also available.

The MediShield Life Council has recommended that the Medishield Life scheme be enhanced and the premiums be adjusted to taken into account these enhancements as well as claims experiences over the last 4 years.

MediShield Life is a not-for-profit, universal scheme that provides Singaporeans with basic lifelong protection against large healthcare bills. Premiums collected are placed in the MediShield Life Fund and used solely for policyholders’ benefit and scheme administration.

Premiums are actuarially determined based on not only current claims but also future commitments, hence total premiums are higher than current payouts. This is because some diseases currently under treatment will require multi-year care, such as renal failure and cancer. Policyholders also pay more premiums during their working age, which are set aside for future premium rebates to moderate premium increases in their old age. This goes some way in making premiums more affordable when we are older.

The average Incurred Loss Ratio (ILR) of the Fund from 2016 to 2019 was 104%. This means premiums collected were slightly less than total monies required for current claims and future commitments. If you are interested, you can refer to the table for further breakdown of the premiums collected, claims paid, change in required reserves and ILR of MediShield Life Fund. In fact, about 40% of the premiums were contributed by the Government through premium subsidies for the lower- to middle-income and various other premium support. These info are already made public and you can also read more at https://www.moh.gov.sg/home/our-healthcare-system/medishield-life/what-is-medishield-life/about-the-medishield-life-fund.

It is expected that premiums rise with age because we are more likely to make claims when we get older. Among seniors above 65 years old, about one in six received MediShield Life payouts last year, compared to about one in 30 for the rest of the population. They also tend to have more serious conditions that result in larger bills. Their average payout per claim was $1,620, compared to $1,420 for the rest of the population.

The MediShield Life Council has suggested premiums adjustments and changes to ensure that MediShield Life remains relevant and sustainable.

- More Singaporeans are claiming, and claiming more from the scheme. Over the last four years, Annual payouts have increased by 40%. Number of claimants has increased by 30% and average payout per claimant has increased by 7%. Bulk of the premium increases are due to this and healthcare cost increases as we have not adjusted the premiums for 5 years.
- Revision of claim limits to ensure adequate coverage for the majority of subsidised bills.
- Enhanced benefits, including several that had been rolled out previously without adjusting the premiums such as extension to cover inpatient hospices, serious pregnancy complications and higher, more granular claim limits for surgical procedures.

We are mindful of the impact of COVID-19 but we hope Singaporeans can understand that we need to keep MediShield Life sustainable. As we have not adjusted the premiums for 5 years, delaying the premium increase further would only result in even higher premium increases down the road to catch up. Hence, we decided to instead cushion the impact of the premium increase with an additional COVID-19 subsidy for all Singapore Citizens over the next two years. Net premium increases after subsidy will be no more than about 10% in the first year.

We will continue to hold to our commitment that premiums will be affordable and no Singaporean will lose their MediShield Life coverage due to financial difficulties.",19/10/2020 19:09,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121573750_5198193106873334_1558159167856928101_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=hbT2U4XXLxoAX-iNle7&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b6fff758fe52b1e04a00e47760515aa8&oe=6057D8F4,,,,113,5,12,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158586276565631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121573750_5198193106873334_1558159167856928101_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=hbT2U4XXLxoAX-iNle7&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b6fff758fe52b1e04a00e47760515aa8&oe=6057D8F4', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121492494_5198193100206668_1928627636118604427_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=-8-TbDYVdWcAX8CDLyO&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=871201a1eee7eba61b88e9f40548c90f&oe=605541BC']",10158586276565600

Visited Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic this morning, to thank our healthcare workers for their efforts in our nation’s fight against COVID-19.

During the visit, I announced that there will be a new polyclinic in Bidadari, located near the Alkaff Lakeview HDB cluster along Upper Aljunied Road. It will be developed as part of an integrated development with a nursing home, to serve the needs of residents in the vicinity of the upcoming Bidadari estate. The nearest MRT station is Woodleigh station about 500m away. We expect that it will be ready by 2027.

Including Bidadari, Singaporeans can look forward to 12 new polyclinics by 2030, which will bring us to a total of 32 polyclinics in Singapore.

Now that we are seeing fewer COVID-19 cases daily, more of our colleagues at the polyclinics can now focus on providing preventive and chronic care, treating patients for a variety of ailments and helping patients manage their chronic conditions. Their role is a critical one, especially as our population ages and chronic disease prevalence increases. We will ensure that Singaporeans continue to have access to affordable healthcare in the community.

One’s youth is no barrier to dedication and a strong desire to serve. Mr Khairul Rusyaidie, who assists physiotherapists in conducting exercises for seniors at Vanguard Healthcare’s Woodlands Care Home, is one such shining star. A recipient of this year’s Community Care Manpower Development Awards (CCMDA), Khairul is pursuing a Work-Study Diploma in Rehabilitation Care at the Institute of Technical Education.

Khairul was inspired to join the community care sector when he saw how a therapist helped his grandmother regain her ability to walk after an extended period of severe osteoarthritis.

Community care staff like Khairul play a critical role in the recovery journey for our seniors. Whether in frontline roles like nurses, doctors or therapists, or back-end support functions such as administration and executive roles, all our community care staff are part of an important ecosystem to ensure seamless and holistic care for our seniors. Kudos to them!

I attended the CCMDA ceremony on 16 Oct. This is the first time the ceremony is held virtually – the COVID-19 situation hasn’t held us back in recognising our community care staff. I am touched that our community care staff are all united by a common purpose, that drives the kind of work that they do every day.

Despite busy schedules, many of them continue to engage in lifelong learning, so that they can provide better care for our seniors. To continually support our community care staff in enhancing their skills and knowledge, the CCMDA covers a range of programmes in clinical and non-clinical areas.

Congratulations to the award recipients! I hope your passion and spirit to serve will inspire many more to join the community care sector.",18/10/2020 10:48,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121445932_5192362940789684_1939377595947347208_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=h72nSYKo0I0AX9ulRoe&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=55a77ba9f8b86b76b5de1bcdbcd9c6e6&oe=6056C221,,,,175,1,5,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158583054210631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121445932_5192362940789684_1939377595947347208_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=h72nSYKo0I0AX9ulRoe&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=55a77ba9f8b86b76b5de1bcdbcd9c6e6&oe=6056C221', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/122124400_5192362947456350_4147193192150237852_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=3R0YNV7ocVQAX_0J_Qg&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=6aa0d5222334e8eae6a29a2fc982442e&oe=6056B1FB', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121451823_5192362980789680_542328912591753166_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=sWIaXeSFt0IAX8gL4Ba&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=a44acadaddc7fb97c6990089df2f89cf&oe=60578F8A', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121496743_5192363060789672_6688045613332914828_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=aQidcrozlRQAX9Bj5_D&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=81dfe5f9decf082d8973763f15a09087&oe=6055EA84']",10158583054210600

You may have seen COVID-19 swab tests being administered at void decks and other areas in your neighbourhood. These swab test operations are part of the government’s efforts to keep our community safe as we continue to reopen our economy and allow more activities to resume. We are offering these tests to selected groups whose work involves more frequent interaction with the public, like stall holders and food delivery riders.

I visited the COVID-19 screening centre at Blk 402 in Ang Mo Kio today, and was glad to see many coming forward to be swabbed. Beyond AMK, the testing operations will also be progressively rolled out to other parts in Singapore. This testing exercise requires the joint efforts of multiple agencies working closely together with community partners. Thank you to all the teams managing this, and keep up the good work! – LHL

Spoke in Parliament yesterday about the GPFirst programme, which helps our hospitals’ Emergency Departments (EDs) focus on attending to patients with life-threatening and critical conditions.

We piloted GPFirst at Changi General Hospital (CGH) in January 2014 to encourage patients with non-emergency conditions to seek treatment at GPs rather than at EDs. If patients are subsequently assessed by GPs to require emergency care, they will be referred to the ED, where they will get priority to be seen earlier, and receive a $50 subsidy on their ED bill.

With the pilot, we saw a reduction of about 8.5% in the self-referred attendances at CGH’s ED from 2014 to 2017. This may be attributed in part to GPFirst.

The Ministry of Health, Singapore has since expanded GPFirst. It now includes GPs around Khoo Tech Puat Hospital and the new Urgent Care Centre @ Admiralty. By end 2021, the initiative will also be implemented in regions surrounding Sengkang General Hospital, National University Hospital - NUH and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital

Go to the ED only for emergencies that are urgent and life-threatening. For non-emergencies and milder to moderate conditions, do go to your #GPFirst!

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we work, live and learn. Our seniors are no exception. Many face-to-face courses and activities for seniors have gone online to ensure that they can continue to participate in their courses safely from their home.

I understand that embracing technology can be a challenge for some seniors who aren’t digital natives. But help is available, and many providers have gone the extra mile to lend a helping hand to our seniors as they transit to virtual activities.

For example, the SG Digital Office under Infocomm Media Development Authority - IMDA mobilised 1,000 Digital Ambassadors to provide one-on-one coaching on digital skills – such as making video calls and using smartphone apps. To date, over 21,500 seniors at 34 SG Digital Community Hubs in Community Centres/Clubs have benefitted from this initiative.

Our colleagues at Agency for Integrated Care - AIC Singapore’s (AIC) Silver Generation Office (SGO), together with IMDA, are also working on reaching out to more seniors in the heartlands through the digital clinics at the SGO Satellite Offices.

As with learning anything new, some things may seem difficult at first, but with some practice, you will get the hang of it in no time! Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health, Singapore will continue to work with our stakeholders to ensure that seniors with a passion for lifelong learning can continue to benefit from the myriad learning opportunities available.",13/10/2020 21:19,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121334002_1642395039254840_3091607785812604534_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=4BK5Jrl_JG0AX-KvjGp&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=716be14ca5174a4285ecd56144ec688d&oe=60581752,,,,229,0,11,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158571169680631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121334002_1642395039254840_3091607785812604534_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=4BK5Jrl_JG0AX-KvjGp&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=716be14ca5174a4285ecd56144ec688d&oe=60581752', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121507288_1642395059254838_7418082385418280844_o.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=X6xL1SNjvtMAX_QIWUy&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=10c0da5e4eec0756a724df29f9ce7a8e&oe=60572DCE', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121172259_1642395075921503_1374215505142683973_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Tt4-Sru8YRUAX9xe9T3&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=430db6f3025264a2c560486cb500eacd&oe=60551049']",10158571169680600

1.01586E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce had earlier announced that travellers from Malaysia are allowed to serve a 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at their place of residence. As there has been an increase in cases in Sabah recently, all travellers entering Singapore from 14 October 2020, 2359 hours, who have a travel history in the past 14 days to Sabah will be required to serve a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. This also applies to returning Singapore-based travellers under the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL), as well as Malaysian Citizens and PRs entering Singapore under the Periodic Commuting Arrangement. We are monitoring the situation across other states and federal territories closely, including Kuala Lumpur, Selangor and Putrajaya.

To reduce the importation of cases from Indonesia and the Philippines, travellers who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents and who have recent travel history to Indonesia or the Philippines within the last 14 days prior to entry will be required to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure. Travellers will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result as a condition of approval to enter or transfer through Singapore. This requirement will take effect for those arriving in or transferring through Singapore from 19 October 2020, 2359 hours.

As Hong Kong is a low risk region, we will reduce the SHN period from 14 days at dedicated SHN facilities, to 7 days at their place of residence, for travellers from Hong Kong, from 14 October 2020, 2359 hours.

As COVID-19 testing is an integral element to the safe resumption of travel, we will make COVID-19 testing more accessible for travellers. There are currently over 150 clinics that provide pre-departure testing to eligible travellers. We will increase the number of clinics and providers who can administer the COVID-19 PCR tests for pre-departure testing.

Singapore’s border measures will evolve as the global situation changes. We will continue to monitor the global health situation closely and update our border measures in accordance with the public health risk assessment.

Ivan Lim held a stable job and finances were nary an issue for him. It appeared that Ivan had everything, yet nothing, as he never knew what happiness felt like. Due to marital problems, he turned to alcohol every night even after he crashed his car while asleep at the wheel. It was only when his mum found him almost unconscious, that she set up an appointment with a psychiatrist. In 2001, the 34-year-old was diagnosed with depression.

It is important to seek professional help early for your mental health condition. If you are worried about stigma or don’t know where to start in seeking help, try the online tool mindline.sg, developed by MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation, the Institute of Mental Health, MSF Singapore and NCSS Singapore. It is a useful and convenient website that has a comprehensive list of resources and a self-assessment tool to connect you to the right resources based on your needs. The self-assessment results will guide you along appropriate pathways of intervention and support. You can also choose to talk to someone if you prefer personalised assistance while remaining anonymous.

Another resource you can turn to is the “My Mental Health” microsite (www.stayprepared.sg/mymentalhealth/), which provides tips on stress management and information on mental health-related programmes.

The road to recovery for mental health patients may be a long one. But as we commemorate World Health Mental Day, I want to assure you that you don’t have to walk this journey alone. Through the Community Mental Health Masterplan launched in 2012 and further enhanced in 2017, the Ministry of Health, Singapore, has significantly increased its outreach and care for those with mental health conditions and will continue to strengthen its services and programmes.

Ivan, who is now 54, has kept his condition under control after a series of therapy sessions and medication. He is now happily married with a teenage son. He finds joy in spending time with his family and playing music. So if you feel like your world is bleak, take the first step and reach out for help. We must remember that for every storm that passes, the sun will rise again.",10/10/2020 19:48,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121327629_1639392522888425_1363258679470456139_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=y0kzSqzRW3YAX9KU14A&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b3a96058f116d50fa43b30191a13ee5b&oe=605732D4,,,,105,0,5,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158562670500631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/121327629_1639392522888425_1363258679470456139_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=y0kzSqzRW3YAX9KU14A&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b3a96058f116d50fa43b30191a13ee5b&oe=605732D4', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/120996836_1639392602888417_8718944555119693400_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=18-EOrrkiwsAX-HEGqB&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=8ac95d104a69044263f70375aa482b38&oe=60568A7F', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/120973411_1639392636221747_17771729860433643_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=8FLKVL_Ac7wAX_o4XTp&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=2834f3487e3c63989a95b648f5d173e5&oe=60562FF8']",10158562670500600

We all grow old some day and hope to be cared for when we are in need. The community care sector is an integral part of our healthcare system, ensuring that those with healthcare needs can be cared for at home and in the community. It is also an area that has growing manpower needs, as our population ages and chronic disease burden grows. In August, we announced that 7,500 jobs, and about 1,600 traineeships, attachments and skills training opportunities will be made available in healthcare, including in our growing community care sector.

Community care workers help people who need medical care and support to live as independently as possible while minimising social isolation. You could say that they were born to care, as this video by the Agency for Integrated Care - AIC Singapore shows: https://youtu.be/k9WRuQTd4rM. Their roles range from clinical (nurses, allied health professionals and support care staff), to non-clinical (administration/ancillary and operations). Job seekers with no medical or healthcare background are also welcome to join the community care sector.

Check out the current job opportunities available at AIC’s website: www.borntocare.sg. You can also find out more from Workforce Singapore - WSG’s MyCareersFuture job portal, and various job fairs and recruitment platforms.",10/10/2020 19:23,,,,,87,0,3,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158562624360631,[],10158562624360600

If you are living with chronic conditions, regular follow-up with your family doctor is key to managing your health. I am happy to share that you can now tap on CHAS Chronic subsidy and MediSave to offset the cost of video consultation, related drugs and investigations for all 20 chronic conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP). This is up from 7 conditions covered under the scheme when we first introduced it in April 2020. We hope that this will help support even more patients with stable chronic conditions to benefit from receiving care while avoiding a trip to the clinic.

Even with the consultations carried out remotely, we want to ensure our patients’ safety and wellbeing. Healthcare professionals who provide these video consultations are trained to do so. Ministry of Health, Singapore also has guidelines for providers to only carry out video consultations for suitable patients who have been assessed that they do not require an in-person physical examination. If your doctor assesses that there is a need to visit the clinic for a physical consultation, you will be advised to do so.

To find out which healthcare institutions provide this service, please visit www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vc.

Represented Singapore at the World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Board Special session on the COVID-19 Response on Monday.

COVID-19 has reminded us of the world’s interconnectedness and interdependency. Tackling this pandemic must be a collective effort built on the principles of multilateralism and international cooperation. This is a challenge that no single country can confront on its own.

Singapore stands in solidarity with the WHO and Member States against this global threat. For example, under the “Friends of the COVAX Facility”, Singapore supports vaccine multilateralism and the goal of ensuring affordable, fair and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for all.

Two Amendment Bills were passed in Parliament today. The amendments to the Civil Law Act (CLA) will uphold clarity, certainty and consistency in the taking of informed consent, while amendments to the Medical Registration Act (MRA) seek to strengthen the medical disciplinary process.

The practice of medicine is centred on the doctor-patient relationship, which in turn is built on trust. Patients need to be able to trust that their doctors will do their best for them. Doctors also need to be able to trust that the disciplinary system they operate in is a fair and transparent one which produces consistent outcomes, and which sets and applies clear standards on what is required of doctors.

I look forward to the new statutory test under the CLA, which will set out a healthcare professional’s duty in giving medical advice to his patient. This new test will uphold the principle of self-regulation in the medical profession and at the same time preserve the principle of patient autonomy. It acknowledges the reality that the doctor and the patient are in fact on the same side, working towards the same outcome - the good health and recovery of the patient.

Much thanks to the 12-member Workgroup appointed by Ministry of Health, Singapore in March 2019 for coming up with the wide-ranging recommendations to improve the medical disciplinary process and the taking of informed consent. They had engaged widely last year to canvass views from various stakeholders, and some of their recommendations will come into effect following the legislative changes passed today. I look forward to continued partnership with them, and the wider healthcare fraternity, to build stronger trust in the doctor-patient relationship, which will ultimately benefit both patients and doctors.

As the adage goes – age is but a number as it’s not the years in your life that count but the life in your years.

This phrase is especially meaningful today, as the world comes together to celebrate the International Day of Older Persons, to mark the contributions of our seniors.

By 2030, 1 in 4 Singaporeans will be above the age of 65 and we will have over 900,000 seniors. To ensure that seniors stay healthy even as they live longer, we launched the Action Plan for Successful Ageing in 2015, aimed at enabling them to live their silver years meaningfully and confidently. But our work doesn’t stop here and we will be reviewing our Action Plan, to help more Singaporeans add quality years to their life.

Take for example 67-year-old Sebastian Lim, who never let his age be a setback. When he found out that he had high cholesterol, it ignited his desire to stay healthy and he turned to Aikido, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Chinese martial arts. Over time, his tenacity paid off as he got rid of his high cholesterol. Besides sport, he has a passion for learning and just last year, he completed a certificate in business analytics at the Singapore University of Social Sciences. He’s now setting his sights to pursue a certificate course in photography at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.

Like Sebastian, we must remember that ageing is not lost youth, but a new stage of opportunity and strength. You can log on to the I Feel Young SG website, and choose from a wide array of volunteer opportunities, active ageing programmes, skills-based courses, and even enjoy senior discounts to attractions!

Ministry of Health, Singapore will continue its efforts to transform Singapore to a “City of All Ages”, where seniors can continue to grow and achieve their fullest potential. You too can do your part by staying active!

Today, two new schemes which better support Singaporeans in their long-term care come into effect. CareShield Life, our national long-term care insurance, provides lifetime monthly cash payouts for as long as one is severely disabled. Payouts increase over time, starting at $600 per month in 2020 and increasing annually until age 67 or when a successful claim is made, whichever is earlier. MediSave Care enables those aged 30 and above who are severely disabled to withdraw cash of up to $200 per month from their and/or their spouse’s MediSave account for long-term care expenses.

We hope that these schemes will make life a little easier for Singaporeans like Mr Ivan Lim and his family. Ivan, 30, has autism, severe intellectual disability and visual impairment. His mother, Mdm Esah, has been his main caregiver since he was born. Ivan, who attends the SPD Day Activity Centre programme on a part-time basis, is fully dependent on her for most of his daily activities. His sister is the sole breadwinner of the family and they have been benefitting from the Home Caregiving Grant. Mdm Esah says the CareShield Life payouts will help to lessen the burden on her daughter and also gives her peace of mind for Ivan’s future expenses.

Applications for CareShield Life and MediSave Care open today. Applicants will need to undergo a severe disability assessment by an MOH-accredited severe disability assessor and submit the application to AIC. The list of assessors has been expanded to include trained therapists and nurses.

COVID-19 has been particularly tough for the elderly. Not only are they most at risk from the virus, but the necessary social distancing precautions have had a detrimental effect on old people, especially those living alone and the less digitally savvy.

During the circuit breaker, the Silver Generation Office (SGO) stepped up its care for the most vulnerable seniors. It mobilised SG Ambassadors to assist seniors in various ways – distributing food packs, shopping for groceries and collecting medication, so that seniors could stay home safely. SG Ambassadors also called them regularly by phone, to monitor their well-being, and most importantly, assure them someone was looking out for them.

Many volunteers stepped forward to support SGO’s efforts, including 500 public officers. Since February when the COVID-19 outbreak began, SGO has engaged more than 83,000 vulnerable seniors and responded to close to 3,000 requests for assistance.

1 October is the International Day of Older Persons. I am glad that we are also paying tribute to SG Ambassadors and all who volunteered at SGO during this difficult period. You can read their stories in #SGOCares (go.gov.sg/sgocares), an e-book that was launched by SGO.

Thank you SGO and our SG Ambassadors, for your service and care towards our seniors, especially during these challenging times. – LHL

1.01585E+16,"As part of an ongoing review of MediShield Life benefits and premiums, the MediShield Life Council is conducting a public consultation to seek views from the public on its preliminary recommendations for enhancements to the scheme.

Guided by the considerations of providing better protection to Singaporeans while keeping premiums affordable, the MediShield Life Council has identified preliminary enhancements to refresh and refine claim limits to provide better coverage, and support larger healthcare transformation.

Premiums need to be adjusted periodically to support enhancements that provide better coverage and higher payouts, and to keep pace with healthcare cost inflation and actual claims experience. The MediShield Life Council recommends adjusting the premiums this round to ensure that the scheme continues to be sustainable.

While the public consultation on the proposed benefit enhancements is ongoing, the Government has committed about $2.2 billion for premium subsidies and support over the next three years to help Singapore Residents with their MediShield Life premiums, particularly in view of the impact of COVID-19 on Singapore Residents and the economy. With these support measures, the net premium increases for all Singapore Citizens will be kept to up to about 10% in the first year.

The public consultation will be held from 6pm, 29 September to 6pm, 20 October 2020. To contribute your views and feedback on the preliminary recommendations, go to the online feedback form at http://www.moh.gov.sg/e-consultation/mshl2020, or mail it to the following address: Quality Service, Ministry of Health, 16 College Road, College of Medicine Building, Singapore 169854.

Heart attack patients tend to have common risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, overweight, diabetes and being current or ex-smoker. This is why it is important to make healthier lifestyle choices to prevent a heart attack. Choose to eat healthily, exercise, stop smoking, manage your chronic conditions if you have them, and go for regular health screening for early detection.

Last week, I shared about the recently opened Urgent Care Centre at Kampung Admiralty (UCC@Admiralty) which eases the load on hospital Emergency Departments (EDs) by tending to patients who need urgent care for non-life-threatening conditions.

Complementing this effort is our GPFirst programme, which encourages patients with non-emergency conditions to see their general practitioners first, instead of heading straight to the ED. If patients are assessed by GPs to need ED care, they are immediately referred to the ED and will be prioritised over other non-emergency cases. They also receive a $50 subsidy for their ED bill, in recognition of having incurred initial charges at the GP.

GPFirst helps EDs to focus their resources on attending promptly to critically ill patients. Patients with non-emergency conditions also benefit from quicker access to care at GPs.

GPFirst was piloted in 2014 at Changi General Hospital (CGH), whose partner GP network includes Tampines, so Tampines residents can tap on this programme! We are progressively expanding the programme to other partner hospitals and GPs, including residents in the North.

Remember, visit the EDs only for serious, urgent and life-threatening emergencies. If you have these mild to moderate conditions, you can consult your GP:
- Abdominal pain or indigestion
- Insect bites and stings
- Mild burns and scalds
- Nausea and vomiting
- Strains and sprains
- Sore eyes

For more information on GPFirst, check out the Facebook page GPFirst.",25/9/2020 18:02,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/120132191_5075830369109609_8861279753669227271_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=W71K2Y8T9DMAX-ov1-p&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=f051b7aaada81e9513985fa6d0a617a3&oe=6057B7FA,,,,224,2,15,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158520684545631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/120132191_5075830369109609_8861279753669227271_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=W71K2Y8T9DMAX-ov1-p&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=f051b7aaada81e9513985fa6d0a617a3&oe=6057B7FA', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/120129751_5075830459109600_4761300150421494717_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=krAbbQEpqfsAX9YDMDS&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=70a9eebdb00dec1d9b2dddef3fe4ef99&oe=60581866', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/119984765_5075830552442924_222470195887023983_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=dbGSZLKUUzAAX8lr3ub&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=8575f0d3484e70425756f840adf4dada&oe=60552E52', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/120048471_5075830642442915_7260614311541544856_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=sWjicGK4O6cAX9DDQSv&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=d19c7bf7f01288ace7bc078e84272733&oe=6057A9DA']",10158520684545600

As long as we stand by one another, we can overcome the challenges ahead.

a) Imported cases: 4 (3 Permanent Residents, 1 Work Pass holder)
b) Cases in the community: 1 (1 Work Permit holder)
c) Cases residing in dormitories: 7

Of the new cases, 92% are imported or linked to known cases/ clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.

29 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,291 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.

There are currently 36 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit.

1.01585E+16,"In recognition of the importance of religious and particular social activities, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will be expanding the capacity limits for worship services and wedding receptions.

• From 3 Oct 2020, all religious organisations will be allowed to conduct congregational and other worship services for up to 100 persons, subject to safe distancing and safe management measures in place.

• From 3 Oct 2020, we will be expanding the current pilot for wedding receptions to allow up to 100 unique attendees (including the wedding couple, excluding vendors and service providers) in total, subject to premise capacity. Participants in a wedding can be split into multiple zones of up to 50 persons each, or split by staggered timings with up to 50 persons in each slot. The cap for marriage solemnisations will also be increased to 100 persons, split across multiple zones of up to 50 persons each.

• Starting in Nov 2020, we will also be launching a pilot which will allow wedding receptions organised by a registered wedding organiser to take place at Housing Development Board (HDB) common areas, such as void decks and Multi-Purpose Halls managed by Town Councils.

In addition, we will be adjusting the legal cut-off age for children to wear masks to 6 years old and above, up from the current 2 years old and above. To protect young children from COVID-19, we continue to strongly encourage young children to use a mask or face shield, especially if they are in a group setting or when interacting with others.

1.01585E+16,"As the number of community cases has remained low, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will ease measures to facilitate business operations, by supporting essential business travel, and enabling more employees to return to the workplace.

(1) We are piloting a new business travel pass for senior executives in Singapore with regional or international responsibilities who need to travel regularly for official and business purposes. Travellers on this pass will be required to abide by a strict controlled itinerary when they travel overseas for work. To ensure that we can carefully monitor the public health outcomes of this pilot, the number of passes will be strictly limited in the initial phase.

(2) Working from home remains the default mode of working. We will allow more employees to return to the workplaces. But employers must ensure that such employees continue to work from home for at least half their working time, and no more than half of such employees are at the workplace at any point in time. Employers should play their part in minimising crowding and possible congregation at common spaces, including on public transport. In addition, split team or shift arrangements must continue to be implemented, with each team restricted to one worksite where possible.

(3) Work-related events within the workplace premises that are business-oriented will be allowed to resume, for up to 50 persons with strict adherence to safe management measures requirements. As per existing guidelines, employers must not organise or encourage larger scale social gatherings within or outside the workplaces.

As we resume more economic and social activities, with more employees returning to the workplace and more persons engaging in business travel, the risk of community transmission increases. We strongly urge everyone to do their part by observing safe distancing and practising good personal hygiene to reduce the risk of transmission. Together, we can continue in our fight against COVID-19, to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our community.

Being a community care worker takes more than just medical know-how. You also need a lot of heart – as exemplified by this video by the Agency for Integrated Care - AIC Singapore about a team of community care staff who went the extra mile to make sure a patient could attend his daughter’s wedding.

That’s why I find AIC’s Thank You Project (https://www.thankyouproject.sg/) particularly meaningful – you can leave a thank you message and choose a sponsored gift to show your appreciation to the community care workers in our midst. These are our allied health professionals (including therapists, medical social workers and dietitians), support care staff (such as healthcare assistants, nursing and therapy aides), community care nurses, as well as administration and operations staff. They work hard every day to ensure that Singaporeans can be cared for closer to their homes.

The community care sector is one of the key areas where we are ramping up manpower to meet Singapore’s growing healthcare needs. The Ministry of Health, Singapore is setting aside $150 million over the next three years to support community care institutions to make salaries more competitive for up to 4,000 local nurses and support care staff. We are also continuing efforts to attract fresh graduates and mid-careerists to join the healthcare fraternity and bring non-practising nurses back to our healthcare family.

One in ten seniors aged 60 years in Singapore and above is estimated to have dementia, and we expect this number to rise with Singapore’s ageing population. This also means that the burden on caregivers will get heavier, and they will need stronger support.

Since 2012, Ministry of Health, Singapore has been strengthening mental health care under the Community Mental Health Masterplan. Besides increasing services and resources available, we also work closely with community partners to reach out to those with dementia and their caregivers through their public education programmes.

But building an inclusive environment for those with dementia requires a whole-of society effort. Our dementia community is multi-faceted and their diverse stories are aptly represented in this colourful Lego mural unveiled by the Alzheimer's Disease Association - ADA today to commemorate World’s Alzheimer’s Day.

The journey of a caregiver and those living with dementia is never easy. We will walk this journey with you and continue to increase capacity and improve service quality for our dementia care services.",22/9/2020 11:14,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/119942225_1620508888110122_486673381340085890_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=GWzRNcb8JPEAX_UqfsI&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=9b20637de62cda54fed509d9476ae1cd&oe=605546C5,,,,190,3,7,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158512226730631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/119942225_1620508888110122_486673381340085890_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=GWzRNcb8JPEAX_UqfsI&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=9b20637de62cda54fed509d9476ae1cd&oe=605546C5', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/119942236_1620508948110116_1105017588732451636_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=97tG7T-SHzsAX-t1hAu&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e81783b84ea278e81727d05feb23a3d3&oe=6054DAFC', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/119708860_1620508911443453_1023228029302193885_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=MowAd9DBf7sAX8pTZ8S&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=76183fdb512416608091266fbf4debfd&oe=6056CE8E', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/119797589_1620508981443446_334978681831604070_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=tFXLUr3SyRUAX_am1oL&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=82cd8d3170199ae0829a379d1d7a1f54&oe=60567B07']",10158512226730600

[New Models of Delivering Healthcare]

Each time we develop a new regional health system, it allows us the opportunity to break new grounds and push out new models of patient care. This is the third week of operations of the Urgent Care Centre at Kampung Admiralty (UCC@Admiralty). Patients who require urgent medical attention for conditions that are not life-threatening can now seek treatment at UCC@Admiralty. The UCC care model sits between primary care (such as GP Clinics and Polyclinics) and the hospital Emergency Department (EDs).

Health and finance have always been closely intertwined, and in a pandemic, this is even more so. Earlier this evening, Gan Kim Yong and I participated in the Joint Finance and Health Ministers Meeting hosted by G20 Saudi Arabia. We thank our Saudi colleagues for their leadership. COVID-19 is a global crisis, so international cooperation is critical. The #G20, which covers nearly 80% of the world’s economy, and the World Health Organization (WHO) have key roles to play.

Countries, International Organisations and the private sector are joining forces to accelerate vaccine development, maximise manufacturing capacity, and ensure equitable distribution. Singapore is an early supporter of the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility. Switzerland and Singapore are also co-chairing the “Friends of the COVAX Facility” to promote vaccine multilateralism.

At the same time, as we restart our economies in a safe manner, countries need to coordinate our resumption of activities. As we restart air travel, testing will be key to give assurance to travellers and public health authorities. We must work together to develop international standards, and share test results quickly including through electronic means.

We must also continue to identify gaps and strengthen our health and financial resilience against future outbreaks.

<Strengthening Measures for Safer Reopening>

To enable the safe resumption of more activities, we are enhancing our TraceTogether programme and SafeEntry. In particular, we will deploy SafeEntry together with TraceTogether (TT). This means that in certain venues with higher-risk activities, you can only enter with TT. This “TT-only SafeEntry” will be piloted initially at selected venues like B2B events. Over time, we intend to expand to more venues, especially in settings where there are large groups of people, close interactions, and where masks are not worn, eg hotels (for wedding functions), F&B outlets, cinemas, gyms and certain workplaces. In parallel, for those who do not have smartphones to download the TT app, we will be commencing nation-wide distribution of TT tokens from 14 Sept. We will start in the areas with a higher concentration of elderly who may have more challenges using the TT app.

We are also monitoring closely the situation at F&B outlets. Dining out is an activity that involves considerable risks, because people are gathered in an enclosed space, without their masks on, and for a prolonged duration. That’s why we have in place a whole series of safe management measures to ensure safety. While the majority are complying with these measures, we continue to observe breaches at some F&B outlets. We will therefore step up spot checks and enforcement actions. So far agencies have issued warnings for the first offence. By now sufficient time has been given for everyone to adjust. So with immediate effect, agencies will take enforcement action even for first offenders.

1.01585E+16,"To support the safe and gradual resumption of activities, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will be enhancing the TraceTogether Programme and SafeEntry to facilitate rapid and comprehensive contact tracing, so as to mitigate risks of onward transmission and formation of large clusters.

(1) To enable more Singapore residents to be protected by the TraceTogether Programme, we will commence nation-wide distribution of the TraceTogether Tokens from 14 September 2020, and we aim to complete the distribution by November. We encourage every Singapore resident to either download the TraceTogether app onto your mobile phone, or to collect a TraceTogether Token. Please check https://token.gowhere.gov.sg for more details on collection sites and timing.

(2) To facilitate contact tracing efforts, we will be piloting the deployment of SafeEntry that requires the use of either the Trace Together App or Token to check in at selected venues, and will gradually expand this over time once the national distribution of the tokens is well under way. These could include venues where there may be larger groups coming together, especially where there is close interaction among attendees; or where masks may not be worn at all times due to the nature of the activities. Supplementing SafeEntry with proximity data from TraceTogether will enhance safety for participants.

(3) From 10 September, we will introduce a new Self-Check service and SMS service so that people can be alerted if they have visited the same venues at the same time as COVID-19 cases, based on their own SafeEntry records. Self-Check service will be available on the TraceTogether app. SMS alerts will be sent to a smaller group of individuals who were at locations assessed to pose a higher risk of transmission at the same time as COVID-19 cases. These include dining places and gyms where people do not wear masks for extended periods of time.

These features will help everyone to play their part to stay ahead of the pandemic, and keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.

Proactive outreach by Silver Generation Ambassadors, Senior Activity Centres, Community Resource, Engagement and Support Teams, and diabetes outreach activities will also resume with safe distancing measures in place.

As more activities resume, we urge seniors to remain vigilant, conscientiously practise hand hygiene and safe distancing and to continue to keep to a small regular circle of contacts when going out.

-To prevent the spread and formation of large clusters, MOM has put in place “Safe Living, Safe Working and Safe Rest Day” measures in the dormitories.

-To swiftly detect new cases of infection, MOM has deployed a number of strategies including (i) self-monitoring by migrant workers and regular updating of their health status; (ii) close monitoring of workers who report sick at medical posts with acute respiratory illnesses; (iii) conducting wastewater testing at selected dormitories for traces of the virus as a means of early sentinel surveillance; and (iv) conducting Rostered Routine Testing for dormitory residents every 14 days.

-If a new case is detected, MOM will quickly ring-fence and test close contacts to contain its spread.

We remain very concerned about Safe Management Measures (SMM) breaches at F&B outlets. We will continue to step up enforcement checks at F&B outlets and will take appropriate action against businesses and individuals who breach the SMMs. With immediate effect, agencies will take enforcement actions even for the first offenders. This will be in the form of a fine or a closure of the premise, depending on the severity of the offence.

To enable more workers to return to workplaces safely, MOM is working with tripartite partners on the next phase of SMM for workplaces. Employers need to implement flexible workplace hours, so that a good part of workers are able to travel off-peak hours, to mitigate the risk of crowding in public places and office buildings. It is critical that employers implement their safe management measures seriously, and ensure that safe distancing is adhered to.

To keep Singapore COVID-safe, everyone, including individuals and business owners, will need to play their part, by adhering to the safe distancing measures and SMMs in place. Together, we can ensure continued safe reopening of activities, while keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe.

If you are looking for a career switch into the community care sector, Ren Ci Hospital is looking for those with a passion for caring for seniors to join them as Resident Care Associates.

The community care sector is growing, as we expand our healthcare sector hiring to meet rising healthcare needs due to Singapore’s ageing population. Last month, we announced that 7,500 jobs, and about 1,600 traineeships, attachments and skills training opportunities in the healthcare sector will be made available.

The Resident Care Associate role was created by Ren Ci two years ago, as part of a job redesign initiative – enabled by Ministry of Health, Singapore's Healthcare Productivity Fund – to complement the model of care at its Ang Mo Kio nursing home. Resident Care Associates work with therapists, nurses, social workers and other allied health professionals to manage various aspects of residents’ care, and focus on getting to know the residents to better understand their needs and improve their quality of life.

It is a complex task, but Mr Mizahairi Mahadi can attest to the level of fulfilment it brings. He became a Resident Care Associate after spending many years in the music industry teaching youths. While the learning curve was steep at first, Miza persisted because he wants to give back to the community and gain a better understanding of the diverse roles of the community care support worker. With the support from his colleagues and residents’ next-of-kin, Miza has been helping seniors with their daily activities and is happy to support them to live meaningfully.

If you want to explore a switch to a fulfilling and purposeful career in the healthcare sector, do find out more from Workforce Singapore - WSG’s MyCareersFuture job portal, and various job fairs and recruitment platforms.",9/9/2020 16:55,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/118960844_4991149587577688_6986125620644820875_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=qsLP4MwhcnUAX-NGSxI&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=24ad4a0ae1abeb9b8133787fa330acc1&oe=6057F937,,,,106,0,5,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158477405075631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/118960844_4991149587577688_6986125620644820875_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=qsLP4MwhcnUAX-NGSxI&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=24ad4a0ae1abeb9b8133787fa330acc1&oe=6057F937', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/118880467_4991149720911008_5060426423461587388_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=IrRTAHQlM_0AX-T4nHV&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b426760bd5d48288837b38edf3a2020e&oe=6057F38F', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/118794399_4991149844244329_6142976876749610694_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=GfUT1vlLyn4AX8Um4kJ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=dc90586df7768b51dee1c29b009c9657&oe=60576051', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/118941797_4991150030910977_7030184575835337292_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=FZpFSZpD8QoAX816Ib9&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=7b2e78a3dc90cfba37c89b9ed960f327&oe=6055B375']",10158477405075600

One of the changes that COVID-19 has brought about is the increase in online shopping and utilization of delivery services for food and groceries.

Did you know that since 2003, patients at our public healthcare institutions have been able to get their medication delivered right to their doorstep?

This service has since been enhanced, thanks to the partnership between our public hospitals and polyclinics, and the Agency for Logistics Procurement and Supply, which was set up by the Ministry of Health, Singapore.

With the ongoing COVID-19 situation, we have increased our delivery capacity tenfold – from 320 deliveries per day before the start of the pandemic to an average of 3,200 deliveries each day. In fact, over 400,000 medication deliveries were made from 1 February to 25 August 2020. This is something that we hope to encourage and continue for the long term.

Besides medicine delivery services, some polyclinics also provide the option for patients to collect their medicine at their convenience from Pilbox lockers, selected parcel deposit lockers or certain retail pharmacy outlets.

This month, the Silver Generation Office (SGO) is celebrating its 6 years of reaching out to seniors and linking them up with the help that they need. Set up in 2014, the SGO has played an active role in connecting our seniors to the ABCs: active ageing programmes, befrienders, and care and support programmes. To date, it has conducted more than 1 million engagements with seniors!

Powering SGO’s outreach are the 3,000-strong Silver Generation Ambassadors, who volunteer their time to check in on our seniors across Singapore and connect them to services and assistance to meet their needs. With the COVID-19 pandemic, SGO’s usual face-to-face engagements have been largely replaced by tele-engagements, with brief visits conducted only when a tele-engagement is not possible.

Mr Kong Seet Kiang is one of the many volunteers who make SGO’s extensive outreach possible. After retiring as a shopkeeper at a Chinese medicinal hall, he decided to volunteer as a Silver Generation Ambassador as he enjoys listening to seniors’ stories. These days, he checks in on the wellbeing of seniors in his area via tele-engagement. If seniors need help with basic needs such as buying groceries or medication, volunteers will step in to assist. He also refers seniors to SGO’s community partners so they can receive the support they need.

To our Silver Generation Ambassadors, thank you for your dedication and care in improving our seniors’ lives. Your spirit of volunteerism is inspiring.

If you would like to find out how to volunteer as a Silver Generation Ambassador, do approach the Silver Generation Office.

1.01584E+16,"MOH and SFA are investigating a recent uptrend in the number of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) cases.

In July 2020, MOH received reports of 50 GBS cases from public hospitals. This compares with an average of 25 GBS cases per month from January to June 2020. Further laboratory investigations showed that 18 of the cases reported in July were GBS Type III ST283. This compares with an average of 4 cases per month from April to June 2020.

As GBS infections have previously been associated with the consumption of raw freshwater fish, we advise members of the public who choose to consume ready-to-eat (RTE) raw fish to exercise caution. Raw food is likely to contain more bacteria compared to well-cooked food. Cooking raw food well is still the most effective way to kill bacteria. As a general precaution, vulnerable groups of people, especially young children, pregnant women, elderly persons, or people with chronic illness such as diabetes, may be more susceptible and should exercise caution by avoiding the consumption of raw food. Individuals can also reduce their risk of infection by:

• Thoroughly cooking food;
• Washing hands and kitchen utensils such as knives and cutting boards thoroughly before handling food; and
• Using separate sets of knives and cutting board for raw and cooked food.

We strongly encourage individuals in the identified community groups to come forward and utilise the tests offered. The costs of the tests will be fully borne by the government.

The Taskforce also recommends that makeshift face coverings such as bandanas, scarves, and neck gaiters should not be used. As these makeshift coverings may not have a good fit around the person’s nose and mouth and are made from materials that are not specific for disease prevention, they may not perform as well as purpose-built masks.

Everyone has a role to play to ensure the safe resumption of social and economic activities. Together, we can continue in our fight against COVID-19 to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our community.

In the last 24 years as a doctor, I’ve observed that it is often those who needed medical insurance who doesn’t have it. This is especially when the patients have disabilities that made it difficult for them to earn an income to support their medical needs. Hence, a national level insurance scheme that is affordable and takes care of those who are most vulnerable is crucial in an aging population where 1 in 2 persons will require long term care towards the final years of their life journey.

Yesterday, Ministry of Health, Singapore announced the launch of CareShield Life and MediSave Care on 1 October 2020.

CareShield Life is a national insurance scheme that will provide payouts for as long as one is severely disabled. These payouts increase every year until you start claiming, or until age 67 if you don’t claim. The younger generation of Singaporeans – those aged 30 to 40 this year - will be joining the scheme first. Those aged 30 and above with severe disability will also benefit from MediSave Care, where they will be able to draw on their and/or their spouse’s MediSave savings for their long-term care needs.

Eligible individuals can start applying for claims from 1 October 2020. Interested applicants should arrange for a disability assessment by a MOH-accredited severe disability assessor and submit the application to AIC.

The first group of Singaporeans joining CareShield Life can also look forward to getting their welcome package very soon! Comprising a welcome booklet and letter, you’ll receive it by 2 September 2020 or up to two months before your 30th birthday.

1.01584E+16,"Two years ago, we announced that a new, national long-term care insurance scheme was in the works to provide all Singaporeans with universal coverage for severe disability. We also shared our plans to extend the use of MediSave for long-term care needs. We are pleased to share that CareShield Life and MediSave Care will be launched on 1 October 2020. The first batch of policyholders will be Singapore Residents aged 30 to 40, who will be automatically enrolled this year.

With CareShield Life, Singaporeans will receive monthly cash payouts for life should they become severely disabled. We will keep CareShield Life premiums affordable, through means-tested subsidies for lower- to middle-income residents and additional premium support for Singaporeans who need further help.

We have appointed the CareShield Life Council to oversee the administration and ensure the sustainability of CareShield Life. The Council is made up of 14 members from a variety of fields and is chaired by Ms Jeanette Wong, a veteran in the banking sector and Board Member of UBS Group AG.

Through MediSave Care, Singaporeans will have another option to support their long-term care expenses. Those who are 30 and older and severely disabled can withdraw up to $200 in cash monthly from their own and/or their spouse’s MediSave.

Together, CareShield Life and MediSave Care will provide greater assurance and support to Singaporeans for their long-term care needs.

We will start mailing out welcome packages soon for the first group of Singaporeans joining CareShield Life and they will receive it by 2 September 2020 or up to two months before their 30th birthday. Do keep a look out for it!

In Ministry of Health, Singapore’s addendum to the President’s Address, we outlined our commitment to ensuring everyone can benefit from a healthy life well-lived.

Singapore’s population is ageing rapidly. By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above, compared to the current one in seven. Singaporeans’ life expectancy is also the highest in the world, at almost 85 years. That is why it is important that we empower our seniors to stay active and healthy, so that we delay the onset of frailty and keep seniors in good health for as long as possible. We also need to create opportunities for seniors to contribute to and stay connected with the community, so that they can enjoy their silver years purposefully.

The ongoing review of the Action Plan for Successful Ageing, a national blueprint that spans over 70 initiatives, seeks to help our seniors achieve this. Over the years, we have introduced various active ageing programmes, enhanced our aged care services, and expanded the reach of preventive health services to seniors in the community. We have also built up strong networks of care and support for seniors, connecting seniors to the help they need and strengthening support for family caregivers.

We will continue to build on the progress made in the coming years, and work with Singaporeans to create a caring and inclusive community that is conducive for our seniors to age actively and happily.

Longevity is an opportunity and blessing, so let’s work together to help our seniors stay healthy and happy!

As Singapore’s population ages, we continue to grow our healthcare workforce to meet the current and anticipated rise in demand for healthcare services. Happy to share that we are inviting more individuals with a passion to care for patients to join the healthcare family.

Close to 900 counsellors, psychiatrists, social workers or public officers have stepped forward to volunteer to man the the National CARE Hotline. The hotline has handled approximately 28,000 calls

1.01584E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to allow a calibrated resumption of economic and social activities, while putting in place measures where needed to ensure that activities can continue to be conducted safely.

From 1 September 2020, we will expand the list of public facilities where organised exercise classes conducted by instructors can be held, to include more open spaces at SportSG sport centres, parks, and HDB common areas. Safe management measures have to be put in place and adhered to. These include temperature and symptoms screening, safe distancing, and maintaining a list of participants in venues where SafeEntry is not deployed. The instructor must be registered to conduct these activities.

To reduce the risk of overcrowding in lifts and lift lobbies, we will put in place stringent safe management measures in lifts while exempting them from the 1-metre safe distancing requirement. These safe management measures include wearing of masks, refraining from speaking, and using hand sanitisers provided in lifts.

From 29 August 2020, Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza will implement odd and even date entry restrictions on weekends, based on the last digit of an individual’s National Registration Identification Card (NRIC) or Foreign Identification Number (FIN), to better manage crowds and ensure that safe distancing can be observed both inside and outside the buildings.

Some F&B outlets have been observed to be playing extremely loud music, causing patrons to have to talk more loudly to be heard which increases the risk of droplet spread. As an added precaution, we will tighten the rules to allow recorded music at F&B outlets to be played as soft background music only.

We urge everyone to do their part to ensure that our businesses and public spaces can continue to be safe spaces for all, by observing safe distancing and avoiding peak periods and crowded places. All who are unwell should see a doctor immediately and stay home to prevent spreading illness to others. Let’s work together to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our community.

We have monitored the situation and assessed that there are several countries/regions where the virus situation is well under control and the risk of importation is low, and will therefore update our border measures accordingly. From 1 September 2020, 0000 hrs:

- Travellers from Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand will be subject to a COVID-19 test upon arrival, in lieu of a Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

- We will also reduce the SHN duration from 14 days to 7 days for travellers from low risk countries/regions, and allow ravelers to serve the SHN at their place of residence. These low risk countries/regions are Australia (excluding Victoria State), Macao, Mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia. The COVID-19 test will continue to be administered before the end of the 7-day SHN.

- All other incoming travelers will continue to serve their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities and will be subject to a COVID-19 test before the end of the SHN.

We will also update the travel advisory to allow the following:

- General travel to Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand. Travellers to Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand are advised to check the entry requirements imposed by these countries, and take the necessary precautionary measures.

- Travel for studies for students pursuing academic qualifications overseas, and where distance-learning is not offered as an option by the education institution.

We will continue to monitor the global health situation closely and update our border measures in accordance with the public health risk assessment. Pls check the MOH website regularly for the latest updates.

Let’s support one another to care for our seniors’ wellbeing. Check in frequently on the seniors in your life – be it your family and loved ones, or your neighbours. Take some time out and check how they are doing, or connect them to help where needed.

Sometimes all it takes is a simple phone or video call, and a warm voice saying “hello, how is your day?” or “have you eaten?”, to spark off a meaningful connection.

[New Job Opportunities]

A few days ago I shared about how our SIA aircrew helped as Care Ambassadors in our hospitals during this period when the aviation sector is impacted by COVID-19. Some have asked me how they can switch over from other industry sectors to seek permanent employment in healthcare.

The Professional Conversion Programmes for Enrolled Nurses or Registered Nurses help mid-career Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) in acquiring relevant training to be Enrolled or Registered Nurses. Funding is provided by Workforce Singapore - WSG, Ministry of Health, Singapore and a co-sponsoring organisation for successful candidates to undergo either a 2-year NITEC in Nursing at ITE, or a 2-year Diploma in Nursing (Accelerated) at Nanyang Polytechnic or an accelerated 2-year Bachelor of Science (Nursing) at NUS. The various healthcare Professional Conversion Programmes offer a training pathway for those seeking a second career in healthcare and have helped to supplement the growth of our local healthcare workforce.

Ms Goh Ling Ling, 40, is a Staff Nurse at St Luke's Hospital - Singapore. But she hasn’t always been a nurse – she used to work in quality assurance and quality control before she took the leap to nursing. 10 years ago, a friend showed her an advertisement for a Diploma in Nursing Programme under the Professional Conversion Programme. Ling Ling had always aspired to care for the less fortunate and sick, especially after personally experiencing the care of nurses following a motorcycle accident. In her words, “The desire to help others who are suffering from illness and those who are experiencing caregiver stress affirmed my decision to switch careers.”

Today, besides general nursing care, Ling Ling also works as a dementia care nurse to help to manage patients’ behavioural and psychological symptoms. Knowing that she has made a difference in the lives of her patients and their family members gives her much happiness.

These last few months, the COVID-19 pandemic has grounded planes, but some 500 Singapore Airlines cabin crew have been hard at work as Care Ambassadors at our hospitals. They have been supporting nurses in administrative and non-clinical aspects of patient care. With the positive feedback and the COVID-19 situation lasting longer than expected, we are extending the initiative for a year, and opening up another 1,000 opportunities to cabin crew.

The Care Ambassadors have been adjusting well to their new roles. Ms Melannie Wong, an SIA Chief Stewardess who is now a Care Ambassador at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, said she is glad to have made a difference and finds the experience rewarding. Another Care Ambassador, Mr Kenneth Tan, who is now deployed at Ren Ci Hospital, is motivated by his desire to give back to society. He treats his patients the same way he treats his passengers – “with an attention to detail, a warm human touch, and sincere service from the heart”.

Kudos to our Care Ambassadors who have been bringing their warmth and graciousness to patients, and lending a much needed helping hand to healthcare workers!",18/8/2020 16:07,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/117236865_4878399652186016_1972459709344442229_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Jt3FYT6hunEAX-ypXvr&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=34359392f069ec57112518941016224d&oe=60564C7F,,,,661,21,45,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158416058200631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/117236865_4878399652186016_1972459709344442229_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Jt3FYT6hunEAX-ypXvr&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=34359392f069ec57112518941016224d&oe=60564C7F', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/117445227_4878399555519359_5792395170412564652_o.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=3xvIc70ISoIAX-XtJ_q&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=16030d89924f0117a65ea13c96a95ab5&oe=60565E1A', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/117692757_4878399628852685_4320857515868616268_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=ZWcgW9CnXZgAX8Zw7KF&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=13f9c705d0a168aa2b62d56a5e84a94b&oe=6054FB0F', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/117749296_4878399508852697_3839759504752670096_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Li96gdyh0zgAX8WkXcS&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=c99feac154d7fb7a95ad34060d1cfbea&oe=60575505']",10158416058200600

I was at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases this morning for the Anthem Moment. The choice of the location is particularly meaningful for us as it is a recognition of the role the healthcare family plays, especially in our fight against COVID-19, not just in NCID, but all over Singapore and in all healthcare institutions.

Over these past months, our healthcare workers have persevered in playing their part to be at the frontline of Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. I want to thank each and every one of them for their dedication, courage and resilience.

I am confident the COVID-19 virus will not break our Singapore spirit. Let's renew our pledge to stay resolute and press on together to build a brighter future for Singapore. Just as we have triumphed over past adversities, we will similarly emerge stronger from this crisis – because we are Singapore, and we are Singaporeans.

Today I want to celebrate not just Singapore’s 55th birthday, but also the tenacious efforts of our healthcare workers in the COVID-19 fight. Thank you for keeping us safe! It is one of the toughest battles our nation has faced – with no vaccine yet, we have to continue to be vigilant. The battle ahead is long, but I know that the resilience of our nation and our sense of unity will see us through the challenges that may come, and we will emerge from this stronger, together.

To my fellow healthcare workers: you are the backbone of this fight. We will continue to count on you, from testing and detecting the virus, to healing patients and saving lives. It makes me proud to have shared the National Anthem Moment at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases today. Stay strong – we are in in this together! 🇸🇬

The Anthem Moment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), one of eight locations chosen to host the event this year.

This means that all the dormitories will be COVID-cleared, with the exception of several standalone blocks which serve as quarantine facilities.

As we gradually open our borders, we are adjusting our charging policy for COVID-19 treatment to support returning travellers should they be infected while participating in permitted essential travel. From 7 August 2020, all outbound Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass holder travellers who travel abroad under permitted travel arrangements will be able to tap on regular healthcare financing arrangements for their inpatient medical bills, should they have onset of symptoms within 14 days of their return to Singapore and require hospital admission for suspected COVID-19 infection.

While more activities and events are allowed to resume over time, most events should remain fully virtual or hybrid physical-virtual where possible to protect our loved ones and fellow Singaporeans.

1.01584E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will be easing restrictions on two key life events – namely weddings and wakes/ funerals – as part of a careful, calibrated resumption of activities in Phase Two.

From 4 August 2020, marriage solemnizations will be allowed to take place with up to 50 persons (including the couple, excluding the Solemniser and vendors) for the entire event, subject to the venue’s capacity limit based on safe management principles. This will apply to venues such as places of worship, HDB common areas and other external venues.

In addition, we will launch a pilot where each wedding couple will also be allowed to hold one wedding reception (including food and drinks), with up to 50 attendees (including the couple) for the entire duration of the event, in venues that are permitted to serve food and drinks (e.g. restaurants, hotels), and subject to their capacity limit based on safe management principles. All other wedding-related activities including customary rites and ceremonies, would have to adhere to prevailing gathering size limits, e.g. up to 5 visitors to each household, or up to 5 persons in a group outside the home.

To facilitate more family members and friends to pay their last respects at wakes and funerals, from 4 August 2020, up to 30 persons may be present at any one time, subject to the venue’s capacity limit based on safe management principles.

This last batch of workers come from dormitories with a relatively high prevalence of COVID-19, and will be subject to a final test before they complete their isolation periods. We therefore expect the daily case counts to be high for the coming two weeks, before tapering down thereafter.

We are still working through the details of the cases today, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.

1.01583E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce continues to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation, and take aggressive actions to prevent, detect and contain local transmissions.

We have been stepping up our surveillance, active case finding and containment efforts, in order to detect and ringfence cases of infection as early as possible. Where infection clusters arise, we undertake swift action to quarantine and test close contacts, mount swab operations, and suspend operations at the relevant facility if deemed necessary. Over the past months, we have conducted 7 such swab operations associated with newly emergent workplace clusters. We also launched swab operations to test individuals at retail premises frequented by multiple positive cases.

We have also been stepping up our general surveillance efforts, and have been using a combination of different testing methods to pick up any early signals of emerging clusters. The National Environment Agency is also planning to progressively expand waste-water testing to include more workers’ dormitories and other populous living quarters such as nursing homes and hostels.

Under Phase Two, we have observed crowding and poor adherence to safe distancing measures at some hotspots, such as popular night spots, beaches, selected malls and parks, as well as in HDB towns. Agencies will put in place enhanced crowd control measures, as well as step up enforcement, at these hotspots.

The Inter-agency Taskforce is close to completing the dormitory clearance. We expect all the dormitories to be cleared by the beginning of August 2020, with the exception of 17 standalone blocks in 8 Purpose Built Dormitories, which serve as quarantine facilities. This means that all the migrant workers in the dormitories would be cleared by then, except for 28,000 workers still serving out their isolation period in the various quarantine facilities.

It is critical that we continue to stay disciplined and vigilant. We need everyone to observe safe distancing as we carry on with our daily activities, and seek medical attention early if unwell. Let us play our part to keep our loved ones and our community safe!

Always at the forefront of care delivery, our nurses form the backbone of our healthcare system and are a critical part of a patient’s care journey. During this COVID-19 pandemic, our nurses have also stepped up to answer their call of duty, working tirelessly with other healthcare professionals to keep our loved ones and Singapore safe.

Today, we celebrate 5 nurses who are the winners of the President’s Award for Nurses 2020, the nation’s highest honour for nurses. To Ms Chin Soh Mun, Dr Alice Chua, Ms Kala D/O Narayanasamy, Ms Tay Yee Kian and Ms Patricia Yong, congratulations on winning the President’s Award for Nurses 2020 and thank you for your immense contribution to the noble profession.

These nurses’ exemplary leadership and selfless service to the community illustrate the essential role of nurses in our healthcare system. They show us the deep skills and professionalism required of nurses, and the passion, resilience and strength that drive many more like them to help patients towards recovery and better health.

The year 2020 also marks the 135th year of nursing in Singapore. This is a timely occasion for us to look back on the achievements of the nursing community and to show our gratitude for their contribution. I hope you will join me in thanking our nurses for their dedication to our patients and for their service to generations of Singaporeans.",22/7/2020 11:33,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/109720676_3572849399392142_4271739284198233040_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=OIQZ8c6gCdoAX8Lkeq5&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=93d93420cf504685bf4125c6ccb9c7e0&oe=6054CB4F,,,,674,26,18,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158335930565631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/109720676_3572849399392142_4271739284198233040_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=OIQZ8c6gCdoAX8Lkeq5&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=93d93420cf504685bf4125c6ccb9c7e0&oe=6054CB4F', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/109674241_3572849479392134_5936474629078293193_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=jw8AMPaYgC8AX8-nZuO&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e749abe67f487b9b142693e0c70d7ed1&oe=60547F54', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/109299195_3572849589392123_8654700086781645671_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=lYc14jPSY4IAX-fMW53&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4bebf5339b26c2d4adb4e021593d681b&oe=6057A147', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/108172458_3572849652725450_4505335425899549104_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Zi1jaxniELUAX-f6DeH&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=f0065e355842dd90d585b9ad95cb1816&oe=6056AB13']",10158335930565600

We will adjust our border controls, in line with the COVID-19 situation abroad and the assessed risk of importation from arriving travelers. Travellers entering Singapore after 19 July 2020, 2359hrs, who have recent travel history, including transit, to Victoria (Australia); Japan; and Hong Kong within the last 14 days will be required to serve their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities instead of their own place of residence.

We continue to take aggressive actions to detect and ring-fence local transmissions. We have significantly scaled up testing of those with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms at first presentation, and are now testing around 2,400 ARI cases a day on average.

The Inter-agency Taskforce (ITF) is continuing efforts to systematically test and clear workers and dormitories. As of 16 July 2020, around 232,000 workers have either recovered, or have been tested to be free from the virus. The ITF expects to complete the testing of all workers by mid-August.

As we resume more activities under Phase Two, we must double down on our efforts to control the spread of the virus. Everyone’s continued vigilance and adherence to safe management measures remains important to reduce the spread of infection and protect our loved ones.

Work is ongoing to prepare these dormitories to be declared cleared, and for workers to resume work. We are on track to clear about 80% of workers staying in the dormitories by end-July, and to complete the testing of dormitory residents around mid-August.

In the next few days, we have a larger population of migrant workers in various purpose-built dormitories completing their isolation period and being tested for COVID-19. As some of them came from dormitories with higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection, we can expect a higher number of confirmed cases in the next few days from this group of migrant workers.

1.01583E+16,"As part of our efforts to better protect Singaporeans from vaccine-preventable diseases and to reduce the risk of outbreaks in the community, we will enhance subsidies for vaccinations recommended under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule and National Adult Immunisation Schedule at all CHAS GP clinics and polyclinics from 1 November 2020.

Singaporeans will benefit from higher subsidies of between $35 to $125 for the vaccinations listed on the subsidised vaccine list administered at CHAS GP clinics. At the polyclinics, adult Singaporeans will receive up to 75% subsidy for NAIS vaccinations, with Pioneers and Merdeka Generation seniors receiving an additional 50% and 25% subsidy respectively.

All eligible Singaporean children will also receive full subsidies for childhood developmental screening at all CHAS GP clinics and polyclinics.

To better protect children against various vaccine-preventable diseases, varicella, influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines will also be added into the NCIS from 1 November 2020.

1.01583E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation.

- The total daily new cases has been on the decline since the Circuit Breaker, and efforts to clear migrant worker dormitories are continuing.
- While there has been some imported cases, our border controls remain tight. Travellers are isolated under Stay-Home Notices on arrival, and this prevents community transmission.
- While there has been an uptick in community cases, the majority are linked cases detected early by aggressive ring-fencing.
- Close to half of unlinked cases in the community are past infections, and many are in construction or construction-related occupations.

Proactive measures are in place to uncover and contain cases early. Linked cases are detected and isolated quickly through aggressive ring-fencing. Unlinked cases are picked up early from active surveillance and routine testing of targeted groups, and expanded testing for those diagnosed with acute respiratory infection.

As we resume more activities under Phase Two, we must be prepared for the number of cases to increase. Apart from the early detection and isolation measures in place, continued vigilance and adherence to safe management measures on everyone’s part are important to reduce the spread of infection and protect our loved ones. Through everyone’s collective efforts, we can keep COVID-19 under control while we progressively resume activities safely.

1.01583E+16,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) stepped up surveillance and contact tracing of community cases in June. Once a case is detected, through our expanded testing strategy or testing of those diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor, MOH will quickly identify all potential close contacts, and test and isolate them to prevent further transmission.

Our early detection and aggressive case finding efforts have helped us to quickly pick up and ring-fence cases. One example is our management of the cases at Block 111 Tampines Street 11. Even as epidemiological investigations are ongoing to establish if some of the cases across two households are linked, as a precautionary measure, MOH has placed households residing within the same section of the block under active phone surveillance and is facilitating COVID-19 testing for them and their visitors. Of the individuals who have been tested, so far all have been found to be negative for COVID-19.

As we resume more activities under Phase Two, we must expect the number of cases to increase. We need to continue to stay vigilant. The implementation of strong safe management measures, safe distancing measures and strict infection control measures by everyone is key to reducing the spread of COVID-19.

1.01583E+16,"On Monday, Co-Chairs of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce, Mr Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Health, and Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for National Development, met with the medical teams deployed at the Community Care Facility (CCF) at Singapore EXPO & MAX Atria to thank them for their hard work in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.

Since the CCF at Expo was first set up in early April, the medical teams – from SingHealth, Woodlands Health Campus and the SAF – have been tirelessly caring for the residents as they recover from COVID-19, many of whom have mild symptoms. The teams’ work at the Expo CCF is also enabled by the use of technology as a force multiplier to deliver the same or enhanced outcomes with less time and resources. This includes a system developed by IHiS for residents to input their own vital signs to help the medical teams monitor residents’ condition and the use of robots to allow doctors and nurses to communicate with residents.

As more COVID-19 patients recover and are discharged from our community facilities, we will progressively put into reserve some of the CCFs as part of broader efforts to optimise resources. These CCFs will continue to stand ready to be re-activated should there be a need for them, and we can also swiftly deploy the necessary medical, service and ancillary manpower needed to support the operations.

Running a CCF involves complex and extensive operations to make sure every resident is taken care of. It would not be possible without the close collaboration between the public and private sectors, with each party bringing their expertise to the project. The various CCFs we have set up over the past months exemplify the whole of society effort required in tackling the COVID-19 outbreak and we are grateful for the teamwork displayed. #SGUnited",2/7/2020 10:58,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/106719678_10158273422945631_6677125324906360760_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Nsb_H2sx1QEAX83XoZ7&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=98f4358f7a74f328c0f200db0967f557&oe=605466AE,,,,4654,152,0,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158273443375631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/106719678_10158273422945631_6677125324906360760_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Nsb_H2sx1QEAX83XoZ7&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=98f4358f7a74f328c0f200db0967f557&oe=605466AE', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/106394769_10158273423100631_8204626801740368269_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=OJpXcdkQu_8AX_BpHI6&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=130584d487adcd3cec9b1dd94e1c727f&oe=6057F5FE', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/106528244_10158273423360631_1760375790583372149_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=-VhPfwBXxH0AX_B0_mY&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=289ed120e6e0db078437231379cee3d2&oe=605593D1', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/106671093_10158273423700631_4879206980987646249_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=h7FezsdtkyoAX9cJznF&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=87adefcc50911c403b858e50486125e4&oe=60559F1E']",10158273443375600

1.01583E+16,"Tobacco use is the second-highest contributor to ill health and premature death in Singapore. As part of our continued efforts to discourage non-smokers from picking up smoking, encourage smokers to quit and to encourage Singaporeans to adopt a tobacco-free lifestyle, from 1 July 2020, all tobacco products sold in Singapore will be subject to standardised packaging and enlarged graphic health warnings.

Tobacco products can no longer have logos, colours, images and promotional information on their packaging (other than brand names and variant names displayed in a standard colour and font style); and the minimum size of the mandatory graphic health warnings of all specified tobacco product packaging surfaces must increase from the existing 50% to 75%.

This complements a range of other measures including public education, taxation, smoking cessation programmes, bans on tobacco advertising, the point-of-sale display ban and the institution of a minimum legal age for tobacco.

We can all take charge of our health and the health of our loved ones, with a tobacco-free lifestyle. Stay smoke-free, quit smoking and support your loved ones who are on their quit journey.

In the last 4 months, our Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) have been at the frontline detecting and managing COVID-19 infections in the community, playing a crucial role in Singapore’s efforts to contain the outbreak.

Happy to share that the Ministry of Health, Singapore will provide a one-off COVID-19 Business Grant, totalling $10,000 each, in recognition of the role that PHPCs play in supporting our efforts in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The grant will be disbursed in December 2020 to all eligible PHPCs.

To date, more than 900 PHPCs have provided subsidised consultation and treatment for Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and eligible Work Permit holders diagnosed with acute respiratory infections. This grant is to support PHPCs in their active role in caring for patients with respiratory symptoms, and defray additional costs that they may have incurred in doing so.

About 400 PHPCs have also come onboard the Swab and Send Home Programme (SASH) to provide COVID-19 testing services to eligible individuals, playing an important role in testing and diagnosing COVID-19 cases in the community. MOH will provide a one-time start-up grant of $1,200 to all PHPCs on SASH, in recognition of the costs and effort incurred in stepping up to support our national COVID-19 testing effort.

We are grateful for the commitment that our PHPC partners have displayed in responding to the evolving situation, as well as the hard work that all our healthcare workers have put in. We would like to thank all of them for their continued support and effort as we work together to keep Singapore safe from COVID-19.

We will continue to expand our community testing efforts to include all individuals, aged 13 years and above, diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor, starting from 1 July 2020.

In recognition of the role that Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) play in supporting the nation’s efforts in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, we will provide a one-off COVID-19 grant totalling $10,000 to each PHPC.For the 400 PHPCs who are on the Swab and Send Home (SASH) programme, we will also provide a one-time start-up grant of $1,200.

The Inter-agency Taskforce (ITF) is continuing its efforts to systematically test and clear workers and dormitories. To date, about 120,000 workers have either recovered or have been tested to be free from the virus. Amongst them 80,000 are able to resume work while the rest are pending movement to appropriate accommodations before they start work.

The risk of infection and spread remains and the implementation of strong safe management measures, safe distancing measures and infection control measures by everyone remains key.

The SG Healthcare Corps supports our healthcare workforce in the fight against COVID-19. I met many of the volunteers who were receiving training in wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and masks properly, and how to perform nasopharyngeal swabs. This training is essential to equip our volunteers with the knowledge of proper infection control, before deploying them to support healthcare operations or roles in community care.

I had a short dialogue session with the trainers, who were volunteers themselves. Many of them were experienced ICU-trained nurses who have retired or are no longer in active practice. Some of them had worked as nurses in wards during the time of SARS, and are back to volunteer as trainers this time. Others are dentists from the CGDP College of General Dental Practitioners Singapore
and Singapore Dental Association who had stepped forward to contribute their expertise in performing nasopharyngeal swabs. What encouraged me was their enthusiasm and passion to impart knowledge and empower other volunteers.

To all the volunteers, thank you for your dedication and for stepping forward to support and augment our healthcare workforce, in the spirit of #SGUnited and #SGTogether. For those of you who would like to play a part in caring for our community during this time, visit the SG Healthcare Corps website (www.healthcarecorps.gov.sg) to sign up!

1.01582E+16,"As we move into Phase 2 after 18 June 2020, 2359 hours, we will need to continue to step up our precautionary measures to enable a safe resumption of activities. Our expanded COVID-19 testing regime, and the use of technology to facilitate efficient contact tracing, are part of these efforts and key enablers to support a safe re-opening of our economy and society.

We have plans to increase our testing capacity to 40,000 tests per day, and we have applied this increased testing capacity in several ways:
1) We have stepped up the testing of close contacts, by testing all close contacts of confirmed cases before the start of quarantine.
2) From later next week, we will extend testing to all individuals aged 45 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This will progressively be extended to more groups subsequently.
3) We will continue to do more active surveillance testing in the community.
4) We will be setting up more Regional Screening Centres to support the needs of our population and bring testing services closer to our people.

As we re-open and resume more activities in Phase 2, raising the adoption level of TraceTogether is critical. We encourage everyone to download and use the app.

To ensure everyone benefits from the TraceTogether Programme, we will be providing TraceTogether Tokens to those who do not have smartphones or the requisite smartphones for the app to work properly. The TraceTogether Tokens will be rolled out from end June onwards, starting with the elderly and then progressively to the rest of the population. Details will be provided at a later date.

All individuals must play their part, and continue to practise strict safe distancing and good personal hygiene, to reduce the risk of transmissions. With our collective efforts, we can look forward to a safe re-opening and resumption of activities.

1.01582E+16,"Seniors are especially vulnerable and should be extra careful as more senior-centric activities resume in Phase Two from 19 June 2020. We encourage seniors to continue to stay home as much as possible and to limit their interactions to a small regular circle of close contacts.

In Phase Two, senior-centric activities organised by the People’s Association, Health Promotion Board, Sport Singapore, and the Council for Third Age (C3A) may resume but will be limited only to activities that can be done individually, and with safe distancing measures in place.

Day care services at most Senior Care Centres and Active Ageing Hubs will resume on 29 June, to support seniors and their caregivers who have to return to work in Phase Two. Providers will continue to enforce safe distancing, limit group interactions, and ensure good infection control practices such as hand hygiene and wearing of masks.

Face-to-face visitations at residential care homes may resume starting from 19 June, with the implementation of additional precautionary measures. To minimise the risk of infection within the nursing homes, each resident will be allowed a total of two designated visitors, and only one may visit each day, with each visit limited to 30 minutes. The total number of visitors allowed each day in a home will also be capped through appointments.

We will continue to monitor the situation closely, with the aim of continuing to ease measures until we reach a new normal in Phase Three.

Next month, Pioneer and Merdeka Generation seniors will be receiving their MediSave top-ups. PG seniors will get between $200 to $800, while MG seniors will get $200. Eligible seniors will get their notification letters by the end of June. Seniors can use the MediSave top-ups to pay for their MediShield Life premiums and other applicable medical expenses.

The $255 million MediSave top-ups are part of the benefits under the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages — to thank our Pioneer and Merdeka Generation seniors for their contributions to Singapore. Altogether, we had set aside more than $14 billion for these packages, to cover about one million seniors for life.

Our Pioneer and Merdeka Generations weathered difficult storms in the early years of Singapore, and contributed to Singapore’s growth. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their hard work and dedication. Let us continue to support them to stay active and healthy.

You can refer to the Ministry of Finance (Singapore) and Ministry of Health, Singapore press release for more details: go.gov.sg/mofpgmgpayout.

In this next phase, our goal is to ensure that efforts taken during the circuit breaker period and Phase One of reopening are sustained. By limiting close contact among individuals, while maintaining hygiene and safe management principles, we will be able to resume more activities without substantially raising the risk of new clusters of infections.

Apart from a small list of exceptions, Phase Two will see the resumption of most activities, with the following safe distancing principles in place:
a. As a default, individuals are to maintain safe distancing of at least one metre at all times.
b. Where not feasible or practical to apply one metre safe distancing between individuals, this one metre requirement can instead be enforced between groups, with each group made up of not more than five persons, and with no mixing between groups. Other safe management measures should also be in place.

Similarly, small-group social gatherings of up to any 5 persons can also resume. Within the home, households may receive up to 5 visitors at any one time.

Read more about the activities to be resumed in our press release: https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/moving-into-phase-two-of-re-opening

With the range of activities resuming in Phase Two, the number of close contacts between individuals will increase. More new community cases should be expected. To keep the number of new cases under control, it is critical that we continue to exercise caution. We must adhere to safe management principles, and practise social responsibility in upholding good personal hygiene and safe distancing measures.Let us continue to stay disciplined and vigilant, and not let all our previous efforts go to waste.

Today is World Blood Donor Day, when we commemorate the generous and crucial contributions of blood donors. Last year, I had the chance to meet many of you at the World Blood Donor Day 2019 ceremony, and listen to the stories and motivations behind your commitment and contributions.

On behalf of the more than 30,000 patients who receive life-saving blood transfusions each year, I would like to say, a Happy world Blood Donor Day, and a big thank you for your generosity and steadfast dedication to blood donation!

Sustaining the nation’s blood supply is important to save lives in times of emergencies. I am heartened to see that your commitment to the national blood programme remains unchanged – especially and even throughout this COVID-19 period. Many of you have continued to rally loved ones, colleagues, neighbours and the wider community to respond quickly to the news that blood stocks were at critical levels in February this year, and again when blood donations dropped in April. This sense of perseverance, togetherness and selflessness is what defines the blood donor community – truly exemplary of our #SGUnited spirit!

To ensure that our blood supply remains sustainable, we need more to come forward and donate blood, so that blood will always be available to all patients who need it, when they need it – whether in peacetime or in times of crisis. I want to encourage everyone to take that step forward, donate blood, and save lives.

Visit www.giveblood.sg to find out more about blood donation. Information on upcoming community drives can also be found at https://redcross.sg/give-blood/covid-19-updates.html.

<Regional Screening Centres>

As part of our scaled-up testing regime, the Health Promotion Board will be setting up Regional Screening Centres across the island. We now have five Centres at the Old Police Academy, The Float@Marina Bay, Bishan sport hall, Bukit Gombak sport hall and the former Sepak Takraw sport hall in Bedok, and we will set up more venues over time to support the testing needs in the community.

For now, the Centres will not take in walk-in requests for testing. Instead all workers with higher risk of exposure (eg those working in construction, marine and process industries, as well as those in our frontline Covid-19 operations) will be identified, and will go to the Centres for periodic testing. Doctors will also provide referral letters to their patients with acute respiratory infections, and they can go to these centres for testing. Over time as our testing capacity expands, we will include more groups to be tested.

Testing is a critical part of our strategy to control the infection, and the Regional Screening Centres will play a critical role in the implementation of our national testing strategy",9/6/2020 19:17,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/103458645_3874740075900640_1863817768177069437_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=_ZSBElLfd9EAX8b7P4s&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=f9594ff4aea9a98edc554ae3bb2f8648&oe=6057FF6F,,,,975,21,131,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158196062670631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/103458645_3874740075900640_1863817768177069437_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=_ZSBElLfd9EAX8b7P4s&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=f9594ff4aea9a98edc554ae3bb2f8648&oe=6057FF6F'],10158196062670600

1.01582E+16,"COVID-19 testing is a key enabler of the Government’s overall efforts to safely re-open after the circuit breaker.

Besides diagnostic testing, we have started to conduct active surveillance testing on targeted groups, to help detect cases early and reduce the risk of large COVID-19 clusters from developing.

With the gradual re-opening of more workplaces, we have started testing workers who are returning to work in the construction, marine and process sectors. We have also extended testing to individuals who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor, starting first with groups such as seniors 65 years old and above, healthcare workers, as well as staff and students aged 13 and above from our education institutions.

The Health Promotion Board, Singapore has been setting up regional screening centres across the island to support the national testing efforts. These centres are integral to the implementation of our national testing strategy, and play a critical role in keeping Singapore COVID-19 safe.

While testing helps us to detect, isolate and contain possible spread, strong infection control measures will continue to be the mainstay of disease prevention in our community. Let’s continue to practise strict safe distancing and good personal hygiene, to reduce the risk of transmissions.

[Launch of CareShield Life and MediSave Care]

We explained in Parliament yesterday that the launch of CareShield Life for Singaporeans born in 1980 or later, and MediSave Care, which provides cash withdrawals for long-term care needs, will be deferred slightly till end 2020. Both schemes were originally planned for launch in mid-2020. The launch of CareShield Life for Singaporeans born in 1979 or earlier will also minimally be deferred till end 2021, instead of the earlier plans for launch in mid-2021. The Ministry of Health, Singapore will review the ongoing situation and announce more details when ready.

The resources taken up to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact has meant a reduced pace of development and testing work being undertaken by our implementing agencies and vendors. This has caused a delay in the completion of IT systems needed to implement both CareShield Life and MediSave Care.

We would like to assure disabled Singaporeans and their caregivers who require assistance that they can continue to receive help from existing disability assistance schemes via the Agency for Integrated Care - AIC Singapore. If they require additional support for living costs, they can also tap on other schemes such as ComCare, the Temporary Relief Fund and the COVID-19 Support Grant.",6/6/2020 10:55,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83099305_2972555239497235_5433367064920969254_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=3MZBjhoYvLUAX9p7wlR&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=f83f45797ddd1f454f5cd98ad9e56aed&oe=60557FF3,,,,351,3,16,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158185362150631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83099305_2972555239497235_5433367064920969254_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=3MZBjhoYvLUAX9p7wlR&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=f83f45797ddd1f454f5cd98ad9e56aed&oe=60557FF3'],10158185362150600

With effect from 2 June, face shields will be treated differently from masks, and will be allowed only for specific exempt groups or settings.

In some situations, the wearing of masks may not be practical. In such situations, face shields may be worn. The face shields must be worn properly so that it covers the entire face, from the forehead to below the chin, wrapping around the sides of the face. The groups which can wear face shields are as follows:
• Children 12 years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time;
• Persons who have health conditions that may result in breathing or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time; and
• Persons who are speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture-style setting, where they largely remain at the spot from which they are speaking, and are able to maintain a safe distance away from any other persons.

As more activities and services gradually resume, we urge everyone to play their part by wearing masks, observing good personal hygiene, and adhering to safe distancing and safe management measures.

Today is World No Tobacco Day. Singapore was honoured at 2020 World No Tobacco Day Awards by the World Health Organization (WHO) for our tobacco control efforts which protect youths from industry manipulation.

This is a significant achievement by Ministry of Health, Singapore, Health Promotion Board, Singapore and Health Sciences Authority, and Singaporeans for strongly backing our efforts.

Singapore’s efforts in introducing standardised packaging for cigarettes, progressively raising the minimum age for tobacco sales and use from 18 to 21 years, and ban on Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems and Heated Tobacco Products were highlighted.

The road was not easy. Pseudo-experts and industry-funded research tried to influence public opinion by downplaying the damaging effects of tobacco in cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other products. But recent evidence of harmful effects of e-cigarettes in US and other places have dampened their efforts somewhat.

No amount of lobbying can change this important fact – about 6 Singaporeans die from smoking-related diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke and lung (COPD) disease daily. Totally preventable deaths that can be avoided if not for smoking.

About 10.6% of adult Singaporeans still smoke daily. Let’s encourage and support them to kick the smoking habit. And keep working together to protect Singaporeans, especially our young, from smoking.

We should strive to make everyday a No Tobacco Day.",31/5/2020 21:55,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/82943167_2638748823079254_4431872449461616640_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=yFPQFfcoRoEAX9hD9Rr&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=30e3835068298bfb3595326f796ec5c6&oe=605579B8,,,,349,33,48,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158166301115631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/82943167_2638748823079254_4431872449461616640_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=yFPQFfcoRoEAX9hD9Rr&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=30e3835068298bfb3595326f796ec5c6&oe=605579B8'],10158166301115600

Since her appointment as CNO in January 2015, Ms Tan has led transformative efforts in nursing to improve delivery of care and made invaluable contributions to bring nursing in Singapore to greater heights. A strong advocate of continuing education, she spearheaded the formation of the Nursing Education Executive Committee in March 2017 to look into enhancing competency-based nursing education at the national level. She instituted the Advanced Clinical Education nursing programmes to equip nurses with broad-based skills and knowledge to manage patients across care settings, in line with the needs of an ageing population. She also worked with the nurse leaders to implement Community Nursing pilots across the three healthcare clusters in October 2017.

No stranger to the nursing community, Ms Koh is the Chief Nurse at Changi General Hospital (CGH) and the Deputy Group Chief Nurse of SingHealth. At CGH, Ms Koh has been a key driver for Community Nursing to extend its reach beyond the hospital and into the community. As a member of various MOH and Singapore Nursing Board committees, Ms Koh has contributed towards elevating the nursing profession in Singapore and has shaped policies and strategies to enhance nursing practice, education and career.

We thank Ms Tan Soh Chin for her contributions to the nursing profession and warmly welcome Ms Paulin Koh to the MOH family, as we fight against COVID-19 together.

<Roadmap Ahead to Phase 2>

The Taskforce has set out the overall framework for resuming activities in three phases. Here’s a more detailed roadmap on what you can expect in the coming weeks.

In Phase 1, which will begin on 2 June, we will have about 75% of the economy restarting operations. More Singaporeans will return to work, although many will continue to work from home. Students will be back in schools.

Thereafter we will monitor the situation closely. If infection rates remain low and stable over the subsequent two weeks, then we will decide by the middle of June to move to the next phase. This means that Phase 2 could take place before the end of the month.

Phase 2 will entail the resumption of a broader range of activities. We can expect almost the entire economy to re-open. Broadly speaking the activities in Phase 2 would include:
- Retail shops and consumer services
- Dining-in at F&B outlets and hawker centres, as well as social interactions and family visits, all with group sizes capped at 5 people
- Opening of outdoor sports and public facilities

There are activities in higher-risk settings which we will have to consider more carefully. These are activities involving large groups or close contacts in enclosed spaces. They include:
- Museums, libraries, cinemas, theatres, religious services
- Bars, clubs, discos and karaoke outlets
We will consider these more carefully as they will require strict safe management practices. Subject to appropriate safeguards being in place, we will discuss with the relevant entities on the timing of when they can resume activities. It may not be at the start of Phase 2 but could happen later.

I have provided a timeline of what we can expect in the coming weeks. But this is not cast in stone, as the situation is uncertain and fluid. Ultimately the pace of reopening depends on all of us. If there are people acting recklessly and breaching the rules when the circuit breaker ends, then new clusters will surely form and we could be set back by weeks. But if we all stay vigilant and socially responsible, then we can keep infection low, and we can move to Phase 2 before the end of the month.",29/5/2020 11:02,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/101043831_3828855940489054_7604643822710030336_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=pdxJXTGcrv4AX8FaKi9&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=08d61edb3d800b943aa57719fb718b8f&oe=6057A9C5,,,,799,39,222,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158158185675631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/101043831_3828855940489054_7604643822710030336_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=pdxJXTGcrv4AX8FaKi9&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=08d61edb3d800b943aa57719fb718b8f&oe=6057A9C5'],10158158185675600

1.01582E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has studied and evaluated the latest local and international clinical and scientific evidence which show that viable virus was not found in COVID-19 patients after the second week of illness despite the persistence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of ribonucleic acid (RNA). This means that COVID-19 patients are not infectious by Day 21 of illness.

The Taskforce will therefore revise the discharge criteria for COVID-19 patients in Singapore. With immediate effect, all COVID-19 patients who are assessed to be clinically well by Day 21 of onset of illness can be discharged without the need for further PCR tests. They will be given leave to remain at home (or place of residence like dormitories) for a further 7 days to rest and recover. After Day 28, these recovered individuals can return to work. This revised approach will allow recovered patients who are well and no longer infectious to return to the community in a timely manner.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to review the latest evidence with medical experts as the situation evolves, and make evidence-based adjustments to Singapore’s medical plan for COVID-19 patients, to ensure the wellbeing of all patients.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will carefully monitor the effects of increased activity in this phase. If the community infection rates remain low and stable over the subsequent two weeks, we can decide by the middle of June to proceed with Phase Two, which could then happen before the end of June.

Phase Two will entail the resumption of a broader range of activities. We expect almost the entire economy to re-open, subject to safe management measures being in place. Small-group social gatherings of up to 5 persons will be allowed. Within the home, households may receive up to 5 visitors per day. Under Phase Two, masks will remain compulsory whenever outside one’s home.

As restrictions are eased, it becomes even more critical that each of us exercises social responsibility to ensure that community transmission remains low as we resume more activities. We need everyone to play their part, observe good personal hygiene, adhere to safe management measures, and avoid crowded places. We can look forward to moving to Phase Two and beyond if each of us plays our part. Together, we can and we must achieve a COVID-safe Singapore.

They’ve been contacting others. This Hari Raya I thought I contact them and wish them Selamat Hari Raya and thank them for their hard work - 7 days a week, 12 hours daily, including this festive season.

I visited our contact tracing team at Mandai Hill Camp this morning. The team consists of officers from Ministry of Health, Singapore and Ministry of Defence, Singapore (MINDEF) and crew from Singapore Airlines and Jetstar Asia.

With circuit breaker ending on 1 June, there’ll be more physical interactions. It’s likely new local Covid-19 cases will go up. We have to quickly detect, contain and prevent large clusters from forming.

We now have about 50 contact tracing teams, up from 20 in March. Contact-tracers are important in containing Covid-19. They conduct interviews to check who confirmed cases have been in contact with and reduce spread by identifying infection source and those potentially infected.

<Why We Are Easing Cautiously>

We have been able to bring down the number of new community cases significantly. But we have not eradicated the virus. No country has done so, even with the tightest of lockdowns.

All the countries that have been beaten the virus to low levels have seen a rebound in cases when they resumed activities - more when they resumed precipitously; less when they proceeded cautiously.

We must expect cases to rise in Singapore too when we resume activities. It's not because of the clusters amongst the migrant workers which are contained in the dormitories and under control. The fact is that there are still hidden cases circulating amongst the general population. For example, when we did a test of around 16,000 pre-school teachers recently, we detected 8 cases. There are bound to be other undetected asymptomatic cases in the community. That's why we have to move cautiously.

This means that not everything can re-open at the same time, and tough decisions have to be made on which ones go first. For example, since we have permitted physiotherapy sessions, should we now also allow spas and massage centres to re-open (as has been requested by some business owners)? Obviously the services are different - the former is an integral part of healthcare, and that’s why we accord it greater priority. We would have liked to say ""yes"" to all the requests. But each time we ease up on something, we introduce many more face-to-face contacts and people movement within the community. That in turn means higher transmission risks and the likelihood of more infections.

I know many are disappointed by our cautious approach. We are prioritising both lives and livelihoods. I hope you appreciate and understand that we are trying our best to resume activities safely for Singaporeans, while keeping infection rates low.

With a phased re-opening, we will have a better control of the overall situation. If new cases were to emerge, we will be able to detect and ring-fence them quickly. At the same time, we will continue with our pro-active testing of different segments of the population. If all goes well, then we will move to the next phase around the end of June, and resume more activities then.

Meanwhile, the Government will continue to provide assistance to businesses that are unable to open, as well as to households and workers.

Participated in the 147th session of the World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Board meeting, held virtually yesterday evening. This particular EB session took on an abridged agenda in view of the COVID situation and the travel restrictions put in place by many countries. This is the 2nd year I am serving in the WHO EB, after being elected as the Singapore representative for a 3-year term last year. During the virtual meeting, I am glad to be appointed as member of the Programme, Budget and Administration Committee (PBAC) for the next two years. The PBAC reviews and provides guidance to the Board on matters relating to programme planning, monitoring and evaluation, as well as financial and administrative matters of the WHO.
During this COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO plays an even more crucial role in coordinating international responses to overcome this pandemic. Hope to play a part in this unprecedented international health crisis!

<Continue to Work from Home>

Working from home has taken new meaning for most of us. We’re doing more remote meetings with our colleagues and realising that we can be just as productive at home as we have been in the office. The circuit breaker has showed us that we can work effectively in different ways.

We must now embrace working from home as the new norm. So even as more Singaporeans return to work during Phase 1 of the reopening plans, we expect the majority of the workforce to continue to work from home.

This is why we have imposed the following requirement on employers after 1 June: your staff should return to work only if they need specialised equipment and machinery that cannot be accessed from home, or if they need to fulfil legal requirements (eg to complete contracts or transactions). On that basis, we expect most employees working in an office setting to continue working from home as they are presently doing.

Many employers and managers will need to adjust their mindsets to this new normal. It’s no longer about having all your staff physically present at work. Even if they have to be on site, consider if they really need to do so every day. You could have hybrid arrangements where your employees work from home a few days in a week. For those who absolutely need to be in the office, employers must ensure that the work environment is safe (eg maintain good ventilation and high hygiene standards, and have officers seated apart etc) and offer them staggered work hours. All these workplace measures are critical in our fight against Covid-19 - they will reduce the need for daily movement of people, and minimise the risks of the virus flaring up again.

Healthcare providers will triage and prioritise the resumption of healthcare services based on medical necessity, where patients with more urgent medical needs will be attended to first. Services for patients who are well, or whose conditions are stable and whose treatment can continue to be safely deferred will resume in a later phase. Similarly, services which alter the appearance but do not cure or ameliorate disease or illness (e.g. Botox, fillers, threadlifts) will continue to be deferred.

Even as some healthcare services resume, physical visits should be minimised whenever possible, so patients should continue to use teleconsultation and medication delivery.

Visitors from the same or one other household will also be allowed to visit loved ones who have been hospitalised. However, to protect our patients who are still vulnerable, we will allow a maximum of five such visitors to pre-register with the hospital, and only one person will be allowed to visit at a time.

1.01581E+16,"Seniors are especially vulnerable and should continue to take extra precautions after the Circuit Breaker. In Phase 1, with more activities and interactions, there will likely be a higher risk of community transmission. Therefore we will continue with most Circuit Breaker measures for seniors in Phase 1, to ensure that they stay safe.

As family support for seniors remains important, we will allow family members to visit their parents or grandparents staying elsewhere in Phase 1. This will be capped at two visitors from the same visiting household per day to minimise risk of exposure. Essential services such as residential care services, home care, and meals support will also continue. To protect our seniors, face-to-face visits in residential care homes and senior-centric activities will continue to be suspended. We will also continue to complement our precautionary measures with surveillance testing.

While all activities that involve physical interactions amongst seniors remain suspended, we will gradually resume some activities for clients of SACs and CREST providers to address their psychosocial wellbeing. In order to keep interactions low, these will be limited to activities that can be done individually, and with restrictions on the activity duration and total number of persons per session.

Depending on the COVID-19 situation and our risk assessment, we will continue to ease measures gradually and eventually reach a new normal in Phase 3. In order to resume these activities that we enjoy, we must continue to be vigilant. Stay home, avoid crowds, and stay in contact with your friends and family remotely as far as possible.

<End of Circuit Breaker; Resume Activities Safely in Phases>

I thank everyone who has worked hard over the past few weeks to bring down infection rates in the community. Because of our collective efforts, we can now exit the circuit breaker and resume activities in phases starting from 2 June.

The first phase of re-opening will be done in a careful and calibrated manner. More Singaporeans will be able to return to work, and students will go back to school. But many restrictions will still be in place. I know some were hoping to be able to go out freely - to start dining out and meeting their friends. Unfortunately, all this will have to wait.

I hope everyone understands why we have to be cautious. We cannot risk the virus flaring up again. We also must not sacrifice all the efforts that we’ve put in over the last few weeks to bring the outbreak under control.

Some businesses will not be able to open in Phase 1. They include retail shops and those offering personalised services. The government will continue to extend support to these businesses and their workers. DPM Heng will announce the details of these support measures in Parliament next week.

We expect to be in Phase 1 for a few weeks. If the infection rate in the community remains low and stable, and the situation in the dormitories remains under control, then we will be able to move to Phase 2, where we will allow social activities and F&B dining in small groups, and re-open more consumer-facing businesses, as well as public spaces and sports facilities.

So we will need everyone to cooperate and do your part during this first phase of re-opening. If you are going back to work, remember to wear a mask and maintain a safe distance from your colleagues. Refrain from socialising or interacting with them at the office pantry or staff canteen. Continue to practise good personal hygiene and social responsibility. Let’s stay disciplined and focussed, so that we can move to Phase 2 and allow a broader range of activities to resume in good time.",20/5/2020 0:18,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/99117268_3792485637459418_419522273645428736_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=BI_Q_k19gY0AX9aZ-\-\z&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b17f3392514d7d438bd8547a694dc7d4&oe=605780FF,,,,1684,105,691,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158126657100631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/99117268_3792485637459418_419522273645428736_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=BI_Q_k19gY0AX9aZ-\\-\\z&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b17f3392514d7d438bd8547a694dc7d4&oe=605780FF'],10158126657100600

Today is World Family Doctors’ Day, when we recognise the role and contributions of family doctors in providing comprehensive healthcare for patients across their life span.

This year’s theme of “Family doctors on the frontline” aptly pays tribute to the family doctors at our general practitioner (GP) clinics and polyclinics, who have been at the frontline of Singapore’s public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

To date, more than 930 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) have been activated to provide subsidised medical care for eligible patients with respiratory infections such as the common cold and influenza. More than 260 GP clinics and all 20 polyclinics also swab patients who meet the clinical criteria for swabbing as assessed by doctors.

Many family doctors have also come forward to volunteer in the SG Healthcare Corps, to support our healthcare workforce in the #FightAgainstCoVid19. This includes helping to provide onsite medical support and perform swabs at the foreign worker dormitories and community care and recovery facilities.

To our family doctors, thank you for your steadfast dedication during these unprecedented times. As we celebrate World Family Doctors’ Day, we urge all Singaporeans to continue to stay at home and be socially responsible. Let us stand united with our family doctors in this fight against COVID-19.

1.01581E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has assessed the situation and decided to exit the Circuit Breaker when it ends on 1 June 2020. We will embark on a controlled approach to resume activities safely over three phases.

Phase One (“Safe Re-opening”) will be implemented from 2 June. We will first resume economic activities that do not pose high risk of transmission. Social, economic and entertainment activities that carry higher risk will remain closed. Everyone should continue to leave home only for essential activities, and should wear a mask when doing so.

𝐒𝐚𝐟𝐞 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤:
• More Singaporeans will be allowed to return to work, starting with businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks. Most offices can also re-open, but with tele-commuting adopted to the maximum extent, and with safe management measures in place.
• Most retail outlets and other personal services will not re-open in Phase One while dining in at F&B outlets will continue to be disallowed.

𝐒𝐚𝐟𝐞 𝐇𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲:
• As seniors are a particularly vulnerable group, they should continue to stay at home as much as possible.
• Each household will be allowed to visit their parents or grandparents staying elsewhere with some restrictions in place.

𝐒𝐚𝐟𝐞 𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐥: Preschools and schools will also be gradually re-opened.

𝐒𝐚𝐟𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐞:
• Healthcare services such as specialist outpatient services, medical procedures, allied health services, community-based services, and chronic disease management, will resume.
• Preventive health services such as flu vaccinations, will recommence.
• Complementary healthcare services will resume for one-to-one sessions and by appointment.
• Senior Activity Centres will gradually resume some activities in a safe and controlled manner, to address the psychosocial well-being of seniors with little or no social support.

The Taskforce will monitor the daily infection rates which are expected to rise with increased activity in Phase One. If the community transmission rates remain low and stable over the subsequent few weeks, and the dormitory situation remains under control, we can move into Phase Two (“Safe Transition”), with the gradual resumption of more activities. Depending on the COVID-19 situation and our risk assessment, we will continue to ease measures gradually until we reach a new normal in Phase 3 (“Safe Nation”), a state at which we expect to remain until an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is developed.

The road ahead to a new COVID-safe environment may be long. But with everyone playing their part and staying united, we can get through this and emerge stronger from this experience. #SGUnited.

<Resuming activities in a controlled manner>

As we approach the end of the circuit breaker, we are now preparing for the next phase and considering what activities can resume in a safe manner. We will do so in a very careful and calibrated manner. It won’t simply be a return to life before the circuit breaker.

For example, in the construction sector, we will only re-start with a few projects and insist on very tight end-to-end safeguards for these projects. The safeguards include requiring all the workers involved in a project to be housed together (instead of being at multiple dormitories); safe distancing measures at the work sites; and periodic testing of the workers (at 2 week intervals). We expect only about 5% of the construction workforce to work on these projects, and will scale up over time as the industry gains confidence and experience with the measures.

We will apply this same calibrated approach in how we resume normal activities, be it at work, schools, or in our social settings. In other words, don’t expect 100% resumption of activities after 1 June. On the contrary, be fully prepared that many of the current restrictions and measures we have today will continue for some time, so as to keep our family members and loved ones safe.

A controlled and phased exit from the circuit breaker will require patience and discipline from all of us. We must all do our part to control the spread of the virus and ensure that it does not flare up again.",17/5/2020 20:24,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/98565501_3781638415210807_4010084030811734016_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=M5gacp1eo9UAX_a3H2Y&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=1fc16fc0243c5cca1260c050c90a5c1a&oe=6056585D,,,,610,38,85,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158119444255631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/98565501_3781638415210807_4010084030811734016_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=M5gacp1eo9UAX_a3H2Y&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=1fc16fc0243c5cca1260c050c90a5c1a&oe=6056585D'],10158119444255600

Participated in the annual Commonwealth Health Ministers Meeting (#CHMM) this evening to update member states on Singapore’s COVID-19 situation and shared ideas on how Singapore plans to progressively lift our circuit breaker measures and reopen our borders in a safe and calibrated manner.

I shared with the Commonwealth Health Ministers, Singapore’s ABC checklist for lifting measures:

• Assurance that community transmission is stemmed, with new cases maintained at a low level.
• Backing our decisions on any border reopening with a comprehensive assessment of the global situation, public health risks involved and the economic benefits of doing so.
• Continue to detect, isolate, contact trace and quarantine close contacts, to protect ourselves from new imported cases and limit community transmission.

In this unprecedented global health crisis, solidarity and cooperation is needed more than ever. Singapore stands ready to work with Commonwealth member states, World Health Organization (WHO) and the rest of the global community in this #FightAgainstCoVid19!

Delighted to spend my morning speaking to residents and staff at the Singapore Christian Home (SCH) via video-conferencing. Glad that everyone was in good spirits.

This was my first virtual visit to a social service agency - done very differently from my previous visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I am glad to still be able to engage the community even as we heed safe distancing advisories. These measures are necessary for public health reasons, but we should still try to stay connected with our loved ones and with one another, leveraging technology where possible.

I took the opportunity to thank the staff at SCH too. Like many at the other nursing homes, they have made personal sacrifices by staying on-site or at hotels during this period, in order to reduce the risk of bringing in the virus into the nursing homes. Their dedication and selflessness are admirable.

During this period, let us also not forget the longer term needs of our social service agencies. COVID-19 has made it difficult for many to raise funds for their daily operations. The President’s Challenge will continue to support such agencies in a wide range of social services, ranging from vulnerable families and children, to seniors, to persons with mental health conditions, to persons with disabilities, and more. I hope Singaporeans will continue to support our social service agencies through PC. You can do so at https://www.pc.org.sg/take-action/donate/

While COVID-19 cases in the community have been coming down, Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong cautioned that Singapore must not be lulled into a sense of complacency as it progressively eases its Circuit Breaker measures. Instead, precautions like safe distancing and good hygiene practices must be continued as part of a “new normal”, in order to prevent any sharp resurgence of the virus.

He also added that steps are being taken to manage the outbreak in the migrant worker dormitories, so that workers may return to work safely as economic activities are restored.

He was speaking at a Multi-Ministry Taskforce press conference on 12 May 2020.

Testing for COVID-19 infection will be ramped up for Singapore’s migrant worker population living in dormitories, announced Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong at a Multi-Ministry Taskforce press conference on 12 May 2020. Test methods will comprise PCR and serology testing to detect both currently infected workers, as well as those who have recovered from COVID-19. This helps to clear affected dorms thoroughly of the infection.

At the same time, he noted that many currently infected workers are recovering well, with an estimated 20,000 workers set to be discharged by the end of May. This will put Singapore in a favourable position to begin taking steps to reopen the economy in a cautious and calibrated manner.

Since the start of the circuit breaker on 7th April, Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs) from across various government agencies have been deployed on the ground to remind everyone to observe safe distancing measures.
The healthcare sector is no exception, as the safety of our patients and healthcare workers is of paramount importance.

From 11th May, 18 of our very own MOH Safe Distancing Ambassadors, comprising volunteers from the aviation sector, are being deployed to licensed clinics (such as dental and general practitioner clinics, as well as specialist clinics) to ensure that they are implementing safe distancing measures and to assist them with putting these best practices in place. They will also be helping to guide patients at the clinics to check-in and check-out using the #SafeEntry App, which will be useful with contact tracing efforts. They will be working in pairs and will make about 15 to 20 clinic visits per day.

For your own safety and the safety of others, we hope everyone will work with our SDAs to observe the safe distancing measures when you need to go to a clinic. Do stay safe, stay healthy and stay at home as much as possible. Together, we can overcome COVID-19!

<Controlling the Outbreak; Preparing for Next Phase>

We are making progress in controlling the outbreak in the dormitories and in our community. Our daily infection numbers in the community have been coming down steadily. The daily infection numbers from workers in the dormitories have moderated, but they are still high, and will remain so for some time. That’s because we are testing all the workers, even the ones who are well, and discovering many “hidden” cases. This comprehensive testing regime is necessary so that we can clear the dormitories systematically, and ensure the health and well-being of the workers. Meanwhile I’m glad that many of the infected workers are doing well in their recovery process. Around 20,000 will be ready for discharge by the end of this month.

If all goes well, we will be in a position to consider our next moves to ease some of the circuit breaker measures after 1 June. Some have asked for a specific relaxation of the restriction to visit their family members. I can understand why they would like to do so. Many seniors, in particular, miss their children and grandchildren. But we will have to consider this very carefully, because our seniors are a vulnerable group, and if they were to catch the virus, the disease can be lethal for them.

We will look at the evidence over the coming days and assess the situation carefully. If there are still risks, then we may have to hold back on allowing such family visits for a while more, and continue to maintain the current restrictions and safeguards even after 1 June. It will not be an easy decision to make, but I hope Singaporeans understand that our primary aim is to protect our seniors and to save lives.",13/5/2020 10:48,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/95910462_3759957174045598_4187518016096829440_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Zk0j-XdyC1YAX-fS9mV&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=fe2c7b71e0fd5cdaa2519863e9cfb3ba&oe=605575FF,,,,1124,49,198,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158104454320631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/95910462_3759957174045598_4187518016096829440_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Zk0j-XdyC1YAX-fS9mV&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=fe2c7b71e0fd5cdaa2519863e9cfb3ba&oe=605575FF'],10158104454320600

The plan employs a mix of COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and serological tests, and we will do this systematically across all the dormitories to ensure the health and wellbeing of every worker.

We are seeing lower numbers of new community cases daily, and we are making progress in our efforts to test the workers and clear the dormitories.

Visited the Community Care Facilities (CCFs) @EXPO with SPS Amrin Amin this morning to thank the HCWs and ancillary staff for their dedication and hard work in looking after the patients during this COVID-19 pandemic.

All the 10 halls in Singapore EXPO have been converted into CCFs with a total capacity of 8,000 beds. Patients in the CCFs are generally young and assessed to be either early in the disease or are medically stable, requiring less medical attention. However, they are still being monitored on a regular basis with checks on their temperature, oxygen saturation, pulse rate and blood pressure. The medical coverage for the various halls are provided by Woodlands Health Campus, SingHealth and the Singapore Armed Forces. However there are strict protocols in place to prevent intermingling of staff from the various medical clusters and even within each cluster, HCWs are cohorted into different teams and shifts. In addition, safe distancing measures must be strictly observed, especially during resting periods when HCWs are not required to don their full PPEs. HCWs are also required to change out of their civilian clothings into the working scrubs during their duty hours and take a shower at the end of their work shift before going home.

To further enhance protection of the HCWs, physical protective screens are installed at the resting / dining areas to prevent droplets transmission when their masks are removed transiently during meal times. HCWs are also constantly reminded to sanitise their hands regularly and not touch their face, nose and eyes unnecessarily.

I am most impressed with the clean sanitisation tunnel where all personnel are sprayed down with a chemical mist before entering the premises.

Protection of our HCWs and frontline workers is our utmost priority and we will leave no stones unturned in our endeavour to do so. Without a fit and healthy fighting force, there is no way we can win this battle against this invisible foe.

Let us all work together as one #TeamSingapore to #FightAgainstCoVid19. Together, we will overcome this trying and challenging period.

1.01581E+16,"Our study of linked cases in the community found that outside of the household setting, the majority of cases arose from workplace interactions, including work activities such as meetings and discussions, as well as meals or social interactions among colleagues.

To reduce the risk of transmission as we gradually resume activities, all businesses and individuals must uphold good practices and measures that minimise the need for prolonged interactions.
• Good safe management measures like telecommuting, avoiding face-to-face meetings, and regular disinfection of common touch points and equipment should continue.
• At work premises, workers should avoid all social interactions with their colleagues, including during meals and break times.
• Everyone must wear masks when outside of the home
• Please continue to stay home when unwell, and practise good hand and personal hygiene.

Singapore Ministry of Manpower and other relevant agencies will provide more details on the safe management measures which employers are required to implement in various workplace settings, including offices, common meeting and rest areas, factories, customer-facing settings and transportation.

Businesses and services that are in operation must come on board SafeEntry to log the check-in of employees and visitors. As a start, deployment will be made mandatory for places where individuals are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods or in enclosed spaces, or where there is higher traffic. Employees and visitors should check-in and check-out of workplaces and other venues using SafeEntry to help our contact tracers establish cluster links and transmission chains.

Social responsibility is critical in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Even as the circuit breaker measures are gradually eased, all of us should continue to stay at home as much as possible, and minimise movement outside the home. Individuals should adopt good practices and abide by safe distancing measures, and businesses should put in place safe management measures, so that we can resume activities safely and gradually as we exit the circuit breaker period.

<Protecting our Seniors>

Seniors are significantly more at risk from Covid-19. Globally, 80% of Covid-related deaths occur in older persons above 60. In Singapore it is 95%. Many young people with Covid-19 have mild symptoms. But for seniors the disease is severe and potentially life-threatening.

That’s why we are stepping up our precautions at residential care homes serving the elderly. We are putting in place tighter infection controls and prevention practices. We are requiring all resident-facing staff to stay onsite or at designated hotels during the circuit breaker period. We are also testing all 30k residents and staff of these homes - not just once, but on a periodic basis every two weeks.

At the same time, all of us can do our part to protect the seniors in our families. Remind them to stay home as much as possible and minimise contacts with others. If the seniors are living with us, then help them with their errands, so that they can minimise their movement outside. If the seniors are living elsewhere, then stay in touch with them with frequent phone calls, so that they will not feel socially isolated.

Safeguarding the welfare of our seniors is a collective effort. We must do everything we can to keep our seniors safe through this crisis.",9/5/2020 0:02,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/96581211_3745029308871718_1316673437778837504_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=2RsZW56HfmsAX_f6pNP&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=3fa68d2461c0fc151876fb9b551e13dd&oe=6056BE0F,,,,543,26,26,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158087164365631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/96581211_3745029308871718_1316673437778837504_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=2RsZW56HfmsAX_f6pNP&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=3fa68d2461c0fc151876fb9b551e13dd&oe=6056BE0F'],10158087164365600

1.01581E+16,"Since January 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF Singapore), and Agency for Integrated Care - AIC Singapore have worked with residential care homes on a range of safeguards.

To further reduce the exposure of these Homes to COVID-19 infection risks in the community, we have worked with the homes to arrange for resident-facing staff to stay at designated accommodation facilities on-site or at hotels during the circuit breaker period. About 3,000 are in the process of moving into hotels.

Testing is an important strategy to detect COVID-19 infections amongst our vulnerable groups as early as possible to limit further transmission. MOH, AIC and MSF have initiated testing for all 30,000 residents and staff of nursing homes, welfare homes, sheltered homes and adult disability homes.

During the circuit breaker period, essential services have remained in operation, to ensure that seniors and their caregivers can receive the support they need at home. For example, service providers and charity organisations have worked together to conduct home visits and deliver cooked meals and groceries to seniors with inadequate family support. The Silver Generation Office has also proactively checked in on about 20,000 seniors with weak family support.

From 12 May, medical halls which sell herbal products but do not have a registered TCM practitioner on-site will be allowed to commence operations, subject to the necessary safe management measures being in place.

Even as we gradually lift movement restrictions, we must stay vigilant and look out for the vulnerable amongst us. Safeguarding the wellbeing of seniors is a collective effort, and each of us can play our part to support one another. We urge Singaporeans to connect seniors to help where needed, and to make more frequent phone calls to your family members and loved ones. #SGUnited

Since the start of our #FightAgainstCoVid19, our healthcare workers have been working tirelessly to care for our patients. Many have risen up to the occasion and gone above and beyond, and I thank them for their dedication and commitment.

We have also witnessed the wider community coming together to support our healthcare workers. Many Singaporeans have shown their appreciation with cards and words of encouragement, while many local companies such as Gourmet Food Holdings, Grab, Zouk Group and Mothership have banded together to support our healthcare workers.

The “Food For Frontline” initiative by Mr Peter Lim and his team is another such example. Starting today, #FoodForFrontline will be providing meal vouchers to about 20,000 frontline healthcare workers from our nine public hospitals and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, including support staff such as patient care assistants and other ancillary staff. Many food vendors offering local delights have also come on board so that our healthcare workers can redeem their meals at over 160 outlets.

Thank you, Singapore, for your wonderful show of support and acts of kindness for our healthcare family. Above all, the best that we can do to help our healthcare family is to stay home, stay safe and stay healthy. I believe that together, we can tide through these challenging times.

This morning, I represented the Ministry of Health, Singapore to receive China’s donation of 500,000 surgical masks and 100,000 KN95 masks from Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China H.E. Hong Xiaoyong.

I would like to express my sincere appreciation for China’s offer of humanitarian assistance. Singapore and China share a very close and longstanding friendship. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have been providing mutual support to each other. Earlier in February this year, Singapore dispatched diagnostic test kits and medical supplies to China to help communities affected by the coronavirus.

Mutual assistance and cooperation are especially crucial during this period. We will continue to work closely with China and the global community to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gan Kim Yong, Lawrence Wong and Josephine Teo updated Parliament on the COVID-19 situation today.

We are in the second week of the tightened circuit breaker measures. We see positive signs the measures have reduced transmission of the disease, but we must not let our guard down prematurely. We have to step up testing of vulnerable groups like the elderly in nursing homes, and continue to look after our migrant workers who have been deeply affected by this.

We are closely watching the experience of other countries which have begun to open up. We are constantly reviewing and updating our practices to keep our people safe. It will not be easy, but let us help one other adjust and learn new behaviours and skills.

We have surprised ourselves with our Singapore Spirit. Volunteers are contributing their time, energy and resources to help those in need, while public officers have stepped out of their comfort zones to take up new frontline responsibilities. Private sector firms have also contributed greatly by providing equipment for essential services, as well as staff to fill in the gaps.

Everyone is adjusting to working, learning, living, and playing in a COVID-19 world. We have a long journey ahead, but if we continue to work together, I am confident we will come through and emerge stronger. – LHL

The tighter circuit breaker measures have been in place for about two weeks, and I am glad to note that everyone has been playing their part and practising safe distancing. We have seen a decrease in community transmission, and my colleagues in the Multi-Ministry Taskforce had announced yesterday that while many of the tighter circuit breaker measures will remain, some measures will be progressively eased.

Selected services and activities will be allowed to resume in the coming weeks, including Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). I’m happy to share that from 5 May, TCM needle acupuncture will be allowed for pain management, if assessed by the TCM practitioner to be essential. However, cupping, moxibustion, guasha and tuina manipulative therapies will not be allowed.

Currently, TCM halls with registered TCM practitioners are providing consultation and herbal dispensary services even under the tighter circuit breaker measures. From 5 May, they will also be allowed to sell retail products. We hope this will be welcome news for to Singaporeans who use TCM.

Most of the other circuit breaker measures are still important to help keep transmission of COVID-19 low in the community. So let us all continue to play our part – to stay home as much as possible, wear masks if you need to go out, practise safe distancing and good personal hygiene.",3/5/2020 14:17,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/95684568_3353703477973403_3155517394403721216_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=fmilxslMhkAAX_b0t92&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=a3234132cfc691a9361405ebb2999f12&oe=60572017,,,,252,10,13,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158065565425631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/95684568_3353703477973403_3155517394403721216_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=fmilxslMhkAAX_b0t92&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=a3234132cfc691a9361405ebb2999f12&oe=60572017'],10158065565425600

<One More Week of Tightened Circuit Breaker Measures; Gradual Easing Thereafter>

We tightened the circuit breaker measures two weeks ago and said we would review the situation by 4 May. To date, we have seen a reduction in our daily community infection numbers. But we are still not in single digits. So aside from some minor adjustments (for TCM practitioners and what one can do within the grounds of strata-titled residential developments), we will have to continue with the tight measures for at least another week.

From 12 May, we can allow some gradual easing of these tightened measures. In particular, we will allow selected activities and services to resume operations, including home-based businesses, selected food manufacturing and retail outlets; laundry and barber services, and pet supplies stores.

We will also phase in the reopening of the economy, and allow more people to resume going to work. The key precondition for this to happen is stricter requirements in the workplace for safe distancing, with employers to take ownership and responsibility of these measures. The specific measures are being worked out, and government agencies will be engaging industry associations, business chambers and firms in the coming days.

One specific requirement is that all businesses must put in place the SafeEntry app to log the entry and exit of their staff and visitors. This information will enable us to speed up contact tracing.

Further down the road, from 19 May, we will start to bring back students in small groups for face-to-face lessons. We will focus on the graduating cohort who are taking national exams, and amongst them, priority will be given to those who require school facilities for coursework and practical sessions, and those who need additional support during the school vacation period. The Institutions of Higher Learning especially the ITEs will also bring back small groups of students on campus for critical consultations, projects or practicums

We have provided a broad outline of how we intend to adjust the measures in the coming weeks so that everyone knows what to expect. But the situation is fluid, and the measures may have to be further adjusted along the way.

Most importantly, remember that the circuit breaker is still in place till 1 June. This is not the time to slacken and let our guard down. We must continue to stay disciplined and vigilant. Stay home as much as possible. Go out for essential activities only, and when you have to do so, try to go out one person at a time. We still have a long fight ahead of us, and the virus can flare up again anytime. Let’s stay focused, work together and win this fight against the virus.",2/5/2020 22:04,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/95093527_3722431751131474_4174396100733566976_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=T5QxgeL7RSsAX_X71Kj&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e8d96fa4cb4925df35aeb243fa88f0da&oe=60548593,,,,586,31,82,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158062517555631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/95093527_3722431751131474_4174396100733566976_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=T5QxgeL7RSsAX_X71Kj&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e8d96fa4cb4925df35aeb243fa88f0da&oe=60548593'],10158062517555600

Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, our nursing homes have been working very hard to ensure that our vulnerable seniors remain protected and well cared for. Many personal sacrifices have been made, and I want to thank all nursing home staff and senior management for your dedication in answering the call of duty and doing your utmost in ensuring that the homes remain a safe place for everyone.

The current precautionary measures put in place by nursing homes have been effective, but we cannot be complacent. We need to do more to protect our seniors, who are at higher risk of developing serious health complications if infected with COVID-19. We also need to protect our nursing home staff, whose work is crucial in ensuring the well-being of our elderly home residents. This is why we are prioritising homes serving the elderly.

Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong and I held a webinar with the nursing homes’ senior leadership this morning to talk about two additional support measures that MOH and MSF will be extending to all Homes serving the elderly. As an pre-emptive step, we are prioritising testing for all staff and residents in these Homes. This will ensure that any cryptic COVID-19 infections can be detected as early as possible for treatment. MOH and MSF will fund all tests and follow-up treatments.

We are also working with the Homes to facilitate lodging for staff at designated accommodation facilities on-site or at hotels, to reduce their exposure to the community during the circuit breaker period. We will provide financial support to both nursing homes and staff affected by this measure.

These are unprecedented times, but through collective efforts, we will be better able to tackle the COVID-19 outbreak and protect those who are more vulnerable in our community.

1.01581E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will ease some of the tighter circuit breaker measures, which were announced on 21 April 2020, progressively over the coming weeks. At the same time, we are preparing for the safe and gradual resumption of economic and community activities after the end of the circuit breaker period on 1 June 2020. We will be tapping on digital solutions, such as the SafeEntry check-in system, and deploying them more pervasively when we resume these activities.

We plan to phase in the reopening of work premises, taking into account their importance to the economy and supply chains, their contribution to local employment, and their ability to minimise risks of transmission at their workplaces. To do so safely, we will impose more stringent requirements on all employers and firms.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will also allow the gradual resumption of selected activities and services in the coming weeks, subject to the necessary safe management measures being in place.

From 19 May 2020, schools will bring back students from graduating cohorts in small groups for face-to-face consultations and lessons.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will closely observe the trends over the coming weeks, and adjust further as necessary.

Social responsibility is critical in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Even as the circuit breaker measures are gradually eased, all of us should continue to stay at home as much as possible, and minimise movement outside the home. In the community and at workplaces, we must keep up good habits such as safe distancing, personal hygiene and wearing of masks. This must be our new normal in a COVID-19 world. #SGUnited

Did you know that loss of sense of smell is a symptom of COVID-19?

We all know that if we have a fever, we should see the doctor. But if we suddenly lose our sense of smell (or taste), we may not understand what it means, or react promptly.

So If you lose your sense of smell, even if you feel otherwise quite well, please use this online COVID-19 Symptom Checker to get a recommendation whether to see a doctor:

<Comprehensive Medical Strategy for Covid-19>

The Taskforce has put in place a comprehensive medical plan to tackle Covid-19. We have tiered facilities to care for infected patients according to their medical needs. This enables us to deploy our medical resources optimally and to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.

Our hospitals will care for those with more severe conditions. We now have 1451 Covid-19 cases in hospitals and 20 in Intensive Care Unit. Our hospitals are continuing to expand their capacity in isolation wards and ICUs.

Not all infected patients have a severe illness. For the majority of patients with mild or even no symptoms, they can be admitted to a Community Care Facility (CCF) where most will recover with minimal intervention. Patients in CCFs are monitored closely in case they need to be transferred to hospitals for more intensive care and management. We now have about 10,000 CCF bed spaces at the Singapore Expo and the Changi Exhibition Centre; and we plan to double this capacity to 20,000 beds by end-June.

Patients who remain well after day 14 of the illness are likely to remain clinically stable and generally do not require any further medical care. So we transfer these patients to a step-down Community Recovery Facility (CRF). We now have a capacity of over 2000 beds in CRF sites, and will increase our CRF capacity to more than 10,000 beds by end-June.

Besides more medical facilities, we also need an augmented healthcare workforce. MOH has sought the support of professionals in the private sector to join the newly launched SG Healthcare Corps. Many from the healthcare sector have already come on board. Some from other industries are part of the Corps too, including SIA cabin crew who are now serving as care ambassadors, together with our nursing staff.

We have been able to execute this national medical plan within a very short timeframe because of strong public-private partnerships. We have mobilised resources across many public sector agencies, including the SAF. Importantly many private organisations have stepped forward too - Temasek Holdings, Singapore Expo, Experia Events, Resorts World Sentosa, Mandarin Oriental, PSA, ST Engineering, Certis Cisco, Parkway Pantai, Surbana Jurong, Raffles Medical etc.

We appreciate the contributions of everyone who has worked round the clock to get ready the facilities and who are continuing to serve in different roles. Through our combined efforts we are able to take care of all infected patients and ensure we have sufficient healthcare capacity for the longer term. This is #SGUnited at work; and that’s the Singapore Spirit that will enable us to beat the virus together!",28/4/2020 22:28,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/94884779_3707828205925162_5289525341994352640_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=OY6j6PO0jcAAX843zp7&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=aacc4fe9a0a351cad16052de211c173e&oe=60558767,,,,1784,83,178,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158046391735631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/94884779_3707828205925162_5289525341994352640_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=OY6j6PO0jcAAX843zp7&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=aacc4fe9a0a351cad16052de211c173e&oe=60558767', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/94607724_3707828375925145_6881456958826610688_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=uoRQNCJb93kAX-miSu1&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=2cc44f206d0a99925728dd2a4f2c6fb2&oe=6056EC72', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/94869026_3707828272591822_4412059529101967360_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=g9raOEK1K5MAX8EPjS1&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=5b1b1bf2011ea06971ac3eac9074994e&oe=6056B6DD', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/94706901_3707828319258484_895767042202796032_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1g0mfqNiMKkAX-cWSmY&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=301855d30df780bc6f3cbccea358b019&oe=60569087']",10158046391735600

1.0158E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has a comprehensive medical strategy to ensure that individuals infected with COVID-19 receive prompt and quality medical treatment.

The clinical and scientific data from managing COVID-19 patients, as well as the current epidemiological evidence on the infection, have provided the bases for a comprehensive medical plan. The plan guides the admission of patients into the appropriate tiered facilities for medical care and support, the transfer of patients between these facilities according to their needs, and the discharge of patients who are well and no longer infectious. The aim is to deploy our medical resources optimally so as to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.

To support this plan, we have established a number of Community Care Facilities (CCFs) and Community Recovery Facilities (CRFs). We have also augmented our healthcare workforce and deployed them to provide the appropriate level of care in the different facilities and settings, according to the needs of patients.

The CCF capacity has been rapidly increased, starting with about 500 beds at D’Resort NTUC to about 10,000 spaces currently. We are continuing to expand our CCFs, aiming to double their capacity to 20,000 beds by end-June.

We now have a capacity of over 2,000 beds in CRF sites, and intend to ramp up our CRF capacity to more than 10,000 beds by end-June.

This expansion of our medical facilities has to be supported by a healthcare workforce. We have taken a two-pronged approach: One, we have tapped on private sector healthcare professionals, retirees and volunteers; and two, we are making full use of technology as an enabler.

We have been able to mobilise our medical facilities and provide such enhanced support within a very short time because of a Whole-of-Society effort, bringing together government agencies and the private sector. Through their combined efforts, we are able to take care of all infected patients, and ensure we have sufficient healthcare capacity for the longer term.

<Scaling up our Testing Capabilities>

Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. That’s why we have been steadily building up our national testing capacity.

From an average of 2,900 tests per day in early April, we are now able to conduct more than 8,000 tests per day. We are continuing to expand our testing capacity in the coming weeks and months.

To date, Singapore has tested about 2,100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the US has tested 1,600 per 100,000 and the UK 1,000 per 100,000. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up more cases.

In our migrant worker dormitories, for example, we have been testing around 3000 workers every day (including the workers that are asymptomatic), and will continue to do more tests. So far, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about 1 in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6,500 per 100,000), far higher than the testing rates seen in countries like South Korea (one in 90, or 1,100 per 100,000).

One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community.

We are also doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes and senior residential homes, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers.

As more testing capacity is brought on-stream, we will gradually expand testing to the wider pool of workers. This expanded testing regime is of critical importance in enabling us to safely resume economic activities beyond the circuit breaker period.",27/4/2020 23:09,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/94606282_3704472012927448_3513439043771695104_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=nBZqgBvdqsYAX_QdSH2&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4453fe555b204b8fae54997d44f7c4e2&oe=6054AD0D,,,,727,32,67,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158042571825631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/94606282_3704472012927448_3513439043771695104_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=nBZqgBvdqsYAX_QdSH2&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4453fe555b204b8fae54997d44f7c4e2&oe=6054AD0D'],10158042571825600
1.0158E+16,"Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been steadily building up our national capacity to conduct tests for COVID-19. Testing is used for three key purposes. First, for diagnosis in order to provide the appropriate treatment early for persons who are unwell. Second, for active case finding in order to identity infected individuals early and isolate them. Contact tracing around confirmed cases allows us to ring-fence any clusters, and prevent further transmissions. And third, for surveillance purposes, in particular of groups at higher risk of contracting or transmitting the disease.

Such testing is done systematically across our hospitals, polyclinics and general practitioner clinics. A similar testing strategy is applied to our migrant worker community, including those living in dormitories. We have been testing close to 3,000 migrant workers residing at the dormitories every day, and will continue to do more tests. To date, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested.

While testing is important, it has to be part of a broader strategy to fight COVID-19. Testing alone cannot substitute for other important measures like safe distancing and infection control. Individual responsibility in upholding good personal hygiene, minimising contact, and seeing a doctor immediately when sick are all critical aspects of the overall strategy. Together, we can slow down transmissions, beat the virus, and emerge stronger after the crisis.

Singapore Expo's Covid-19 care facility: How Surbana Jurong set up 2 halls in 3 days

Lee Hsien Loong
26 April 2020 at 18:44 ·

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to improvise and come up with innovative, workable solutions on the ground. It's a constant trial and error, to find the best way to help the most people in the shortest time.

With many more COVID-19 cases, mostly mild, we urgently needed a solution to house the large numbers, and not let our hospitals get swamped.

This TODAY article shows a timelapse of how two halls in Singapore Expo were converted into a temporary isolation facility for 950 patients in just three days. We now have four halls completed and occupied, and six more soon to come.

Other locations being repurposed include the Changi Exhibition Centre (http://cna.asia/2x8BlUy) for 2,800 people, and Tanjong Pagar Terminal (https://str.sg/JMnZ) for 15,000.

These community facilities allow our hospitals to focus on the more serious cases. Many people worked very hard to make this happen. Medical staff from both restructured and private hospitals have stepped forward to look after the patients in these facilities. To all of you, a heartfelt thank you! – LHL

<Extended Circuit Breaker>

We are seeing some results from the circuit breaker but these are still early days and we cannot let up. We must hunker down and push harder to break the transmission chain decisively.

First, we call on everyone to minimise movement. Stay home as much as possible. If you need to go out to buy food or groceries, do so by yourself. If you need to go out to exercise, do so by yourself and in your neighbourhood. This is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones.

Second, we will tighten access to popular areas where people are still gathering, like wet markets and supermarkets, so that safe distancing measures can be better implemented. For a start we will introduce a new control measure in selected popular wet markets to limit entry to alternate days.

Third we will close more work premises and tighten the list of essential services. The aim is to reduce the number of essential workers still out and about, so that we can minimise movement and interactions. Additional requirements will also be put in place to ensure that these workers and their employers uphold safe distancing measures at their workplaces.

We will implement the above measures from now till 4 May. Beyond that we will have to extend the circuit breaker for another 4 weeks till 1 June. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and if we are able to bring down our community infection numbers decisively, then we can consider easing some of the measures gradually.

I thank all Singaporeans and residents who have made tremendous efforts and sacrifices to observe the circuit breaker measures so far. We are asking more from everyone now. We are mindful of the impact, and the government will continue to help employers and workers through the extended circuit breaker period. Ultimately this is a test of our unity, resilience and resolve. If we all do our part, we can stamp out the virus and overcome this together.",21/4/2020 23:44,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/93788337_3681984055176244_1950976267004149760_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=0kwrqfAiTJEAX_bIMgE&_nc_oc=AQmhPeV9-b6LWIepfhfUOZzibFjcP0gFU_HAfWN_6c0plkajfpIx2DcWwyDU7jnqfYU&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=abe1c2b6100c18b9b24c94d9e4ad19cf&oe=6055EDC3,,,,791,60,79,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158015544025631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/93788337_3681984055176244_1950976267004149760_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=0kwrqfAiTJEAX_bIMgE&_nc_oc=AQmhPeV9-b6LWIepfhfUOZzibFjcP0gFU_HAfWN_6c0plkajfpIx2DcWwyDU7jnqfYU&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=abe1c2b6100c18b9b24c94d9e4ad19cf&oe=6055EDC3'],10158015544025600

The tighter measures will be in place minimally for a two-week period from 21 April 2020 until 4 May 2020 (inclusive). In view of the current situation, the Taskforce will also extend the circuit breaker period by another 4 weeks until 1 June 2020 (inclusive).

We are now two weeks into our circuit breaker. I will be giving an update on where we are now and what we need to do next at 5pm today on TV and radio. You can also watch it ‘live’ here on my Facebook page.

This is an uncertain and worrying time for many of us, especially with the large number of cases in the migrant worker dorms. Our teams have been working hard to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the dorms, and look after the well-being of our migrant workers.

I urge everyone to persevere with the circuit breaker measures, and continue to help one another through this outbreak. – LHL

<Stay Home Notice for Construction Workers>

Our analysis of the virus outbreak amongst workers in the dormitories showed that many of them are in the construction sector. From the epidemiological findings, there is evidence that the transmission (across multiple dormitories) could have occured at worksites, or at places the workers congregate during their days off to shop and socialise.

Most construction work has already stopped earlier (since the start of the circuit breaker) and the dorms have also been locked down. But there are construction workers still renting and staying in premises outside the dorms. So we have decided to put these workers on Stay Home Notice till 4 May. Employers have to uphold their responsibilities too. They will be required to check on the health of their workers during this period and to take care of their food and other daily needs. MOM and BCA will also step up inspection checks in these premises. Enforcement action will be taken against anyone who breaches the SHN, as well as their employers. These are strict but necessary moves to prevent further spread of the virus.

<Foreign Worker Dormitories>

We are going all out to suppress the virus outbreak in the foreign worker dormitories. It’s a massive undertaking involving many people on the frontline - including SAF and SPF officers, officials from MOM, healthcare doctors and nurses, as well as many private sector partners including security firms like Certis Cisco and food caterers like SATs.

The team is going into the dorms to actively test the workers and isolate the infected ones from the healthy, and to ensure their overall well-being. The vast majority of the workers are young, and they tend to have very mild cough/cold symptoms that are not picked up by temperature taking alone. So the teams are working doubly hard to sweep through the dorms and test the workers, and this is also the reason why we are seeing such high reported cases every day. We have to expect the numbers to remain high for some time as we continue this effort to swab, test and isolate the workers.

We are rapidly expanding our community care facilities at the Singapore Expo and other sites to take care of the infected workers. Most of them have a mild illness; no one is in the ICU. After the workers fully recover (and test negative), they will need a place to stay. So we are also preparing additional facilities to accommodate them.

Covid-19 will be with us for many more months, and likely beyond the end of the year. We have to be prepared for future waves of infection and we have to steel ourselves for a long fight. As we all do our part to stay home, let’s also remember our frontline personnel working round the clock, as well as our foreign workers who are fighting the virus alongside Singaporeans. We will overcome this together.",17/4/2020 23:14,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/92926825_3667650389942944_1087619868355723264_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=gHYKhEqNekYAX-z_Dfk&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=03eb028d07a25ee03e3908cd4ab96259&oe=6057CDA1,,,,2473,116,382,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157996396970631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/92926825_3667650389942944_1087619868355723264_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=gHYKhEqNekYAX-z_Dfk&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=03eb028d07a25ee03e3908cd4ab96259&oe=6057CDA1'],10157996396970600

Paid an “e-visit” to the team at the Singapore Ministry of Manpower Services Center at Bendemeer Road and met the Interagency Task Force.

The task force brings together efforts across the Whole-of-Government to look after and treat migrant workers in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially those living in dormitories. Public officers from various agencies have been deployed to the dormitories to care for the workers. Not all speak the native languages of the foreign workers, so we are working with the ambassadors from the Migrant Workers' Centre who are migrant workers themselves. I was encouraged to learn that the workers recognise our collective efforts and are working with us.

On another front, our Safe Distancing Ambassadors have also been hard at work in the community. Many of us are practising new habits and keeping a safe distance. But quite a few have still not got used to this. Many Ambassadors are volunteers who care, and want to do something. We are grateful for their efforts and service.

I am grateful to the public officers quietly carrying out essential tasks under great pressure, and I am sure you will be too. I am glad private individuals and community groups are also doing their part. They are raising funds for foreign workers, sewing masks, and rendering help to the homeless. May the Singapore spirit shine brightly as we go through this difficult period together. – LHL

At the Multi-Ministry Taskforce Conference on 14 April 2020, Minister for National Development, Lawrence Wong, announced that the Government will tighten current measures by making it mandatory for everyone to wear a mask when they go out. Children under the age of two are exempted from this new rule due to concerns over child safety. Those participating in strenuous exercises such as jogging or running are also allowed to remove their masks temporarily when engaging in such activities. He stressed that the Government will continue to take strict action against those who breach the circuit breaker measures. The first offense will incur a fine of $300 and the second offense $1000 or prosecution in court.

<Epidemic Curves>

These charts provide some useful insights on the virus situation in Singapore.

The number of imported cases rose around mid-March due to the large number of returnees then, but it has since come down to zero.

The number of cases in the community increased following the wave of imported cases. But there has been some moderation in recent days, in light of the safe distancing measures that have been put in place.

The number of work permit and dormitory-related cases has increased sharply, and this is likely to continue going up, especially as we undertake more aggressive testing of workers at the dormitories.

As I had shared earlier, we have a comprehensive strategy to take care of our foreign workers and contain the virus in the dorms. This will take some time, but we are going all out to tackle this.

Today our Enforcement Officers reported that there are still too many people not taking the circuit breaker measures seriously. We issued more than 3,000 stern warnings today, and more fines! Stiffer penalties are clearly needed.

From tomorrow, we will no longer issue written warnings. Any offender encountered by our Enforcement Officers will be asked for particulars immediately, and will face the following:

1st offence: $300 fine
Repeat offenders: Higher fines, or prosecution in court for egregious cases.

The health and safety of Singaporeans are at risk. It is therefore our top priority and collective responsibility. I have been receiving a lot of feedback on the circuit breaker measures. Many of you shared photos and videos of people (both young and old) who are still not staying at home, or not complying with the elevated safe distancing measures. Please don't send photos that you did not take yourselves as some of these cause our officers to waste time pursuing past events.

To further safeguard public health, we have made it mandatory for all food handlers and wet market stallholders to wear masks. This will be enforced from 13 April. All visitors to wet markets should wear masks from tomorrow. Those who do not will not be allowed to enter the markets managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators.

Many of us are working hard to protect Singaporeans, including healthcare workers, cleaners, those in essential services, and our public service officers too. Many in the community have also started their own initiatives to chip in and to help others around them. The simplest thing everyone can do is to #StayhomeforSG. Let us get through this together.

The COVID-19 pandemic is moving fast and furious across the globe. As of 11th April 2020, more than 1.65 million people have been infected with more than 100,000 deaths worldwide.

Since the epidemic began 5 months ago, there is still no definite treatment for the novel coronavirus infection. Many of those infected recovered due to our bodies’ own immune system fighting off this virus.

The world is racing against time to find therapeutics and vaccines to #FightAgainstCoVid19. There are currently several streams of medical research and trials to find the cure for this coronavirus infection. We have read about repurposing existing drugs, manufacturing monoclonal antibodies and developing vaccines, but all these will take time, with the former being viewed with most optimism in terms of timeline and vaccines on the other end of the spectrum, likely taking many months or even years.

Many countries are looking at repurposing drugs - basically finding new uses for old drugs as it is a good strategy especially when racing to fight a new rapidly spreading disease like COVID-19. Many trials are looking at existing drugs, that combat HIV (Lopinavir/Ritonavir), Influenza (Avigan or Favipiravir), Malaria (Chloroquine and its derivative Hydroxycholoroquine) and Ebola (Remdesivir), as they are found to work in vitro in the laboratories. Even then, it will probably take months to assess the optimal therapeutic dosage, efficacy and potential side effects in humans before they can be deployed widely to treat the disease.

Scientists are also working to identify which antibodies are most potent to fight off the coronavirus. When the human body is infected by the virus, our immune system will produce antibodies to help fight off the infection. Once identified, there is a need to see if these antibodies can block the virus from infecting cells in vitro, followed by testing on animals and humans. The above processes will likely take months, before the pharmaceutical companies will make vast quantities of identical copies of these antibodies synthetically. These monoclonal antibodies will be useful in treating patients with COVID-19.

But the best solution to this pandemic lies on the discovery of an effective vaccine against the coronavirus. Several countries are already racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. With technological advancements and a greater commitment by governments and non-profit organisations to fund research, I am hopeful that this will shorten the time from discovery to deployment of the vaccine to hopefully months or a few years. Clinical trials are still the rate-limiting steps in determining its efficacy and safety. Even when a vaccine makes it through all the rounds of testing, it is unlikely that drug makers can manufacture enough of the vaccine to protect everyone in the world.

Till then, our best bet is still to protect ourselves from being infected in the first place. Personal hygiene, wearing of mask and safe distancing are vital during this circuit breaker period. #StayHome and #StaySafe! We can overcome this together !

We saw our largest daily number of COVID-19 cases so far yesterday. Many were from foreign worker dormitories. My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously — stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

Secondly, Medical posts will be set up in the dorms to screen for infections, and to separate healthy workers from ones who are sick.

<Infection Clusters in Foreign Worker Dorms>

We are now dealing with two separate infections in Singapore. The first is in the foreign workers dormitories, where the numbers are rising sharply. The second is in the general population, where the numbers are also going up but not as quickly.

The FW dorm issue is a major concern because of the large numbers living in close quarters, which is resulting in big clusters. We also want to prevent cross-infection from the dorms to the rest of the population. That’s why we have mounted a comprehensive response to tackle this issue, involving resources and personnel from the SAF and SPF.

There are two key aspects in our FW dorm strategy. First, we are working with the dorm operators to ensure effective management of all dorms. This includes taking care of the daily needs and well-being of the workers; as well as minimising their movement to prevent further spread of the virus.

Second we are putting in place a whole series of public health measures in the dorms. This includes forward deployment of medical posts for faster response, and active screening and testing of the workers - to separate those that are infected and sick from those that are healthy.

To do all this well, we will need to reduce the number of workers in each of the dorms. So we are moving out workers who are not sick, starting with those in essential services who are continuing to work. They will be housed in alternative venues including SAF military camps, Changi exhibition centre, floatels (floating hotels typically used by offshore marine workers), and a few vacant HDB blocks.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and I spoke on the phone this afternoon. We updated each other on how we are managing COVID-19 in Singapore and New Zealand. We are both implementing strict circuit breaking measures, to break transmission of the virus and squeeze the cases down.

PM Ardern shared that after New Zealand implemented their measures, numbers only started to come down on Day 11. We are only in Day 3 and still have a long way to go. If we all comply strictly, as the New Zealanders have done, hopefully by our Day 11 we too will see positive results.

PM Ardern and I also discussed how we can support each other during this time, including keeping supply chains intact between the two countries. Both Singapore and New Zealand will continue to do our part in this global fight against COVID-19.

At home, Masagos Zulkifli has announced that enforcement officers will immediately take down the particulars of anyone breaching the measures (https://go.gov.sg/u5gbvi). We cannot wait to save lives. Please do your part today. – LHL

<Dedicated SHN Facilities for All Returnees>

Over the past week, we have been working with more hotel operators to prepare their premises for the Stay Home Notice (SHN) requirements. We now have more capacity and so will be able to accommodate all travellers returning to Singapore at these dedicated facilities.

Returnees will be transported straight from the airport to these hotels, in order to serve out their 14-day self-isolation period. In other words, they will no longer be isolated at home. This additional move will help keep our border controls tight.

Besides the hotel operators, there is a lot that happens at the airport to implement the entire SHN regime. Frontline workers - from immigration to healthcare, security and transport - ensure that the returnees to Singapore are properly screened and transported safely to their respective hotels. We thank all involved for their hard work.

Meanwhile let’s all do our part to observe strictly the circuit breaker - stay at home and go out only for essential activities. Keep safe everyone!

The full suite of “circuit breaker” measures kicked in today. Cabinet still had to meet, but we separated into two locations, connected via teleconferencing. We also spaced out to maintain safe distancing, and wore masks to keep our droplets to ourselves.

The “circuit breaker” is essential to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. As we expected, daily numbers of new cases are still going up, and faster than before. We must bring the numbers down, and the only way is for all of us to observe the circuit breaker measures strictly.

Stay at home, except when you have to go out to do essential work or buy food. If you need to go to the market, stagger your timing too. Avoid being part of the crowd. This is not a month long holiday, when we can go out for jalan jalan or to meet up with friends.

The health of us all depends on the actions of each of us. Please do your part. – LHL

This morning, PM Lee Hsien Loong was invited by the World Health Organization Western Pacific Region (WHO WPRO) to deliver a message at the Second Virtual Meeting of Health Ministers in the Western Pacific Region. PM shared with the international community on Singapore’s experience
in the fight against COVID-19. Indeed, we are all fighting the same enemy – COVID-19 and global cooperation is crucial to win this battle. I am glad to be able to participate at this meeting again to share our perspective and learn from fellow Member States.

Being an urban city, Singapore is especially vulnerable to infectious disease threats. We learnt from our experiences during the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks, and invested resources in pandemic preparedness over the years. The COVID-19 pandemic is yet another painful reminder for all Member States - that it is never too early to invest in robust pandemic preparedness and response.

Singapore stands in solidarity with the international community in our fight against COVID-19. As Member States continue to fight the battle within their countries and in their own unique way, we must also cooperate with one another, in order to accelerate the path towards winning the battle together.

Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong and I participated in the Special Video Conferences of the ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting and ASEAN Plus Three (People’s Republic of China, Japan, and Republic of Korea) Health Ministers Meeting today.

The meetings were held to enhance regional cooperation on our response towards the COVID-19 pandemic. I shared on Singapore’s national efforts and updated the meeting on our latest circuit breaker measures to curb the local transmission of the virus.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a grave global concern affecting not just the health sector, but the whole society and economy. It is imperative that countries work together to share best practices on public health efforts, as well as keep supply chains open in order to minimize the impact of this crisis on our people. We should also step up collaborations amongst our scientific and research community for the development of an effective vaccine or therapeutics against the Coronavirus. This is the only way we can shorten the crisis and save lives. Until then, everyone of us should do our part to #flattenthecurve .

<Start of Circuit Breaker>

Our nation-wide circuit breaker measures starts today. Safe Distance ambassadors and Enforcement Agencies are fanning out all over Singapore to get the message out and ensure compliance with the rules. Penalties will be meted out to those who flout the rules.

But this goes beyond penalties and fines. Every individual must proactively do their part. Our efforts and sacrifices during this circuit breaker period can be completely undermined by just one lapse or one weak link. As we have seen over the past weeks, one single case can easily develop into a large cluster. So we must all take this very seriously, and be very disciplined about staying at home, and significantly reducing our social interactions.

We are very mindful of the difficulties that businesses, workers and households are facing during this period. That’s why the Government has significantly stepped up support, initially through the #UnityBudget and #ResilienceBudget, and now the #SolidarityBudget, which DPM Heng Swee Keat just announced in Parliament.

Together we can protect our families and loved ones, and keep them safe. We still have a long road ahead of us and it not be an easy journey. But if we all rise to the occasion with unity and resolve and continue to support one another, we will beat the virus and emerge stronger.",7/4/2020 13:57,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/92134333_3631092436932073_3182561613760692224_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=j6p1Kl83SLoAX-Hd0BX&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=7ae7a4ca7554f33a1f2f796edf3cd89c&oe=6056A939,,,,715,79,159,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157955731865631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/92134333_3631092436932073_3182561613760692224_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=j6p1Kl83SLoAX-Hd0BX&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=7ae7a4ca7554f33a1f2f796edf3cd89c&oe=6056A939'],10157955731865600

Today is World Health Day – a global health campaign organised by the World Health Organization (WHO). This year’s theme celebrates the work of nurses and midwives — a fitting one to salute the healthcare professionals working selflessly and tirelessly to care for patients in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I was cheered by this video of “Home” sung by around 70 of our healthcare workers, and dedicated to all Singaporeans and fellow healthcare workers. Glad to see them positive and in good spirits during these tough times. My deepest thanks to all of you for your dedication and commitment to save lives and bring comfort to the ill and infirm.

Our month long circuit breaker starts today. Let us all do our part to support our healthcare professionals by staying at home, and complying with the enhanced measures in place. – LHL

We are all fighting COVID-19 together. The circuit breaker measures take effect tomorrow. They will affect us all.

DPM Heng Swee Keat announced a “Solidarity Budget” today in Parliament, to help see Singaporeans through the circuit breaker period. This is on top of the earlier Unity Budget and Resilience Budget. There will be more protection for jobs and livelihoods, more support for workers and firms, and more help for all Singaporeans. Some schemes will be enhanced, others will be brought forward so help can reach you sooner. You can find out more in the link below.

But all these measures will be in vain, unless we all comply strictly with the measures. Everyone needs to be serious about staying at home, and not go about unless absolutely necessary. If you have to go out, practise safe distancing.

If you see the elderly out and about, please gently remind them to stay home. They are the ones most at risk from COVID-19. Be responsible and protect your family, friends, and fellow Singaporeans. – LHL

[ FISCAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 ]

DPM Heng: The additional measures in the Solidarity Budget will cost $5.1 billion.

I have sought and obtained President Halimah Yacob’s in-principle support to draw on an additional $4 billion from Past Reserves. The remaining $1.1 billion will be funded from the fiscal space of this term of Government.

Taken together, the Government’s response to COVID-19 will total almost $60 billion, or about 12% of GDP.

This is an unprecedented budget, for an extraordinary time. The situation remains highly fluid and uncertain. The Government stands ready to provide further support, should it become necessary.

This would keep the workers safe, as well as protect the wider community from widespread transmission from these clusters.

The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory have been gazetted as isolation areas. Onsite medical support has been deployed, along with provision of food and essential supplies. Workers who are symptomatic have already been isolated. Within these two dormitories, precautionary steps have also been taken to protect workers who are well.

Visited Lentor Ambulance yesterday to thank the ambulance crew, including their part-timers, for transporting patients with suspected of COVID-19 or pneumonia to the hospitals for further assessment. They were having their daily morning briefing when I arrived, and we had a short chat on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore before they set off to attend to patients. Many thanks to Lentor Ambulance and other Private Ambulance Operators for playing an important role in in our national effort to #FightAgainstCoVid19.

I was delighted to meet some part-time crew members who stepped forward to help in this challenging period. Some of them are on holiday before school starts next semester, while others had to seek alternative employment as their previous jobs were affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. I am heartened by their resilience and adaptability during such difficult times, and the Government will continue to support them in their work during this trying times.

Each of us can play a part to break the transmission of COVID-19 by staying at home to protect ourselves and our families. Let’s also continue to observe good personal hygiene and overcome COVID-19 together!

Members of the public are strongly advised to stay at home and avoid going out unnecessarily, except to purchase daily necessities, essential services, or for urgent medical needs.

<Dedicated facilities for 14-day SHN>

Joined my co-chair Minister Gan Kim Yong to visit one of the hotels we are using for US/UK returnees to serve out their 14-day stay home notice (SHN).

Some have asked why we needed to do this. Properly isolating the returnees is an important public health measure to ensure that those with the virus do not spread it to their family members or to others in the community. So this is not an indulgence for the returnees. It’s a critical and urgent measure to keep Singaporeans safe.

Why did we use hotels? Because this is the only way we can quickly get tens of thousands of rooms to house so many returning Singaporeans. In fact we would have preferred to put all of them into hotels. But due to insufficient rooms, we had to prioritise them for those coming back from countries with higher risks, namely US and UK.

For the hotels, this is not just business as usual. They have to train their staff, take extra precautions, and put in place proper infection controls. I’m glad many have responded promptly to the call. It’s yet another example of the SG United spirit which will enable us to beat the virus together!",1/4/2020 9:48,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/91866151_3608696909171626_3802363164515893248_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=px0F3OAwbcQAX8OcZCn&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4feaec3c4142669c6d5b829eb0480cf3&oe=60569DB1,,,,549,17,22,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157932458605631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/91866151_3608696909171626_3802363164515893248_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=px0F3OAwbcQAX8OcZCn&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4feaec3c4142669c6d5b829eb0480cf3&oe=60569DB1', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/91384831_3608696955838288_1320160233963651072_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=VNF_cguJ6OoAX9o_sqV&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=6da13c0c0bf50929d52bf2c72b334636&oe=6057EA88', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/91509479_3608697075838276_5868198114124365824_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=KlwbVdExltUAX9xkAfd&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=354d4d98e3ffd3d32ec6d2465ae58397&oe=6055D141']",10157932458605600

This will allow patients whose conditions are stable to avoid a physical visit to a clinic during this period of heightened alert due to COVID-19.

These chronic conditions are diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorder, major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and anxiety.

The extension will remain active until the de-activation of the Public Health Preparedness scheme, or as otherwise determined by MOH.

Visited Farrer Park Hospital today to show our appreciation to their healthcare teams for their support and dedication in responding to the evolving COVID-19 situation. I met with the staff managing contact tracing and those attending to patients in the emergency clinic and the ward.

The COVID-19 pandemic have led to an increase in work demands across our healthcare sector and I am heartened that the staff at Farrer Park Hospital (FPH) remain positive and committed to play their part in our #FightAgainstCoVid19. I am also thankful that FPH is training and preparing their healthcare teams to receive stable COVID-19 patients who are being discharged to isolation. The Ministry of Health, Singapore is committed to supporting our public and private healthcare institutions as they collectively meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is going to be a long battle ahead. Let us each play our part by being socially responsible and observe QOs/SHNs/LOAs. For those who are well, please continue to practise good personal hygiene and stay well and healthy.

Mr Gan shared Singapore’s experience in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. The session also included sharing by the People’s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.

Mr Gan said that Singapore’s strategy is to slow down the infection rate and to keep it as low as possible. Case detection and contact tracing remain important for us to ring-fence the spread and to preserve our healthcare capacity to cope with the outbreak in the long term. He emphasised the need for trust and open communication between people and the governments. Mr Gan expressed deep appreciation for healthcare workers around the world, who have been tirelessly working around the clock to protect the health of our people.

As we continue to fight this battle, Mr Gan urged global citizens to stay calm and stand united with their governments and with the rest of the world. Only together, can we overcome COVID-19.

Visited Concord International Hospital 泰和国际医院 (CIH) today to thank their healthcare teams for their support and dedication during this challenging time. Recently, they have started caring for stable COVID-19 patients who have been discharged to isolation. They have worked closely with NCID National Centre for Infectional Diseases to put in place the necessary precautionary measures in order to care for these patients in their designated ward.

This is one of our strategies to decant stable COVID-19 patients to be cared for by the private sector while freeing up beds and resources in the public healthcare institutions to look after the more severe cases. I am heartened to know that the staff are positive and determined to play their part in Singapore’s #FightAgainstCoVid19.

Ministry of Health, Singapore is committed to supporting all our public and private healthcare institutions to meet the challenges of the evolving COVID-19 situation. Let us play our part in this fight against the disease by practising good personal hygiene, and continue to keep well and healthy.

Tighter safe distancing rules kick in from today onwards, and will be in place till end of next month. Many entertainment venues will be closed and F&B outlets will have to impose strict rules to ensure physical separation and to keep groups to less than 10 persons. Malls and supermarkets remain open but with reduced capacity to avoid over-crowding. So please avoid going to these places during peak periods.

All of us must do our part to slow down the spread of the virus. Work from home wherever possible. Minimise non-essential activities.

[ IMPACT OF COVID-19 ]

DPM Heng: The COVID-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts — medical, economic, and social. On the medical front, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe. Yet measures on the medical front to contain the pandemic, both in Singapore and around the world, have made the second front of the battle — the economic front, even more difficult. Our latest GDP growth is forecasted to be between -4.0% and -1.0%. On the social front, we need Singaporeans to be strong, and ride through these challenges together.

Last month, I committed $6.4 billion in the Unity Budget towards the Stabilisation and Support Package, the Care and Support Package, and to support our frontline Agencies. Today, I am introducing measures worth over $48 billion in this Resilience Budget, to deal decisively with the COVID-19 situation.

Altogether, we are putting $55 billion to support our people, amounting to 11% of our GDP. This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation.

The Resilience Budget will focus on three key areas:

1. Save jobs, support workers, and protect livelihoods

2. Help enterprises overcome immediate challenges

3. Strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge intact and stronger

Five weeks ago, we had the Unity Budget. I had called for all Singaporeans to remain united, and to each play our part in overcoming COVID-19 together.

COVID-19 has since turned into a global pandemic, one that will be with us for many months to come. We must remain resilient as we brave the difficult times to come. This is why I have named the supplementary budget the Resilience Budget.

Our resilience as a country, as a society, is being put to the test as we face our biggest challenge in more than a decade. I still remember vividly the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, when I was heading up the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Those were dark days, but we bounced back. This time around, we face not just an economic crisis, but also a global pandemic.

The road ahead will not be easy, but with the Resilience Budget — we will help save jobs and support companies, with more for those who have been hardest hit. Households will also receive additional help to tide through this difficult period.

Various analysts and business leaders have been guessing about the size of the Budget, and its reach. It is important not to have excessive expectations or merely focus on the headline numbers. What is more important is that all of us do our part and make the best use of whatever we have.

Together, we can weather the storm and emerge stronger as one Singapore.

We’re living history today. Massive changes on a global scale - lockdowns, grounded planes, world economy and activities practically halting.

Shahida Sarhid and Norman Sawi invited me to share my thoughts on COVID-19 and its disruptions to jobs and our daily life on Berita Harian Singapura #NoTapis podcast.

I spoke candidly. Who likes closing mosques and social distancing - they are against our human instincts to reach out and interact. But we have to adapt and do what we must for our safety and health. We’re living in an unusual time, fighting a virus.

Faced with extraordinary challenge, we make sacrifices, stand together, support tough decisions, stay strong and fearless. This generation is gritty - I’ve never doubted that!

We announced several measures, including:

1. Closure of bars, cinemas, other entertainment outlets

2. Suspension of all religious services

3. Suspension of centre-based tuition and enrichment classes

4. Asking malls, museums and restaurants to reduce crowd density

Meanwhile, there are reports of clubs offering promotions for “one last bash” before they have to stop for a period.

It needs to be understood that these are exceptional times – it is reckless, irresponsible to behave like it is “life as normal”.

I have asked Police and enforcement agencies to step up checks, to make sure that clubs, others, follow the rules.

For example, on the number of people in enclosed spaces.

Today in Parliament, we put in place stricter safe distancing guidelines. We are organised into two teams — Red and Blue. Our seats in the Chamber were also spaced out — a first in Parliament’s history.

I hope people understand that we must all do our part. As Gan Kim Yong and Lawrence Wong pointed out in their Ministerial Statements today, all the measures we have in place will only be effective if we all do our part and are socially responsible. Our frontline healthcare workers, together with our public officers, are giving their all, working around the clock looking after patients, protecting Singapore and our people.

38,000 people are now serving their Stay Home Notices (SHN). Many of them have returned from countries that are hard hit by COVID-19. More will return in the coming days. We expect the number of new cases to go up.

K Shanmugam Sc told the House of several cases of irresponsible behaviour — a few individuals who were on SHN were unwell, but still went to work and even participated in social gatherings. The police will be investigating these cases and those caught flouting their SHN will be charged in court.

Do your part — practise safe distancing, seek medical attention promptly if you do not feel well, stay at home if you are supposed to. Only when each of us does our part, can we protect our loved ones and the people around us.

25 March 2020 at 12:56 ·

Gan Kim Yong updated Parliament today on the COVID-19 situation and what lies ahead. The strict measures we have taken — border controls, restricting travel, safe distancing, suspending religious services, and closing of entertainment outlets and tuition centres — are meant to curb the spread of the disease, to flatten the curve, and slow down the infection rate.

Around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen. We too expect to see more cases, as more overseas Singaporeans return home. It is crucial for these returnees to comply strictly with their Stay Home Notices. You must protect your families and everyone else, in case you turn out to be infected, which unfortunately some returnees will be. Glad that many are behaving responsibly by staying home, but some are not. Please comply — it is irresponsible to gallivant off to eat local food you miss, or to go partying with friends, when you are supposed to stay at home and isolate yourself. You will also be breaking the law.

Lawrence Wong spoke for us all when he gave heartfelt thanks to our healthcare workers, public officers, volunteers, and many unsung heroes who are fighting hard against COVID-19. Everyone has a part to play — be socially responsible, keep a safe distance apart from others, maintain high levels of hygiene, and heed the government advisories. It is a sombre time, but if we work together as one people, we will overcome this challenge, as our pioneers have done before.

[Joint statement by the Singapore Tourism Board, Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Police Force]

Following yesterday’s announcement that all entertainment venues will be closed from 26 March, 2359 hours till 30 April, we are aware a number of nightlife operators intend to host “farewell” events tonight that could result in large numbers of people congregating. These events undermine the fight against COVID-19 and increases risk to public health. If you are planning to attend, we urge you to seriously reconsider, if not for your own health, then for the health of those around you.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce’s decision to enforce stricter safe distancing measures aims to significantly reduce the risks of seeding new local COVID-19 clusters, which could strain our healthcare system further.

From now until the stricter measures kick in on 26 March 2020, 2359 hours, nightlife operators must continue to strictly implement safe distancing measures announced by the Ministry of Health on 20 March 2020. Events with 250 or more participants must be suspended, while operators of events with fewer than 250 participants must implement all necessary precautionary measures, including ensuring a distance of at least a metre between all participants and reduce mingling amongst participants.

These safe distancing measures are enforceable. Officers from government agencies including the Singapore Police Force will be on the ground to monitor the situation and carry out enforcement action over the next two days. The Traffic Police will also be conducting island-wide enforcement operations against drink-driving during this period. We will not hesitate to take action against anyone who fails to comply.

During this time, we appeal to Singaporeans to exercise good judgement and social responsibility. This will play an important part in keeping fellow Singaporeans and our loved ones safe in the midst of this global pandemic.",25/3/2020 13:27,,,,,149,15,46,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157905114510631,[],10157905114510600

Yesterday, I co-chaired the second Singapore-Malaysia Joint Working Group (JWG) for COVID-19 with Malaysia Deputy Health Minister YB Dato Dr. Haji Noor Azmi Ghazali.

We updated each other on the current COVID-19 situations and had discussions on “how to flatten the epidemic curve”. In Singapore, we adopt a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach towards managing COVID-19. A coordinated national response with community support is crucial for us to respond effectively against the outbreak. Our enhanced surveillance efforts have helped us in our overall containment efforts by “leaving no stones unturned” in detecting cases.

The JWG also discussed on joint border measures and agreed to continue entry screenings by both countries, align screening protocols by applying the same temperature cut-off (>37.5 degree Celsius) for febrile travellers, and implement reciprocal arrangements for the transfer of symptomatic travellers detected at entry screening back across both the land and sea checkpoints.

Singapore and Malaysia are working closely together during this pandemic to ensure the health protection of our people crossing the land and sea border.

From 27 March to 30 April 2020, there will be stricter measures to limit gatherings outside of work and school to 10 persons or less, to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Further Measures to Help Companies Cope with COVID-19 Situation

MORE HELP FOR OUR COMPANIES AND WORKERS

Many businesses have been impacted by the evolving #COVID19 situation. Through our conversations with business leaders and the trade chambers and associations, we recognise that companies, in particular the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as certain sectors, may need further support.

Singapore Ministry of Manpower will thus introduce further measures to help companies tide over this period. In helping the companies, we are in fact helping Singaporean workers to keep their jobs too.

With immediate effect, MOM will provide a three-month extension of levy payment timeline for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This applies to levies incurred in 2020 and will benefit around 60,000 companies.

Additionally, in view of the widespread travel restrictions and difficulties workers may face in returning to Singapore, MOM will extend the levy waiver period to up to 90 days with immediate effect for foreign workers who are currently on overseas home leave. Employers may also consider sending their foreign work pass holders back home to wait out the situation.

The construction sector in particular has been hard hit by work disruptions due to delays in overseas supplies and entry of foreign construction workers. As a result, construction firms are unable to fully utilise the Man-year Entitlements (MYE) allocated for their projects. Together with The Singapore Contractors Association Ltd and Building and Construction Authority (Singapore), we have worked on a temporary scheme to refund unutilised MYE due to work disruptions from COVID-19. For six months starting from 1 April 2020, firms will have the flexibility to use the refunded MYE within one year to hire new workers or renew existing ones.

We will continue to support our businesses and workers during this difficult time. – Jo Teo

Singapore residents will also not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at public and private hospitals.

· We will be promulgating Regulations under the Infectious Diseases Act to give legal force to the safe distancing measures, as well as provide enhanced enforcement for breaches of the SHN.

Singapore has pledged US$500,000 to fight COVID-19, in response to an appeal by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations.

The money is for the WHO’s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19. The plan aims to reduce transmission of the virus, and support the efforts of vulnerable countries to detect and isolate cases.

COVID-19 is a global problem, which no country can deal with alone. Instead they must work together as members of a global community.

I realised that my last post cannot be shared properly because of a link. I have removed the link and reposted. Wasted 900 shares but more important to get the message out. Learn something everyday.
==========================================================

School is re-opening tomorrow.

I have received many emails and messages from parents. Some asked why not extend the March holidays, especially given the rising numbers of imported cases and impending border closures. Others, including several students, urged MOE to keep schools open as they would like to go to school.

I have personally replied to many parents and students. Actually, part of the reason for the tougher border measures is to ensure we keep Singapore as safe as possible, so that daily activities, like going to work, eating out and attending school, can go on.

But let me lay out MOE’s thinking on why school will open tomorrow, but with more precautionary measures. There are three key considerations.

First, science. With the virus being around for several months now, there is a body of scientific evidence showing that COVID-19 does not affect the young very much as compared to adults. Parents will be familiar with this concept, as this is the case for other diseases such as chicken pox.

Neither is there evidence to show that the young are vectors or spreaders of the virus. The reverse appears to be the case, where the young get infected by adults at home. This is the advice of Prof Dale Fisher, Group Director of Medicine at NUHS and Chair of the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.

Indeed, for the small handful of our students (including those from Institutes of Higher Learning) who were infected, every single one caught it outside of their schools.

In this context, it may not be a bad idea for our children to spend the bulk of their day in school, where lessons and activities are arranged such that they mingle only with their classmates, who are less susceptible to the virus than adults. They will be quite a resilient group. If we close schools, many will not stay home, but may run around in the community and mingle with a lot more people, exposing themselves to more risk.

In that sense, schools remain safe places for children, especially as they seem to be more resilient against the virus.

Second, disruption. Closure of schools will disrupt many lives, especially parents who are both working, with no domestic help, and have limited childcare options. We are particularly concerned about parents who are healthcare workers and providers of essential services.

Keeping our healthcare system strong is paramount in the fight against COVID-19. Our frontline warriors will be much more assured if their children are in school, meaningfully engaged, in a safe and healthy environment.

Third, precautions. Notwithstanding that the young are more resilient to COVID-19, there is no place for complacency. We have consulted our healthcare experts and put in place many significant additional precautionary measures to safeguard the entire system, to maintain the calm situation we enjoyed before the March holidays.

We have implemented a Leave of Absence/Stay Home Notice policy, with the result that come Monday, every student, teacher, staff, canteen stall operator in school would not have gone overseas since the start of the March school holidays. As a further precaution, there will be 100% checks on their travel history at the gates.

Also, students will only spend their time with two groups - their class and their CCA. All other activities that involve mingling have been suspended. With CCA suspended for two weeks, their only social group is their class.

Another significant precaution is that every morning, every student who is not feeling well, be it with a cough or sore throat, and not just fever, will have to be in an isolation room or sent home.

In class, students will sit apart, just like during exams. Teachers and students will continue to upkeep the highest standards of hygiene. There is constant supervision (for the younger students) and reminders for all students to wash their hands properly and regularly, and avoid touching their faces.

Implemented together, these measures will serve as a robust layer of system defence, complementing the natural defence children may already have, to enable school to continue.",22/3/2020 22:02,,,,,360,21,111,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157894086745631,[],10157894086745600

They must not be disheartened as they have done their best and because of that many others who were infected had recovered and were discharged from our hospitals and safely returned to their families.

If such gatherings can be delayed, that would be better until the risk has passed.

Please remember too that no age group is invincible. The World Health Organisation has recently made a special call to young people to be vigilant because of the concern that many think that COVID -19 only infects older people. The virus infects everyone except that older people are more vulnerable because of lower immunities and pre-existing conditions. Also, infected young people can spread the infection to others who are more vulnerable.

The virus infects everyone except that older people are more vulnerable because of lower immunities and pre-existing conditions. Also, infected young people can spread the infection to others who are more vulnerable.

So, let’s do this together. Let’s do whatever it takes to beat COVID-19.",21/3/2020 13:42,,,,,0,0,0,https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3108865175813230&id=664833020216470,[],

Singapore reports first two coronavirus deaths: a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and 64-year old Indonesian man

Deeply saddened to hear that two COVID-19 patients passed away today. Both were being cared for in ICU and had pre-existing medical conditions. I extend my condolences to their families and loved ones.

Our frontline medical workers are working very hard to save lives. 131 cases have since fully recovered and been discharged, with most cases recovering gradually. It is unfortunate but understandable that those at higher risk would succumb to the virus, in particular the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions. Let us continue to root for a speedy recovery for the remaining cases, including those who are in critical condition, and keep them in our thoughts and prayers.

In the meantime, our fight against COVID-19 continues. I know that Singaporeans are worried but precautions have been put in place. Please adhere to the safe distancing guidelines to protect yourself and the people around you. Those who are unwell should see a doctor promptly for treatment. We must stay vigilant and not let our guard down as we continue to keep up a high standard of personal hygiene and social responsibility.

We will get through this together, just as we have done before during H1N1 and SARS.

<More Stringent Safe Distancing>

We have tightened our borders. Now we must implement much tighter safe distancing measures within Singapore. The full list of measures is in the MOH statement.
https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/stricter-safe-distancing-measures-to-prevent-further-spread-of-covid-19-cases

We will enforce the new requirements and move decisively on these changes. We want to see a reduction in social gatherings or any activity involving close contact that can be a potential vector for transmission of the virus.

The changes will bring about inconveniences for everyone. They will impact local businesses especially F&B outlets which are already facing difficulties. So we should all help to support and patronise our favourite hawker stalls and restaurants. But if the place is full (due to the spaced out seating arrangements and reduced seating capacity), then order take-away and eat at home.

With these changes, we should see fewer people out and about; fewer crowded venues; and more people working from home. We will need to make major changes in our daily routines and lives. But if we are disciplined about this, we will have a better chance of suppressing the virus, and slowing its spread.

The COVID-19 pandemic is causing an unprecedented impact on both Singapore’s and the world economy. I announced a $4 billion Stabilisation & Support Package in #SGBudget2020 to support our workers and businesses affected by the outbreak. But the fast-evolving and worsening situation calls for more to be done.

My Ministry of Finance (Singapore) team has been working hard with other agencies and organisations on the second stimulus package. Today, Minister Chan Chun Sing and I met Council members from the Singapore Business Federation, Trade Associations and Chambers to have a better understanding of the challenges faced by different sectors of the economy, and how a second support package can help viable companies and retain workers.

We had a robust and substantive dialogue as they candidly shared their immediate and long-term concerns and challenges. These covered many ‘Cs’ — cash flow, costs, capabilities and confidence. We will take the feedback into consideration for the second package.

As COVID-19 will be here to stay till the end of the year, or longer, we have to ensure that our measures are sustainable, to weather the impact of a prolonged outbreak. We are focusing on containing the outbreak on the medical front, to protect lives, and to protect workers and livelihoods. I am very encouraged to hear many comments from our business leaders on their determination to emerge stronger together from this crisis. This is the spirit of #SingaporeTogether.

Before the March school holidays, we were in a stable situation, with few new COVID-19 cases a day, most of which were traceable to known clusters.

Our schools had effective precautionary measures - sending home students who do not feel well (including those with cough and sore throat), inculcating better personal hygiene habits, and limiting mingling to largely students’ classes and CCA groups - to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Separately, many parents and students were asking if we can resume some activities, such as the suspended National School Games, which they having been training very hard for. Quietly, MOE was closely watching the situation, with some hope that we could resume some non-contact, small scale activities.

However, I am afraid this is now not possible. The past week saw rising infections around the world, including in Southeast Asia. This resulted in a surge in imported cases in Singapore. We have been very vigilant in picking up infections amongst this group, and most did not have a chance to mingle in the community. To protect our society further, the Government has stepped up travel restrictions.

Unfortunately, this development coincided with the March school holidays. Thousands of our students and their families have travelled overseas and have returned, or are now making their way back.

Our priority must be to protect the education system and keeping students safe. By protecting the system robustly, it can remain open, and lives need not be disrupted. Otherwise, many parents, including those working in hospitals and providing essential services, will not be able to go to work.

Hence, after much discussion with the Ministerial Task Force and medical experts, we have decided to subject all students and school staff who have returned from overseas on or after 14 March 2020 to 14 days Leave of Absence (LOA). This is on top of the Stay Home Notice that the MOH has just announced. The day you arrive will be considered Day 0 of your LOA.

We have also decided to suspend CCAs for two weeks and defer the SYF Arts Presentation. The National School Games will continue to be suspended until the end of the June holidays.

I know many students, parents and coaches will be disappointed. And many students and parents will be inconvenienced. I hate to have to do this, but it is critical that we protect the system, and keep everyone who has overseas exposure to the virus away from the school population. Then we can possibly return to the calm we enjoyed before the March school holidays. We need to do our best to maintain that.

I know many have rushed back to Singapore earlier this week because of all the travel restrictions. So for many, your LOA from school may have already started. This means that you may not miss school for the full two weeks, so I hope this won’t be too much of an inconvenience.

For students who are not able to be in school, your school will support you through home-based learning. There will be a few schools where teachers have travelled and will have to be absent. MOE will do our best to support these schools and ensure that lessons are not interrupted.

We have done what we can to protect the system. Let’s keep calm and carry on. Continue to monitor your temperature, see a doctor if you’re sick and wash your hands regularly. I thank you for your understanding.

<<Measures for preschools and student care centres>>
In the past week, we have seen a rising number of imported COVID-19 cases, as Singaporeans and residents get infected overseas and are picked up when they return home. Those who are abroad for work or studies are also coming back to Singapore. On 13 March, before the school holidays, ECDA had strongly advised families with pre-schoolers and preschool staff against overseas travel, given the escalating COVID-19 situation globally. We similarly advised all student care centre staff and children against overseas travel. We are appreciative that many took heed and decided not to travel. Nevertheless, quite a number of families still travelled abroad, and have returned or are returning home.

Yesterday, MOH announced that all returning Singapore residents, Long Term Pass Holders and short term visitors will be issued with Stay-Home Notices (SHNs).

We will need to take further steps to safeguard our preschoolers and our students. After careful deliberation with my colleagues in the Ministerial Task Force, we have decided to implement a 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA) for students and staff of preschools and student care centres who had returned from overseas on or after 14 March (which is the start of the March school holidays). This was not an easy decision as this enhanced precautionary measure will bring great inconvenience to some families. But given the volatility and the worsening global situation, we must keep those with overseas exposure temporarily away from our preschool and school community to ensure everyone’s health and safety. By protecting the system well, our preschools and student care centres can then remain open so that we can go about our lives as normally as possible.

This new measure will apply to children and preschool/student care staff who have returned to Singapore from abroad on or after 14 March 2020. On return to Singapore, they will need to undergo LOA (i.e. stay away from preschool/centre and remain at home) for 14 days. Count the day you return as Day 0, and you can return to the preschool/student care centre on Day 15.

This measure will kick in from tomorrow morning, 20 March. This to give parents some lead time to make alternative arrangements. For those who are already back in Singapore, we strongly encourage you to start your LOA immediately. But if you need some time until tomorrow to make alternative childminding arrangements, the preschools and student care centres are making arrangements to limit potential exposure today.

Similar measures have been announced by MOE for schools, and MSF for social services that serve vulnerable communities such as the elderly.

My colleagues and I apologise for the inconvenience that this tighter measure will cause our parents, pre-schoolers, children, preschool and student care operators and staff. We seek your understanding and support during these unusual times, and thank you for playing your part to keep our infants, children, clients and staff safe and healthy. During this difficult period, we urge employers and colleagues of affected parents and caregivers to support them with flexible work arrangements if they need to be at home to care for their children and family members during this period.

Let us continue to look out for one another.

<New Travel Advisory and Restrictions>

We are all concerned about the sharp rise in infected cases today. The majority of these cases are Singaporeans and residents returning from overseas. In the coming weeks, we expect more to do so, including Singaporeans/residents studying or working in Europe and the US.

Singapore cannot shut its doors to our own citizens and residents. So we have to take extra precautions.

First, we advise everyone to defer ALL travel. Second, for those who are already overseas (anywhere in the world), they will have to meet a full 14-day stay at home requirement when they come back to Singapore. In other words they have to self-isolate for 14 days at their place of residence.

With these precautions we can ensure that all returnees are isolated and that those who are infected can be treated promptly, without causing a broader spread of the virus in our community.",19/3/2020 1:34,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90094420_3562756560432328_2440460598668951552_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=D5bhnihCdNMAX_ALkE2&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=ce553107db8b96ccbe320a4aae55f011&oe=6056FDF3,,,,193,17,32,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157878673340631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90094420_3562756560432328_2440460598668951552_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=D5bhnihCdNMAX_ALkE2&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=ce553107db8b96ccbe320a4aae55f011&oe=6056FDF3'],10157878673340600

Our Department of Laboratory Medicine operates 24/7 round the clock every day to ensure rapid turnaround of COVID-19 testing. Their tireless work of testing and sending accurate and prompt results is crucial in providing timely care for confirmed cases and reducing anxiety amongst suspect patients. With 500 to 700 samples coming in for testing daily from TTSH, NCID and other institutions, we've had to train additional staff in running the COVID-19 tests, which involve numerous steps. While some services have been reduced to ramp up our support for NCID, our lab work still continues for tests such as Haematology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Blood Transfusion, MERS, or Avian Flu. Even with this workload, our lab is scaling up through process re-design in anticipation of processing more COVID-19 tests in our fight against the virus.

Another team crucial in our battle is our Intensive Care Unit. They've been working their hearts out making critical decisions and care interventions to save a more vulnerable group of patients severely impacted by the virus while ensuring that more critical care is readily available with the evolving situation.

We are encouraged to have Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong this morning at our Laboratories and Intensive Care Units, to thank our staff for their dedication and to listen to their needs. Thank you Minister for reminding us that we are #StrongerTogether.

1.01579E+16,"In view of the heightened risk of importation of COVID-19 cases into Singapore, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will implement additional measures for all travellers entering Singapore.

• Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel abroad with immediate effect. The expansion of the travel advisory is to reduce the risk of Singaporeans being infected with the virus when abroad, and spreading it to other Singaporeans when they return.

• From 20 March 2020, 2359 hours, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents, Long Term Pass holders and short term visitors entering Singapore will be issued a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN). They will have to provide proof of the place where they will serve the 14-day SHN, for example a hotel booking covering the entire period, or a place of residence they or their family members own.

• As announced earlier, short-term visitors with recent travel history to mainland China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Republic of Korea and Spain, are not allowed to enter or transit in Singapore.

As Singapore’s measures will evolve according to the global situation, Singaporeans should check the MOH website (https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19) for the latest measures.

Visited Bedok Polyclinic today to thank the healthcare staff for their hard work and dedication in Singapore’s #FightAgainstCovid19. Happy to meet healthcare workers at the frontline, providing care for the patients who have respiratory infections and those who require medical attention for other conditions.

Many thanks to our primary care team, as they remain in high spirits and committed to manage the containment of COVID-19 in Singapore as well as serve the regular patients. As the number of confirmed cases continues to increase globally, let us continue to play our part in this fight against COVID-19 by continuing to practice good personal hygiene and stay home if we are unwell. Look after yourselves and seek necessary medical attention for your chronic conditions too as the Polyclinics have designated green-zone (non-fever areas) to ensure patient safety and continutity of care.
Together, we can overcome COVID-19!

Malaysia has implemented its Movement Control Order. I am glad to see that the supply of fresh food has not been fully disrupted and most of our wholesalers and retailers managed to receive their goods as per normal since this morning.

Other goods such as pharmaceuticals and infant diapers have also managed to come through to Singapore. We are aware that some companies have provided feedback that trucks not containing food have not been allowed to come in. We are monitoring the situation closely and are in touch with our Malaysian counterparts to ensure that food and other supplies will be able to come through to Singapore as agreed by Malaysian PM Muhyiddin Yassin in his phone call with PM Lee yesterday.

I also spoke to my counterpart Senior Minister and Minister of International Trade and Industry Azmin Ali this afternoon. I thanked him for facilitating the flow of goods and supplies into Singapore during this period and told him that we will continue to work closely with Malaysia to slow down the spread of COVID-19. We both noted that it is in our mutual interest to ensure that supply chains remain robust and in working order, and agreed that we must maintain confidence in our people and businesses in order to successfully overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19.

Some of our companies have also activated alternative transport arrangements via sea and air freight to bring their goods from Malaysia to Singapore. Our economic agencies are working with our companies, in particular those dealing with essential products and services, to minimise disruption to their supply lines.

Most of our companies have also managed to secure the necessary accommodation for their Malaysian workers who will be staying in Singapore for the next two weeks to work. It must not be an easy decision for them to leave their homes and families to stay in Singapore during this period. We thank the Malaysian workers who decided to make this personal sacrifice to ensure that business operations and essential services can continue in Singapore.

As the number of imported cases rise, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong assured Singaporeans that these cases were fortunately picked up because they have been socially responsible after returning: staying away from crowds and going to see a doctor the moment they felt sick. This helped keep the spread low.

To further limit the number of imported cases, Minister Lawrence Wong strongly encouraged Singaporeans to defer all non-essential travels and adhere to the travel advisory. For employees who still decide to travel during this period, their employers are entitled to have them serve their 14-day Stay-Home Notice out of their own leave upon returning. Furthermore, the employers will also not be entitled to the $100 allowance that the government gives to affected companies.

The Order will affect the movement of people, including Malaysian workers who commute daily to Singapore. We are supporting affected businesses, by helping them house these workers in Singapore during this period, particularly those providing essential services.

I am glad that the flow of goods, including food supplies, will continue when the Order is in force. As Chan Chun Sing explained, we have adequate stockpiles, diversified food supply lines, and alternative plans should existing supply lines be disrupted. We do not have all our eggs in one basket — you can view our diversified food supply lines in this chart: https://www.sfa.gov.sg/images/default-source/section-content/food/foodsource.jpg.

While the supermarkets in Tampines and other parts of the island were more crowded than usual, most shoppers are buying what they need. There is no need to panic buy.

In this moment of crisis, remember to look after yourself and look out for those around you. Together, we can overcome the current challenges.

[Frontline Teams]

Visited Changi General Hospital (CGH) yesterday. A small gesture to thank the healthcare team for their hard work and dedication in our #FightAgainstCovid19. Glad to meet the teams from the CGH A&E department, the Radiology and Microbiology Lab, as well as the contact tracing team at the Ops Centre. They are all frontline in the fight against COVID-19.

Many thanks to all of them and their colleagues - all of them have families, some with young children or elderly parents, and they all do their jobs knowing the risks which they might put themselves and their own families through.

When my visit ended at mid-day, I was joined by Nazreen Catering who had generously donated nasi briyani bentos to CGH, and we distributed them to the healthcare teams, including the Ops Centre team.

It has been close to 3 months since the outbreak of the disease. The Ministry of Health, Singapore will continue to support our healthcare teams managing the containment of COVID-19 in Singapore. As the number of confirmed cases continues to increase globally, let us play our part in this fight against the disease by practising good personal hygiene, and continue to keep well and healthy. If we remain united, we will come out of this fight a stronger Singapore. #SGUnited",17/3/2020 13:13,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90166319_2784337934985634_2014216495046852608_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=fypLyTjCsqMAX9-6w8w&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4a69eae5d1f25fc82104f1045ce6611f&oe=6057E795,,,,111,3,2,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157873314385631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90166319_2784337934985634_2014216495046852608_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=fypLyTjCsqMAX9-6w8w&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4a69eae5d1f25fc82104f1045ce6611f&oe=6057E795', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90063372_2784338184985609_3677348868531421184_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=R3AHjRt_vksAX8uoch1&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=d41942f5112eab5fb714bcb42e76819d&oe=60549BC6', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90154156_2784338601652234_494952894479466496_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=6XZMvE1YbEYAX-tj77J&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=d59a7e7b3733438c5693b99a8030b8ba&oe=6055C4F8', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90083781_2784338674985560_5736443159026597888_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Yk_GwxEJHicAX-erPDO&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=08844508cab9230c39586f0ce436c4a3&oe=6054D4E0']",10157873314385600

This morning I spoke with our media to provide more details on our supplies of food and essential items.

While I did not reveal the actual numbers as it will affect our ongoing negotiations with overseas suppliers, I shared that we are using a strategy combining stockpiling and local production to buy us time to bring in alternative supplies should our usual supply lines be disrupted.

For carbohydrates, like rice and noodles, we have more than three months’ worth of stockpile at the national level. For proteins like meat, and vegetables, we use a combination of fresh, frozen and canned options to meet our demand and we have more than two months’ worth of supplies at normal consumption patterns. As for eggs, we have our local production and we are also activating air freight options to substitute the Malaysian supplies should they be disrupted.

A disruption of supplies from Malaysia is a contingency scenario we have planned for many years. We have put in place robust plans to manage this scenario and will continue to review our strategies to ensure that Singaporeans never run out of food or essential supplies.

While we may have to make some adjustments to our choices in the short term, we have sufficient food supplies for all Singaporeans as long as all of us buy responsibly.

Once again, I would like to express my deep appreciation to all the staff who worked through the night to replenish our shelves and also a big thank you to all Singaporeans who have stayed calm throughout all the recent announcements and developments.

While we may be anxious individually, we can draw strength from the fact that we are all in this collectively, working as one united Singapore. CCS",17/3/2020 9:49,,,,,352,14,96,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157872861710631,[],10157872861710600

Entry Approval and Stay-Home Notice Requirements For All New and Returning Foreign Domestic Workers

PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES TO PROTECT HOUSEHOLDS

Foreign domestic workers (FDW) play an important role in supporting Singaporeans with domestic work and caregiving needs. They live with employers and their families, and many look after young children and the elderly.

In view of the #COVID19 situation, we will now require employers and employment agencies to obtain approval from Singapore Ministry of Manpower before their FDWs enter #Singapore. These measures will apply to all new or returning FDWs arriving in Singapore from 16 March 2359 hours. The FDWs will be placed on a mandatory 14-DAY Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore.

Employers I have spoken to understand this is a necessary measure to protect their families and the wider community. MOM is prepared to support employers whose existing FDWs are not in Singapore but will be required to serve the SHN when they return. If they wish to arrange for their FDW to serve her SHN outside of their homes, they can apply for $60 support and levy waiver for every day of the SHN.

Additionally, with the introduction of social distancing measures, employers should discuss alternative rest day arrangements with their FDWs. FDWs may choose to take their rest day on a week day when it is less crowded or choose to spend their rest day at home. FDWs planning to go on home leave should also be encouraged to postpone their plans.

We thank everyone for their cooperation during this period. Let’s try our best to keep each other safe. – Jo Teo

In order to further reduce the risk of importation of COVID-19 cases to Singapore, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce has announced additional border restriction measures.

From 16 March 2359 hours, all travellers entering Singapore with recent travel history to ASEAN countries, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued with a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

However, given our close proximity to Malaysia, the 14-day SHN will not apply to our land and sea crossings with Malaysia. Singaporean and Malaysian workers who commute between Singapore and Malaysia daily will still be able to do so. The latest restrictions will also not have an impact on the supply of food and other essentials between Singapore and Malaysia as drivers of goods vehicles will be able to enter as per normal.

<Additional Travel Restrictions>

Globally, the number of infected cases is rising rapidly. We are also seeing more imported cases in Singapore. Many of them are our own residents returning from overseas. Hence the Taskforce has issued an advisory to defer all non-essential travel abroad with immediate effect.

Besides returning residents, we have a few cases from ASEAN countries, coming here for the sole purpose of seeking medical treatment. It is hard for us to cope with this additional demand during this critical period when our healthcare resources are stretched, and need to be prioritised for Singaporeans.

We have therefore decided to put in place tighter border control measures:

- All travellers with recent travel history in the UK, Switzerland, Japan, and ASEAN countries will be served a 14-day stay home notice. In other words they have to self-isolate or self-quarantine for a full 14 days at their place of residence.

- All short term visitors who are nationals of ASEAN countries will have to submit health information to our Overseas Missions, and the submission will have to be approved by our MOH before they travel. Those without the necessary approval will be denied entry.

These arrangements will not apply to Singaporeans and Malaysians using our sea and land crossings daily. Precautions are needed at these checkpoints but they need to be considered separately given the high volume of people, and the high level of interdependency between our two countries. Officials on both sides are now discussing separate arrangements for these checkpoints through the Joint Working Group on COVID-19

The new measures will impose greater inconveniences, especially for those planning to travel, or who are already overseas. But I seek the understanding of Singaporeans that they are necessary moves to limit the number of imported cases and to keep all of us safe.",15/3/2020 18:42,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90231850_3551439038230747_6744901643336155136_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=mTT8XRplRnIAX-BRBI6&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=40fa372d17a849880a088f1f520088cc&oe=60574C36,,,,194,24,46,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157866934740631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90231850_3551439038230747_6744901643336155136_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=mTT8XRplRnIAX-BRBI6&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=40fa372d17a849880a088f1f520088cc&oe=60574C36'],10157866934740600

COVID-19 is a novel disease and there is still much to be learned about it. Based on existing information, the most likely modes of transmission are through droplets and fomites (touching of contaminated surfaces).

There has been quite a lot of discussion about social distancing of late. So what is the value of social distancing in the context of this current COVID-19 pandemic?

Social distancing practices are changes in our human behavior that prevent disease transmission by reducing physical contact rates between susceptible individuals and the infected individuals. The coronavirus does not infect us though the air we breathe in. It has to reach us through close contact via droplets from coughing, sneezing or even talking, or through contaminated surfaces where our hands laid on and then subsequently accidental touching of our mouth, nose and eyes.

Social distancing measures have been shown to reduce the severity of an epidemic, but the benefits of social distancing will depend on the extent and magnitude to which it is applied by both the individual and the community.

Social distancing practices can range from the simplest modification of behaviour, such as the way we greet one another, ie. no shaking of hands; sitting / standing with a reasonable separation of about a metre apart; avoiding crowded places and minimising socialisation duration to preferably less than 30mins. Or it can be more extensive involving a whole of community or society, like telecommuting, cohorting of employees, cancellation of mass events or social activities, school closures or even a total lockdown of cities / countries, such as in Wuhan, Hubei province, Italy and Denmark.

The applications of such social distancing measures will depend on various factors such as the severity of the epidemic, the extent of the community transmission, and the availability and adequacy of the medical resources in dealing with the severely ill.

Social distancing is about protecting not just yourself, but everyone in the community. By slowing the spread of the disease, it helps protect people who are at higher risk of developing more severe illness or death, including the elderly, those with pre-existing medical conditions and the immunocompromised.
Social distancing also helps communities “flatten the curve” - slowing the spread allows the health care system to more adequately respond to an influx of patients, especially those who require respirators or intensive care facilities.

Effective as it may when applied appropriately, it must be accompanied by both personal hygiene and social responsibility. We must constantly keep our hands clean by frequent washing with soap and water or the use of hand sanitisers. This will help minimise the risk of transmission through fomites. We must also exercise social responsibility by putting on a mask when unwell and to consult a doctor for medical assessment, and avoid doctor-hopping. When unwell, please stay away from work, school or participating in other social activities. Many of the large clusters we see recently were due to irresponsible behaviour by the infected individuals, resulting in further transmission of the disease.

Singapore has done reasonably well as a nation in preventing a massive uncontrollable outbreak in the community. We should not be complacent and must continue to stand united (with some safe physical separation 😄) in this #FightAgainstCoVid19. I believe if we can all play our part, we will get through this together and emerge stronger as a people, as a nation.

<Social Distancing and Travel Restrictions>

The Taskforce announced more social distancing measures today. This includes limiting the size of gatherings to 250 people and having seats placed further apart in workplaces and public venues, where possible. We are starting this new practice even for our media conferences.

At the same time, we remain vigilant against the import of new cases. That’s why we are restricting travellers with recent travel history from the whole of Italy, France, Germany and Spain - countries with very high numbers of cases and very high rates of increase. We are also requiring all visitors with fever or respiratory symptoms to serve a full 14-day stay at home (or hotel) requirement, in addition to undergoing a swab test.

We will continue to do everything we can to limit the number of imported cases and slow down the spread of the virus in Singapore.",13/3/2020 19:21,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90087456_3544755455565772_1027271763915964416_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=DTy1-cMY3noAX-uQ-Zz&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=ad2df5152fcfe8dcd229928090380363&oe=6058187F,,,,124,8,17,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157860577045631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/90087456_3544755455565772_1027271763915964416_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=DTy1-cMY3noAX-uQ-Zz&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=ad2df5152fcfe8dcd229928090380363&oe=6058187F'],10157860577045600

In response to the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases across Europe, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced the implementation of additional travel restrictions for visitors from Italy, France, Germany and Spain. From 15 March, all visitors who have visited these countries within a 14-day period will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore. Singaporeans and PRs coming back home from these countries will have to serve a 14-day Stay Home Notice. This is on top of the swab testing conducted at our checkpoints. We will also cease port calls for all cruise vessels with immediate effect.

To further reduce the risk of local transmission at large-scale events, all ticketed events with 250 participants or more will be cancelled or deferred. We have also introduced restrictions and advisories for events and gatherings.

These measures are part of our overall approach to fight COVID-19 — which will continue to be guided by data, scientific evidence, and expert advice. But these measures alone are not enough. We must all do our part — continue to practise good personal hygiene and be socially responsible. Together, we can overcome and emerge stronger from this outbreak.

• From 15 March 2020, 2359 hours, residents (Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) and long-term pass holders (including work passes, Student’s Pass, Dependent’s Pass, and Long-Term Visit Pass) with recent travel history to Italy, France, Spain and Germany within the last 14 days, will be issued with a Stay-Home Notice.

• From 4 March, travellers entering Singapore and exhibiting fever and/or other symptoms of respiratory illness are required to undergo a COVID-19 swab test at the checkpoint, regardless of travel history. With immediate effect, all such travellers will also be issued a 14-day SHN , which they will have to serve in full even if the result of the swab test is negative. Those who meet the clinical suspect case definition will be conveyed to the hospital for follow-up.

• In order to reduce the risk of local transmission, we will introduce requirements and advisories for events and gatherings, workplaces and public venues. This is to limit large crowds gathering in close proximity over a prolonged duration.

I am also encouraged to see that the healthcare workers are in good spirits as they know that they have the support of the public during the outbreak. This is a common thread I observed from my visits to the different healthcare sectors.

<Social Distancing>

Yesterday the Taskforce announced the suspension of all senior-oriented activities by government agencies for 14 days. This is an example of a “social distancing” measure, where we reduce the contact people have with one another to slow down the spread of the virus.

Beyond this specific move, we are looking at a broader range of social distancing measures, including for events, schools, workplaces, as well as religious services.

We are mindful that some of these measures can be disruptive to the daily lives of Singaporeans. If we do them all at once, many activities will grind to a halt, and our city will have to shut down. If we implement the measures too early, people may get fatigued. And remember that various medical experts have already said that the virus can last till end-2020 at least.

So it is critical to put in place the right measures at the right time, to act as effective “circuit breakers” to slow down the transmission chain. In deciding what to do and when to implement them, we will continue to be guided by data, scientific evidence and expert advice.",11/3/2020 22:11,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/87836120_3538835739491077_7981307219004096512_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=uRPcSsb2EiMAX8YxDYu&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=aee3a9fe0c11a98bb2da3bb22b918856&oe=60546E3E,,,,84,6,14,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157854665875631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/87836120_3538835739491077_7981307219004096512_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=uRPcSsb2EiMAX8YxDYu&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=aee3a9fe0c11a98bb2da3bb22b918856&oe=60546E3E'],10157854665875600

Visited our healthcare team at National University Hospital - NUH with Minister Lawrence Wong this morning to thank them for their hard work in Singapore’s #FightAgainstCoVid19. Happy to meet the teams running operations at NUH’s Operations Centre, the isolation wards, the Department of Laboratory Medicine’s Molecular Diagnosis Centre, and the Emergency Medicine Department.

Our healthcare teams have been working hard at the frontline providing care for all Singaporeans – those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as those who require attention for their other medical conditions.

Many thanks also to our medical technologists working tirelessly at the laboratories of our public health institutions, to conduct diagnostic tests on the many samples received during this period. Their efforts have provided our healthcare teams with prompt and accurate diagnosis of cases, enabling patients to receive appropriate treatment and care and recover from COVID-19.

The Ministry of Health, Singapore will continue to support our healthcare team in managing the evolving COVID-19 situation. As the number of confirmed cases continues to increase globally, let us continue to play our part in this fight against COVID-19 by continuing to practice good personal hygiene, stay home and avoid social activities if unwell, and do not doctor hop when seeking medical treatment.

Social responsibility is a critical factor in slowing the transmission of the virus. Many of the locally transmitted cases were the result of the socially irresponsible actions of a few individuals who attended events and activities despite being unwell.

We urge all Singaporeans to play their part in the fight against the virus. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should see a doctor and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others.

HARNESSING TECHNOLOGY TO MANAGE COVID-19

Since 5 March, travellers to #Singapore who have a fever or display signs of respiratory illness have to undergo a COVID-19 nasal swab test. The samples, collected at all air, land and sea checkpoints, are analysed by the test kit developed by HTX SG. It has an accuracy rate of more than 99 per cent and is able to test for a result in three hours.

The test kit helped to detect the presence of COVID-19 in Case 147 upon arrival in Singapore in 7 March. He was subsequently confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on the morning of 8 March.

Proud that our HTX scientists from the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) Centre of Expertise developed this test kit quickly to meet our frontline needs, after the COVID-19 genome sequence was made public in mid-January.

I’m glad that this innovation from our scientists at HTX can play a part in limiting the spread of imported cases in our ongoing battle with #COVID19.

Visited Kwong Wai Shiu (KWS) Care @ McNair, an Active Ageing Hub that offers day care, rehabilitation services and social programmes for residents in the area, complementing services offered by the Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital. The KWS team shared with me how they are continuing to support seniors during this period as we tackle the COVID-19 virus. This includes having their Home Care Assistants visit the elderly to share tips on personal hygiene and address their concerns. The management team has also put in place stringent business continuity plans, to protect the well-being of their staff, clients and visitors.

I am heartened that amid the evolving COVID-19 situation, our members of the Intermediate Long-Term Care (ILTC) sector have stepped up to ensure that the vulnerable within the community are well cared for in a safe environment. I thank all our ILTC professionals for their tireless dedication in caring for the seniors and supporting national efforts to tackle COVID-19.

Task force formed to raise public hygiene standards beyond COVID-19 outbreak

COVID-19 makes hygiene and cleanliness more important than ever. More and more people are getting infected all over the world. Singapore has restricted travellers from badly hit countries, but we can’t close our borders completely. So we must expect more cases and clusters to pop up in Singapore.

We have been quite successful identifying patients, tracing contacts and stamping out clusters. We will keep on doing this. But we also need to slow the spread of the virus, and that means we must raise our hygiene standards.

Better hygiene must be our first line of defence. We have formed the SG Clean taskforce, to be chaired by Minister Masagos Zulkifli. It will focus on 3 things:

- public cleanliness (keeping public spaces clean);
- personal hygiene (washing your hands); and
- social norms (use serving spoons when you share food).

With the continued global spread of the COVID-19 virus, it is important for us to remain vigilant and take active steps to safeguard public health.

We are entering a new situation, a new normal, where enhanced personal hygiene and social responsibility have to be an integral part of our lives. This is especially so, when we don’t know how long COVID-19 will last.

Today Masagos Zulkifli announced the formation of the SG Clean Taskforce, which is under the purview of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce for COVID-19. The Taskforce will rally Singaporeans to step up cleanliness and hygiene standards through three key areas:

— Ensuring cleanliness of public spaces is a shared responsibility
— Improving personal hygiene
— Adapting social norms

We need everyone to come on board, to stand united as a nation, so that we can keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.

Let’s make SG Clean our new way of life.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been introducing measures progressively, to meet the challenges of the evolving COVID-19 situation. This has helped us to manage the spread of the virus, and facilitate contact tracing. We will continue to do all we can. I would like to thank all frontline officers and healthcare workers, and everyone who has pitched in to fight against COVID-19.

But community spread remains a possibility as COVID-19 continues to spread globally. We need to step up cleanliness and hygiene standards in all facets of our lives. This requires us to make some adjustments and adopt new norms.

Today, I announced that I will be chairing a new multi-agency SG Clean Taskforce to drive this, under the purview of the MTF. Together with Desmond Lee Amy Khor Janil Puthucheary Low Yen Ling Baey Yam Keng 马炎庆 and representatives from other agencies, we will focus on 3 key areas to safeguard public health.

First, strengthening shared responsibility for the cleanliness of public spaces. We have made a good start with the launch of the SG Clean campaign last month. And as announced this week, we are making amendments to the Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA) to mandate standards for public cleanliness and place greater accountability on premise managers to ensure the cleanliness of their premises.

Second, improving personal hygiene. All of us can do our part to keep ourselves and others around us safe by practising the “Habits of Good Public Hygiene” as highlighted by National Environment Agency (NEA). Good habits such as washing hands frequently with soap, taking our temperature daily, and using a tissue whenever we sneeze or cough, should become our way of life for the longer term.

Third, adapting social norms. We do not know how long COVID-19 will last. We are entering a new situation, a new normal, where enhanced personal hygiene have to be an integral part of our lives. Do remember to use serving spoons when sharing food, and keep the tables in hawker centres and public spaces clean.

Let us work together to make SG Clean our new way of life.

I announced subsidies for vaccinations in Parliament at Ministry of Health, Singapore Budget (Committee of Supply) debates on Thursday (5 Mar).

All childhood vaccinations recommended under National Childhood Immunisation Schedule and developmental screening will be fully subsidised for Singaporean children.

Adult vaccinations recommended under National Adult Immunisation Schedule will also be subsidised.

Eligible lower to middle income Singaporeans will get 75% subsidy at polyclinics. This corresponds to CHAS Blue and Orange cardholders.

Other eligible Singaporeans will get 50% subsidy for the vaccinations.

Pioneer Generation get an extra 50% subsidies and Merdeka Generation get an extra 25%, off the remaining co-payment amount.

This will take effect before the end of 2020 and will be available at polyclinics, and CHAS GP clinics across Singapore.

We want to keep Singaporeans healthy, stay out of hospitals, keep out vaccine-preventable diseases through vaccinations.

I urge parents to take advantage of the free vaccinations to give our children the best possible start. And adults, particularly seniors, please get vaccinated too - stay healthy!",6/3/2020 8:24,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/87151687_2566600113627459_5314247744980779008_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=8Uq3WiBIh38AX9Knf0w&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=d2d6d20e4430020736afb61428740b45&oe=6055EEBE,,,,63,2,12,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157838453285631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/87151687_2566600113627459_5314247744980779008_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=8Uq3WiBIh38AX9Knf0w&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=d2d6d20e4430020736afb61428740b45&oe=6055EEBE'],10157838453285600

We have seen a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in some countries over the past few days. In response to this, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced today that additional precautionary measures will be implemented for incoming and outgoing travellers.

From Wednesday, 4 March 2020, 2359hrs, travellers with recent travel history to Iran, northern Italy, and South Korea will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore. Residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history of 14 days to these countries will be issued with a Stay-Home Notice.

At the same time, all travellers arriving in Singapore who exhibit symptoms of respiratory illness will have to undergo a compulsory COVID-19 swab test.

These measures are meant to limit the spread of the disease in Singapore, but despite our best efforts, we have to be mentally prepared for undetected cases to cause a new spike in COVID-19 cases here. We have seen this happen elsewhere.

As we continue to monitor the fast-evolving situation not just locally but also globally, we will adjust our measures so as to ensure these are appropriate.

In the meantime, our first and best line of defence involves every single one of us — let’s continue to stay vigilant and be socially responsible, stay at home if you are unwell and always practise good personal hygiene.

Please see the Ministry of Health, Singapore’s statement below for details.

[Visit to Raffles Hospital]

Visited a group of front line healthcare workers at Raffles Hospital today. They help us battle the virus, keep Singaporeans safe.

Many of them have their own families, some with young kids, others with elderly or frail parents at home. They are concerned about themselves and their loved ones, just as much as we all are. But they press on, put aside their own anxieties and continue to do their job - and with a smile too (behind the masks!).

Very grateful to our healthcare teams.

<Additional Precautions; Be Prepared>

Just shared with the media the additional precautions and travel restrictions the Taskforce has decided to put in place.

For outgoing travellers, we advise to defer non-essential travel for Iran, Northern Italy, Japan and Korea.

For incoming travellers, we will not allow new visitors with recent travel history from Iran, northern Italy and Korea (we have not included Japan for now as the infection rate there is not as high compared to the others). Singaporeans, residents and long-term pass holders returning from these countries will be issued a 14-day stay home notice.

We are also putting in place a new screening mechanism at our borders to test for infected cases, as temperature scans alone are not sufficient. In particular our officers at the checkpoints will look out for those with respiratory symptoms, identify them and ask them to go through a swab test.

Despite our best efforts, we have to be prepared for the infected numbers in Singapore to rise, as has happened elsewhere. As the virus spreads, it will become increasingly difficult to stop it at our borders. There are also likely to be many undetected cases in countries that are not doing proactive testing. We cannot isolate Singapore and shut ourselves from the world. So we will be exposed to new waves of infection.

This is why we must redouble our efforts on what we can do within Singapore. Maintaining good hand hygiene; stepping up cleanliness and hygiene standards in public areas; seeing a doctor when we are sick and staying at home when we are on MC. These are vitally important to slow down the spread of the virus within our community. These new habits must become a permanent part of our daily lives.",3/3/2020 18:54,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/87955369_3511865132188138_2998956271572353024_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=7Es-4B9y61oAX-cQmdo&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=7b3ed5a858d5a15fc5a5dbb708eb0453&oe=6054E5C1,,,,151,3,21,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157830271890631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/87955369_3511865132188138_2998956271572353024_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=7Es-4B9y61oAX-cQmdo&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=7b3ed5a858d5a15fc5a5dbb708eb0453&oe=6054E5C1'],10157830271890600

Visited Singapore General Hospital this afternoon. Met our frontline staff from the healthcare workers to the administrative officers and security department who served selflessly and tirelessly since the outbreak of COVID-19. Like many Singaporeans, I am thankful for their dedication and sacrifices helping Singapore to overcome COVID-19.

I also met a group of young local and international scouts and guides, as part of the ground-up movement by Scouts & Guides Care this afternoon. Organised in collaboration with the Community Chest, the students presented handmade ‘Thank You’ cards and letters to show the various frontline staff their appreciation and encouragement during this challenging time.

Our Silver Generation (SG) Ambassadors have been out and about to reach out to vulnerable seniors to keep them updated on the COVID-19 situation, address their concerns and share information on the government support available. In cases where assistance is needed urgently, these vulnerable seniors will have a contact point to reach out to at the Silver Generation Office.

Yesterday, I met Mr Tay and Mdm Lim when I joined the SG Ambassadors to visit some seniors in Ang Mo Kio. They were in good spirits and were positive about the situation, going about their daily routines as usual. They have been keeping themselves informed of basic hygiene tips and know what to do should they develop respiratory symptoms.

We also met Mdm Nooraini and Mr Hamid and shared where the nearest Public Health Preparedness Clinics to them are. Acknowledging the reminders to exercise and stay healthy, Mdm Nooraini said that she often goes to the fitness corner near her place, and take walks around her neighbourhood. Mr Hamid jokingly asked if his walks from the living room to the kitchen were counted as exercise!

I thank the SG Ambassadors for stepping up in this critical time to continue reaching out to our seniors. I am confident that we will be able to overcome the COVID-19 situation if everyone makes an effort to take care of themselves and one another.

Joined my colleague Lam Pin Min（蓝彬明）to visit some Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) today. These clinics are at the frontline detecting any new COVID-19 cases in the community. They will give patients with respiratory symptoms up to a 5 day MC in the instance; and if the patients are still not well, they will refer them to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) for a test. The PHPCs are an important part of our overall system of defence against the virus.

The World Health Organization Western Pacific Region (WPRO) has launched a guidance paper to prepare Member States for community transmission of COVID-19. Today, I attended a special briefing chaired by Regional Director Dr Takeshi Kasai and exchanged views with Member States on this growing issue of concern.

The global situation is evolving rapidly and remains highly uncertain. Over the past few days, we have seen multiple outbreaks in several countries. We could be in for a long fight and must start looking for sustainable solutions in the long term to reduce community transmission, while keeping disruptions to our daily lives and on economic activities to a minimum.

Special bonus for frontline public officers battling COVID-19

Lee Hsien Loong
28 February 2020 at 17:57 ·

In the ongoing fight against COVID-19, our frontline workers, especially in healthcare, have gone above and beyond the call of duty to keep us all safe.

To acknowledge their sacrifices and hard work, DPM Heng Swee Keat today announced a special bonus of up to one month to healthcare officers in restructured hospitals and the Ministry of Health, Singapore, and some officers in other frontline agencies who have been directly involved.

To show solidarity at this trying time, political office holders will be taking a one month pay cut, while MPs will take a one month cut in their allowance. I am heartened that President Halimah Yacob is also joining in this gesture.

For the time being cases in Singapore are under control, but the virus is spreading in many countries. So we must remain on high alert. Whatever happens, let us stay united, and prevail as One Singapore.

The first Singapore and Malaysia Joint Working Group for COVID-19 was held in Johor Bahru yesterday. The Singapore delegation crossed the Johor-Singapore causeway to meet with colleagues from Malaysia and also took the opportunity to observe the border health screening facilities at the JB Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) Complex.

The first JWG meeting was productive and both countries agreed on the next steps for further cooperation. There were discussions on the latest COVID-19 updates and the screening protocols in place at the two land borders we share.

The JWG agreed to continue entry screening at both countries and align health screening protocols at the land borders. Technical experts from both countries will meet to exchange information on clinical management for COVID-19 patients. We will also activate a bilateral Field Epidemiology Training Network (FETN) to share surveillance data and will continue to exchange relevant information with each other to further strengthen public messaging on COVID-19.

It is of importance that both Singapore and Malaysia continue to work closely together to fight the ongoing outbreak. We look forward to hosting Malaysia colleagues in Singapore for the second #JWGforCOVID19.

Chinese New Year gathering identified as missing link between COVID-19 church clusters

We discovered an important link today between two existing COVID-19 clusters — the Grace Assembly of God church (our biggest cluster) and the Life Church and Missions church.

Cases 83 and 91 had only mild symptoms earlier, and had not been diagnosed with COVID-19. But a new serological test — which detects antibodies in the blood, instead of the virus itself — done subsequently confirmed that they had been infected earlier, and linked the two clusters together.

This breakthrough would not have been possible without close cooperation among the Ministry of Health, Singapore, Singapore Police Force and researchers from Duke-NUS Medical School, who developed the serological test, the world's first, here in Singapore. My thanks to all of you for a job well done!

For now, the best thing we can all do is to continue practising good hygiene, and be socially responsible — do not go to gatherings if you are feeling unwell. Together, we can beat the coronavirus. – LHL

To understand how the transmission likely occurred across the different cases, MOH and the Police had extensively analysed the activity maps of the confirmed cases, and interviewed them as well as their close contacts. With the discovery of the links between the two church clusters to the travellers from Wuhan, we have now determined the likely source of infection for a large majority of the locally transmitted cases.

He also took the opportunity to listen to their feedback on how they are coping with the additional precautionary measures that the Ministry of Health has been rolling out since January. Minister Gan was joined by Mayor of South West District Ms Low Yen Ling and fellow MP for Chua Chu Kang GRC Mr Zaqy Mohamad.

Despite various new protocols and measures they had to adapt to, the teams are upbeat and determined to do their best to keep their patients safe. They have also worked out good processes to triage patients, isolate and escalate suspect cases, while tending to the vast majority of patients whose conditions are not related to COVID-19.

We hope the public will continue to show them your support, and bear with us if you encounter any inconvenience during your visit to the primary care providers. We also want to thank the sponsors who have so kindly donated care packs for our healthcare workers.

<New Stay Home Notice>

The number of Covid-19 cases in China continues to rise. There are now more than 12000 cases outside of Hubei. At the same time, there are many Singaporeans, PRs and long-term pass holders still in China. Many may return after the CNY holidays.

Previously all returnees from China have to serve a 14-day Leave of Absence or LOA. To date, we’ve not had any confirmed cases amongst them. But with the latest situation, we have to do more to guard against the risk of a returnee carrying the virus.

So we have introduced a new Stay Home Notice, which will replace the LOA. Under this new regime, all returnees will have to stay at home or their designated accommodation (eg dormitory or hostel) throughout the 14 day period. They will not be allowed to go out. We will enforce this strictly using a range of technological tools and manual spot checks, and there will be penalties for all who breach the rules.

This additional measures will help to minimise the number of new imported cases, and allow us to focus our energies and efforts on reducing the risks of local transmission within our own community.",18/2/2020 13:11,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/87155723_3464715266903125_414014472009547776_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=TFocSn-XxLkAX_EbqL6&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=9c5b9a77dc02873441b57849ba4dbce4&oe=6057B440,,,,128,9,24,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157786784560631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/87155723_3464715266903125_414014472009547776_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=TFocSn-XxLkAX_EbqL6&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=9c5b9a77dc02873441b57849ba4dbce4&oe=6057B440'],10157786784560600

1.01578E+16,"The number of confirmed cases in mainland China (outside of Hubei) has increased from over 4,000 cases on 31 January 2020 to over 12,000 today.

At the same time, there remains a substantial number of Singapore residents and long-term pass holders in China, including Singapore Citizens. Many of them are expected to return to Singapore in the coming weeks, and to their workplaces or schools, after the Chinese New Year holidays in China. There is a higher chance that returnees could be carrying the virus.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has therefore decided to introduce a new “Stay-Home Notice” (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China (outside of Hubei). This SHN will take effect from 18 February 2020, 23:59 hours, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.

Under the SHN, they will have to remain in their place of residence at all times during the 14-day period. This is stricter than the existing LOA regime, which had allowed returnees to leave their homes briefly, for example for their meals or to buy household supplies.

Those placed on SHN will be reminded to monitor their health closely and minimise contact with others.

Joined a video conference this afternoon between Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong and WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, where we shared with World Health Organization (WHO) our measures to contain COVID-19 in Singapore. Our enhanced surveillance includes the conduct of COVID-19 tests on all pneumonia cases admitted at our restructured Hospitals and sentinel surveillance of influenza cases in the community.

Starting tomorrow, 800-900 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) GP clinics in Singapore will be progressively activated to provide subsidised care for all patients with respiratory illnesses.
With enhanced surveillance, we will expect a higher number of confirmed cases but these measures are important to help minimise the chance of spread in our hospitals and within the community.

DG commended our containment and contact tracing efforts in ring-fencing the clusters and noted that there is currently no widespread community transmission in Singapore. He also urged Singapore to share our experiences with other Member States, so that affected countries can learn from one another in the fight against the virus together.

Singapore stands in solidarity with the global community and will continue to work closely with WHO and Member States to protect our people from the COVID-19.

I am proud to see Singaporeans stepping up to cheer our frontliners on.

I was at Singapore General Hospital today to meet our nurses, patient care assistants, health attendants, maintenance and hospital support team.

Four restaurants contacted me and offered to treat our frontliners to a nice lunch.

60 packets of Nasi Ayam Geprek (chicken rice) from Kinamaya.

4,000 curry puffs from Rumah Makan Minang (1,000 a week for 4 weeks).

1,000 samosa sets from Hjh Maimunah Restaurant (250 a week for 4 weeks).

70 pasta sets from Positano Risto

Riders from Dadah Itu Haram helped to bring some food to the hospital.

We heard about the disgraceful way some people treated our healthcare workers recently. We know for certain that such people are a minority, a very tiny minority.

Many are stepping forward to appreciate and care for our frontliners. The best of Singapore is showing - shining, glowing, beaming. #SGUnited

Read this moving account by one of our recovered COVID-19 patients. Mrs Zhang was evacuated from Wuhan on the first Scoot flight. She was asymptomatic on the flight, but was found to have a fever upon arrival in Singapore. Her illness took a turn for the worse, and she had to be admitted into ICU, but she managed to pull through, thanks to the care of the doctors and nurses at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. She shared her recovery experience with the Ministry of Health, Singapore.

My deepest respect to all the healthcare workers, who are working so hard to care for patients. My thanks also to their families and loved ones for their sacrifices and understanding. 19 patients have recovered and been discharged so far, including Mrs Zhang. Wishing a smooth recovery to all remaining warded patients. – LHL

1.01578E+16,"We are re-activating the Public Health Preparedness Clinics to focus our primary care efforts to better detect and manage COVID-19 infections. We have also observed that many of the local confirmed cases had continued to circulate in the community or gone to work when they were already ill. This is why we had earlier given guidance to doctors to provide medical certificates (MC) of five days for patients with respiratory symptoms so they could stay home to recover.

Based on the COVID-19 cases in Singapore so far, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases has observed that a significant number of them have mild symptoms in the initial phase of infection. Similar to influenza, these patients typically experience mild flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough. And similar to influenza, they can be infectious during this initial period of mild symptoms. The risk of their infecting others can be reduced with appropriate measures.

In fact, most patients with respiratory symptoms are not infected with COVID-19. But we must take extra precautions. It is therefore important that anyone with respiratory symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose) seek medical treatment early, and stay home throughout their illness. We urge all individuals and employers to cooperate, and follow strictly the five-day MC regime that has been put in place. In addition, we will be taking further pre-emptive measures to reduce the risk of community transmission.

Taxi drivers reluctant to pick up staff in medical uniform. A healthcare professional’s private-hire vehicle cancelled because she was going to a hospital.

A nurse in a lift asked why she was not taking the stairs and that she was spreading the virus to others by taking the lift.

A nurse scolded for making the MRT train ‘dirty’ and spreading the virus. An ambulance driver turned away by food stall workers.

These are some examples of disgraceful conduct. Discriminatory actions.

They do not reflect the best of Singapore. In fact, they do not represent us at all. These are shameful acts of a small irrational minority.

We’re better than that!

I met our Singapore Civil Defence Force officers at SCDF HQ this afternoon. I thanked our hardworking men and women for bravely answering the call of duty with distinction and conviction.

Ordinary people, with families - like you and me. Yet, they rose to the occasion. They shared with me their pride in serving Singapore and Singaporeans in this time of need.

<<Courage & Care in trying times>>
Our frontline workers in the healthcare and other sectors have been working tirelessly to respond to the public health threat posed by COVID-19. On behalf of all Singaporeans, we thank them for their hard work and selfless dedication.

Our healthcare workers have expressed appreciation for the many offers of help from many good-hearted Singaporeans. Some have suggested that it might be helpful to have a centralised place for Singaporeans to find out how to contribute, in a way that is timely and relevant. We will support this in two ways:

(1) The Courage Fund. This was set up 17 years ago to support SARS patients, healthcare workers and their dependents as well as the wider community affected by serious infectious diseases. Community Chest Singapore and NCSS will facilitate the use of the fund for COVID-19, to support patients, healthcare workers and other affected people. People who wish to donate can also do so. As of today, we have received $250,000 from President’s Challenge and $300,000 from CapitaLand. https://www.comchest.sg/thecouragefund

(2) We are also creating a centralised platform to enable the various ground-up initiatives to more meaningfully address areas of need. Some Singaporeans may want to volunteer or contribute in a bigger way. I will share more details soon.

The way we respond to this global health crisis will shape not just who we are as Singaporeans but also how we will be remembered by future generations. I am confident that Singaporeans will choose courage and resilience, and continue to look out for one another.

Visited the Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) Operations Command Centre and NCID and spoke with leadership and staff of the Hospitals, together with Ministers Gan Kim Yong and Lawrence Wong.
Healthcare workers are critical frontline workers in this #FightAgainstCoVid19.
It is distressing and disappointing to read stories of how ambulance drivers and nurses in uniform are being shunned by the public. These are the everyday heroes who have been working hard, putting their lives at risk to ensure that patients are well taken care of. Healthcare workers have responded to their call of duty during this trying time (and always will) and we should all show our gratitude and appreciation for their professionalism and dedication to keeping Singaporeans and Singapore safe. Together as one #TeamSingapore, we can overcome and rise above this crisis and emerge stronger as a nation!

On behalf of my colleagues on the multi-ministry taskforce, I wrote a letter to the ST a Forum to echo public support for our frontline heroes. Let’s stand with them.

<<Need to stick together to get through this>>

The letters by Mr Phillip Tan Fong Lip (Kudos to those fighting outbreak, Feb 6) and Mr Adrian Villanueva (Stay strong and united in current difficulties, Feb 10) are very much appreciated.

With the recent developments in the situation, our battle against the novel coronavirus looks like it could be a long one. Those on the front line - including healthcare workers and everyone involved in ensuring the cleanliness and safety of our environment - will especially need our support.

The kind words and understanding of people like Mr Tan and Mr Villanueva will help them to keep up the fight.

On behalf of my colleagues on the multi-ministry task force, I would like to echo the letter writers' appreciation to everyone involved in standing united to manage this situation.

Across both the public and private sectors, many have gone well beyond the call of duty, working through many nights and over the Chinese New Year period. They are giving their best for Singapore. We would also like to thank their families for their understanding and support.

Because of their hard work, the Government can continue to lead a robust response against the virus, and keep the public updated on the situation in a timely and transparent manner.

Let us all do our part in our national effort to keep Singaporeans safe and healthy.
Be socially responsible, practise good personal hygiene habits, and take the necessary steps if unwell.

As Mr Tan said, we can overcome this if we all cooperate and play a positive role. In these difficult times, we can call on our unity and Singapore spirit to overcome the challenge. We are confident that the best of Singapore will allow us to prevail over this virus.

7 teams, 2 shifts, drawn from MOH departments, 8.30 am to 10 pm, 7 days a week.

I joined MOH's team of contact tracers on Monday (10 Feb) and helped to make calls.

Our task - identify and check on all whom a suspect novel coronavirus patient has interacted with, determine who have been in close contact and at risk of an infection. We also check on whether the person is well or not. A close contact must be quarantined for 14 days from last contact with patient.

This is an important aspect of managing this infection. With proper identification and quarantine, we can ring fence the case and contain transmission.

#SGUnited: A*STAR has worked with the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) to successfully develop thousands of 2019-nCoV diagnostic test kits for a number of Singapore public hospitals.

The tests can accurately screen patients for the coronavirus, possibly reducing the wait time for results and allowing those infected to be treated quickly.

Singapore is self-sufficient in this critical area of diagnostics, with the Diagnostics Development (DxD) Hub having the ability to transfer the know-how to local biotechs and SMEs to ramp up production of the tests for the country and the region.

10,000 tests were recently sent to China to assist in the international effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus infection.

The team comprises Dr Masafumi Inoue from A*STAR’s Experimental Drug Development Centre (EDDC); Associate Professor Timothy Barkham from the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital; Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh from A*STAR’s Bioinformatics Institute (BII), and Dr Sidney Yee from DxD Hub.

Support #OpsHandsOn! They need recycled bottles so they can fill with hand sanitizers, and volunteers to help them. Delane Lim of FutuReady and Tony Tan from Innotrek, together with colleagues from their two outdoor camp operators, decided to distribute hand sanitizers and masks to elderly and the vulnerable in the community and to share with them important public health messages.

Impacted by the decision to cancel school camps, the two organizations decided instead to galvanize and play a proactive part in the fight against the coronavirus. They sourced and bought the masks and sanitizers, spent hours packing, prepared flyers and videos in various languages, and worked with the grassroots volunteers and NGOs to distribute them across various parts of Singapore.

They started on 10 Feb and will continue every day for the next 2 weeks. They’ve made an open call for volunteers and donations for recycled bottles, and many people have sprung into action. Please support them.

I joined Ang Hin Kee, Advisor to the National Taxi Association and the NPHVA this afternoon to meet some 50 taxi and private hire car drivers for a dialogue. Drivers shared their concerns about the virus situation, mainly about the drop in ridership and risks of infection in the course of their work.

We hear them and we feel their worries. Totally understandable. The Government will take the lead to coordinate tripartite efforts with taxi and private hire car operators. NTA and NPHVA will provide more support to the taxi and private hire car sector, and one of the first things we are doing will be to make a one-time contribution of 300,000 surgical masks for active drivers. These masks are intended for drivers to offer to passengers who are unwell but do not have a mask and need a ride to seek medical attention. More support measures will be announced in the coming weeks.

How is contact tracing done?
1. Interview – The hospital maps out the patient’s steps and contacts for the last 14 days
2. Investigation – Contact tracers at MOH make calls to the people the patient has interacted with to get more details
3. Identification – Further analysis to determine if the person is a close contact and whether the close contact is well
4. Notification – If the close contact is well, he or she will need to be quarantined for 14 days from last contact with the patient; if the person is symptomatic, he or she will be classified as a suspect case and isolated in hospital.

The pervasiveness of social media has changed the way we receive and react to information and news. In the current rapidly evolving nCoV situation, deliberate online falsehoods can spread more widely and quickly than the facts.

In an interview with CNBC last week, I emphasised that it is important to ensure that the public has access to accurate and up-to-date information. We also need to take swift action against the spread of falsehoods that can sow fear and cause panic in our society.

Gov.sg’s Whatsapp is one channel where the public can turn to for regular updates and information on the nCoV situation in all four languages. Residents have told me that they appreciate having such timely updates. Together, we can take a firm stand against falsehoods and help one another to overcome this challenge.

As of 10 February 2020, 12pm, we have confirmed two additional cases of 2019-nCoV infection in Singapore. Of these, one was on the evacuation flight from Wuhan on 30 January. Contact tracing of the other case is underway.

We have looked into reports that 2019-nCOV could be transmitted through aerosol.

Based on evidence available in China, an expert from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said that there is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through aerosol. The currently known transmission routes of the virus are via respiratory droplets and physical contact.

Visited Victoria Junior College today to check in on the students and staff. Last week, one of the teachers was confirmed to be infected with the 2019-nCoV virus.

Glad to see that attendance was 92% today - very normal - and students are in good spirits.

But it troubled me when students told me that some members of the public had shunned them in uniform, even going so far as to refuse to serve them!

This is not what we stand for in Singapore, and I’m sure the few don’t reflect the larger population.

As I shared with the school, it’s important to remember that how we treat the affected people could be how the rest of the world treats us Singaporeans. They could avoid us, just because we have confirmed cases of nCoV infections.

I’m cheered that many students also expressed their desire for school life to go on as far as possible, with precautions, and despite some calls for school closures. To them, this crisis is an opportunity for the school to rally together and show how the “Indomitable Victorian Spirit” triumphs. Likewise, if we all stick together, I’m sure our Singapore spirit will triumph over all. #VJunite #SGunite",10/2/2020 19:05,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/84592797_3223432044338042_1075629638220251136_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=IRM78HiKc5sAX__IbT7&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=79ede2dfa8921f760665ded3ec720320&oe=6054F5CB,,,,130,1,6,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157762332325631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/84592797_3223432044338042_1075629638220251136_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=IRM78HiKc5sAX__IbT7&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=79ede2dfa8921f760665ded3ec720320&oe=6054F5CB', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/86224228_3223432054338041_3240462862447017984_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=5pKYUUMb06cAX9m_zWt&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=365bf5853e1f358e6acd05226000dc62&oe=6055B7C2', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/84889799_3223432174338029_7655451967266750464_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=KlwuHr0dZOAAX8TbP4A&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=c919d4a6700f1c1b71578bdfd32b3ceb&oe=6055F05A', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/84411144_3223432191004694_5428852307255099392_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=YrygyFeNnPoAX9TLgnq&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=1c4fecb59a3e0a90873c63b9695dd3e0&oe=605750D0']",10157762332325600

Three more 2019 novel coronavirus cases were confirmed on Sunday. The Ministry of Health, Singapore is doing contact tracing for these as well as seven other confirmed local cases. You can read the latest update here: http://bit.ly/MOH-9Feb.

While we have been seeing more new cases, I am relieved to hear that four more cases have fully recovered and were discharged on Sunday. We have seen a total of six patients who have recovered fully.

With the switch from DORSCON Yellow to Orange, MOH has issued an infographic on precautions you should take to help contain the spread of 2019-nCoV. Just remember the 5Ms, practice them diligently and stay healthy!

Do share it with your friends and loved ones so that they are informed as well.

Coronavirus: Fighting a psychological battle

When I spoke to Singaporeans on Saturday, I described fighting the coronavirus on two fronts — the medical and, more importantly, the psychological.

This The Straits Times article explains how small and close-knit societies like Singapore are prone to herd mentality and mass behaviour. Drawing on lessons from SARS, it outlines three ways we can practise psychological defence — by not ostracising frontline medical personnel, not going into lockdown and shutting down businesses, and finally, not succumbing to racist and xenophobic thoughts and actions.

Do not let fear and paranoia overwhelm our better selves. We can overcome this current challenge by keeping calm, staying united and supporting one another. – LHL

Glad that our second specially arranged FlyScoot flight TR5121 to bring 174 Singaporeans and their family members back home from Wuhan has landed safely at Changi Airport. All passengers and crew will be required to undergo medical checks and undergo the appropriate quarantine arrangements upon arrival.

Before the plane took off from Singapore on Saturday, Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan handed over to PRC Ambassador to Singapore Hong Xiaoyong diagnostic test kits and medical supplies as part of Singapore’s contribution to China’s effort to fight the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak. Infectious diseases transcend borders, and Singapore will work closely with China and the international community to overcome this global challenge.

My thanks to the PRC government, together with the dedicated Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs officers as well as the Scoot airline crew, and pilots who all helped to bring our people home.

On top of our four official languages, Gov.sg has also published several videos in Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese to educate dialect-speaking Singaporeans, especially the older generation, about the coronavirus situation.

These videos are very useful — calling on individuals to be socially responsible, look out for one another, and for everyone to play a part as we work together to overcome the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

Do share these videos with your friends and loved ones who only understand dialect. You can find the full series of videos here: bit.ly/Govsg-dialectvids

Also, if you have yet to sign up for the Gov.sg WhatsApp group, it’s still not too late! You can sign up here: https://www.form.gov.sg/#!/5d15b58f9fbcc50018bc66f2 — it’s available in our 4 languages, English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil.

Visited the Lions Befrienders’ Senior Activity Centre (SAC) on Mei Ling Street, which had a Community Nursing Post in collaboration with the National University Health System - NUHS. The Community Nursing Post (CNPs) has been an important healthcare resource for seniors in the neighbourhood.

Our friendly nurses at CNPs develop care plans for our seniors, help to monitor their chronic conditions, assess health risk factors as well as ensure early interventions and timely referrals. Besides the CNP, our nurses in the community also regularly conduct house visits for seniors who may have mobility issues.

I spoke to a number of the seniors at the SAC, and wished them a Happy Chinese New Year. One of them was Mr Lai, who brings along his bag to his check-ups at the CNP to show the nurses that he has faithfully taken his medication. The nurses have a good rapport and trust with Mr Lai, who proudly showed them his pill box.

I also joined Staff Nurse Rafidah for a home visit. We visited Mr Mostakim, who recently moved into the flat and is settling in well. The CNP team helps him to optimise his glucose control and ensure he takes his medication. Mr Mostakim also regularly goes for his check-ups at the SAC.

Since October 2017, the Ministry of Health, Singapore has worked with our three healthcare clusters to pilot community nursing teams island-wide to anchor care in the community. We will continue to strengthen community nursing across Singapore and make community nursing services accessible to more seniors in 2020.",9/2/2020 12:00,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/84523626_3140427289301024_7942697941209186304_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Rl5C_TgKL-MAX8med1U&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=bed8b40f58b72d7dca3e524bb9d16613&oe=6056D4F7,,,,46,1,3,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157758748660631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/84523626_3140427289301024_7942697941209186304_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Rl5C_TgKL-MAX8med1U&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=bed8b40f58b72d7dca3e524bb9d16613&oe=6056D4F7', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83588812_3140427299301023_8115294126871674880_o.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=sXJZxU-gziEAX-tpEir&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=76b8340cd122f2db887861cd66cb9493&oe=605525D3', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83949028_3140427572634329_4155760714377592832_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=IoSfGB9bqUQAX_dDyNg&_nc_oc=AQlhtI2wc8L7w0G7Lkp4U0gHMJeYX9FyonIOz1_ktXoDn0hZfm6DGAliGtryOQYqkJA&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=abd1070fe3e69693a41523dafcd7dfc9&oe=605478D7', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83945972_3140427309301022_7848085292056576000_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=bL9DPx7I5zkAX8BoCcZ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=d7f4688f1d45032f2b41f1b11ff86131&oe=6055CEF1']",10157758748660600

Just launched our second Scoot flight to Wuhan. It is extra special because today marks ‘Chap Goh Mei’, a day for family reunion in Chinese tradition. This flight will bring our Singaporeans and their family members back home from Wuhan.

We also gave some diagnostic test kits and medical supplies for the novel coronavirus to China this afternoon through PRC Ambassador Hong Xiaoyong. We must credit the Chinese for sequencing and releasing the full genome of the virus by mid-January, which enabled multiple research centers across the world, including A*STAR in Singapore, to rapidly develop test kits for specific identification of the 2019-nCov.

Infectious diseases do not stop at the border. We can only overcome this global challenge by working together, at both the national and international level. Singapore will continue to work closely with China and the international community to tackle the challenge.

We have faced the novel coronavirus situation for about two weeks now.

People are understandably anxious and fearful. But fear can end up doing more harm than the virus itself! It can lead to irrational panic, causing us to hoard face masks or food.

Singapore has ample supplies — already, supermarkets across Singapore have restocked. There is no need to stock up on instant noodles or toilet paper, as was widely seen on social media yesterday.

Instead, let us stay united and resolute in this outbreak. Keep helping one another, as many of you have stepped up to do. And most importantly, stay calm and carry on with our lives. – LHL

Happy to share that a patient who was a confirmed case of 2019-nCoV infection has been discharged from NCID on Friday (7 Feb) afternoon. Ms Jiang is a 53-year-old Wuhan resident who came to Singapore for a holiday. Doctors have cleared her of the 2019-nCoV infection, and have ascertained that she is no longer infectious. She is looking forward to going home now that she is discharged.

Having recovered from the nCoV infection, she shared that she was not afraid during her illness because of the wonderful medical team attending to her. She thanked them for the good care she received and lauded the team for their “hearts of gold” and their strong sense of responsibility and professionalism in caring for her. Here’s a photo of Ms Jiang, in good spirits, with nurses at the NCID.

Ms Jiang also showed great resilience – she was brave and overcame her illness, and she felt she has grown in strength from the experience.

We are happy for Ms Jiang’s recovery and we wish her well!

Those flouting leave of absence rules face action

HELPING EMPLOYERS OF WORK PASS HOLDERS WITH CHINA TRAVEL HISTORY

We have both Singaporeans and work pass holders (WPHs) who may have visited China recently and have yet to return. I thought it would be timely to address a few recurring questions on the WPHs.

Why not get them to return later?

We are already doing so. Employers now have to seek MOM’s approval before bringing back these WPHs [https://go.gov.sg/mom-wphs requirements-for-employers-with-wph-returning-from-china]. It would be very helpful if employers voluntarily defer their return. However, we are mindful that not all employers can do so without severely disrupting their business. If this happens, their local employees will also be affected.

What happens when these WPHs return?

For returning WPHs (and likewise, Singaporeans), there are multiple layers of health and temperature checks before and when they arrive in #Singapore. Once here, they must observe a mandatory 14-day leave of absence (LOA) as an extra precaution, and minimise social contact. Singapore Ministry of Manpower takes the mandatory LOA very seriously – we will require regular reporting, and also conduct spot checks. Penalties for individuals caught flouting the rules includes the cancellation of their work passes and repatriation.

What if they cannot find suitable accommodation to serve their LOA?

If these WPHs and their employers are unable to find suitable accommodation, we will not approve their return in the first place. However, we understand that there are companies who need to bring back their workers to keep their businesses running. If employers have difficulties finding accommodation, MOM will help to link them up with available dorm operators.

We greatly appreciate the support and cooperation of the business community during this period. – Jo Teo

Pictures circulated last night of empty shelves and panic buying of food and household essentials at supermarkets around Singapore.

There’s ample supply and shelves will be restocked.

We took photos of the market and various supermarkets, provision shops and grocery stores across #jurongspring this morning. There are queues at a few supermarkets, but most were business as usual. The stall owners and shopkeepers we spoke to said that shelves will continue to be restocked. Appreciate the help of many community volunteers this morning who fanned out across all our shops.",8/2/2020 12:56,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/84182946_3791033804240867_8090409962531979264_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Wvaoh1_EwKEAX_GVcOA&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4ea973833d0455db6460f541952a18af&oe=60580896,,,,244,19,68,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157756046215631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/84182946_3791033804240867_8090409962531979264_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Wvaoh1_EwKEAX_GVcOA&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4ea973833d0455db6460f541952a18af&oe=60580896', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/84685750_3791034614240786_6446135935745654784_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Fi-s7jyB5U4AX-w1_il&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4606d2a1f2f654ec3eb15d2434ed4bfd&oe=60573D91', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/84336403_3791035327574048_1792875827893895168_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=fkwolAi5ZrYAX-0FgeT&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=4fab290668ba3926d7190567e0dddc5e&oe=60568F72', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83879776_3791035214240726_996152286315020288_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=M66W8GNe6eIAX-o5tEL&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b96a33f31a4e97213b0506974acc1e53&oe=605671E3']",10157756046215600

Yes we’re at Orange DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) level now. But really no reason to panic - none at all. No reason to go on a buying spree to hoard food or other essentials.

The panic is what causes shortage. It feeds fear, fuels irrational conduct. Needless frenzy. That’ll just make you fall sick easily.

Yes, there are new cases and local transmission. We’re taking this very seriously - from border controls, quarantine measures, to enhanced protection for seniors and children and more.

Practise good personal hygiene. Be socially responsible - stay at home if you are ill.

We are now in Dorscon Orange as there are a few local cases of 2019-novel coronavirus without any links to previous cases or travel history to China. As such, we are putting in place further safeguards for our preschools and social service facilities that look after seniors and persons with disability.

From tomorrow, 8 February, all preschools, residential and community-based facilities serving vulnerable groups (such as children, the elderly and persons with disability) will:

(a) Restrict the entry of casual visitors to minimise the risk of community transmission.

(b) Limit the movement of staff across different preschools and facilities.

In addition, our residential and community-based facilities will:

(c) Allow only a maximum of two designated caregivers/visitors per enrolled client/resident.

(d) Increase temperature screening to twice daily, if not already the practice.

We also encourage users of our MSF frontline services (including when submitting Baby Bonus/Lasting Power of Attorney forms at service counters, or walk-in registrations for marriage solemnisations at ROM) to avoid crowds by using our online services, or contact us by email/post instead. You can reach us at go.gov.sg/msfcontactus

I seek the understanding of parents, caregivers and staff who may be inconvenienced by these tighter measures. Let’s continue to work together to stay safe and healthy.

Today MOH confirmed 3 new cases of the 2019-nCoV infection. Among them is a JC teacher. She was last in VJC on 31 Jan and only developed symptoms on 2 Feb.

The school has taken a slew of precautionary measures, including asking the class she taught in, and colleagues in close contact with her, to take a Leave of Absence. VJC has disinfected the school thoroughly, having more tutorial classes instead of large lectures, and suspending CCAs for two weeks.

I spoke with the teacher on the phone earlier this evening. She felt bad about what happened, but I assured her it was not her fault. What we are doing are necessary precautions to keep our schools safe. I also wished her speedy recovery.

System wide, we have implemented enhanced measures - suspending inter-school activities and external activities until the end of the March school holidays. This is to reduce the mixing of students across schools and exposure to large crowds at public places. We have also put in place a stringent hygiene regime, ensuring students and staff practise good personal hygiene, and also social hygiene protocols such as wiping down surfaces after use.

Some parents have suggested suspending schools. But this is a drastic move that will disrupt life for many families, and it is also not realistic to expect older children to stay home the whole time school is closed.

Should there be wide community spread - which we hope will not happen - and given all the measures we have taken, schools may actually be one of the safest places for our students. We are calling on our 33,000 educators to make that happen.

We will continue to monitor the situation and do the necessary steps to keep our people safe.

There have been many reports this evening of people buying up food and household items at our supermarkets. This has resulted in photos of temporary empty shelves in our supermarkets circulating on social media.

I understand that people are concerned after the announcement this afternoon that we have raised the DORSCON level to orange.

We have done so as there are now a few local cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to China. This is a scenario that we are prepared for and we will put in place additional measures to minimise the risk of further transmission.

MTI is in close contact with our retailers and I assure all Singaporeans that there is no need to rush for essential supplies like rice or instant noodles. Our supply lines for these essentials are intact and there is no risk of us running a shortage of essential food or household items. We also have our national stockpile for essential items.

However, we must all play our part, exercise individual responsibility and not hoard items unnecessarily. This will create undue panic and is unhelpful to the situation at hand.

Collective defence is our strongest defence. Let us all stay alert but remain calm and collected. The Government is monitoring all aspects of the situation closely and will always make sure that the needs of Singaporeans are met and catered for. CCS

有许多超市出现人群扫购食品和家居日常用品的现象。社交网站也流传着超市货架空荡荡的照片。

我理解大家今天下午在看到DORSCON应对级别上调到橙色后自然会感到不安。我们是因为出现没有与之前确诊案例有联系，又没有去过中国的本地确诊案例，才会提升级别。这是我们早已做好准备的情况，也是为了防止扩散而实行的措施。

贸工部已经和零售商取得密切联系，我也要在此呼吁国人保持冷静。我们的必须品有充足的货源，所有的必须品也都有存货，没有缺乏或断货的风险。但大家也必须尽自己的责任和本分，不要囤积日用品，造成不必要的恐慌。这样的行为只会对目前的情况雪上加霜。

<DORSCON Orange>

Given the emergence of new cases in Singapore with no links to previous cases or with no recent travel history to China, there is now indication of community spread of the virus. Hence the Taskforce has decided to raise our alert levels to DORSCON Orange, with additional precautionary measures:

- Event organisers are advised to cancel/defer large-scale non-essential events. Those that wish to proceed should take all necessary precautions including temperature screening, and denying entry to those with respiratory symptoms and recent travel history to China

- All employers and individuals should do regular temperature taking twice daily. Those with a fever should see a doctor promptly.

- All organisations should step up their Business Continuity Plans. This can include telecommuting or operating in split teams.

We are also taking extra precautions in our hospitals, schools/preschools and eldercare organisations to protect our children, elderly and vulnerable groups.

I know many Singaporeans are anxious and worried about the spread of the virus. The government will continue to do everything we can to contain and ring-fence every case we identify, and prevent broader community spread. You can help too by taking these three measures to protect yourself and your family:
- Wash your hands frequently with soap
- Avoid shaking hands (use other forms of greeting) and avoid touching your face with your hands
- Take your temperature regularly and see a doctor immediately if you have a fever

If we continue to stand together and look out for each other, I am confident we can overcome this challenging situation.",7/2/2020 19:25,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83946948_3428469630527689_425222086089244672_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=MkOHS6KTfwMAX83n229&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=0fbbb4a77f101a12483879006d103078&oe=6054DE0C,,,,70,2,31,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157753594840631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83946948_3428469630527689_425222086089244672_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=MkOHS6KTfwMAX83n229&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=0fbbb4a77f101a12483879006d103078&oe=6054DE0C'],10157753594840600

Singapore's Support for China's Efforts to Overcome The 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak

The 2019-novel coronavirus is a global public health challenge. I spoke to PRC Vice-Premier Han Zheng earlier today. I conveyed my condolences and sympathies to the families who have lost their loved ones to the outbreak, and to the communities in China which have been severely affected by the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

I reiterated to Vice-Premier Han that Singapore will continue to work closely with China and the international community to fight the virus — this includes preventing its further spread and developing better medical testing.

In times like this, with the longstanding special relationship between Singapore and China, it is also important for us to work together.

Singapore researchers have worked to develop diagnostic nCoV test kits for use in laboratories. We can contribute to China’s containment efforts by providing test kits to conduct 10,000 tests at the first instance, together with 3 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines. We will be providing another 10,000 tests in the next couple of weeks. Our scientific experts are also exchanging views with their counterparts in China.

Earlier this week, the Singapore Red Cross, together with various trade associations and chambers, companies and local community organisations, launched a public appeal to raise funds to provide humanitarian assistance to the affected communities in China. The Singapore Government will also contribute $1 million in seed funding to this collective effort by Singaporeans.

Infectious diseases are transboundary in nature. Countries can only overcome this challenge by stepping up measures within each country, and by collaborating with one another.

Singapore will continue to do our part — enhancing our safeguards as the situation evolves, and working with China and the international community to combat this outbreak.

I am confident we can overcome this challenge together.

<Stepping up the Leave of Absence Regime>

We had earlier put in place the Leave of Absence (LOA) regime for all returning travellers, including Singaporeans/PRs, from the rest of China (i.e. outside of Hubei province). They were assessed to be of lower risk (compared to Hubei travellers) and were not quarantined, but we required them to serve out a 14-day LOA at their homes.

But given the escalating situation in China, we have decided to step up the entire LOA regime, which is mandatory. Specifically we will further enhance the monitoring and surveillance system with regular video/phone calls and spot checks, and impose penalties for non-compliance. So whether one is on home quarantine or LOA, the requirements will be strictly upheld, and we will ensure all comply with the rules.

For returning PRC workers, we will also require their employers to notify MOM before their workers return, so we can push back and stagger their arrivals over a longer period of time. For those with genuine difficulties finding suitable accommodations, we will work with the employers to identify suitable dorm facilities for the workers to serve out the LOA. I visited a dorm in Tuas with Manpower Minister Josephine Teo and I’m glad that the dorm operators are also helping to prepare spaces for the returning workers.

In the end all of us must do our part. Individuals under quarantine or LOA must comply with the requirements strictly; employers must take responsibility for their returning workers; landlords and dorm operators can also help by making their spaces available for workers to serve the home quarantine or LOA. That’s how we can all fight and contain the virus together",6/2/2020 23:21,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83915617_3425536540820998_7500966258532155392_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=qkuhlyXT0_cAX8QlO81&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=51680f768e7acf829a94142949534711&oe=605473C4,,,,58,27,13,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157751256050631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83915617_3425536540820998_7500966258532155392_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=qkuhlyXT0_cAX8QlO81&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=51680f768e7acf829a94142949534711&oe=605473C4'],10157751256050600
1.01578E+16,"As of 6 February 2020, 2pm, we have confirmed two additional cases of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in Singapore. Of these, one case is a close contact of a previously confirmed case. The other case has no recent travel history to mainland China and does not appear to be linked with previous cases. This case was confirmed late last night and contact tracing is still in progress, with focus on identifying any links it may have with past cases or travellers from China. We will provide further updates tomorrow as the investigations progress.

Thus far all our previously announced confirmed cases have been either PRC travellers from Hubei, or individuals with links to PRC travellers. All such cases have been isolated and ring-fenced. But we must be prepared for the possibility of new infection clusters involving locals within the community, not linked with recent travel to China or contact with recent PRC travellers. This has already happened in several places outside of mainland China. We had earlier stepped up significantly our precautionary measures to reduce the risk of community spread of the virus. We stand ready to ramp up our measures even more once we have some findings from the ongoing investigations.

STEPPING UP PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES

I went down to Chinatown yesterday together with NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng 黄志明 to find out how the shops and workers are coping with the evolving 2019-nCoV (#NovelCoronovirus) situation.

With the first case of local transmission, people may be worried, particularly workers at the frontline.

I want to assure every one that we are ready and prepared. The tripartite partners have disseminated an advisory to businesses (https://www.mom.gov.sg/2019-ncov/general-advisory-for-workplaces-and-frontline-workers) to guide them on how to strengthen precautions and keep their workplaces and workers safe.

For employers, they can step up cleaning on areas with high human contact, such as countertops, lifts and washrooms. This extends to all other workplaces. They can also help familiarise employees on how to deal with certain situations, such as serving customers who are unwell.

Employees too can play a part by observing their own personal hygiene, such as washing their hands more frequently, and seek medical attention promptly if they are unwell.

If we pull together and implement these measures, I am confident that we can continue to keep our workplaces and workers safe. – Jo Teo

Our cabin crew are our heroes, working at the frontline as we continue to provide connectivity for our citizens staying and working in some key Chinese Cities.

Just touched down this morning after extensive meetings with executive board members of the World Health Organization (WHO) and spoke to some SIA cabin crew who will be departing for Beijing and Shanghai. Together with SIA, we have put in place measures to ensure that the health of our passengers and cabin crew are protected on flights to and from China, especially during this challenging times.

We are monitoring the situation very closely and we appreciate the strong support of all cabin crew and the understanding of their families as we continue our #FightAgainst2019nCov.

Stay vigilant, stay calm and stay healthy. Tough times don’t last, tough people do! 17 years ago, we succeeded in battling SARS. We are much better prepared now and together, we will overcome this, as one aviation community.

With the world’s population aged over 60 almost doubling from 12% to 22% between now and 2050, the question of how we can continue to create opportunities for seniors to stay healthy and connected to the community, and to delay the onset of frailty is something many nations are concerned about.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) has worked with government agencies and our partners to empower seniors to stay active and healthy. For instance, under the National Seniors Health Programme, over 550,000 seniors in the community have been reached through health talks and exercise programmes. Seniors are also connected to active ageing programmes, befriending and care and support services by Silver Generation Ambassadors who proactively reach out to them.

While MOH works with various public and private stakeholders to continually create such opportunities, we are also aware that seniors in the future will have different needs and aspirations from seniors of today. Therefore, fresh ideas are always needed. It is for this reason that NRF and MOH have partnered with the U.S. National Academy of Medicine’s (NAM) to launch the Catalyst Awards to reward bold, innovative ideas from any discipline that could extend the human health span through disease prevention, mobility, functionality, social connectedness, longevity, and more. I hope Singaporeans will step up to participate in the competition to uncover some breakthroughs in fostering healthy longevity that will benefit the seniors in our community, and perhaps, even the rest of the world.

Watch this video to see how we are keeping our housing estates clean and safe. I visited Tampines Green Terrace yesterday to observe the cleaning of frequently accessed areas around the HDB estate. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been working closely with Town Councils to ensure that they enhance their cleaning efforts and implement measures to upkeep good public hygiene. For instance, Tampines Town Council now cleans the lift buttons in their HDB estates twice a day!

Our cleaners are working hard to keep our environment clean. But if each one of us does our part to maintain good personal hygiene and keep our surroundings clean and litter-free, it will make the cleaners’ job easier and complement their efforts too. If your home may have been exposed to the novel coronavirus, you can watch this video to find out how you can clean and disinfect your home: https://www.facebook.com/NEASingapore/posts/689939038481665

NEA has also issued cleaning guidelines and advisories to commercial premises and residences. I urge all premise owners to ensure that cleaning and disinfection is done in accordance with NEA guidelines, which are available here: https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines

Let us all work together to minimise the risks of transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus.

What we know about the 6 new cases of novel coronavirus in Singapore

Heng Swee Keat
4 February 2020 at 14:23 ·

6 new cases of the 2019-novel coronavirus were confirmed today, including:
- 2 cases who were evacuated back from Wuhan on 30 January; and
- 4 cases of local transmission.

Local transmission occurs when the source of the infection can be identified. In these 4 cases, two staff at a shop serving tourists from China, and their tour guide were in close contact with the tourists. The fourth person is a domestic helper of one of the staff.

Ministry of Health, Singapore is now doing contact tracing to identify contacts of the cases, to quarantine them and to minimise the risk of spread. In this way, we can reduce the risk of further transmission by closely monitoring the cluster of contacts.

As of now, Minister Gan Kim Yong noted that there is no evidence of a widespread sustained community transmission. A widespread community transmission happens when confirmed cases have no linkages to possible contact source of infection. There is no evidence of this, but we must remain vigilant.

Glad that one of the earlier confirmed cases, a Wuhan resident, has been cleared of the virus and discharged from the National Centre of Infectious Diseases. Our frontline staff at our hospitals are working very hard, so let us support them, and also wish all the affected patients a speedy recovery.

Ministry of Education, Singapore and MSF Singapore are taking additional measures for our students in our pre-schools, primary and secondary schools, special education (SPED) schools, junior colleges, and Millennia Institute. They will suspend camps, assemblies and mass gatherings. You can read about this here: http://bit.ly/MOE-4Feb

As the situation evolves, we will put in additional measures accordingly. Our current travel restrictions will continue to help contain the risk of spread but there is still a risk that the situation may get worse. Should that happen, the Taskforce will consider additional measures to reduce human-to-human interactions, to protect the well-being of our people.

I hope that Singaporeans can remain calm, stay vigilant, and continue to take care of your own personal hygiene. Together, we can get through this.

We will take further precautionary measures to protect our preschoolers, in light of developments involving the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.

With effect from tomorrow, 5 Feb 2020:

(a) Large group and communal activities such as assemblies, excursions, field trips and mass celebrations will be suspended.

(b) Health checks and temperature screening for all children, staff and visitors will continue. We will increase the frequency of temperature taking for children and staff.

These measures also apply to our social services for vulnerable groups, including our residential facilities and disability day activity centres.

We seek the continued support and understanding of parents, preschool staff, our frontline colleagues, our partners and service users to mitigate the potential risks. My colleagues and I continue to monitor the situation closely and will implement further measures if necessary.

We have set up multiple lines of defence to reduce the risk of imported cases and local community transmission:

1) To prevent further importation of the virus into our shores, we have introduced measures such as temperature and health screening at all checkpoints, as well as international travel controls.

2) To detect and contain the virus, and prevent it from spreading further, we have good surveillance systems to identify cases. Our healthcare providers are right at the frontline, and are on heightened alert and ready to deal with cases as they emerge.

3) Most importantly, all of us must play our part and exercise social responsibility, to prevent or stem any possible spread of the virus in the community. Do continue to practise good personal hygiene – wash your hands regularly with soap and water, and avoid touching your face with your hands.

These measures, when taken together, will improve our resilience and ability to respond to this disease.

Our heartfelt thanks as well to our healthcare family, who have worked tireless over the last few weeks to keep Singapore safe.

1.01577E+16,"Chan Chun Sing added a new photo to the album Visit to Oasia Downtown Hotel.
2 February 2020 at 11:02 ·

Visited Oasia Downtown Hotel with Minister Josephine Teo this afternoon where we met with senior management and staff from the hotel. We were briefed on the additional measures that the hotel is taking in light of the novel coronavirus situation and how the company is supporting both guests and staff during this period.

It has not been an easy time for those in the tourism sector. Revenue is declining for businesses and workers have had to take on more responsibility and duties to ensure the health and safety of customers. But I was very happy to see during my visit that the staff at Oasia Downtown were still in good spirits and understood why the additional precautions are necessary.

During my visit, I also announced that the Singapore Tourism Board will be implementing targeted measures to support our tourism businesses during this period. We will waive license fees for hotels, travel agents and tourist guides and defray enhanced cleaning costs of hotels that provided accommodation to confirmed and suspected cases of nCoV infections.

The new measures announced today may not be very big but they are a signal to our tourism companies that we have heard their concerns and stand ready to support them.

During these challenging times, cash flow is a key concern for businesses. I encourage businesses who need more support to tap on Enterprise Singapore’s Enterprise Financing Scheme to address their financing needs. We will also look at further enhancing support in the form of temporary bridging loans.

For aviation-related companies who have been impacted due to a decrease in overseas travellers, we will provide assistance to defray business costs and help maintain air connectivity between Singapore and China. Taxi and private hire car drivers whose income may be affected due to the sudden decline in visitor arrivals will also be provided with more assistance.

The state of the global economy today is very different from 2003 when SARS happened. China in particular has much deeper linkages with other economies around the world. While it is still too early to tell the exact impact of the nCoV, I want to assure businesses that we will continue to walk this journey with them and provide them the necessary support. Our workers also remain our key priority and we want to ensure that we preserve as many jobs as we can during this challenging period.

Some of you may have received a text message with a list of places which have allegedly been exposed to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). There is no need to avoid any places. To safeguard public safety, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has been working closely with residents and owners of premises, to ensure that the cleaning and disinfection of areas are done in accordance with NEA guidelines. For places exposed to confirmed cases, our officers have been on the ground giving advice on and supervising the cleaning and disinfection works.

NEA has also issued environmental cleaning guidelines to non-healthcare commercial premises and residences, as well as advisories to hotel operators, food establishments, hawker centres, town councils, transport operators, condominiums and commercial buildings.

The risk of infection from transient contact, such as in public places, is low. There is also currently no evidence of community spread.

Let us avoid circulating messages if we are not able to verify their accuracy.

Taxi and private hire leaders told me that their income has been impacted by the slowdown of tourist arrival. They are concerned for their income and also their health. However, in the same breath, they told me how our National Taxi Association (NTA) and National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA) are stepping up to help affected drivers. It is really heartwarming to know that the industry has rallied together to assure drivers that help is available if they need it. For both taxi and private hire drivers who are under quarantine, taxi and private hire operators will be providing rental waiver and a one-time allowance of at least $100. NTA and NPHVA members can receive an additional one-time $200 assistance from the associations. This is on top of the $100 per day allowance given by the Government.

Workers at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa also shared their concerns with Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and I. We assured them that the Government, NTUC Singapore and our unions will do what is necessary to help our workers.

Even though we may face some difficult times ahead, we must also continue to press on with our upskilling and training efforts, stay calm and confident in knowing that when we work together, we can and will overcome the challenges that lie ahead.

Visited Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa this afternoon to meet with frontline workers, together with Ng Chee Meng 黄志明 and union leaders. The first and third imported cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus had stayed at the hotel. While it is less crowded, I was glad to see that the staff were in good spirits.

Safeguarding the well-being of our people remains our top priority. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has stepped up precautionary measures in the past week to reduce the risk of both community spread and the risk of more imported nCoV cases.

At the same time, the economic impact of the outbreak is understandably weighing on people’s minds. The Government will provide targeted support to sectors that have been directly impacted, such as the aviation sector, taxi and private hire car drivers, hotels and tour agents.

The situation is rapidly evolving. Depending on how the situation progresses, the impact on our economy could intensify. The Government is prepared to support our firms and workers in the event of a broad-based economic slowdown. We will continue to monitor this closely and implement decisive measures as needed.

Full details will be shared at #SGBudget 2020 on 18 February.

We can emerge stronger as long as we continue to work together.

[CNY@Sengkang Hospital]

I joined doctors, nurses and healthcare staff at the Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) and Sengkang Community Hospital (SKCH) for their Lunar New Year celebrations yesterday. It was also the 7th day of the Chinese New Year or Ren Ri (人日), which in Chinese customs marks the day of the birth of humankind, so we also celebrated everyone’s birthdays!

Since officially opening less than a year ago, SKH and SKCH have been working hard to serve the patients in this neighbourhood, and have grown to be an integral part of the community.

To our healthcare colleagues, we know that the demands on you are already challenging enough, in the best of times. With the Novel Coronavirus, so much more has now been asked of you, to look after our health, and to be at the front-line.

Getting through this together

Yesterday, 1500 SAF personnel were mobilised to pack 5.2 million surgical masks for distribution to households. The first batches are rolling out to the constituencies. They will continue to do this round the clock for the next few days until the task is completed.

Even as they packed, grassroots leaders and volunteers responded to the call to the community for help with the mask distribution at the RC and neighbourhood centres which which starts today and will continue over several days.

In the hospitals our medical healthcare workers are at the frontline, working hard to take care of those who are unwell and having to be extra careful as they are more exposed than others to the risk of infections.

At our airports, ports and land checkpoints, our immigration personnel are working overtime on temperature checks and spotting anyone who may have symptoms of the Wuhan virus.

In pre-schools and schools teachers have to be vigilant and look out for our students children.

Behind the scenes, the civil service has been putting into operation contingency plans, adjusting and responding at short notice as and when new scenarios arise.

Yesterday, the Scoot crew - volunteers all - flew to Wuhan and brought our Singaporeans home. There were some Singaporeans who could not come back as they had symptoms, but they are certainly not forgotten. Our embassy in China is in touch with them to ensure their welfare, and we hope the conditions will be clear for them to come back as soon as possible.

Different sectors, different people. But all working tirelessly to get us through this situation. This is what it means to work together and to pull together.

A big thank you to all these heroes and the many others who are quietly going about their jobs or volunteering their time and effort so that we can beat this virus.

In this situation we all have a part to play and every action counts.
- be vigilant
- follow the advisories on usage of masks
- wash your hands with soap and water regularly
- be patient and understanding too.
- go to trusted sources for information.

We will get through this together.

<New travel restrictions>

The virus outbreak in China is spreading beyond Hubei province. The number of reported infection cases has doubled to over 9,000. Significantly, the virus has spread to every region of mainland China. The likelihood of widespread community transmission in other parts of China is now high. We are likely to see a sharper rise in the local transmission of the virus in other Chinese cities in the coming days.

We have therefore decided to expand our travel restrictions to all new travelers arriving from mainland China. In particular all new visitors (regardless of nationality) with travel history in China in the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter into Singapore or to transit through Singapore.

Returning Singaporeans, PRs and long-term pass holders who have travelled in China will be allowed to enter Singapore, but they will be put on a 14-day leave of absence. They will be issued a health advisory to stay at home and avoid social contact.

We are not letting up on our efforts to fight the virus. Across the Government, public officials are working hard to respond to this challenging situation - be it our healthcare workers at the frontline, our medical teams at the airport, ICA officers at checkpoints, SAF personnel and PA staff at the mask packing/distribution centres; or our officials at the quarantine facilities. Businesses are also doing their part to take precautions, and individuals are practicing good personal hygiene habits.

This is the Singapore spirit which will see us through all challenges.

It has been a stressful week not just for the general public, but in particular for healthcare and medical professionals.

We have watched the new coronavirus outbreak in China closely, from the moment the first news came out. Actually we have been preparing for such a situation ever since SARS in 2003. We knew that one day something like that would happen again. So, in a way, this outbreak was a shock, but not a surprise.

9 of the 13 confirmed cases in Singapore are currently being treated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), next to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. I visited NCID this morning to see for myself the screening and containment process for affected patients, and to meet and thank some of the people working day and night to treat them. I was very happy with what I saw.

I urge everyone to show understanding and support to our healthcare and medical teams, public officers, the SAF and The People's Association, who will be distributing masks to Singaporeans over the weekend. We owe them our gratitude for their hard work and dedication.

I have every confidence that if we stay vigilant and united, we can overcome this challenge. – LHL",31/1/2020 18:15,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83720840_3015596395169713_3583410464819773440_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=XaPaas2FXGgAX93AiW0&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b09dbdd109b698007ad9dd20dfdff763&oe=60572E57,,,,52,1,4,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157731860810631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83720840_3015596395169713_3583410464819773440_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=XaPaas2FXGgAX93AiW0&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=b09dbdd109b698007ad9dd20dfdff763&oe=60572E57', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83653880_3015596405169712_3493796985801015296_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Go0vKgkP3_8AX_ReI-x&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=0a5adb529e40c697edfbf9277640784e&oe=6055D6BC']",10157731860810600

Many of you may be wondering: what steps can you take to thoroughly clean and disinfect your home if one of your family members is suspected to have been exposed to the Wuhan coronavirus?

National Environment Agency (NEA) has worked with Ministry of Health, Singapore and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases to provide residents and premise owners with a set of guidelines which will help you. There are guidelines for non-healthcare commercial premises and residences, and they are easy to follow. Do take note to use the proper personal protective equipment and appropriate disinfectants when cleaning your premises.

Some residents have also expressed concerns over the safety of food imported from China. Rest assured that Singapore does not import livestock or raw meat from China. And currently, there is no evidence that the Wuhan coronavirus is associated with food consumption.

We all have a part to play in maintaining good personal and environmental hygiene to safeguard against community transmission.

Singapore households to get 4 face masks each amid worries over Wuhan virus

Yesterday, we activated the SAF, The People's Association and other agencies to start preparing masks in special packs for Singaporeans. We want to ensure that every Singaporean who is unwell and needs a mask will have one.

I understand your concerns and frustrations about not being able to get masks at retail stores, given the recent rush all over Singapore to buy them. 5 million masks have been released to retailers in the past 9 days but demand has been higher than anticipated.

The Ministry of Health, Singapore has advised that we only need to wear a mask if we are sick. There is no need to wear a mask if we are well.

There will be a one-time mask distribution at Residents’ Committees and Community Centres. Residents will need to bring their NRICs to verify their addresses in order to collect one pack of four surgical masks per household. PA volunteers will help distribute masks to residents who are not able to go to the RCs and CCs themselves. We will post more details of the arrangements on RC notice boards and government social media channels.

Do heed the MOH advisories on when you should use a mask and how to properly handle one.

The number of confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV infection have increased globally. The number of confirmed imported cases stands at 13. We need to stay vigilant to prevent further importation and the spread of the infection in Singapore.

Strengthening our borders is one important strategy. Thermal scanners and health screening stations have been set up at our airport, land and sea checkpoints. Immigration clearance may expect a slight delay as our healthcare team is exercising extreme caution. I visited the Marina Bay Cruise Centre this morning with SMS Dr Janil Puthucheary and thanked the frontline officers and the healthcare team for their hard work. We need to work together in this challenging time to #FightAgainst2019nCoV.

Govt to distribute masks to all 1.37 million Singaporean households amid Wuhan virus outbreak

Heng Swee Keat
30 January 2020 at 07:45 ·

Masks have been on the minds of many Singaporeans in recent days.

Social responsibility is critical to contain the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. However, you do not need to wear a mask if you are well. You should only wear a mask if you are unwell, go see a doctor, and stay away from crowded places. In case you have a family member who is sick, it is useful for each household to have some masks on hand.

We have a sufficient national stockpile of masks in Singapore, as long as the masks are used responsibly. We had earlier released more than 5 million masks from the national stockpile to retailers. However, these were bought up very quickly. And many Singaporeans could not get masks for their households.

To address the situation, we will be distributing masks from the national stockpile to 1.37 million households in Singapore. Each household will have a packet of four masks.

Ministry of Defence, Singapore (MINDEF) and The People's Association will be setting up collection centres at Residents’ Committees and Community Centres in the coming days for residents to pick up their mask pack. We will deliver the masks to the vulnerable who are unable to collect them.

I urge everyone to remain vigilant and stay calm. While we go about our daily activities as usual, do pay extra attention to personal hygiene — wash your hands with soap regularly and avoid using your hands to touch your face.

Let’s stay united. Together, we can overcome this challenge.",30/1/2020 16:35,,,,,42,12,7,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157727628670631,[],10157727628670600

WELCOME HOME!

SCOOT TR121 from Wuhan which touched down this morning at Changi is special. It carried the 92 Singaporeans who were stuck in Wuhan when PRC decided to lock down the city. You can imagine their anxiety and fear! Their ordeal is over, though we have to put them under quarantine for 14 days.

TR121 was made possible through the dedication and sacrifice of many agencies and colleagues. We thank the MFA officers who gallantly escorted the Singaporeans back! We thank the CAAS, CAG, ICA and MOH colleagues who worked through the days and nights! We thank the SCOOT pilots and crew members who made this flight possible! On behalf of the MOT family, thank you to all of you!

As always, we stand together to help our fellow Singaporeans. This was what we did 17 years ago, when Singaporeans came together to battle SARS. With the experience from SARS, we started our thermal scanning much earlier this time at all our air, sea and land checkpoints.

We will conquer this Wuhan Virus, like how we did as a nation 17 years ago.

<Masks for all Households; Use Responsibly>

We have sufficient masks in the national stockpile if everyone uses them responsibly. Responsible usage means following medical advice - only those who are sick need to wear masks; for those who are well, there is no need to wear masks.

Over the last 9 days, we released more than 5 million masks from the national stockpile to retailers. They were snapped up in hours. Yet many Singaporeans are still unable to get a mask. The current situation is clearly not sustainable.

This is why the Taskforce has decided to change our distribution method, as my colleague Chan Chun Sing and I announced this morning. First, we will prioritise the national stockpile of masks for essential services, namely our healthcare workers at the frontline. Second, for the general public we will release masks from the national stockpile directly to Singaporeans. In particular we will provide a packet of 4 masks each for every local household.

We are doing this to assure all Singaporeans that if any member of the family falls sick and needs a mask, they will have one at hand. But remember to use the masks responsibly. Do not wear the masks immediately. Keep this as a precaution and use the masks only if someone in the family falls sick and needs to go out to see the doctor.

I know many Singaporeans are concerned about the virus and want to protect themselves and their families. The best thing to do is to uphold good personal hygiene. Wash your hands regularly with soap; do not use your hands to touch your face; if you are sick, see a doctor and stay at home until you recover.

With individual and collective responsibility, we can maintain a strong defence against the virus, and overcome this together.",30/1/2020 14:38,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=a4WD16vhkwcAX-IYqi9&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=2d277b6539b51edee8cf5c914951002a&oe=605537B6,,,,80,10,26,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157727384930631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=a4WD16vhkwcAX-IYqi9&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=2d277b6539b51edee8cf5c914951002a&oe=605537B6'],10157727384930600

During a media conference with Minister Lawrence Wong this afternoon, we announced that the Government will issue four surgical masks to each household from this weekend.

The masks are for residents to use when they are unwell and going to seek medical help. Upon medical assistance, healthcare professionals will be able to assess the subsequent need for more surgical masks.

During times of uncertainty, it is natural that some will take to hoarding in-demand supplies such as masks. We understand this. But such behaviour is not helpful to our collective defence and we seek Singaporeans’ understanding that the priority for our mask stockpile will have to go to our frontline healthcare workers and the most vulnerable in our society.

We are actively working on identifying new suppliers for in-demand items and will also ensure that existing lines are kept robust. However, in these uncertain times, we must be mindful that there is keen competition from others to secure their supplies as well. Many global suppliers are prioritising China because it is the epicenter of the outbreak. Places such as Taiwan have also banned the export of surgical masks and we expect more to follow suit.

We are also aware of concerns about profiteering. Today, the Price Controller will issue warning letters to retailers such as Deen Express suspected of profiteering. We have also sent notification letters to e-commerce platforms to cooperate with MTI and provide us with requested information on errant sellers on their platforms.

These are challenging times and people are fearful. We understand and want to do all we can to reassure Singaporeans. By providing each household with their own set of masks, we hope to address concerns about the purchase of masks and allow our supplies to return to normalcy. I thank Singaporeans for their understanding and patience during this period and we will continue to work hard to contain the spread of the Wuhan Coronavirus.

I went to send off our flight crew that volunteered to bring Singaporeans back from Wuhan. It warmed my heart to know that when Scoot management asked for volunteers to staff a flight to Wuhan Tianhe International Airport, there were more volunteers than was needed. I was so pleased to meet Captain Ian and Captain Derek, and their crew before they departed for a round trip from Singapore to Wuhan. They shared with me that all the necessary precautions had been made and permissions granted for the flight to proceed.

Half in jest and half serious, I told Captain Ian how I would like to fly with them. His immediate response was, “Min, that would be too stressful for me.” 😀😀😀

I couldn’t be more proud of our Scoot Staff Union leaders and members for stepping forward to serve our fellow Singaporeans without hesitation. Thank you to all parties who worked hard in helping to bring home Singaporeans who had been unable to come home due to travel bans.

In view of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation, some consumers have expressed concerns regarding the safety of food imported from China.

There is currently no evidence that the novel coronavirus (nCoV) is associated with the consumption of food. Singapore does not import livestock and raw meat from China.

Fake news - Woodlands MRT closed for disinfection yesterday due to a suspected Wuhan coronavirus infection. Truth: Woodlands MRT was fully operational on 28 Jan 2020!

I have received messages about avoiding certain places where a person suspected with Wuhan virus has been to. Do we need to avoid such places? No.

Prolonged exposure to the infected person is required to catch the virus. That typically means at 30 minutes within 2 metres of that person.

I am concerned as you are. The Government is taking all necessary steps - border controls, temperature checks, quarantine, ensuring adequate supply of masks, etc.

We can do our part. Practice good personal hygiene like washing hands regularly.

It’s tough as it is. Let’s not make it worse with rumours, fake news, speculations. Take care what you share.

Schools reopened today after the Chinese New Year break. I decided to visit a couple of primary schools and was only allowed in after having my temperature taken. Good to know no one is exempted!

It was pretty much business as usual. Many students were happy to go back to school. They went about their lessons, played at recess, went for learning journeys. I popped into a P1 and P5 class at Bendemeer Primary, as well as chatted with students in an after school programme at Zhangde Primary.

I practised my teaching pedagogy and got the students to discuss how viruses transmit via droplets through sneezes and coughs, and let them derive at how best to protect themselves against transmission.

The verdict was the same across the classes: (a)wash our hands regularly with soap, (b) keep our hands away from our faces, and (c) wear a mask if we are sick so that our droplets don’t infect others.

I also spoke to teachers, including the team at Zhangde Primary working to help students from vulnerable backgrounds. They shared with me their challenges, and the specific cases which made progress on. They know the name of every child. They know they are making a difference to each of the kids under their charge.

I also met student volunteers from Singapore Polytechnic who mentor the students. I see the sparkle and enthusiasm in their eyes.

Life has to go on and we must continue to make our difference to society. The students, teachers and staff I met today were calm and resolute.

[ElderFund to launch on 31 Jan]

Happy to share that applications for ElderFund will start from 31 Jan 2020. This is a new disability assistance scheme we announced last year.

ElderFund is an additional safety net to help lower-income and severely disabled Singaporeans with their basic long-term care needs. It will supplement existing Government, community and family support in providing for the needs of disabled Singaporeans.

Severely disabled Singapore Citizens aged 30 and above who are unable to benefit from ElderShield and Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly (IDAPE), or the future CareShield Life, and have low income and low MediSave balances, can apply for ElderFund.

Successful applicants can get up to $250 cash payout every month.

We estimate that in the next 10 years, on average, about 9,000 Singaporeans per year can potentially benefit from ElderFund. We hope that ElderFund can go some way to provide peace of mind to Singaporeans who need an extra helping hand.

For more information on how to apply for ElderFund, including how to be assessed for severe disability, please contact the Agency for Integrated Care - AIC Singapore at 1800-650-6060 or visit www.aic.sg/ElderFund.",29/1/2020 15:44,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83788972_2686108744808554_4060194260362723328_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=WCOTpVAD9YcAX8XA97G&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=3bcbf9d5c8699a0c91ab7a7bdd58ca80&oe=6055DA5F,,,,22,0,4,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157720668275631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83788972_2686108744808554_4060194260362723328_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=WCOTpVAD9YcAX8XA97G&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=3bcbf9d5c8699a0c91ab7a7bdd58ca80&oe=6055DA5F', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83997669_2686110354808393_8382972732324708352_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=sQDbl0lT5w8AX849RIs&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=1d3c035e43aa56e439bb1440fbf8159c&oe=6056BC8F', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83810733_2686110384808390_9072917511409762304_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=SZFxzmn7OU4AX95Vjqd&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=041773e92be006005d59492fb67eb80c&oe=6056D44A', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83454466_2686110491475046_1572368517540347904_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=wg9EWZf8ye4AX9h9HAX&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=698d2a97e409dcaf4767268719af9688&oe=6055E0E8']",10157720668275600

<Wuhan coronavirus - additional measures>

I mentioned yesterday that the situation is evolving rapidly, and the key is for us to be able to swiftly adjust and recalibrate our actions.

Over the last 24 hours, we have seen an accelerating trend of infection among the population of Chinese nationals from Hubei. Within Singapore, we’ve had a near doubling of imported cases overnight. All the confirmed cases are Chinese nationals from Hubei. Within China, the numbers are rising sharply too. The vast majority of cases in Chinese cities can also be traced back to Hubei.

Given the heightened risks from Hubei travellers, we have decided to take additional measures on top of those announced yesterday to limit these risks:

First, there are recent travellers from Hubei who are now in Singapore. There are 2000 of them here, including Singaporeans/PRs and tourists. We are getting in touch with all of them, and will quarantine those with higher risks (particularly the ones who arrived more recently and are still within the incubation period).

Second, there is a group of returning residents (Singaporeans/PRs) and long-term pass holders, i.e they are in China now and will likely return over the coming days after the CNY holidays. We will also quarantine those amongst them with recent travel history in Hubei or with PRC passports issued in Hubei.

Third, for new PRC visitors, the numbers are already coming down, but we will take extra precautions. For those with recent travel history to Hubei or PRC passports issued in Hubei, we will not allow them entry into Singapore or transit through Singapore. ICA will suspend issuance of new visas to those with PRC passports issued in Hubei; all previously issued visas will also be suspended.

We have a comprehensive plan with contingencies for different scenarios. These measures are part of our plans. Given the accelerating trends and risk levels, we’ve decided to activate them now.

We have to be mindful that the situation is fluid, with new information coming out from China every day, and with our risk assessments being updated constantly. There are signs now that the virus is more transmissible than SARS although less fatal. But we can’t tell how things will unfold. We have to be prepared that this Wuhan virus may well be different from SARS, including the possibility of infection before any symptoms arise. We cannot rule out the possibility of wider infection and community spread.

So we will monitor closely and adjust our posture day by day. We are now taking stricter measures against Hubei travelers. If there is evidence of community spread in other Chinese cities or provinces, we will update our measures accordingly.

There is so far no evidence of community spread in Singapore. So our actions are aimed at containment - to reduce the risk of such community spread. Meanwhile let’s all stay calm and keep our guard up.

I have received many messages from you expressing concerns about the Wuhan coronavirus. I fully understand your feelings. We are all worried for ourselves and our loved ones, here and overseas.

The situation is developing rapidly. We have activated our contingency plans, and all our agencies are working together. Our hospitals and healthcare workers are well prepared. We have been preparing for something like this ever since SARS in 2003.

Meanwhile, scientists and medical professionals across the world are working around the clock to understand the virus and develop a vaccine. Experts think the Wuhan virus may be less lethal than SARS, but more infectious. Patients who are infected may possibly be contagious before symptoms show. If true, this will make it harder to screen and detect new cases, and to stop the spread.

So far, all seven confirmed cases in Singapore are Chinese nationals from Hubei. We have not had local transmission or community spread yet, but that can happen, and we must be prepared for it. Meanwhile, we have suspended entry into or transit through Singapore for people who have recently travelled to Hubei, and those with PRC passports issued in Hubei. We will quarantine Singapore residents and those holding long term passes who are returning here, who have recently visited Hubei.

We will continue to monitor the situation closely and do more if necessary. Meanwhile, we should all remain calm. All of us can do our part to limit transmission of germs by practising good hygiene. Wash your hands regularly, and seek medical advice early and wear a mask if you feel unwell. But in general, there is no need to wear a mask if you are not ill.

Also please do not listen to or spread rumours and untrue reports — alas there is a lot of that circulating around, on WhatsApp and social media. Sharing news responsibly is an important way we can protect ourselves.

Earlier today, I joined Seah Kian Peng to visit one of our warehouses to check on our masks stockpile.

We would like to reassure Singaporeans that there is sufficient supply of masks in Singapore, if we use them sensibly and responsibly. There is no need to rush to buy masks. We are working with retailers like NTUC FairPrice and Unity Pharmacy to push out the stocks.

You may have noticed that some retailers have started to ration the sale of masks (in packages with smaller quantity). This is to ensure that there is adequate supply for Singaporeans and to prevent unnecessary hoarding. We are also working with retailers to manage pricing and we remind them not to profiteer from the increased demand.

As there is currently no local transmission of the 2019-nCoV infection, masks are generally not needed in our normal daily activities. However, do put on a face mask if you have respiratory symptoms like a cough or runny nose to prevent the spread of the flu or the common cold viruses. Above all, practise good personal hygiene by washing your hands frequently. If you are feeling unwell, please seek medical attention promptly.

We urge Singaporeans to stay calm and vigilant to #FightAgainst2019nCoV.

Wuhan virus: Increased border checks, leave of absence among new counter-measures

Lam Pin Min（蓝彬明）
27 January 2020 at 04:53 ·

The Ministerial Task Force on the Novel Coronavirus Infection (MTF-NCI) announced additional measures to protect Singaporeans against the 2019-nCoV. These include the following:

1) Temperature Screening at airports will cover all incoming flights with additional scrutiny of passengers from mainland China, especially those holding passports from Hubei province.

2) Singaporeans are advised to avoid non-essential travel to mainland China. This is on top of the previous travel advisory to avoid all travel to Hubei province.

3) Returning workers and students from mainland China will have to give health and travel declarations to their respective organisations and do self monitoring of symptoms and temperature twice a day for 14 days upon their return.

- for those who may have close contacts with vulnerable populations, such as those in preschools, schools, healthcare sector and ElderCare sectors, will be given compulsory 14 days leave of absence (LOA) so they can stay at home and minimise close contact with others.

Other organisations are recommended to follow these measures as well. Employers may adopt additional precautionary measures if they choose to do so, depending on their operational requirements.

As the situation is evolving very rapidly, the MTF will monitor developments very closely. The government will implement additional measures, if necessary.

🍊🍊🍊 Happy Chinese New Year to all Singaporeans 🍊🍊🍊

Yesterday morning, I visited our healthcare colleagues at the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and JurongHealth Campus to thank them for their hard work and dedication.

Glad to have had our colleagues from the hospitals’ Inpatient Operations, Food Services, as well as Environmental Services teams join us for a lo hei session. We may not see them very often, but they are also very important in ensuring our patients receive the care they need.

Two of them were Chef Richard Woo and Chef Elton Hoo, who prepared the lo hei for us (that had smoked salmon fish shaped in a koi and ingot). A yearly affair, the hospital’s kitchen and dieticians worked together on a special dinner menu on the eve of Chinese New Year, to bring some festive cheer to patients. The festive meal sets included dishes like fresh crabmeat with silken tofu bisque, stewed treasure duck or chicken with sea cucumber, braised long cabbage with crispy dried scallop, and chilled lemongrass jelly with wolfberries.

I also met 83 year-old Mr Chua Kim Hong, who was in good spirits and waiting for his son to pick him up to go home to celebrate Chinese New Year.

With the coronavirus situation escalating globally, we know that this is a challenging time for the healthcare family. We really appreciate your dedication and commitment during this period. Please take care and persevere on – we are fully behind you. 💪🏻

A big thank you to the healthcare staff at National University Hospital - NUH for working tirelessly round the clock to provide quality care to our patients on the first day of the Lunar New Year. I paid a visit to NUH today to bring some encouragement and support to our colleagues, and I am grateful for their dedication and commitment during this trying period.

With families and friends all over Singapore celebrating the Year of the Rat, we had our very own cosy lo-hei session right in the heart of NUH.

Our healthcare workers are at the frontline of care, and are prepared to handle the novel coronavirus situation. I am also heartened when they share that they are confident in this #FightAgainst2019nCoV. I hope Singaporeans will join me in rallying support for them, and to thank them for their dedication to their patients.

Wishing everyone a healthy and happy Lunar New Year!

1.01577E+16,"We have on 23 January 2020 confirmed one imported case of novel coronavirus infection in Singapore. The case is a 66 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family on 20 January 2020. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and his condition is stable. He was immediately isolated upon presenting to SGH with clinical symptoms.

We have initiated contact tracing and nine close contacts of the case, who are his travelling companions, have so far been identified. One of his travelling companions has also been warded as a suspect case. He is a 37 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan. His condition is stable.

The multi-ministry taskforce set up to direct a whole-of-government response to the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak has decided to step up Singapore’s overall preventive posture, given the expected inflow of visitors during the festive season and in view of the confirmed case. This would include expanding our border controls, to include land and sea checkpoints.

Singapore will also expand our travel advisory to recommend that Singaporeans avoid travel to the whole of Hubei Province, in view of the travel restrictions that China has imposed on Huanggang and Ezhou. We advise Singaporeans to continue to exercise caution and attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China.

Given the high volume of international travel to Singapore, we expect to see more suspect cases and imported cases. We urge the public to remain calm and vigilant, and to adopt good personal hygiene practices.

The Singapore General Hospital campus has come a long way from its early days at Sepoy Lines. Affectionately known to many as “See Pai Poh”, the SGH Campus today is home to specialist centres like Duke-NUS Medical School, Academia and Outram Community Hospital, in addition to the main SGH.

Today, I attended the ground-breaking ceremony of the new SGH Elective Care Centre and National Dental Centre Singapore - NDCS which will form the first component of the new SGH Campus. This new building, sited right next to the exit of the North-East MRT line, will bring us one step closer to achieving increased connectivity.

Over the years, SGH has continued to innovate to bring better care and value to patients. For example, SGH has developed a new care protocol for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, which enabled 80% of patients enrolled in the 2019 pilot to go home on the same day, or within 23 hours of their surgery, instead of staying in the hospital for an average of four days in 2016. The new NDCS will also leverage new technology to improve care delivery, such as 3D printing, which will allow for more accurate treatment planning and shorter treatment time.

As Singaporeans’ healthcare needs evolve, I hope that our public healthcare institutions will continue to innovate and provide the best health outcome and quality care to their patients.",22/1/2020 15:40,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/82989376_3114486305228456_496793936505864192_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=49QoCrdBbvEAX9len-4&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=a97eb8acb7018af75c2adbb31fca2fcd&oe=6055E577,,,,19,0,0,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157697812155631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/82989376_3114486305228456_496793936505864192_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=49QoCrdBbvEAX9len-4&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=a97eb8acb7018af75c2adbb31fca2fcd&oe=6055E577', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83513119_3114486318561788_911653366021488640_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=JUEAxmchmCcAX8h9oCe&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=6f3a2b0f6f3aa1494d52611e625aba20&oe=60565AA6', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/82580971_3114486285228458_1290890225114939392_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=QL55lT_7KW4AX9NtZxU&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=61455122f6fdfd717dbaba69719dd44b&oe=6054FDFC', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/82935516_3114486561895097_8028129453521502208_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=ALQWKIT_wmMAX-BUnEN&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=c82f6bdabdfdbf65846c6609eb9deb07&oe=6056C0DD']",10157697812155600

The Ministry of Health, Singapore is putting in place additional precautionary measures to reduce the risk of importation of the novel coronavirus pneumonia to Singapore. This follows confirmation of human-to-human transmission, as well as increase in the number of cases and widened distribution of the virus in China.

From 22 January 2020, we will widen the definition of suspect cases to include persons with the following:

(i) Pneumonia and travel history to China within 14 days before onset of symptoms; or

(ii) Acute respiratory infection who had been to any hospital in China, within 14 days before onset of symptoms.

These cases will be isolated in hospital as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission.

Temperature screening at Changi Airport will also be expanded to cover all inbound travellers on flights arriving from China from tomorrow. Suspect cases meeting the expanded definition will be referred to hospitals for further assessment.

Do stay vigilant and adopt good personal hygiene practices. We remind travellers to monitor your health closely and seek medical attention promptly if you feel unwell, and inform your doctor of your travel history.

Providers and practitioners who have been suspended or terminated from the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), MediSave and/or MediShield schemes will also be listed.

🚑🚑🚑 #didyouknow all private ambulances will be licensed under the new Healthcare Services Act in the second half of 2021? This will enhance patient care and ensure patient safety and welfare.

To help private ambulance operators prepare for these changes and start their transition into the licensing framework, MOH introduced the Voluntary Accreditation Scheme for private ambulance operators in 2018 to help them raise their capabilities and competencies, such as through the training of personnel. Today, 30 operators are already on this scheme, and more than 50 percent of the total number of private ambulances in Singapore are accredited. You can find the full list of accredited private ambulance operators at www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/accredited-private-ambulance-operators.

MOH will also bring about greater price transparency for consumers. We will work with the accredited operators to publish the range of common fees charged, so that consumers are able to make informed decisions on their choice of private ambulance operators.

“Eat more, rest more, don’t work so hard” - We often hear such well-meaning advice offered to pregnant women, but is it sound? Evidence suggests that physical activity and exercise in pregnancy may help limit gestational weight gain, as well as reduce the risk of Gestational Diabetes (GDM) in the expectant mother. It is critical that we tackle GDM, as it could lead to risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life for both mother and child.

I’m glad to see that a committee of healthcare professionals and clinicians have come together to develop the Guidelines on Physical Activity and Exercise in Pregnancy. Launched at the Asia Pacific Diabetes in Pregnancy Conference & IPRAMHO International Meeting at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, the guidelines will help healthcare professionals provide guidance to pregnant women on pre- and post-natal physical activity to achieve better pregnancy outcomes. This is indeed a positive step in raising awareness of appropriate exercise and weight management before, during and after pregnancy.

For expectant mothers, try this advice instead: “Eat healthy and engage in moderate-intensity physical activity regularly”. If you are unsure, do consult your doctor on the appropriate exercises that you can do.",12/1/2020 15:28,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/82736679_3092834140727006_3037837416502132736_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=BiCG7ODtg2gAX_XSmrJ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=81e74bdcacf7326a7c05f83cb41052f8&oe=60558FFB,,,,25,0,3,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10157667965370631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/82736679_3092834140727006_3037837416502132736_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=BiCG7ODtg2gAX_XSmrJ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=81e74bdcacf7326a7c05f83cb41052f8&oe=60558FFB', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/82237002_3092834090727011_8269179807200182272_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=bWh_I7rRfa8AX9ingtQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=6e9395b4d6f82f514731d9fb84e5437c&oe=6054DF96', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/81958161_3092834124060341_4860392335994781696_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=B2R4U_RM5EIAX-KqM5P&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=d0e7fa240250063d5bec6ebd5b04ef6b&oe=6056F70E', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/82804468_3092834194060334_4552316960372686848_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=X240VaIv3XcAX9d-fLV&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=daae5fe5e22fc00e8b4084a62ab55e0c&oe=60579134']",10157667965370600

I was at Republic Polytechnic open house this afternoon where we launched the RP - ST Logistics Healthcare Supply Chain Laboratory. I also had the pleasure of meeting many young inquisitive minds including those behind the innovative projects featured in the joint lab.

The healthcare supply chain is a vast process with a complex network of products and players. Like all complex networks, it is vulnerable to risks of rising cost and disrupted services. But it also presents opportunities for greater cost effectiveness while ensuring safe care delivery to patients. With emerging technologies, such as RFID tracking and robotic process automation, the possibilities are endless.
I am glad that industry players and institutes of higher learning, such as RP and ST Logistics, are collaborating and creating a learning space for students to gain hands-on learning experience in the application of supply chain technologies. We must continue to develop talents and equip students with the relevant skills so that they are empowered to seize opportunities when they arise.

The Healthcare Services (HCS) Bill was debated and passed in Parliament today to ensure that patient safety and well-being are safeguarded while our regulatory framework remains relevant to current and emerging models of care.

In recent years, there have been significant changes to the healthcare landscape in Singapore. While almost all healthcare services were previously provided from physical ‘brick-and-mortar’ locations, there are now new healthcare models and services, including home and community-based care and telemedicine services. These have emerged in response to technological advances, changing care needs of our population as well as changes in patient expectations. The new HCS Bill, which is a services-based licensing regime that replaces the old premises-based framework, will ensure the safe delivery of such new services in this evolving healthcare landscape.

The new framework will also provide the flexibility to accommodate new, patient-centric healthcare models and facilitates the development of new and innovative healthcare services that can benefit many more patients.

The HCS Bill will be implemented in phases from early 2021 to end 2022 and MOH will work closely with healthcare providers to ensure a smooth transition.

• Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats;

• Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;

• Observe good personal hygiene;

• Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);

1.01589E+16,"COVID-19 vaccination for seniors will commence island-wide from next Monday, 22 February.

Over the next three weeks, seniors aged 70 years and above can expect to receive personalised letters inviting them to sign up for vaccination. We will start by inviting seniors living near polyclinics or vaccination centres, so that they can be conveniently vaccinated at a vaccination site near their home. All seniors will be able to receive their vaccination by mid-March when we have opened a vaccination centre in each town. We expect all the letters to reach our seniors aged 70 years and above by the first week of March.

Thereafter we will move to vaccinate the seniors aged 60 to 69 years. They will receive their invitation letters around the middle of March, and the vaccination will commence from around end-March onwards.

Upon receiving the invitation letter, seniors can register online for their vaccination at vaccine.gov.sg, and then receive an SMS with a unique link to book their vaccination appointments. Those who require assistance booking their vaccination appointments can bring their invitation letter to any community centre/club from today.

We will also be setting up more vaccination centres. By the middle of March, 31 vaccination centres will be in operation, with at least one vaccination centre in each town. In total, there will eventually be around 40 vaccination centres. These centres, together with the polyclinics and selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), will ensure that every Singaporean and long-term resident in Singapore who is medically eligible can receive their vaccinations conveniently.

Vaccination is critical to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19. This collective protection will become more effective as more people are vaccinated and is a key enabler allowing us to return to normalcy. We strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated when your turn comes, so that as a society, we can keep each other safe from the disease.

In the next few days, seniors above 70 years old will progressively receive notification to book appointments for their Covid-19 vaccination. Since late January, selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) across the island have been providing COVID-19 vaccination to healthcare workers.

The PHPCs have been playing an integral role in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, from providing subsidised consultation and treatment for acute respiratory infections to conducting COVID-19 swab tests to help us quickly detect cases.

As we ramp up our vaccination efforts, some of these will now play a new role as vaccination sites. These selected PHPCs, along with our 20 polyclinics and vaccination centres, ensure that everyone has convenient and easy access to COVID-19 vaccination.

Vaccination is crucial in protecting ourselves and our loved ones against COVID-19, as well as others who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. When your turn comes, I strongly encourage you to get vaccinated if you are medically eligible! This collective protection will become more effective as more of us are vaccinated and will enable us to return to normalcy.

Good news! We received our first shipment of Moderna vaccines this afternoon. This follows another batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that arrived this morning. These shipments will enable us to progressively roll out our vaccination programme, with vaccination for seniors in the community set to begin later next week.

More vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech will arrive over the coming months. We will continue to monitor our supplies closely, to meet our target of vaccinating all Singaporeans and long-term residents by the end of this year.

If you feel unwell during the festivities, we encourage you to visit your GP or a 24-hour clinic for minor, self-limiting conditions. Seek medical treatment at a hospital’s Accident & Emergency (A&E) department only for serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness, and uncontrollable bleeding.

If you have symptoms of an acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose) as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, you are strongly encouraged to visit a PHPC and get swabbed early when advised by your doctor. It is important to test for COVID-19 early for early detection, management and containment to prevent further spread of the disease, to help protect your loved ones and vulnerable members of the community.

1.01589E+16,"The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the global COVID-19 situation and will tighten border measures for travellers from Vietnam, given the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam. At the same time, with the improvement in the COVID-19 situation in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, we will adjust our border measures for travellers from NSW, Australia. In addition, to minimise the risk of potential incubating cases leaking into the community for travellers, we will tighten border measures for the Business Travel Pass (BTP) scheme.

From 12 February 2021, 2359 hours, Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs) and Long-Term Pass holders entering Singapore with travel history to Vietnam within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore, will be subject to an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, and a PCR test before the end of the SHN period. Short-term travellers holding an Air Travel Pass (ATP) with travel history to Vietnam within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore, will not be allowed to enter Singapore. All travellers who are not SCs or PRs will need to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure. These travellers will still be required to undergo an On-Arrival Test (OAT) and serve their SHN upon arrival and be tested at the end of SHN.

From 10 February 2021, 2359 hours, SCs, PRs and Long-Term Pass holders returning from NSW, Australia will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at the airport in lieu of a 7-day SHN, and if the result is negative, they will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore. Short-term visitors travelling from NSW, Australia can also apply for an ATP for entry into Singapore on or after 16 February 2021.

Travellers on the BTP scheme are now required to undergo COVID-19 PCR Tests on Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14 of their return. An additional serology test will also be required on Day 3.

As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community.

I visited the COVID-19 vaccination centre at the former Hong Kah Secondary School yesterday and saw that the operations are proceeding well. A team of doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants from Parkway Shenton, which runs the vaccination centre, have been working closely to ensure a smooth process. Beyond the day-to-day operation, the team is also constantly looking at how to improve the experience for those coming in for their vaccinations, from planning for contingencies to minimising wait times and exploring how to ensure the centre is accessible for the elderly.

Our vaccination centres, alongside our polyclinics and selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics, will allow us to scale up our vaccination efforts as we progressively vaccinate our entire population. Each vaccination centre is able to perform 2,000 vaccinations per day on average. We will be setting up around 40 vaccination centres to ensure that everyone can be conveniently vaccinated. They will be located in high population catchment areas as well as along public transport routes for greater accessibility.

Getting vaccinated is critical to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19.

I was happy to be part of a panel discussion at the Singapore Perspectives 2021 Conference where the central topic of discussion was on the vision of politics we have for Singapore in 2030.

The politics of our country is determined by our people and the values we hold. In the years ahead, the partnership between citizens and the Government will play an even larger role to achieve our shared ideals and aspirations. We will need to continue having open discussions on various issues to recognise the diversity of opinions and be productive in seeking common ground and solutions.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a test of our values. We came together as a country to fight the pandemic on various fronts - our healthcare and social workers have been stepping up to help those in need, we recognise the sacrifices of our front-liners as we rightfully should, we are looking into ways to help those whose livelihoods are affected by the pandemic and, at the same time, we are looking at the opportunities brought about by the pandemic. The unity, resolve and adaptability of our people give me hope for Singapore.

Years from now, I hope that we are able to look back at 2021 and recognise that we were in a bright spot in terms of our politics, economy, social issues and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and be an even brighter spot in 2030.",26/1/2021 11:26,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/140747699_3700150840051064_8081657175037178394_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=43GY5-gbe4MAX_ZHoFe&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=f2157280c3a1a7c62e184782e2907bad&oe=605929B7,,,,116,2,5,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158839501150631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/140747699_3700150840051064_8081657175037178394_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=43GY5-gbe4MAX_ZHoFe&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=f2157280c3a1a7c62e184782e2907bad&oe=605929B7'],10158839501150600

I visited the Community Care Apartments exhibition held at HDB Hub today with Sim Ann 沈颖 and Amy Khor and was happy to meet with some participants of the focus group discussions that were held earlier to gather feedback on this new public housing concept. We had a lively discussion and I was encouraged to learn that our seniors like the concept of communal living, with opportunities for social interaction – essentially fostering a ‘kampung spirit’.

Our seniors have also shared that they prefer to age-in-place independently within communities that they are familiar with – an aspiration that the Community Care Apartments aims to fulfil. To provide frailer seniors who need some support, there will be a Shared Caregiving Service too, a unique feature of the Community Care Apartments that provides round-the-clock assistance for seniors with moderate disability, as well as medical reminders and assistance with simple errands. To ensure such services are affordable and accessible, we will provide eligible seniors with up to 80% means-tested subsidies to offset the monthly service cost.

Glad to know that the exhibition has received healthy interest since its launch and I invite you to drop by to take a look too. The project will be launched in Bukit Batok West Avenue 9 and HDB will be releasing details in the Build-to-Order exercise in Feb 2021. You can click on the link below for more information or book an appointment to visit the exhibition at HDB Hub.

<Tightened Safe Management Measures>

It has been nearly a month since we entered Phase 3. We had anticipated then that there could be more cases in the community due to increased activities; and that we would need continued adjustments to our measures.

Indeed in the recent two weeks, new cases and clusters have emerged. They are likely the result of increased activities over the year-end period (typically new cases present themselves with a 1-2 week lag). Our vulnerabilities have gone up, and we cannot afford to take any chances. The situation can escalate rapidly especially with Chinese New Year coming up soon. Remember cases spiked after CNY last year, and we had many clusters then linked to CNY activities and gatherings.

So we are making a pre-emptive move now to tighten our measures. Under the current rule, home visits are allowed for up to 8 visitors at any time. From 26 Jan onwards, we will limit such visits to 8 distinct visitors per household per day. For those who are planning to go out visiting, we strongly advise that you minimise your physical gatherings. In particular over the CNY period, visit your family members only, and do not exceed more than two visits per day.

When dining out, keep your masks on if you are not eating/drinking, and refrain from singing or talking loudly. So during the lohei, masks must remain on, and there should be no shouting of auspicious phrases. For reunion dinners, keep to one table of not more than 8 pax and ensure there are no multiple table bookings, or intermingling across tables.

I know many will be disappointed at these new restrictions especially over the festive season. But I hope everyone understands why they are necessary. The virus is raging everywhere in the world. Many places in Asia that have successfully controlled the infection are now seeing a rise in cases. Places like China, Taiwan and Hong Kong have all imposed curbs on their CNY celebrations.

Likewise, we must be mentally prepared that CNY this year will not be the same as before. It will be quieter and more subdued. We will need to stay disciplined and vigilant. I seek everyone’s cooperation on these new measures. If we all do our part, we can continue to keep the infection under control until we roll out our vaccination programme and get everyone in Singapore vaccinated.",23/1/2021 1:15,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/139873998_4913901448651159_1066664831674527737_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=ldB_NOwxYL0AX-NznR1&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=041035b6ac051b5bd2f74681143d8b79&oe=60567A19,,,,775,42,145,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158825653675631,['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/139873998_4913901448651159_1066664831674527737_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=ldB_NOwxYL0AX-NznR1&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=041035b6ac051b5bd2f74681143d8b79&oe=60567A19'],10158825653675600

The COVID-19 pandemic has irrevocably changed the way we live and work, including the way we do business. But we should continue to find new ways to adapt and thrive in the new normal. I had the opportunity to hear from representatives from various healthcare and biomedical companies in Singapore about the challenges they face and to explore solutions to overcome them together, at the Emerging Stronger Conversation organised by MTI yesterday. This was part of a session hosted by DPM to engage the business community on the broader strategy moving forward.

In our exchanges, we talked about encouraging public-private partnerships to help companies internationalise and develop new care models; and supporting closer collaborations between local healthcare and biomedical companies. We also discussed a range of topics, including digitalising healthcare for future healthcare delivery; attracting global healthcare talent while continuing to cultivate our local core to drive innovation; and how regulators and regulations can catalyse medical technology innovation.

I would like to thank the representatives from the healthcare and biomedical companies for the fruitful discussion.

Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 not only protects yourself but also your loved ones.

This was the key reason why Ms Mabel Ong, Deputy Director of Nursing Administration at National University Polyclinics, decided to take the vaccination. Ms Ong was vaccinated yesterday by her colleague Senior Staff Nurse Kim Rui Ning, who was vaccinated last week, as part of the progressive rollout of vaccinations in our public health institutions.

In line with the recommendations of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, healthcare workers and COVID-19 frontline workers are prioritised for vaccination as they are at higher risk of being infected by COVID-19 and hence most in need of COVID-19 vaccination.

Vaccination is a key strategy in our fight against COVID-19, along with safe management measures, contact tracing, and testing. While vaccination is voluntary, we need to have as many people vaccinated as possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and protect those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons.

We strongly encourage you to get vaccinated when your turn comes, to protect yourself, and your loved ones. Let’s work together for a safer and healthier 2021.",13/1/2021 20:39,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136376878_3666027883463360_1452037111360677190_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=zpu9AHe8EtgAX_y4_71&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=34d580345c929ab9b1690ea8c316e239&oe=605722C7,,,,953,16,56,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158800124305631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136376878_3666027883463360_1452037111360677190_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=zpu9AHe8EtgAX_y4_71&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=34d580345c929ab9b1690ea8c316e239&oe=605722C7', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136400058_3666027920130023_853161025450570882_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=WEiX1qpuVoAAX-ESnic&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=72d1ca14f75d38862ed88de1b29eeb67&oe=60583587', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/137039099_3666027943463354_2292168656753996909_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=CE5FoJVtcnYAX_I7sFG&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=0fb0d08afacec2c5fc8fba57aabe6ad5&oe=605791DE', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/137332366_3666028046796677_2019052938850311699_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=YKZYvFf-EdMAX8zWl7z&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=7b2bb2f42b270deae2997f0dd8fdd187&oe=6058DFC1']",10158800124305600
1.01588E+16,"To support Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts, the government is setting up four COVID-19 vaccination centres this month, starting with two – located at Changi Airport Terminal 4 and Raffles City Convention Centre – which have started operations today. Two more vaccination centres, located at the former Hong Kah Secondary School and Woodlands Galaxy Community Centre, will be ready for operations next week.

We expect to set up more vaccination centres over time to support the vaccination efforts. We are on track to have another four vaccination centres by the end of February. These centres, together with polyclinics and selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics, will ensure that every Singaporean and long-term resident here who is medically eligible can receive their vaccinations conveniently.

We have started vaccinating our healthcare workers and frontline workers, including those at our border entry points and those involved in the COVID-19 response. As of 12 Jan, more than 6,200 individuals have received their first dose of the vaccine. These numbers are expected to rise substantially in the coming weeks as we continue to ramp up our vaccination operations. On 12 Jan alone, we vaccinated close to 2,800 individuals, including around 2,500 healthcare workers.

This afternoon, Multi-Ministry Taskforce Co-chairs Gan Kim Yong and Lawrence Wong visited Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital (KWSH) to observe the vaccination operations, and joined healthcare workers at KWSH to receive the COVID-19 vaccination.

Later this month, we will also progressively commence vaccination for seniors. Letters will be progressively sent to seniors to invite them to book an appointment for their vaccination. Residents and clients in the community care sector will also progressively be vaccinated.

We are making provision for all Singaporeans and long-term residents here to be able to get vaccinated by the third quarter of 2021, if there are no unforeseen disruptions to vaccine shipments. Vaccination will be progressively rolled out and is voluntary. We strongly encourage everyone in Singapore who is medically eligible to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered to you so that as a society, we can keep one another safe from COVID-19.

In the meantime, let’s stay vigilant and disciplined in our fight against COVID-19, by continuing to observe safe distancing and safe management measures and wearing a mask when out of the home.",13/1/2021 18:22,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136375946_10158799903225631_4618900220272400347_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=D2Lzd0TukuMAX8vgBqV&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=38b172efd26c06e43ff316d67a4cf908&oe=6056F11A,,,,7296,227,0,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158799922900631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136375946_10158799903225631_4618900220272400347_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=D2Lzd0TukuMAX8vgBqV&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=38b172efd26c06e43ff316d67a4cf908&oe=6056F11A', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/137256932_10158799903440631_4535906341536289281_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=R4k6dypP3lAAX-5BCU3&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=6979dd060b4a388110c1d7c6d049b2ae&oe=60567267', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136767084_10158799903545631_7915750713563837974_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Uz9ReZajODMAX_Dccnv&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=3090b8a429970f137c844cd9ed48a1f3&oe=605640D4', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136675095_10158799903905631_6318190878628332924_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=4HRp3XNjpM8AX86Jhg1&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=72ed48ecc5e5b709cf7be1c5c48fba51&oe=60571A8D']",10158799922900600

The Ministry of Health, Singapore launched the Action Plan for Successful Ageing in 2015, a national blueprint for population ageing. This year, we’re working to refresh the Action Plan, and we want to hear more from you and to tap on your insight and ideas to co-create initiatives and programmes so that we can continue to make Singapore a great place to age in together.

We kickstarted our first Focus Group Discussion (FGD) session on the Action Plan yesterday – and what a fruitful discussion we had! 💪 Many of you at the session shared your aspirations for a Singapore that cares for our seniors, an empathetic and enabling society that is able to walk in our seniors’ shoes while bringing our resources together to plan for ageing early. Many of you also expressed your desire to help seniors with mental health conditions, such as by ensuring that there is infrastructural support for seniors with dementia and their caregivers.

I’m very encouraged by the ideas shared today, and heartened to hear how some of you have stepped up to support seniors in your own ways. Your ideas, energy and commitment are critical to making Singapore a better place to age in, and the Government will work with you, together, to provide support to our seniors. A whole-of-society effort will help us to build an inclusive society that celebrates and embraces our seniors.

There will be more FGD sessions on the Ageing Plan in the next 2 months, where we will continue to seek views and co-create initiatives and programmes with many other participants. For those who joined the FGD yesterday, I encourage you to step forward and start deeper conversations with one another beyond today’s session. And to everyone else, I want to encourage you to join the conversation in your own way, whether with your family and friends, or in your workplace or neighbourhood.

Look forward to having more of you join this conversation in the coming weeks!",12/1/2021 14:31,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/137270281_1726834447477565_5927166361835264166_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=QclsFXRzPgsAX9S3R5g&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=1d62875e1df4c9c85897915755b9e66f&oe=6056D318,,,,65,0,0,https://facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158797397345631,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/137270281_1726834447477565_5927166361835264166_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=QclsFXRzPgsAX9S3R5g&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=1d62875e1df4c9c85897915755b9e66f&oe=6056D318', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/136642065_1726834427477567_232732342641248484_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=SGFIqVdiqMwAX_odYP4&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=8a4045b0ee8abd425cb524251ae83977&oe=6057E158']",10158797397345600
