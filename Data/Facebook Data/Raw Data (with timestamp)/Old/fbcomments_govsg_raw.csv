1.01591E+16,Joyce Tan,很棒的節目，謝謝制作团队。  不过《哪里找 Lobang》单元Lobang Queen 刘玲玲小姐对司机先生的态度很要不得！  记得几年前的一个上午，在大巴窑某家大规模书局看到一位中年auntie 级主管，当着顾客（上午刚开店，顾客不多）的面前，用类似嚣张霸气的口气对待下属，我看不下去，走到店的另一端跟其他员工了解情况，知道这是这位主管的一贯作风。  好管闲事的我请这位主管到一旁，以一位顾客的立场请她尊重她的下属，注意她的口吻，后来我也打电话到这间公司去feedback 所看到的一切。,Jan-12

Not only was the item not available at the physical outlet, I was told to buy online. At the same time, I was informed if I purchase more than $50,  the retailer would arrange for free delivery. Thid retailer doesn't seem to be interested in serving walk in customers at their branches. I wonder why does this retailer even bother to maintain any physical outlets. Having said that, the information posted on their website is inaccurate and incomplete, leaving genuine customers like me confused and unable to make any purchase decision. It was such a frustrating experience dealing with the retailer that I gave up and decided to buy from this business going forward.

Can I request that you all increase the number of Family members to have meals together outside the home. Every time when we order to be delivered, it is not cheap and the food doesn't taste as good as when we eat at the restaurant.

Have better rules and better checks on people before they are allowed to fly in! Start earning your exorbitant salaries! If there isn’t anyone coming in infected than we shouldn’t have local infections and so many rules! It seems like so many rules for us citizens but none for your imported cases! 😡","Nov 3, 2020"

To date we have not seen regular government communication through a spokesmen to communicate with the media and public.  The government needs to upgrade its current communication departments, enhance their importance, and further involve them to engage the public.   It’s not just about doing your best but also about telling what you have done and doing. The technocratic efficient and effective governance is no longer  enough. You also cannot rely on past medias when Singaporeans and residents are reading from many different outlets.   Also recruit more communication professionals to explain policies, events how it is handling matters and what are the results and outcomes.   It’s a world of social media. The more you engage and share, the better you handle public opinion.   Take center stage.","Nov 16, 2020"

Tourists should take Antigen Rapid Fast test very accurate (no need lab for test result) 72 hours before their flight to Singapore, if they are negative than they should allow to fly, once tourists are landed in Singapore at Changi airport we should do one more Antigen Rapid FAST test to them and if they are negative we give them tracing device and let them enjoy and spend money here.

It made me cry to see and hear the heroic deeds of people in caring and attending to the needs of all. I feel so blessed to be in this country where kindness and integrity  rule the heart of those in the government service.

In the mist of such economic situation people got no choice but to take up such role even if working hours are not 8-5 . Singaporean probably have to change their mindset and get out of their comfort zones.As a Singaporean I want to suggest and provide some solutions to whatever ideas there can be as DPM did mentioned about listening feedbacks from the ground. The challenge is always the bridging and change that industries need to adapt to help Singaporean. Hope this can work and I can also benefit from it in the near future. Thanks ,"Oct 13, 2020"

1.01588E+16,Bongiwe Jessica,"I grew up surrounded by God and church members from the very beginning. Being risen by Christian home, I always followed through the motions of doing “Christian things” that I thought a Christian was supposed to do. I didn’t know GOD, I just knew about Him. I found myself searching for purpose and meaning in people and also in myself. Whether that was my friends or in relationships, I poured my whole heart into them. I became very consumed with what people thought of me and was living for the acceptance of the world. At my lowest point when I lost my lovely husband to a beautiful young girl I think we call slay queens these days, I was alone and afraid, I couldn’t concentrate at work not even at any other thing I could work on. Losing my concentration cost me so much that I ended up losing my job too and went back to staying at my parents’ house with my two kids. I can’t lie to you, it was always more hurting and annoying staying home because my mom’s friends used to almost come every day to visit and sit outside talking about their marriages’ and fun they had maybe like during the weekends’ and laugh, OMG, that laugh they used to give always killed me. After what friends showed me that year I admit I had turn into a jealous person. That year was a year I will never forget. I could wake up in the morning sit on the couch watch Isindigo, login Facebook and all those sorts of social Medias and cry the whole day with my mum nursing me until it reached a time that she was also getting fade with my sobbing. It was my daughter’s birthday and some few people turned up, many were my mums friends and actually my daughters friends none of my closest turned up and it was from then I noticed that “people will always love you and support you when its beneficial” out of my mums friends, I found myself initiated in a long and funny conversation with one of them after the party. I won’t forget the fact that her husband called almost like 10 times in a period of 5 minutes just to remind her how he loved her and wishing her to drive safe back home, believe me I had never had that experience with my man. Later on during the conversation, she saw me burst into tears and she asked me what was going on, I told her everything I was going through with my life. And it was from here that I got to know about Mama Morgan +27784502035 a very cunning woman I have ever met. She told me about her meeting with Mama Morgan and she actually never gave me her numbers but took me with her to Mama Morgan. Being a born Christian, believe me I had a very big challenge here. Like how am I going to mix these two things from growing up in a Christian home to starting to believe in African tradition, but I kept on consoling myself. I always kept on having dreams having money, living lavish, and snakes chasing me, falling in very deep holes, having sex with people I don’t even know, being shot, losing fights and many more dreams that didn’t make sense to me. One morning of a beautiful Saturday I went on and called this lady (my mums’ friend) and told her I was ready to meet Mama , she came home, picked me and we went to meet Mama Morgan . She asked me what she wanted to use and I gave her everything then she conducted her prayers. What surprised me was that she was using a BIBLE and mirror to conduct her prayers then after everything she asked me to go back home and wait on the results. It took me 5 days then the father of my kids came to my parents place and He was all in tears telling me that the young girl she had opt to stay with was using muthi on him and she was targeting his riches she even tried to poison him like the evening before he came home but he missed on the poison and the cat ate it instead and he had come to ask for forgiveness and that he saw me in the dream like two days back and he was kneeling begging me to come back in his life and that’s why he had drove home to ask for my forgiveness. Believe me I cried even more than before when he was telling me his story. After like a week, I got a call that Eskom needed me back to work after a period of a year and a half. You can reach Mama Morgan on Call/Whatsapp+27784502035 in case you need her assistance.","Oct 1, 2020"

Tourists should take Covid PCR test 72 hours before their flight to Singapore, if they are negative than they should allow to fly, once tourists are landed in Singapore at Changi airport we should do one more FAST Saliva Covid PCR test to them and if they are negative we give them tracing device and let them enjoy and spend money here.

Phase 2 kicked in on 19th June and local transmissions has been kept low, despite elections and the post elections euphoria at certain wards.   Much of the transmission is still from the dorms, and imported. And once all the dorms are cleared, we should fall to single digit everyday.   Our fatality rate is still the lowest in the world, and that has been the target set all along. So let’s hang in there till the vaccine comes along. We can’t afford a second wave as what we have seen happen in other countries. Masks on, social distancing and pls stay home if unwell. ","Jul 28, 2020"

Some standing around masks down taking their time eating, drinking and talking without safe distancing. Some people I see in my area, walking about smoking using hand phones , or masks down walking about with a bottle of drink but not drinking so that didn’t have to wear mask... almost daily in the evenings I see a group of mothers/ helpers chatting and children (4,5yr olds) with them playing together without any masks or face shields ... the popular spots, beaches & parks are not the only places that need more monitoring.  The heartlands need attention too.  I was at Tan Tock Seng Hospital for my medical follow up on 23rd July . Theres no safe distancing in the queue waiting to get the usual SafeEntry & temp check before entry to the building, plus the safe distance staff didn’t even notice that he was talking to a person whose mask was under her chin.... after she walked away... i highlighted to him, he then went after her and instructed her to properly don the mask ....

Citizens can read from news release that they are classified under Singaporeans and PRs but the infected cases are mainly from India and detected during their SHN.

I know cases where HDB residents who also owns private properties not directly under their names being granted the relief fund. I also know SMEs who are granted 75% of the employees salary by the government. But the SMEs only paid their employees 50% and pocket 25%.  It makes me wonder how the assessment is done especially among SMEs. The government has given many grants to SMEs who sometimes abused what they do to receive the grant. But genuine cases like myself are deprived from any relief fund as self-employed simply bcos our AV value doesn’t qualify. Is the Relief fund based on residential property or helping the affected resident to ride over the current crisis. Please advise.","Jul 7, 2020"

1.01585E+16,Sah Soon Lim,"Let’s have good inclusive schemes for the low-wage Singaporeans , not just sticking to old mind sets or western HR practices blindly ! We not only need to raise the low wages of our workers at the bottom but also have to remove the social stigma against them and give them the much needed respect and career advancement opportunities .  For example ，NEA may want to think out of the box and consider an innovative proposal to draw up a common public health -essential service professional workers scheme to attract Singaporeans to join and serve as a life long career in this essential public sector . Such common service scheme respects and treasures every worker right from the bottom as a cleaner up to the top as a public health manager or superintendent. Young and old Singaporeans regardless of their educational levels or English proficiency can be encouraged to join as public health workers doing the cleaner‘s job at a good starting salary of say $2000 pm for a headstart.The more positive and ambitious ones will be given ample on-the-job career training and development opportunities under the scheme to upgrade themselves to take up various higher job responsibilities ，such as truck driver， machine & tool workshop technician, auto-machine operator，plumber，foreman，supervisor，manager ， public health inspector ，public health trainer ， public health enforcement officer，public health supprintendant and even as a certified public health consultant or a licensed cleaning contractor or SME boss in this industry,as they gain more practical experiences, higher job skills and relevant job interests while working and growing from the bottom to the top and to the best of their ability and hard work. If this pilot scheme proves to be successful for the essential public sector , similar common and inclusive schemes can then be widely implemented for other low wage Singaporeans to bring them into the main stream of our entire workforce in every industry so that we dont depend too much on FW to keep Singapore clean ,healthy and staying  ahead of others as a great city within a garden! More importantly ,we don’t become panic and helpless if the FW for any future reason will not or cannot come to Singapore to work any more. Could NEA or any aspiring MP care to take up or look into this essential issue that is of great concern to Singaporeans?","Jun 25, 2020"

Every morning between 5.30am to 6.30am, there will be more than 10 essential workers not wearing mask, another group will be smoking while using the park to commute and there is a few who kept spitting. I wrote to NEA to highlight this issue but nothing visible has been done since 1 month ago. I did not see any officers patrolling. I think since they are essential workers and probably handling our food, they do not have proper hygiene practices in the public, I wonder what goes on in the factories.","Jun 26, 2020"

The store is located on the bustling Orchard Road. They are happy to talk and sell goods in the store.The live video is recorded truth，uploaded to Facebook by themself,ID ""Cona belle"", these ladies are violating the social ban almost every day.  There was no mask at all, and the ban was severely violated for more than a month.  Are these ladies challenging Singapore law?  What punishment should they receive?  I believe Singapore law is fair.Some people were being sent to court or even deported just talked to friend whose wearing the mask during the Circuit Breaker。从5月27日到6月18日，几乎每天都有五名妇女不戴口罩聚集在同一家商店里聚会，该商店位于繁华的乌节路。 在新加坡断路器期间。这些来自不同家庭的女士们每天都出门去这家商店里聚会，并且高兴的聚集在商店里聊天和出售商品。现场直播视频记录了一切真相，都是她们自己上传到Facebook，ID为“ Cona belle”。当然我已经录制了所有视频防止被她们销毁证据。这些女士们几乎每天都在违反社交禁令。 她们根本就不戴口罩，根本不就在乎别人的生命安全问题，给新加坡人民的生命安全造成严重影响。她们严重违反了社交禁令长达一个多月。 这些女士在挑战新加坡法律吗？ 她们应该受到什么惩罚？ 我相信新加坡的法律是公平的，我知道，有些人在断路器期间被送上法庭，甚至被驱逐出境，有一些人只是戴着口罩与朋友在公共场合交谈.那么这些女士呢？希望警方给新加坡人民一个公正的答案。","Jun 21, 2020"

This Singapore Government's Financial Support Assitance are generous and gives Every Child/Family/Individual the peace of mind to pursue their value creation/potential, when they take the effort to apply for them.  - They are not spoon-fed. Making a better future for yourself is an act of self-/family-love. Having the real opportunity to get financial support for education,  activates the family/individual's integrity to pursue.

Will it result in overcrowding with social distancing being compromised for the first few days of opening?   2. This is always a worrying trend when trade opens for the first few days like MacDonald,  barber shop and also then the closure of pubs,  restaurant before the circuit breaker.    3. It is hard to discipline and resist and this is where covid-19 creeps in like what is happening in Beijing now.  As long vaccines are not found,  it is unlikely we can be free as a bird.    4.Wash hands and only go out for essential trip must be observed.  We can be excited but if not careful,  we will put more healthcare workers in a harder situation.  5.Wearing of mask till end of 2020 must be mandated and not an option.  When winter enters and haze issue happening,  we have more teething issue to solve , not to mention the dengue fever and the coming 7th month when burning of incense pollutes the environment.   We are not over the ordeal but just a respite for the worst to come. Repeated ads to wash hands,  wear mask and social distancing must continue on TV and radio to remind elderly and children. This must be a new normal everyone must observe till a vaccine is found.","Jun 15, 2020"

1.01585E+16,Lerato jennifer," I have been married several times and all my marriages ended up in divorce because i couldn't have kids.I tried almost every specialist in southafrica and spent over R10,000 but with no positive results, until just recently out of desperation i spoke to one of my friends about my problems because of the changes in my husband's behaviour who i believe was considering marrying another wife according to his family.My friend advised me to see a spell caster but since i come from a religious family i didn't take it seriously but because i wanted to save my marriage and i was tired of living a miserable life i agreed to my friend's suggestion since i had nothing to lose. She suggested that we can call a lady called Dr. Mama Shamirah who helped her some time back to recover her stolen car and other properties.I called Dr. Mama Shamirah and explained to her about my situation and she agreed to help me.We started serious spiritual prayers and my sisters you can't believe it that after 2days my current husband came and confessed to me about his new relationship and he was ready to drop it and work on our marriage. I didn't show him anger but love and support as Dr. Mama Shamirah had advised me to do.we started spending alot of quality time together and as am speaking now we are very happy with my husband and our 3months baby girl. I really can't thank you enough Dr. Mama Shamirah but i only have one advice to my fellow sisters never give up on life things can happen at any time and at any age as long as you persist on what you want.Any one with problems like mine please don't waste your money else where try Dr. Mama Shamirah, she is your answer.

1.01585E+16,Lerato jennifer,"When my husband left me for another lady I was so hurt and I used to cry every day. Whenever I could miss him I could just close my bedroom and cry because I never wanted my kids to see me crying. It was tough times to endure the stress and at work, I could not perform well being a nurse I work with many people but I could be moody and could even lose tempers for small things my colleagues complained and I signed many warning before the matron. I tried so much to move on but it was hard I love my husband sometimes I could see him in my dreams wake up thinking he would come but nothing, I used to SMS him but no response calling him he never picked my calls and finally blocked all my numbers not even to support the kids. many times I tried to talk to his family and friends they tried their best but he had completely changed and he regarded everyone as a stranger kept a deaf ear on everyone who tried to talk to him. I resorted to sangomas and spell casters but not even at one time did i see a change. I started drinking alcohol because I couldn't handle the stress but as you all know once you are drunk you are out of stress it could be worse once the alcohol is out . I can't forget the day I came back home and our firstborn asked me where is Daddy I miss him a lot why he is no longer coming home I never gave a right answer I went in the bedroom started crying at this time. I thought a lot of bad things but again because I loved my kids I knew I had to be strong because it was my role to play as a mother. I phoned one family friend she is such a darling to me and she gave me a number of Dr. Mama SHAMIRAH+27790792882 she said she had helped her two years ago I had lost all my trust in everyone but she strengthened me and gave me the go-ahead to try Dr. Mama SHAMIRAH+27790792882. I thought about it with all my heart and finally decided to contact Dr. Mama SHAMIRAH I made everything known to her and she said that we had a future with my husband and we are compatible but the lady had used something on my man which had diverted his feelings away from not only me but also from the whole family. I was so angry at this point and I asked how-how was possible to get him back. Dr. Mama SHAMIRAH assured me that I would get my happiness back in three days Before I began the prayer with Dr. Mama SHAMIRAH, I sent her my info with that of my husband then I was given the instructions of the prayers we did together over the phone and after the fast day my husband texted me saying hi it was not a big message but I was so happy for that small massage I never replied though and after 48 hours of the prayer my husband came home I was not home by that time I was by neighbours I heard the car hooting and rushed to see who was it. He asked me to sit in the car we talked he was so romantic and he asked my forgiveness since then our lives have been progressing both in relationships and finances. I have written my story to tell everyone who may be in tears that I was like that before. If you can contact Dr. Mama Shamirah Call/Whatsapp+27790792882 you will get help. Thank you mama you can contact Dr. Mama Shamirah Call/Whatsapp+27790792882 you will get help. Thank you, mama","Jun 14, 2020"

1.01585E+16,Juliet Lerato,"It's better not to judge a book by its cover. I had always talked rubbish about spiritual healers because i was living a luxurious life. I never believed that anyone can solve someone's problems.I could rudely reply to the posts about the healers with insults little did i know that one day they will help me. The most grateful news of how my situation changed after a long period of suffering in an abusive marriage. My husband used to drink a lot and he loses all his mind and he could beat me up for no reason, I tried to settle matters with him but he kept a deaf ear, the worst thing was that I had failed to give him any kid, I conceived him twice but had miscarriages this made all his family to hate me and considered me as a person with bad luck but in reality I wanted to have kids so much. I looked for help in many places. Some used to tell me they could see darkness around my life and others could say bad luck while others could not give a serious reason behind my problems.and i that made mi to spend a lot reaching to the exetend of selling some of my things trying to get a better life with my husband bt i wouldn't loss hope,because of the situation i was facing! They all used to promise me good results but none could deliver, Most of the times when hardships come to us friends are few I was left alone crying every day and as a result, I lost my job because I couldn't perform well. Many friends left me and my husband filed a divorce and I became a laughing topic but I never lost hope. It was last year when I saw people writing about Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 and I felt interested to contact her one more time. I made my problems known to Mama who advised me to be cleansed from all that was making me suffer and to open up my luck in everything I do. I was asked to buy materials to help me which I did we begun the prayer and results were delivered in Four days. I thought it would be so easy but some stones remained unturned till last week when my husband came up with un apology to me for all he has been doing, he confessed for cheating and I forgave him and finally yesterday when i went for the check-up and the Mama confirmed that am two weeks pregnant with no complications. Am hoping to be a mother soon. Any woman out there facing the same in your love life please don't be ashamed of looking for help just contact Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 privately by either a Call or Whatsapp","Jun 10, 2020"

Just hope you can see the logic here..You said..not possible to ensure distancing in public transport..hence the measures like masks.. If that is the case,then why do u impose on us to wear the mask at all times once out?  To condense ALL the theories regarding purpose of masks..Perhaps your task force might want to re-think to simply say""IT WILL BE AN OFFENCE IF ANYONE  IS SEEN  NOT WEARING A MASK WHEN IN CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH STRANGERS OUTSIDE THEIR HOMES"". This makes it much simpler as all we have to remember is just that. NZ has showed us..FOCUS IS DISTANCE.. To paint a very clear picture..Jogger..not wearing mask..Elderly with mask..Isnt it possible vapours from the jogger can enter the eyes of elderly? This is just one example..but heart of the matter..message should be..ALL OF US SHOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE NEAR others without a mask.","Jun 9, 2020"

However, there will be foreseeable resistance and barrier for the effective use and implementation of wearable contact tracing device/app due to the fundamental trust issue.  I feel it’d be a good opportunity for our Government to address the data protection/privacy legislation to assure public that the data collected about them during this pandemic (and/or future ones) will be handled in consistent manners as it is intended for.  Such use is solely for public health purposes, in the interest and for the benefit of general public, and will be shut down as soon as it no longer serves the purpose.  More importantly, there is no sharing of information with other governmental agencies and/or private entities, and such information should not end up in unexpected places for other surveillance purposes.    In fact, a national approach would prob be more productive and preferable than individual vendors (NTUC, medical hall, salon, etc) holding personal data of individuals for safe entry implementation (subjecting public to unintended risk of personal data violation/leaks).  Hopefully we can hear more updates on the data privacy issue/action plans/process that would be critical to the successful implementation.  Thank you. ","Jun 8, 2020"

Typically, you breathe faster and harder when you are running than when you are standing or sitting, unless, of course, you are watching pictures of melted cheese while sitting or standing. Such panting may mean that you exhale respiratory droplets in greater quantities and project them farther. Therefore, you may want to at least double your distance when exercising or watching melted cheese.   https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/05/10/10-tips-on-how-to-run-safely-with-covid-19-coronavirus-spreading/","Jun 17, 2020"

1.01584E+16,陈小川,新加坡一些特定行业如建筑，维修，卫生环保基本上都是孟加拉和印度客工，没有其他，除了管工的，也不是没有机械化自动化，不过有些工作不能没有人力为基础。工厂生产线多数馬劳，中国工，帮佣印尼菲律宾缅甸，零售服务医护菲律宾，这些类别和传统客工很明显。这次客工疫情爆发是一人失策还是一个政府部门和控制行动有缺失，反应迟钝导致无法围堵。幸好爆发后才倾全力补救，成功压制外传，没有波及社区和延伸到宿舍以外算是不幸中之大幸了。当然每经一事都应该长经验，学习检讨才是，相信下次做到更好，更加妥善。政府需要自行认真客观在疫情后多层面跟进，凝定各个细节和承认疏漏。才是负责任的政府。,"May 26, 2020"

1.01584E+16,FH Tan,"I was at Great World City today at about 1030 to try to buy groceries and the crowd was dumbfounding. I was amazed by the profile of the groups there. Grandparents cuddling their grandchildren while saying goodbye after meeting up with their extended families for a shopping trip together. The government did say not to visit the elderly but didn’t say anything about meeting up with them elsewhere so creative ways of meeting up have been used. Young families with toddlers and babies in tow. It is no wonder community cases do not die off altogether. Adult men who look strong enough to handle groceries on their own but were accompanied by equally strong looking younger men for the grocery shopping trip. We are very good at following the letter but not the spirit of the law. Elsewhere, customers who wear their masks under their noses continue to be served. Hand sanitizers that require touch operation by each and everyone instead of hands-free operation are in place in public domains. I hope we can put a little thought to this and nail the issue once and for all. The malls / shops should be made responsible to ensure that whole groups are not allowed in and also reduce touchpoints as much as possible.","May 25, 2020"

Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my boyfriend. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached his flat I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to his room. When I knocked, he allowed me to enter because he wasn't expecting me at the time, but when I opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in his house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, he followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away. I reached home and cried a lot until i told my best friend everything and she told me to fight for my man and not lose him to another woman. She gave Mama Shamirah contact(+27790792882) and told Mama Shamirah will bring back my boyfriend to me and love and only me.

The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby, he cried and smiled with joy and happiness.

I am currently renting a space from a hairsalon that has a shop front and partition to separate our space. As my business falls under Beauty they say i cannot open on the 2nd of June. I am a manicurist and I hope to open as I have clients who are in pain due to ingrown nail that can cause swelling and inflammation or under hard skin that causes cracked heels that will lead to bleeding. I am told they an go seek hospital to treat it but most of them have have been say they feel pain even more frequent or the doc will tell them to go for minor operation to remove the nail which is not necessary than when they see me as I can treat this problem if not servere. But it has been two months and most of my clients are feeling the pain and have made appt. I only need to open to do pedicure only to help these clients. Even if it's 2 or 3 days week at least to do Pedicure for the feet takes about an hour only. And I have ladies and gentlemen who have injured back and can't bend to cut the nails for the feet or diabetes who need nails short if not dangerous if the nail is too long and they bang into anything in the house. I work alone with no employee. Please consider my business as essential. Cause I don't understand hair salon can open to do full Services that can take a good 4-6hrs per client and I am only doing pedicure that is only an hour job. And my landlord says this month I have to start paying rent and that is a good $2000. So if business cannot open how do I pay next months rent. Am very worried please advise.

Some used to tell me they could see darkness around my life and others could say bad luck while others could not give a serious reason behind my problems.and i that made mi to spend a lot reaching to the exetend of selling some of my things trying to get a better life with my husband bt i wouldn't loss hope,because of the situation i was facing! They all used to promise me good results but none could deliver, Most of the times when hardships come to us friends are few I was left alone crying every day and as a result, I lost my job because I couldn't perform well. Many friends left me and my husband filed a divorce and I became a laughing topic but I never lost hope. It was last year when I saw people writing about Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 and I felt interested to contact her one more time. I made my problems known to Mama who advised me to be cleansed from all that was making me suffer and to open up my luck in everything I do. I was asked to buy materials to help me which I did we begun the prayer and results were delivered in Four days. I thought it would be so easy but some stones remained unturned till last week when my husband came up with un apology to me for all he has been doing, he confessed for cheating and I forgave him and finally yesterday when i went for the check-up and the Mama confirmed that am two weeks pregnant with no complications. Am hoping to be a mother soon. Any woman out there facing the same in your love life please don't be ashamed of looking for help just contact Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 privately by either a Call or Whatsapp","May 22, 2020"

In fact, WFH takes up more of the employees personal time and even at their own expenses like huge increase in electricity bills and they will not get any support or reimbursement for this, yet most of the employees are willing and adapted to WFH and even became more efficient as their health is not at risk and minimum exposure to the virus, which is more important.

I am a manicurist and I hope to open as I have clients who are in pain due to ingrown nail that can cause swelling and inflammation or under hard skin that causes cracked heels that will lead to bleeding. I am told they an go seek hospital to treat it but most of them have have been say they feel pain even more frequent or the doc will tell them to go for minor operation to remove the nail which is not necessary than when they see me as I can treat this problem if not servere. But it has been two months and most of my clients are feeling the pain and have made appt. I only need to open to do pedicure only to help these clients. Even if it's 2 or 3 days week at least to do Pedicure for the feet takes about an hour only. And I have ladies and gentlemen who have injured back and can't bend to cut the nails for the feet or diabetes who need nails short if not dangerous if the nail is too long and they bang into anything in the house. I work alone with no employee. Please consider my business as essential. Cause I don't understand hair salon can open to do full Services that can take a good 4-6hrs per client and I am only doing pedicure that is only an hour job.

1.01584E+16,Mary Nomampelo,"I grew up surrounded by God and church members from the very beginning. Being risen by Christian home, I always followed through the motions of doing “Christian things” that I thought a Christian was supposed to do. I didn’t know GOD, I just knew about Him. I found myself searching for purpose and meaning in people and also in myself. Whether that was my friends or in relationships, I poured my whole heart into them. I became very consumed with what people thought of me and was living for the acceptance of the world. At my lowest point when I lost my lovely husband to a beautiful young girl I think we call slay queens these days, I was alone and afraid, I couldn’t concentrate at work not even at any other thing I could work on. Losing my concentration cost me so much that I ended up losing my job too and went back to staying at my parents’ house with my two kids. I can’t lie to you, it was always more hurting and annoying staying home because my mom’s friends used to almost come every day to visit and sit outside talking about their marriages’ and fun they had maybe like during the weekends’ and laugh, OMG, that laugh they used to give always killed me. After what friends showed me that year I admit I had turn into a jealous person. That year was a year I will never forget. I could wake up in the morning sit on the couch watch Isindigo, login Facebook and all those sorts of social Medias and cry the whole day with my mum nursing me until it reached a time that she was also getting fade with my sobbing. It was my daughter’s birthday and some few people turned up, many were my mums friends and actually my daughters friends none of my closest turned up and it was from then I noticed that “people will always love you and support you when its beneficial” out of my mums friends, I found myself initiated in a long and funny conversation with one of them after the party. I won’t forget the fact that her husband called almost like 10 times in a period of 5 minutes just to remind her how he loved her and wishing her to drive safe back home, believe me I had never had that experience with my man. Later on during the conversation, she saw me burst into tears and she asked me what was going on, I told her everything I was going through with my life. And it was from here that I got to know about Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 a very cunning woman I have ever met. She told me about her meeting with Dr. Mama Shamirah and she actually never gave me her numbers but took me with her to Dr. Mama Shamirah. Being a born Christian, believe me I had a very big challenge here. Like how am I going to mix these two things from growing up in a Christian home to starting to believe in African tradition, but I kept on consoling myself. I always kept on having dreams having money, living lavish, and snakes chasing me, falling in very deep holes, having sex with people I don’t even know, being shot, losing fights and many more dreams that didn’t make sense to me. One morning of a beautiful Saturday I went on and called this lady (my mums’ friend) and told her I was ready to meet Dr. Mama Shamirah, she came home, picked me and we went to meet Dr. Mama Shamirah. She asked me what she wanted to use and I gave her everything then she conducted her prayers. What surprised me was that she was using a BIBLE and mirror to conduct her prayers then after everything she asked me to go back home and wait on the results. It took me 5 days then the father of my kids came to my parents place and He was all in tears telling me that the young girl she had opt to stay with was using muthi on him and she was targeting his riches she even tried to poison him like the evening before he came home but he missed on the poison and the cat ate it instead and he had come to ask for forgiveness and that he saw me in the dream like two days back and he was kneeling begging me to come back in his life and that’s why he had drove home to ask for my forgiveness. Believe me I cried even more than before when he was telling me his story. After like a week, I got a call that Eskom needed me back to work after a period of a year and a half.  You can reach Dr. Mama Shamirah on Call/Whatsapp+27790792882 in case you need her assistance","May 20, 2020"

1.01584E+16,Wen Tian,"1. The duration for phase 1 to phase 2 should not be less than a month. Then there were restriction of not more than 10 in a home which after a few days reduced to no visit.  Again,  we can restrict limited visit but would it turn to no visit if it gets worst?   2. Truly understand that family bonding are important among grandparents and grandchildren.  Elderly suffered badly in loneliness during these 2 months circuit breakers.  However,  while flexibility is there to allow visit, it should not encourage physical visit but rather promote virtual visit more often through whatapp video.    3. Reason is simple,  with higher movement among the young,  no can can ensure they will not pass the virus unknowingly to the elderly during the visit, especially during incubation period.    4. Elderly and children belong to vulnerable groups. At this critical time,  at least for the next 2 to 3 months,  we should minimise the contact physically between these 2 groups.   5. The phase 3 should only commence at least 3 months or more rather than sooner.  We should study other countries practices,  learn from their experiences before implementing.   6. Singaporeans like to crowd at public areas to experience the proximity,  the freedom and to relax,  after being told to confine at their home. Forming long queues for hours to buy something is our favourite pastime on weekends.  We are orderly and we do not mind queue.  This is good news for covid-19.   7. Prolong phase 1 to 3 allows healthcare workers with more breathing space to cope with current cases. If the 3 phrases are open too soon, and if new cases spike or cluster occurs despite all safety messures,  healthcare workers will be pressured for more work and less rest. They do not mind fighting the virus in hospital but they also know if they don't,  nobody can fight the virus on their behalf.  It takes time to train a nurse and doctor to be professional.    8. Prolong the phases and only allow essential workers on the road. Non essential will need to wait a while longer till September 2020 or later .  No easy and painful for non essential workers but we are in these together.  Please everyone just like America,  only makes us suffer more later.    9. I rather suffer longer period now, cut the chain and enjoy more later.  Stay safe,  wash hands often and wear mask in public. It protects you and your loved ones at home.","May 19, 2020"

1.01584E+16,Hava Ashraff,"My concern is what will be done about the dormitories operators who were not following international cleaning and maintenance standards? Given that many of the workers would come from villages and rural areas where hygiene standards are very low, what future provisions will MOM be making in organising standard programmes to teach them about hygiene standards (like is done for maids)? How will employers and dormitory operators be made accountable as well?  These are questions that are very relevant after this bad experience. The general public needs to know.

1.01584E+16,Wen Tian,"1. New normal will surface after 1st Jun 2020. Several habits such as wearing mask when leaving house well or unwell,  washing hands with soaps often,  social distancing and telecommuting whenever possible till end 2020 must be enforced, like it or not. Safe entry is not a 1 time exercise but on going routine till end 2020 in public places.   2. Regretfully,  Covid-19 is here to stay for long unlike SARS,  MERS,  EBOLA, TB,  and H1N1. In fact, healthcare resources are already put to test, stretching their limit and other chronic illness patient treatment in hospital should not be neglected.   3. Travel and entertainment sectors cannot be closed forever as it kills their business and dampen our economy. Singaporeans being confined at home are dying for oversea holiday to relax and release stress. However,  crowd attracted events such as exhibition,  open party,  concerts,  carnivals,  night market, festival celebration will need to be halt in 2020.   4. No more open space IT show., food fair,  baby fair,  natas,  furniture fair,  National Day parade,  Great sales,  Christmas Party  or year end countdown must be held.  It may extend to 2021 if Singapore suffers 2nd or 3rd waves,  which is probably due to condense population.   5.Opening these sectors although gradually will give covid-19 more chance to creep and grown among our community.  Until vaccines are tested and proven effective,  which is most likely another 12 months from now,  it is high risk to have these sectors open.    6. Unemployment in these sectors will rise and structural unemployment may trigger negative sentimental,  frustration  and more crimes. Social issues will infuriate more pressure to already existing crisis.   Sadly,  this is the new normal in 2020 and beyond we need to live with. We need to face it and acknowledge the once in a lifetime agony.","May 16, 2020"

1.01584E+16,Wen Tian,"1. It is good news that the new cases are declining and we see many countries gradually opening up. However, as what New Zealand PM Jacinda Kate Laurell Ardern said, we should not open too soon quoting example in South Korea new cases in nightclubs only to close again, if there is another outbreak. If it happens in other countries, most likely it will happen in Singapore.  2. Certain industries that attract crowds such as shopping malls, amusement park, cinema, pubs, KTV, exhibitions halls and carnivals should remain close until Aug/Sep 2020, till the current condition stabilizes.  3. Prolong closure will inevitably hurt their business and cause some of them to close down. This is a painful decision. However, judging from our local impulse behaviors, if we gradually open up malls, restaurant and other entertainment sites, it will attract large crowds. Most Singaporeans are confined to their homes with limited entertainment for close to 2 months circuit breaker. The desire to be free in the public is very strong when shops are gradually open.  4. Naturally, most of us will rush to malls and entertainment site such as cinema, carnival, parks, KTV, pubs and swimming pool to relax and to release stress once they are open. Even with social distancing and crowd control, you will see crowds forming outside the premises. Most Singaporeans do not mind queuing for hours especially on weekends.  5. All it takes , is one carrier to spread the virus to the rest unknowingly, and the whole circuit breaker will have to re-start again. For the safety of the majority, no large events such as Singapore Sale, National Day Celebration and year-end party or concerts should be held openly in 2020. This is for everyone safety and health. Celebration of such events will need to be virtual in a different format.  6. Wearing of mask till end 2020 or even throughout 2021 must be a daily habit for those well or unwell. Until the vaccines are found and proven effective, we cannot remove our mask anytime in public. Washing hands need to be a routine, not a choice for all of us.","May 12, 2020"

1.01584E+16,Wen Tian,"1. While most cases are foreign workers in dormitories, covid-19 creeps in to any community with crowd and failed social distancing.    2. The main focus is to test all foreign workers in quarters but any re open of retail shops that attract crowds can easily bring up local transmission again and we are back to square one.   3. Keeping crowd dispered even after circuit breaker ease must still be observed.   4. Wearing of mask till end Dec 2020 must be in force even if cases remain single digit daily. Otherwise,  in 2021, we will repeat our circuit breaker again and the 2nd wave will prove more lethal than the current one when autumn comes.   5. Virus mutates and survives in human bodies for long. Will vaccines be strong to deter the virus?  Maybe the current type but not the mutated version if we allow it to breed unknowingly among us.","May 12, 2020"

1.01584E+16,Timothy Lim,"Seems the FW spread keeps continuing, as are the new clusters specific industrial locations and/or individual buildings? Regardless, it's pretty obvious prolonged close contact with asymptomatic/symptomatic individuals is more likely to get infected, considering the number of cluster cases in SG. It isn't very comforting either when community cases don't seem to be coming down, and fluctuating between low and high numbers each day. Are there still asymptomatic cases walking around in the community? Also, the easing of measures may be a good thing to return to normality, however, the long drawn out CB period has also a risk of complacency and false confidence, where there could be some who have begun to wear masks less, or relax their own safe practices. Many move around short distances with no mask on, even though there are others around, some are dropping off food or items for families, which questions if they are actual delivery workers or relatives? There seems to also be an increased movement of people and households as we grow into the CB. Whole families visit supermarkets still and don't seem to be questioned by the staff or ambassadors. And with the festive period approaching, there is an increased movement within Housing Areas where items and packages are being transferred and delivered/dropped off, especially during the late hours of the night. Unless they are official (approved) delivery workers, its curious if they really are as they seem to mingle around the home and void decks for some time unlike deliveries who come and go quickly. Lastly, can the Straits Times or some authority, sticky or make consistent, a compilation of ALL the restrictions during this CB period as a one stop place of reference? Understand that restrictions have been made to address the varied areas of work, but I find many still are unsure, unaware, unknowing of most of these restrictions and how they effect normal day activities. As it is, the restrictions made and changed come and go inbetween headlines and posts. I believe alot are still very uninformed.","May 8, 2020"

1.01584E+16,Ronald Leng,"👍👍👍 Brilliant！  Measured, calibrated and community-driven.  There is no 1-size fit ALL.   The same measures that apply to dormitories cannot be applied everywhere.  There is no 100% testing daily or even hourly (to be sure).  It is normal sampling, tightened and relaxed sampling.  Skeptics and alarmists are helpful; they may be right at times.  Seriously  MOE, students should NOT be allowed back to school; education is lifelong - not essential and urgent services- but carry high risk of another super spreading cluster (pls CONSIDER- both for the child and educators; also family units themselves).  Plenty of collateral damage once students are allowed back to schools during this LAST MILE of the national CB.  Besides for unknown reasons, schools ban masks and ""discourage"" staffers from masking; up the COVID risk.  感恩！","May 3, 2020"
1.01584E+16,Victoria Ng,I agree with NOT reopening schools at all and to wear masks at all times. I prefer they just stick to the CB until 1 June and we all just rough it out for 1 more month and hopefully it'll bring the numbers down even further. Schools are a big NO NO for now.,"May 3, 2020"

As infection can take place thru the eyes, the wearing of goggles, shield or visor should also be mandated once the CB measures are gradually lifted. This must become the way of life until such time a vaccine becomes available. It is very important for everyone to have peace of mind that they are safe all the time so that they can focus on their jobs, education and life.  The going will get tougher for sometime more both in terms of safety from the virus and financial consequences that most would face. A complete mind set shift is needed going forward.","May 2, 2020"

I asked ambassador if nric is accepted for those who don't own smartphone or dunno how to scan and was told, can't use nric.  My concern now is, one will need a smartphone with data plan to scan qrcode for checking in.  Most that goes to wet market are seniors who are not tech savvy or low income families without a smartphone or data plan and also dunno or can't order groceries online.

Noticed that the Q was formed when shoppers Q  at different chain using individual barcode to scan or IC to enter.  We noticed that most stand alone supermarkets only have staff at the entrance asking shoppers for SafeEntry registration Check In and no assistance advice for Check out. When asked about the Check Out and we were told: “no need to Check Out”....  what about those elderly only enter by scanning IC?Hence, w/o Check Out, which mean we are in the outlet 24/7??? Best of all, the News mentioned that many shoppers did not “check out” after completed their shopping trips, that make the tracking very difficult for the tracking teams. Thus, is this SafeEntry app without Check Out really help in tracking???","May 10, 2020"

Good that the vast majority are young and robust and will recover very quickly. In normal terms, it take about 14 days to have a clear view of the infection.

1.01583E+16,Den Tan,Government task force please go and look at the recent BCA guidelines issued today 28th April 2020 forcing pet owners and residents taking a walk out onto public pavements and Parks to walk pets or exercise. This is going to cause major congestions on pathways in housing estates that are so narrow and only allow one person to walk pass at a time. How do you social distance with these ridiculous new measures.   It forces us out of the safety of our compound to add to the already crowded public areas? How is this logical? It’s also now putting us at unnecessary risk! I urge you to please look at these new guideline and do something about them as they are not practical. Condominiums should be able to exercise their own guidelines where rules like this are crazy and put residents in harms way unnecessarily. My dog is a puppy and was terrified to go on the street. We already try our best to be out quickly and come back but these rules force us to go further and so take longer times outside.   Please also check all BCA’s crazy guidelines that don’t make sense.

Am I on the right computation.  How long the incumbent authorities are going to isolate the migrant workers in the dorms in cramped quarters with movement control, won't the length of times in sort of movement control would put the mental and emotional health of the migrant workers to test.  Have the incumbent authorities show solicitudes for the workers.

It is really time to relook our employment and economic models to treat and pay those that really matter. Security guards, cleaners, hospital staff, transport people etc. We can see clearly now who are the essential people in our system. Stop increasing the top and start paying more to the bottom.

1.01583E+16,Calvin Koh,"Number  of  cases  all depends  on  how  test and  what number of test are being  done?  The  authority  do  not  even  reveal  this!  And how and what  methodologies are adopted captured  or  classified as  infected  cases  by the  authority.  Very  strangely,  now the  authority  dont  even bother to give  breakdown  and basic  information (as under Annex previously),  and not  even  local  singaporeans  (or  outside  dormitory)  cases!  Only a lame summary is provided. Why? Something  very  fishy to  me...  Based on my observation : Since April 20th, MOH no longer provide the full new infected case basic details, and instead provide a very simple 1 page summary instead. Why they don’t even provide Singaporean and local outside dormitory details and individual case numbers and I don’t understand how can there be (or unable to track) unlinked case? I don’t believe! Surely all person infected has to come from another infected person!  See how they changed and not providing case numbers and respective information (not even for as low as 10-20 local cases), and they now cannot even identifying any link or clusters, which sound very impossible to me.   If authority can ask the right questions (I can  help  teach  the  authority  if  they  dunno  what  questions  they  need to ask), I do not seem to see many of the possible or suspected or potential clusters being  identified  so far? ...

Thank you to all who made this possible. Your hard work and sacrifice clearly shows💜❤. Still, don't be complacent, don't let your guard down.👍😍","Apr 25, 2020"
1.01583E+16,Chan Kum Wah,"Indeed a very couraging piece of news. The CB is showing positive result. But lets not be overly complacent and starts celebrating too early. Still, it's going to be a long fight before we can get out of the woods safely. We have to achieve 28 straight days of ZERO case before we can declare ourselves clean. And that is not going to be walk in the park. One step at a time,  we certainly can overcome this crisis. Lets continue to be discipline and responsible. Stay Home by all means and wear our masks if we need to carry out our essential tasks out there.","Apr 25, 2020"
1.01583E+16,Paul Soh Chin Siang,So very happy to know that the numbers have come done. Thanks to doctors and medical staff and those working hard behind the scene that  brought about the good result. God bless you all. ,"Apr 25, 2020"
1.01583E+16,Duriz Boo,"Encouraging numbers. May I suggest sending everyone on Pulau Tekong home and housing the thousands of infected  there, away from Singapore? Our healthcare and essential workers will be comfortable in the officer quarters. Put a pause on military life since corporate and academic lives are currently also on hold.   And when our infected numbers go down to two or even single numbers, maintain the policy of wearing masks and safe distancing in public and public transportation for the remaining months of 2020. Let’s support each other and stay safe and sane together.","Apr 25, 2020"

1.01583E+16,Sebastian Chong,"New cluster can easily start again if not everyone is serious. HDB for one is not stopping people from moving house. In resale chain so long as one buyer insists of moving he can claim against his seller so the whole chain of buyer/seller have to move. Most families prefer to move after CB since you cannot do renovation and also is not safe to move... many people are forced to move during CB period. Imagine the danger imposed to the families, the mover and the community. If HDB is serious they could have imposed rule to push completion date after CB and that way they could have reduced the movement and help the fight. After the epidemic history will judge the poor handling by HDB for not being serious in helping the people. This is very sad.","Apr 25, 2020"

Pacific Healthcare Nursing Home (16 Apr 20) 4. Sunshine Welfare Action Mission (20 Apr 20) 5. Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital (21 Apr 20)  Despite measures such as suspension of all visitors from 2 Apr, 3 other nursing homes still had confirmed cases 2 weeks or later since 2 Apr - COVID-19's incubation period for majority of cases.  So I worry that the source(s) of infection might be from non-visitors.  Could the relevant authorities look into taking more proactive measures like what we are doing for the dormitories please? For example, extensive testing even for residents/employees with no symptoms and stricter enforcement of healthcare workers not to cross-cover more than a ward even if the wards are on the same floor? I think there is at least one home whose healthcare workers are still taking care of residents for 2 wards on the same floor, and I am unsure if they also rotate among other floors. As residents in nursing homes are much more vulnerable, even 1 confirmed case in a nursing home is very alarming. Thanks for your attention.","Apr 23, 2020"

Why are they instead of providing all the new daily infected cases and its breakdown, they no longer doing that? Many of  the  cases previously  just  either  merely  showed  pending, or  unlinked,  and nothing  on  the  local  infected clusters  or  work  place anymore!  I stand to be Corrected. Please correct me if I am wrong in this aspect.  Is there something that the authority is trying to hide from the public?  Also, I notice many of the local cases are even more vaguely accounted and detailed. The authority used to disclose the work place of the infected cases at the early beginning, when the figures are still low, and while WHO or some external party gave GOLD STANDARD and continue to praise the government.  I wonder why is it so different now? So many information seem missing or seem intended left out (to me)?  *Was it because of (an/or after) the 5050 vs 5573 and 623 vs 1146 discrepancies?  *And was it because of (and/or after) the accidental mistake of accidentally showing of (over-shot) case 5997, 5998, 5999, 6000, and 6042, 6043, 6046, 6048, and 6051, in one of the annex where the number of case declared for that day should suppose to stop at 5992 max only?  ***I wonder  why  they  stop  revealing  the local  infected cases work  place  etc  ... seem  like  trying  to  cover  or  protect  certain  people  or  group of people...  such as  those  potential  cluster   many expected etc  .... could  be  a  slap  in someone  faces  ...  maybe  they  choosing  to keep  secret  now?  If basic information is not provided or suddenly cut off, We would never know whether more child and student are infected, or more NS men are infected, or some people working beside or near you are infected ... something very very strange ...  What about all those possible clusters, women wings, BB mass dinner, ikea crowd, etc etc ...  And  school  clusters terms also.  Why  no  or  less transparency and so  secretive  now?  *actually  if you  look  at  all the  first  world  countries,  they will  all  agree  that  media  job is  to  monitor  and  check  on  the  government.  But in  Singapore why  i  feel  it‘s  (MSM)  there  to  praise  the  government?  *I wonder why no mainstream media dare even question about this?

I don’t seem to be able to locate the Annex that used to  provide and show the details of each and every new infected covid19 cases since 20th April 2020!  Both the Annex for the details of the press release and number mention are no longer available. I don’t seem to be bake to find it. Please show me where to find it if I had missed locating it.  Or Are things here REALLY getting from bad to worse?  Why is MOH no longer provide details of the new infected cases anymore?  Are they trying to be less transparent now?  Why are they instead of providing all the new daily infected cases and its breakdown, they no longer doing that? Many of  the  cases previously  just  either  merely  showed  pending, or  unlinked,  and nothing  on  the  local  infected clusters  or  work  place anymore!  I stand to be Corrected. Please correct me if I am wrong in this aspect.  Is there something that the authority is trying to hide from the public?  Also, I notice many of the local cases are even more vaguely accounted and detailed. The authority used to disclose the work place of the infected cases at the early beginning, when the figures are still low, and while WHO or some external party gave GOLD STANDARD and continue to praise the government.  I wonder why is it so different now? So many information seem missing or seem intended left out (to me)?  *Was it because of (an/or after) the 5050 vs 5573 and 623 vs 1146 discrepancies?  *And was it because of (and/or after) the accidental mistake of accidentally showing of (over-shot) case 5997, 5998, 5999, 6000, and 6042, 6043, 6046, 6048, and 6051, in one of the annex where the number of case declared for that day should suppose to stop at 5992 max only?

1.01583E+16,Wen Tian,"1. Everytime there is a tighter measure such as closure,  naturally there are people crowding for their last dine in meal,  disco night,  MacDonald, bubble tea or pet shop purchase.  These behaviour is triggered by anxiety and fear of loss in basic needs temporary. Unknowingly,  it allows covid-19 to breed among crowds as some carriers may pass to others unknowingly,  with no symptoms.   2. Incremental measures are hard to enforce as it takes time for the entire Singapor population to abide and comply.  A one time hard measures,  though painful can help shorten the circuit breaker period.   3. The trick to reduce crowds now at wet market is to extend operation hours,  mandate mask,  and to offer staggered hours of visiting in batches. In another word,  from 8 to 9am,  only say 100 people with IC scanned are allowed. The next 100 people on queue will have their IC scan and receive SMS to come only after 9am to 10am (2nd staggered timing). They are ask to go home if their slot is not ready.  Their turn will not be lost if they come within the designated staggered hours. No queue allowed. Each visitor can only visit market once a day.   4.This is easier than having even and odd IC last digit numbers as there could be many even numbers on the same day. One habit we all like to do is,  we do not mind queuing for hours for something.  Key message is to avoid queue.","Apr 22, 2020"

1.01583E+16,Unconventional Thinker,"I suspect that the high level of infections in dormitories are due to 1) infected workers touching door knobs and other non infected workers touching that same door knobs and 2)  nurses and medical workers and dormitory operators and police not being dressed in full medical hazmat suits when inside the dormitories and hence getting infected by the infected foreign workers and then coming back from dormitories after work , to their own home and passing on the virus to their family members and then spreading the virus to the community outside the dormitories and hence causing those unlinked cases ---------3) foreign infected workers who did not change their clothes everyday , due to lack of washing machine, which then cause the virus on the clothes to be transferred to other foreign non infected workers   4)  Foreign workers from different rooms going downstairs to collect food at same time and hence causing infections and virus to be transferred from workers in one room to workers in another room  ...........5) water taps and toilet bowls and solid surfaces in shower rooms and toilets which were not disinfected often so causing virus to be transferred from an infected worker to the a non infected worker who use the toilet later on .  6) Workers from one room chatting with workers from another room and during chatting, the saliva droplets transfer virus from an infected worker to a non infected worker. 7) Hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans and  permanent residents, who are overseas who have been encouraged by the Singapore government to all come back to Singapore from many heavily infected countries all over the world . During the plane flight back to Singapore, many of them got infected  by the virus but did not yet show any symptoms so were allowed to undergo home quarantine and while at home, many of them who were infected but did not yet show any symptoms, secretly sneaked out from home quarantine , and went to many different places, and infected many people in the community, causing the many unlinked cases. .........There are so many more other loop holes i can think of , which is causing the huge spike in cases of covid 19 in Singapore.","Apr 21, 2020"

Think if sg have also heed that by encouraging people to wear masks outside instead of just listening WHO who says only those who has symptom then wear masks. It came a bit late. This is very obvious and not rocket science. If not why doc wear masks then if they are well? Even usual flu cases people wear mask so as not to spread droplets.

1.01583E+16,Tan Kok Tim,"Where to house them, the not infected?     House them in cruise vessels?    What other solutions after using: empty hotel rooms, expo halls, Kallang Sports Hub, etc?   What else, what next should we do as we have dismissed the idea of building temporary hospitals within seven days?  ========  We have been told there are 43 super huge dorms.  Clean them up.  Empty one or two dorms first, thoroughly clean them up.   Cleaning cruise ships, hotels, halls, etc. will be costly too.  Let us send the healthy uninfected FWs back to the 'clean' dorms.   Use it, not let it half empty or half full, please.  How many rooms in each dorm? 1000 big rooms? Send in 200 cleaners to clean and disinfect one dorm in 5 days.","Apr 18, 2020"

1.01583E+16,Cj Local,"I find that exercising outdoors pose even more danger to others; if not wearing a mask. I think if we’re exercising, we should still put on a mask, and then control the level of intensity to suit our own endurance. Example, if I run 5km within 25mins without mask...then I can try to complete 3km in 25 mins or 5km in 40 mins. I think you can still achieve what you want to achieve.","Apr 17, 2020"

Esp those who walk alone and walk after 8pm where paths are empty. Those delivery boys cycling under hot air using mask. You want pple to die? Unless u feel its airborne but not declaring. My opinion if we are in a place with more then 5 or 10 and going for essential shopping use a mask. As long we exercise walk, brisk walk or vigrous no need mask. Common sense we need to breath fresh air.","Apr 17, 2020"

Especially for those who “ don’t exercise” when you run you run and you have sweat on your body [ and don’t use exercise as an excuse to do some leisure sight seeing of the whole city ] I most of the time make sure that my mask is attached to my Chin and put it on up to my nose when I know there group of runners come by... and then I open again..   Please bring spare dry masks if you run longer so you can use the fresh one when you enter the lifts and public area.   For some of us exercise is key to being healthy.  Some of us have problems with some of member of the house but can’t afford to get another housing for example they do need some space ... [ we never know ]   So please don’t judge others and be kind coz every house members fighting their own war .. I hope everyone can be kind to each other ..   I suffered from depression [ and I am still fighting with insomnia and anxiety ] and and it helps a lot to run... no one knows only yourself know ..

1.01583E+16,Calvin Koh,"First 1000 new cases in 70 days?  2nd 1000 new cases in about 8 days?  3rd 1000 new cases in about 4 day?  4th 1000 new cases in maybe 3 days  (about 2)!!!  Which part looks like the preventive and measures are working BEFORE they finally decided to close school and shut down work place? Which part look like what super multi-millions dollars club and team of leadership should produce?  §§§  saw  the  movie  “the  perfect  storm”, in  order  not  let go  the  fish  they  catch  and  can’t bear  to  let  go  the  harvest they  had  on  their  fishing  boat, not willing  to  let the  fish  they  catch  go  down the  drain,  the  captain  decide  to  take  the  risky  path  so that  they  could  try  to  save  the  fish they  caught  and gamble  the life  of  the   whole crew  and  sail  through  the  eye  of  the  hurricane!  The  end  result?  the  boat  did not  survive the  storm, and  the  boat  sink, and  all  the  crew  and  captain die  ....  Another good movie to catch if you like to understand about leadership and the similar situation like we dealing with covid19 virus pandemic now.  What did the captain choose and prioritize? Money or Crew Life?  Almost 3 and more weeks ago, When USA can cancel all NBA and all big games, and Europe can stop all the soccer games, and even 2020 Olympics had to be postponed until next year, know how much economic losses are these to these people and countries? But a responsible man should do what it is necessary to do when they have to do what is needed to save lives / reduce / minimize lives losses, and not just thinking so much on economic gain or how to get economic gain like getting and encouraging own people go for staycation to support hotel industry instead,  going to patron and visit and support own zoo, own parks, etc ... (in the middle of a deadly covid19 virus breakout or pandemic???) . What is the point of economic gain when lives are lost?! And Economic gain for who??? Are some people lives just so cheap???  The cancelling of all the big money spinning games, etc. That already show how serious the situation is and how it could be... (imagine if US and Europe don’t shut down all these earlier, the infection numbers would have been much higher). It is unfortunately that the cooler weather and society culture and mentality and way of lives played a part in the virus spreading more wilder in some parts of the world! Other/Some countries leaders should take this as a heed! Instead, there are still people watching the neighbours’ house burning， and adopted “wait and see attitude” but did nothing much but self praise ownselves, think it is okie that the own house is not on fire, so just watch, and don’t take decisive measures?   Why now U-turn about the mask but yet no apology to the many and hundreds and thousands (or maybe even more) of people infected?  Also, if more “aggressive” or more urgent and swift action made 4-6-8 weeks or earlier ago, then the virus wouldn’t be spreading like this now. Why for a long time, adopt a “wait and see attitude”  and trying “to have the cake and eat it”.   Know what’s 2 steps behind?  Also ... Know what happen when one started wrong footed? So now, are they trying to catch up for the lost time and imposing overkill measures making life so much difficult for so many normal people? Would this be necessary when initial steps and measures are good and done properly?  If virus can be stop spreading better at the beginning, then less people will be infected, and not to mention dying. Closing school early or earlier can prevent many children and students and teachers being infected!  We have yet to see how bad this virus pandemic can do to mankind and Singapore ... So never take things lightly or be stubborn and complacent and keep having and playing politics and trying to force an elections instead of focusing on dealing with the virus wholeheartedly (without prejudice on the selection and consultation of real talent and not nominating own people) to  fight a unprecedented virus!  Also, Another great classic example ... another know the story of titanic or watch the movie “titanic” based on the real event?  Know what happen to the passengers when the self claim best ship ever build sink?  Know what is the problem with 1 party group thinking? Know the meaning of “group think”? Try google this.  1 party system can pass any bills or laws they like... without obstruction or real contest ?  Btw, 1 party NK also claim no covid19 case in their country? ","Apr 16, 2020"

This gamble failed and the price to pay is a lot costlier than perhaps getting every Singapore residents to wear mask 2 months ago. It cost one approximately $30 a month to wear mask everyday. Now, circuit breaker resulted many business closed down. Many lost over hundreds or thousands of dollars per month of their income. A much heavier price the Singapore residents now have to pay. Also, the government should make up their mind on what policy to enforce. I am hearing changes and new restrictions every other day. Yesterday, not wearing mask is not an offense. Today, it cost $300 fine. How confusing it is with the sudden change. Those who  did not get this news update will be slap with $300 fine.

The amount of air intake required at this level of exertion is no less than that for slow jog. Here's my question:  Will I be fined for doing my brisk walk without wearing the mask?

Once these can be treated and contained, plus the locally transmitted cases can be controlled with all the more stringent enforcement, hopefully in coming weeks time by end of April, we can see positive outcome of the numbers of overall daily infected cases go down and the curve flatten.  These few weeks we are all in the same battle.  To add on, Wonder if people are ignorant or complacent.  Government has been doing what they have to do, it is now the society, right down to individual, to practice social responsibility... one such irresponsible act will trigger a massive and exhausting tracing process, which not only will put our system to stretch but also the society at risk. It is time we stand as One United, to deliberate through this trying period. Lifestyle changes so must our habits. Not a time to complain but cooperate.

Can the decision-making and communication be done as far as possible, in a decisive manner rather than in dribs and drabs, which confuses many elderly people and upsets them? The pandemic has already caused them enough turmoil as the elderly could be less adaptable and the constant change in policy is not helping. First, from no mask to mask in certain places and within a few days, mask everywhere. Please also launch some form of public education on how to wear and dispose of masks properly as many I have seen are not wearing or handling them properly, which is as bad as not wearing one. The execution of the strategy in its detail is important if we are to succeed in limiting the phenomenal increase in cases, especially amongst local unlinked cases. Thank you.","Apr 14, 2020"

I've never ever seen so many new joggers (look at their new shoes), runners, cyclists, families strolling, outdoor gym rats, outdoors yoga fanatics.

1.01583E+16,Eugene Sim,"My personal view on daily reporting of cases from each country...  Many questioned why Singapore daily report of cases is so high and fearful that it is out of control..  My own view, you can have your violent objection...is perfectly fine..  The daily swab tests in Singapore is very extensive..much more than other countries especially taiwan who everyday bullshiting their infected numbers. What goes up must come down.  Singapore is doing about 6,900 test per million a day comparing to Korea 6,500 and taiwan 1,000 test per million a day. However, many countries are using this to strategise their political position as well.  Every country is not accurate...either you report high or report low..Is just a number and you can easily manipulate this number. Singapore chooses to report high, many chooses to report low..the number might look good now but the country is very dangerous. Singapore's cases might look vert high now, but is the safest country on Earth as we are assured that all infected are not left out. Singapore is casting the net wide to do the best to catch those infected cases. Of course, the community spread from those without symptoms are there...but that is never alone for Singapore only...every country  is facing the same fate and Singapore contact tracing is still far better than any countries.  The number reported of 2, 3 per day from taiwan, 100 plus from Malaysia (discharging cases 200 plus daily). Vietnam 1, 2 cases...Persoanlly, these places are more scary. Whatever is the outcome, see who is capable to have the last laugh.   What we all can contribute now to the country is to stay calm, focus, be positive & be united. DO NOT criticize, panic, negative, finger-point and making lifes difficult for government agencies and all who are fighting the virus on the frontline.","Apr 14, 2020"

The numbers for the clusters linked to dormitories will continue to surge in coming days and hopefully level off after around 2,000 cases. If not, our healthcare system could start to be overwhelmed.  Hope there're new contingency plans for this in terms of both hardware (beds) and software (people).  Some countries offer early graduation for final year medical students to join front-lines.  We should also be watching the non-dormitory numbers to gauge the broader spread.

The  end  result?  the  boat  did not  survive the  storm, and  the  boat  sink, and  all  the  crew  and  captain die  ....  Another good movie to catch if you like to understand about leadership and the similar situation like we dealing with covid19 virus pandemic now.  What did the captain choose and prioritize? Money or Crew Life?  Almost 3 and more weeks ago, When USA can cancel all NBA and all big games, and Europe can stop all the soccer games, and even 2020 Olympics had to be postponed until next year, know how much economic losses are these to these people and countries? But a responsible man should do what it is necessary to do when they have to do what is needed to save lives / reduce / minimize lives losses, and not just thinking so much on economic gain or how to get economic gain like getting and encouraging own people go for staycation to support hotel industry instead,  going to patron and visit and support own zoo, own parks, etc ... (in the middle of a deadly covid19 virus breakout or pandemic???) . What is the point of economic gain when lives are lost?! And Economic gain for who??? Are some people lives just so cheap???  The cancelling of all the big money spinning games, etc. That already show how serious the situation is and how it could be... (imagine if US and Europe don’t shut down all these earlier, the infection numbers would have been much higher). It is unfortunately that the cooler weather and society culture and mentality and way of lives played a part in the virus spreading more wilder in some parts of the world! Other/Some countries leaders should take this as a heed! Instead, there are still people watching the neighbours’ house burning， and adopted “wait and see attitude” but did nothing much but self praise ownselves, think it is okie that the own house is not on fire, so just watch, and don’t take decisive measures?   Why now U-turn about the mask but yet no apology to the many and hundreds and thousands (or maybe even more) of people infected?  Also, if more “aggressive” or more urgent and swift action made 6-8 weeks or earlier ago, then the virus wouldn’t be spreading like this now. Why for a long time, adopt a “wait and see attitude”  and trying “to have the cake and eat it”.   Know what’s 2 steps behind?  Also ... Know what happen when one started wrong footed? So now, are they trying to catch up for the lost time and imposing overkill measures making life so much difficult for so many normal people? Would this be necessary when initial steps and measures are good and done properly?  If virus can be stop spreading better at the beginning, then less people will be infected, and not to mention dying. Closing school early or earlier can prevent many children and students and teachers being infected!  We have yet to see how bad this virus pandemic can do to mankind and Singapore ... So never take things lightly or be stubborn and complacent and keep having and playing politics and trying to force an elections instead of focusing on dealing with the virus wholeheartedly (without prejudice on the selection and consultation of real talent and not nominating own people) to  fight a unprecedented virus!

Even with the new law against social gathering in homes, they don’t obey. As long as transportation & food still run, people still think it’s ok to have friends over for mahjong! They sit so close to each other for hours, talk loudly (cos mahjong is a noisy game) and breathe in each other’s micro-sprays.

Instead,  We should  and we have to  plan  for worst  case  scenario!  How many ventilators do we have? and how many is stand-by for covid19?

This was after the previous day record high of 120 new cases and they announced at 5pm , compared to previous announcement timing of about 10pm and sometimes 7/8pm  today,  106  figures at 12pm?  No more  cases after  12noon onwards?  Why up till 11pm plus, still no announcement? And why yesterday announced so late around 11.30pm yesterday and yet no further increment of Numbers after the 66 cases number at 12pm?  As a typical and normal thinking person, or in my own limited understanding, I can only guess the follow possibilities :  1. Too big a figure to disclose, and need to seek higher instruction or approval to disclose? 2. Figure is too impossible to disclose without big reaction or repercussion from the public? Trying to think of a way to change or conceal or delay this, or anything to mitigate? 3. Or maybe think of a new strategy, might as well hide and don’t disclose to public anymore? 4. Or maybe someone famous kena, or a number of famous people kena?  I wonder why sometimes, it is announce at around 12noon (I think), sometime announce at around 5pm (just on 1st of April), sometimes at around 7pm (when they announce the record 120 new cases), sometimes at 10pm?

If they didn't isolate or quarantine themselves after returning from home trip or went on holidays during such a time, it's a selfish act n never think of the safety for others!

Even if there is to be full blown restrictions, many will still disobey and try their luck. No idea which part of this pandemic do they not understand. The fact that someone not showing symptoms can possibly infect another? The possibility of contracting pneumonia and being isolated in hospital hooked up to a ventilator to help you breath? The possibility that it can get critical and no loved ones can be with you? When all it takes is to stay home, only buy whats needed, keep a distance and come home immediately. Do the authorities have to detail everything out or even make it more strict to keep people at home? Just because last week they didnt wear a mask and nothing happened doesnt mean it cant this week. To these irresponsible people who are practically demoralizing the authorities, healthcare workers, putting them at more risk, having to chase after you, putting other citizens who want to be responsible at risk, is inappropriate. And then complain the Gov has no control? When no matter what is done, they still dont bother?

1.01583E+16,麻蒼葉,"I appreciate the efforts of the joint-ministries task force. A big thank you to all our medical, healthcare & other frontline staff (the police, contact tracing team & researchers etc.) who have helped Singapore in our fight against COVID-19.  The plans to manage the huge dormitory clusters are quite comprehensive but there is something more that can be done to halt the transmission of COVID-19 amongst the dormitory residents. Run more COVID-19 detection tests on all close contacts of current dormitory confirmed cases now, within capacity that our lab team can currently cope & run them now. Because simply confining the dormitory workers in their crammed dormitory will not prevent further COVID-19 transmission amongst the dormitory workers especially if they continue to stay together in the high density crammed conditions, now that we can almost be certain of  asymptomatic carriers who unintentionally infect others as they do not realized they are sick.  The bigger clusters is a result of dormitories having higher density   crammed. Enclosed space and closed proximity has remain the constant theme for transmission. It would be ideal if density at these dormitories are reduced significantly. But even doing so is not enough against insidious spread of COVID-19.  More can be done now to ""actively attack"" the virus transmissions at these dormitories, the top priority now is to identify & isolate any more potential infected carriers especially asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who may not realized they are carrier. Most men(which the bulk of these dormitories workers are, would probably have been more busy with their work at workplaces previously)& will tend to be less fastidious about COVID-19 prevention measures like safe distancing with others in dormitories & enhanced hygiene measures, so health officials may need to come out with programs to educate & emphasize to them the importance of personal hygiene(not touching face without thorough washing of hands with soap & water & after visiting toilets & before meals etc.)in their native languages for any who have difficulty comprehending English. Facilities owners will need to increase frequencies of toilet/bathing area cleaning at these dormitories as well.  With current developments of Singapore's own rapid test kits which we have been sharing with our neighboring countries, this is the time to ramp-up production of these accurate testing kits as there may now be a need to conduct more tests on any potentially infeyuuúcted dormitory  workers for early detection & isolation to prevent an even higher transmission numbers.  Contact Tracing/ Investigation Teams will need to work quickly to establish & identify any previous close contacts of current confirmed cases from the dormitories. We need to quickly mount a larger scale COVID-19 testing on these close contacts of the dormitories' confirmed cases. As many people may appear healthy now but they maybe rapidly infecting others. We need to be able to quickly identify & isolate any such persons from the crowded dormitories.  Please work out plans to test more of our dormitory  workers who had previous close contacts to current confirmed cases now.","Apr 6, 2020"

The 2nd one, was again small, though I can hook it on my ear, my ear began to hurt from the tightness within 30 seconds. It is unwearable. Therefore, my husband and I bought our own reusable mask from another local manufacturer that provides quality and comfort reusable masks that is tested to be good for 100 washes.  My point is, if we are truly gunning ahead for zero waste, then may I know where can I donate these 4 reusable masks that was issued by the government to us? It might not fit me well, but maybe someone else who needs it can use it.

Although a cloth mask is not as effective as a surgical mask, it’s still better than not wearing a mask.  HOWEVER, you need to soak the cloth mask in hot boiling water with detergent IMMEDIATELY upon returning. Then wash the mask thoroughly and disinfect it before reusing each time. Otherwise you are simply re-wearing a soiled dirty mask with the virus on it.  ‘...“A separate study, from 2015, casts additional doubt on homemade masks. In a randomized trial in Vietnam, healthcare workers who wore cloth masks acquired more respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses than their colleagues who wore surgical masks.   Lab tests showed that 97 percent of particles got through the cloth masks, compared to 44 percent with surgical masks.

I start with an example of A, B, C persons are washing hands and going out to buy essential needs. Let assume a person “D” a vegetable seller is infected with virus cells and throw him virus is spread to A B C again as a chain system. So the idea is very simple that government should announce a time over the country to wash the hands with sanitizer/soap, each and every person must participate on a particular time scheduled. Now hand to hand virus spread would stop completely as all peoples are washing hand simultaneously at same time. However Virus may rise again with already infected person sneezing, coughing or form the object he used earlier. For this concern, every individual must follow all W.H.O guidelines .By this a nation can control the pandemic around 90%, but one important thing to remember is washing hands must include wash of tap handle or anything which holds the incoming of water simultaneously, so that virus does not come again while turning off tap. I REPEAT AGAIN washing hands must include wash of tap handle or anything which holds the incoming of water simultaneously, so that virus does not come again while turning off tap, else the entire concept is of no-use as virus may come again while turning off the tap.

As the untraced cases community spread has increased if we dont want to go in a lock down soon rapid testing for covid is a MUST. E.g. S Korea has been doing drive through swab testing for months now. Why cant Singapore do it?  We all know that the virus shows only mild symptoms to start with but the victim can start spreading it already even during this period. So we cant afford anymore to wait for few days  for symptoms to get serious n then do testing just because we do not have adequate testing facilities.  We must quickly get to a level close to on demand or even drive through testing. Only then we could rapidly confirm an infection and isolate. Unlike today where we doctors wait for few days just by issueing an MC and leving a big question mark whether the person is already infected or not!

1.01582E+16,Eng Lee,"MOH  -  There is no need to keep looking at data - the government needs to look into the manufacturing of more masks for the population.   Definitely the “don’t wear a mask unless sick” cannot be advised anymore because there are infected ones who dont even know they are sick. Airborne transmission has already been conducted and shown to be possible Esp when face to face conversation at close quarters.  There should be a requirement for sales assistants and frontline staff or F&B staff to wear masks. Those taking public transport should also wear masks. Unless you are walking out in the open and just running a short errand without conversing with anyone, then maybe it’s ok not to mask because stocks are limited.  However, the government cannot keep using limited stocks as an excuse. Please look into having our own masks factory here.   Article: The director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control is advocating for people to wear masks to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.  People should continue to wear masks in the office, meeting rooms, lifts and on public transport*, even though *they don’t need to do so at home, in open air, or in an environment where there is good airflow and no crowds*.  This is because droplets and close contact transmit the virus, he said: “Droplets play a very important role – you’ve got to wear a mask, *because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth*.”  He added that because people may have the virus but be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, face masks help to prevent droplets that carry the virus from reaching and infecting others.”  https://mothership.sg/2020/03/not-wearing-mask-mistake/","Apr 2, 2020"

1.01582E+16,Joseph Tan,"Higher viral-load often leads to greater disease severity, and greater infectiousness in the infected!  Even at home, it helps to maintain distance, ventilation, etc. .  Distancing measures etc. don't only help reduce chances of infection. They might also reduce severity of infection if infected!  Also, this article supports my theory (posted earlier) that the coronavirus, having started out with mild/undetected community transmission, could gradually become increasingly severe, due to factors that lead to increasingly-greater viral-loads from continual transmissions.  Thus, it is important to test as many people as possible, even those with the mildest of symptoms. Or else we end up with possibly what's currently happening in Singapore - the severe cases were eliminated at the start, but the mild/undetected cases carried on seeding other mild/undetected cases, such that severe cases start to emerge again, with a bigger wave of detected cases than the first time round, due to exponential transmission.  (Recently, a friend had both fever and cough but was not referred for testing. Furthermore, Singapore appears to not test anyone that recovers within the 5-day sick-leave period. Thus, many of these might be the mild cases that are being missed, and which contact-tracing isn't implemented to ring-fence the virus. And contact-tracing would often start very late, due to the 5-day delay.)  https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/how-does-the-coronavirus-behave-inside-a-patient","Apr 1, 2020"

1.01582E+16,Danny Hoo,"Have we considered the possible spreading in our sardine-packed MRT/buses. No amount of social distancing elsewhere is going to help if the trains/buses are so crowded. While we may expect the sick to put on a mask, many may not - especially if they are asymptomatic. And it would only take a small number of such people to spread in a confined space. I wouldn't be surprised if many of the unlink cases caught them in our MRT/buses.","Mar 31, 2020"

Do we know why a single virus from the Unseen can do so much chaos and damage in the lives of humankind, bringing this earth to a standstill, lockdown, impasse, dead end, deadlock?    Why it appears in this 21st century?   Why the 21st?  Do we know why?  If we don't, we are missing the wood for the trees and many due to ego, arrogance, greed, and lust.  Humans can be beaten to a pulp.    I now know how human can become pulp.  It was difficult for me to believe or picture the scenario back then some 25 years ago when I first heard of it.    Now, I know how a single virus can bring it about and as simple as that.  So effortlessly.  We cannot offer enough sorry prayers of apologies to the Unseen realm and to the animal kingdom for we know not what we collectively as the human race has done causing tremendous damage, some irreversible and some unpardonable.","Apr 1, 2020"

When planes are not flying, hotels empty, airports lights off, banks in limbo, financial institutions in uncertainty, and factories not producing, will it bring about a total collapse of this modern world ending materialism?  Will it lead to severe food shortage and famines?  Will it lead to worldwide stock markets and property markets collapse?

Will it lead to many people facing bankruptcy, suffering chronic depression, having suicidal tendencies, and hopelessly no future, and no hope of salvation?","Apr 1, 2020"

In hawker centers, people should be advised to takeaway their food (in own containers pls) and queue numbers be given rather than people waiting in line. The crux of issue is to stop people from hanging out too long in same spot and reducing chance of infection!

The reports seem limited and many are curiously worried to know their locations or at least if these cases, imported or unlinked, were serving home orders or SHN prior to onset of symptoms and/or confirmed test results. Some parents have chosen, by will, to remove their children from school for the fear of a uncontrollable community spread even though it was said that it is safe there. The worry grows and all we need is some light shed on the community spread and more indicative details on these daily case updates. It leaves much to the imagination and many cannot help but fear even more, questioning the measures that are in place. Understandably, with the larger daily case numbers, detailed reporting by the media will take some time, however members of public are wanting more detailed affirmation if the community of Singapore is safe to walk around in.","Mar 26, 2020"

As it is now, these kids would be placed under some student care groups after school, and with the closing of schools, these student care groups would also be closed - no difference from keeping schools open if only the student care facilities are left open and the children with working parents brought and left in the student care. Can those who insisted that schools be closed give suggestions how to take care of these kids? Leave them all alone at home by themselves while the parents go to work?

When loved ones are removed from your home by ambulance because the virus has hit them hard, you are not going to be able to follow them there, sit by their hospital bed and hold their hand. You are not going to be able to pop in at 7.00 pm for visiting hours. They are going to have no one other than exhausted and brave hospital staff to see them through days or weeks of barely breathing through a ventilator until they either die or recover. They are not going to be well enough to text you.  You are not going to be able to phone the ward to check in on them regularly (staff will be too busy for that). During that time, they will be completely alone, while you sit at home waiting to hear whether they have made it through.  Imagine that person is someone you love dearly. Because it's going to be a reality for many in the coming weeks.

1.01582E+16,Quinn Wong,"I have been against Singapore lock down since Jan, but now it is a good timing to lock down already: 1- sg already locked from outside and imported cases are limited to the existing ones now 2- sg already has wide local transmission now, just a matter of testing, if you test more you will identify 5 times 10 times of current reported cases judging from the situation in US UK two weeks ago and now 3. More and more daily untraceable cases 4. By locking outside we limit the number of imported cases, then lockdown from inside for two weeks we can identify most of the internal local cases, which makes the Lockdown more effective 5. If we locked down in Jan it was not sustainable, but now it is necessary and the correct timing for a lock down. We can choose to proactively lock down now, but if we don't do now and wait for it to slowly lose control and forced to lock down later then the situation will be difficult.   The only way to fight with this virus is Quarantine and Isolation!","Mar 25, 2020"

1.01582E+16,Joseph Tan,"I have this theory:  People who get exposed to low viral loads will tend to have mild/unperceived illness, and these people tend not to present themselves for testing. These mild/unperceived cases will then lead to further mild cases, until cumulative transmissions lead to cases that are more and more severe, due to factors like increased exposure, and weaker immune systems.  Adolescents in China mostly had milder illness because they rarely spend quality time with their adult parents, where severe illnesses were concentrated. However, preschoolers tend to spend more quality time being nurtured/pampered by adult parents, thus in general they got more severe illness than the adolescents.  However, in USA where there had been plenty of time for the virus to propagate among the adolescents unimpeded, even large groups of adolescents have developed severe illness, especially with the copious amount of quality time adolescents spend with each other in large groups. So in USA, the rate of severe illness among adolescents is much more significant than that in China.  Perhaps this would be the way to eliminate the virus (without vaccination):  People need to have non-overlapping (and preferably small) social circles, and not get into situations such as on public transport where the virus can migrate between these groups, so that the viruses in each of the mutually-exclusive groups can die out, before the viruses can migrate elsewhere to begin their life-cycles anew.   Then, only until testing has cleared each of these groups, can they be allowed back into the community. (The people administering the tests need to have 0 chance of being/becoming infected, and the tests need to be 100% reliable.)  Or sufficient time has elapsed such that the viruses would be guaranteed to have died out in each group.","Mar 26, 2020"

When loved ones are removed from your home by ambulance because the virus has hit them hard, you are not going to be able to follow them there, sit by their hospital bed and hold their hand. You are not going to be able to pop in at 7.00 pm for visiting hours. They are going to have no one other than exhausted and brave hospital staff to see them through days or weeks of barely breathing through a ventilator until they either die or recover. They are not going to be well enough to text you.  You are not going to be able to phone the ward to check in on them regularly (staff will be too busy for that). During that time, they will be completely alone, while you sit at home waiting to hear whether they have made it through.  Imagine that person is someone you love dearly. Because it's going to be a reality for many in the coming weeks.

More and more daily untraceable cases 4. By locking outside we limit the number of imported cases, then lockdown from inside for two weeks we can identify most of the internal local cases, which makes the Lockdown more effective 5. If we locked down in Jan it was not sustainable, but now it is necessary and the correct timing for a lock down.

While staggered hours may reduce the volume,  commuters are equally exposed not just to 10 other commuters but more.   2. Government may impose a hard 1 month movement restriction only to allow essential travel to clinic, hospital  supermarket, hawker center,  food court,  cafe, restaurant and police station. All work and school to be suspended for a month,  just like what Wuhan did in January.  Companies are encouraged to use telecommute for communication.   3. Shorten the operating hours of trains and buses on weekends and Friday to end at 11pm or earlier ,  to discourage commuters from staying out late. This is also a good chance for SMRT maintenance staff more time for repair work. Delay morning operating hours for train on weekend only at 7am.   4. Further reduce the number from 10 pax to 2 pax,  to drastically cut down  human contact. After a month,  we may break the virus chain.  The process is hard but necessary.","Mar 24, 2020"

For example, Sparkletots make use of the hdb facilities & playground for such outdoor activities.   if CCA and excursions are cancelled, why are the children still allowed outside of the childcare premises?  if visitors are restricted from entering the childcare premises, why are we still allowing the children to be exposed outside of the childcare premises?  how can u ensure that the public playground and equipment are not contaminated before the children play? children wlll touch the surfaces then touch their faces unknowingly when playing.   nowadays some playground are no longer made of just steel and plastics which can be are easily cleaned & disinfected. what about those creatively made with the wooden parts and other materials? and how do you make sure socially irresponsible people do not cough & sneeze purposely at these children who plays in the public? there are a lot of sick-minded people around you know.  of course some sun, exercises and natural vitamins are good for the children, but in the public? risking exposing them to the virus which can viable in the air for at least 3 hrs and on surfaces for up to 1 day. sure, heat kills the virus but at least 60 degrees of it. that’s not how hot the morning sun is. so really? you call this safe for the children?  we parents try so hard to keep our children safe at home and you allow the childcare centre to bring them out with no precautionary measures set in place?  for centers which do not have the facilities and equipment within their premises, outdoor play should be suspended.","Mar 23, 2020"

1.01582E+16,Sumalatha Videm,Can you please Talk about Children??! I am glad So far we are in better position in the world than many other Developed Countries.. But Take a minute and think are we being Over confident??! What if our confidence doesn't work out ?! Seeing The World Struggle... Seriously I want you to rethink once...  Do we really need to live Normal now and Risk our lives?! Isn't Disruption is better than loosing Lives? Why there is a need to open Schools?! Isn't it prevention is better than Cure...?! Ofcourse no one Guarrentee anything... but at least We should do The maximum so that we don't end up Giving more pressure to HEALTH care professionals ... Even after almost 2 months of 1st case we are still seeing new clusters ..The numbers might be low... But still we didn't flatten the Local Curve.and..Just that we are able to track doesn't mean That we are in safe position.. isn't it?! What if The virus is mutated and The one Now we are seeing is More dangerous one??! Aren't we being so selfish by risking Innocent children Life's? Also Many young children are having existing Health issues like Asthma.. Bronchitis etc Why not at least give Option for People who wants to opt for E Learning!?  How much of social(physical) DISTANCING measures are We able to implement in Public buses and MRTs also in schools? Aren't each school has more than 250 Pupils? And All dismissal and arrival at same time? Aren't many parents and grandparents Dropping off and Picking up Children at same timings?  ((What about the children taking Public Transport?!)))  Doesn't we have Very good E learning technologies available which We can easily utilise in this crisis? Finally if you are really confident about the Situation please let us know What sort of treatment is available and how much and how many medical supplies we have (surplus) ...?! Also How many Critical cases at one Time MOH can easily handle?!  (Because After explaining about National Stock pile of food supplies... Many people stopped worrying about food ...including me).. Same way give us more Information at least then we won't worry much ..and we will also feel confident... (Because Looking at the world numbers I Am much worried ..and getting a feel that this virus is Sneaky and Scary and not going to Spare any one or any country)  Please give us More assurance...Thank you,"Mar 22, 2020"

So let's do our part (the citizens of Wuhan have proven how thru strict discipline of lockdown albeit thru draconian rulings, positive results have emerged to everybody's admiration). As Singaporeans, we can stand to be different - let us all exercise self-discipline to faithfully observe the 'dos...' and 'do not.…'   Let the number of Covid-19 cases plateau so that everyone can resume normal daily living more quickly by ending this pandemic.

1.01582E+16,Mike Chu,"Please start mass producing test kits, buy them or whatever it takes and afterwards do a mandatory 100 percent check on everyone. The borders are secured so those coming in can be identified via 14 days self isolation or even get tested at the airport (there is a 15 test kit available). Make them take the test coming in or before they board. Testing, testing, testing! That comes before contract tracing, isolation, quarantine etc. Korea has proven it works. It will take a lot of logistics, planning and execution (procurement, labs ready, coordination to get tested etc)but it is the most cost effective way to identify who has the virus and subsequently isolate and treat them. Then do continuous random testing for households or free testing spots! This might require a temporary lockdown if necessary, but don’t need to go through what China did in 8 weeks. We can fast track this process of burying of any potential untraceable clusters expeditiously. This will be proactive whereas contract tracing is reactive. This virus thrives on the 1-2 weeks lag.

New arrival to Singapore may be asymptomatic who may already been infected. These group of personnel may take public transport from airport to home. While staying home may infect his/her family members. Worst if the family members consist of of infant and elderly. May I humbly suggest to setup temporary quarantine centers.

So that the park will not be overcrowded 2) Temp scanner with someone actually looking at the screen  3) Patrons are to be seated on alternate rows on the tram.  4) Encourage patrons seated in the amphitheatre to exercise social distancing  which most of the patrons comply.  Singapore Zoo did just the opposite.  1) The Zoo was packed with people today.  2) Instead of social distancing, the staff at the tram station put elderly lady with her coughing granddaughter sat next to me in order to fill up all the seats.  3) Children and adults are still playing at the water play.

I would imagine the pen itself would be one of the key vectors for transmission since everyone uses it. Yes, there was a bottle of sanitiser but I imagine not everyone used it.

Perhaps the younger age groups who are infected are either not self-isolating and not visiting GPs as symptoms are too mild, or are seemingly asymptomatic.  Also, perhaps it's time to do sampling / serological testing among children who mix around with each other in church or neighbourhood communities?  Start with the communities of children of families with confirmed cases? They could be the ones insidiously providing the bridges for the virus between schools/communities/households. And while very mildly or asymptomatic, infecting the parents/grand-parents at home, thus producing unlinked cases.  Perhaps we need to be really strict about restricting children's social activities to only their immediate classmates, or even better, only a fixed cluster of a few classmates, so that we can avoid school closures, yet prevent children from being serious propagators of the virus.  Have packed meals to be consumed in classrooms instead of in canteens where children are closely packed in queues and freely mingle around.  No time to waste!","Mar 19, 2020"

1.01582E+16,Wen Tian,"1. To contain the number of imported case,  to safeguard our limited healthcare resources,  we need to be firm to suffer short term loss and inconvenience.  Being a small country with limited ICU,  hospitals and healthcare workers,  we cannot be at the service for the world, nursing imported cases. This is a good move.   2. If such move is made a month earlier,  things will be better.  However,  it is never too late to impose harsh measure now to contain it.  We know the cases will continue to spike to a few more hundreds in months to come and Singaporeans will be uneasy not able to travel.   3. Travel agencies will be worst hit with high operating cost and some smaller agencies force to end business. These are short term sacrifices to make for long term solution and total eradication of covid-19 spread.    4. More stringent measures can include closing or shortening working hours of non essential large gathering place such as pub, KTV,  cinema,  spa,  and large scale events,  encouraging non facing clients to work from home at least for next 60 days.  5. Too many resources,  effort and time are spent tracing suspected cases. There are other serious crimes to be solved,  national security issue to guard upon.  We cannot lose sight on any of them.   6. Old rules apply. Despite all the measures,  seeking everyone to be socially responsible to stay out if unwell,  maintain personal hygiene,  wash hands before meals and after meals, build up stamina by exercising outdoor,  cut down on mass gathering,  and return tray after meal outside.  This is all we can do now,  instead of getting disturbed on new cases reported daily.  Most importantly,  inject confidence not fear in our community.","Mar 15, 2020"

Please clarify what if travellers from the listed countries choose to use Malaysia as a stepping stone to enter Singapore by land and sea. Will they be exempted from the 14 days SHN?  Secondly, how does the 14 days SHN discourage Asean's travellers from seeking medical treatment here when they are allowed to come in even though they are required to serve a 14 days SHN? This does not help to reserve our medical facilities for Singaporeans since they are allowed to seek medical treatment once they are here.","Mar 15, 2020"

If stopping traveling is not feasible now, please consider to extend the travel restrictions to whole of Europe.  After Italy has the outbreak,  it quickly spread to the rest of Europe.

1.01582E+16,Wen Tian,"1. This covid-19 is here to stay for a year or more as we know. To avoid large gathering,  this includes creative ways to organise national event or festive events such as National Day Parade,  National Day Ralley,  carnivals,  count down year end party,  mid year Singapore Sale,  and multiple exhibitions (IT fair, food fair,  baby fair,  book fair, NATAS, and etc).   2. For all above events,  it is hard to reduce it to 250 pax per session. If we are to proceed above 250 pax with preventive measures,  any unexpected clusters may trigger more infection and new cases. We are living in a crowded space,  not likely to keep 1 meter apart wherever we go. In trains,  buses during peak hours,  if we can have a 20cm distance parameter,  we are lucky.    3. Major events will hit many vendors hard due to repeated reschedule and low turn out rate. and PA  needs new ways to ensure community activities are not compromise or limited just to digital platform. Brisk walking,  block party,  National Day Dinner celebration usually hit more than 250 pax per session at GRC level.   4. A working committee should be set up at governmental level to look beyond short term with industry MICE key stakeholders on ways to draw crowds to keep business as usual. Rebate on business cost is not long term solution.   5. On hygiene part,  repeated message on hawker centers to broadcast and remind all patrons to return their tray after use,  wash hands frequently before and after meal,  and sneeze with tissue are relatively effective than just social distancing.  Even without social distancing,  if we are socially responsible to wash hands,  wear mask when sick,  return tray after use,  we can minimise the risk.","Mar 14, 2020"

1.01582E+16,Conrad Li,"Our containment measures are pretty effective in flattening the curve.  The main areas we should focus on now are: 1. Getting unwell people to wear masks when they need to go out, e.g. to see doctor. Now, there is a social stigma against wearing masks and those who are unwell felt pressurized not to wear. They get odd stares, they get laughed at, they get criticized.  That's why many of us see unmasked people coughing/sneezing in clinics, in MRT and at workplace.  2. Employers should be educated and encouraged not to ""force"" their employees to come to work with mild symptoms. https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/going-to-work-sick-social-norm-in-singapore-needs-to-be-discouraged-experts  3. Organisations should scale down, cancel or defer non-essential large -scale events even if the events cater to the younger crowd.  While younger folks are less likely to have severe symptoms and die from the disease, they can still spread the virus to old and vulnerable.  This is especially when the current screening measures are ""not foolproof"" and as illustrated at SAFRA Jurong, ineffective to identify potentially infected with symptoms.","Mar 13, 2020"

Perhaps Singapore could consider similar measures, that would minimise the risk of imported cases leading to subsequent local transmission, and sabotaging our local containment/mitigation efforts?  Also, can Singapore create a mobile app where people can opt-in to allow precise-tracking of their movements? This would allow efficient contact-tracing and quarantining of at-risk individuals. Hopefully everyone will opt-in (unless we want to make it mandatory). Also provide in the app a function for recording of key details like times/dates of onset of various symptoms.  In recent days, unlinked cases have been emerging consistently. Perhaps with better contact-tracing enhanced by technology, we'd be able to eliminate the virus from local circulation, and swiftly contain any outbreak caused by imported cases too.  This way, we can increase the likelihood that we will never come to a point where we would need to step-up social-distancing to catch-up with a runaway outbreak that we failed to prevent.","Mar 11, 2020"

1.01581E+16,Joseph Tan,"Evidently, the problem of symptomatic people carrying-on with their social activities, is the no.1 priority to tackle.  1. Perhaps we need to give people a concrete number for the fatality rate - 3.4% as provided by WHO.  Don't worry about it being an overestimate when the current problem we have is of people underestimating it.   Many people are just going to round down to 0% in their minds, if authorities aren't making any stand on concrete figures of disease severity.  Besides, we're already not informing the public of the potential long-term complications even for coronavirus survivors (death is not the only concern).  2. Perhaps it is time to clarify that Short-Range Airborne transmission is in fact a likely transmission mechanism (which is what some evidence from SARS and especially MERS, indicate).  Or else, people would reasonably think that it's not important to self-isolate when ill, as long as droplet/contact precautions are taken.  ""It's so easy not to cough and sneeze on each other, and to clean hands before meals, and to avoid anyhow touching things or our own faces.""  Besides, it's been reported that in many cases of transmission, people did not appear to be symptomatically coughing or sneezing. Even in the recent SAFRA Jurong incident.  Also, people might touch their faces, but how often do they actually touch the membranes at their eyes, in their noses, or on their mouths? I'm sure the answer in many people's minds are: ""almost never"".  3.

Perhaps it would be better if you could be more specific for the Travel Advisory to Japan like what you previously advised for Korea - Daegu, Cheongdo-gun and Northen Italy. Because in the regions of Japan, it is just Hokkaido that has more cases compared to other parts of Japan. It is not fair to just include the whole Japan when you could be specific for other countries. We are travelling to Osaka on 20th and it currently has only 4 cases. How do we heed your advice convincingly? Not to forget that there are numbers that were probably imported from Diamond Princess Cruise.","Mar 4, 2020"

However I was charge full consultation and medicine at $173.30. The doctor told me he will judge if I’m eligible to the subsided rate of $10. In the end he said I’m not eligible as I need to have all 4 symptoms fever, cough, running nose and sore throat in order to get the subsided rate. Mentioned my fever was not due to Covid19. In your video, you mentioned that if one have any one of the symptom, as singaporean will get subsided rate. Therefore I felt super unfair regarding this matter for been socially responsible for nothing and I may be paying lesser if I go Hospital A&E straight. I really hope someone can help this matter.

The slower the measures are enforced, the more lives will be sacrificed. For thw whole week, we got much more new cases than discharged ones, a very bad sign. And shopping malls still full of people dining face to face, with quite some coughing without a mask!! ","Mar 11, 2020"

1.01581E+16,Quinn Wong,"Europe or US definitely won't take same strict measures of lock down coz to them so called freedom (or economy) is very important. With only few imported cases and existing lessons of China you c wats the situation in Europe now. Btw Japan Italy US etc in all these countries it is not so easy for even those with travel exposure n with fever to get tested so the reported number is way underestimated. Sg cant ban everyone. Just hope authorities can release some regulations asking those back from Europe Iran Japan Korea etc self quarantine at home for 14 days. MNCs can ask their staff back from those places work from home for two weeks. We need to decide asap. Else with the central aircon we will just have more and more new clueless clusters. If rest of the world don't make an effort to contain the virus and if covid-19 infects as many as or even more than H1N1, then we really can only rely on luck loh. Coz 80% of the infected are with mild symptoms. 20% serious condition and 3-4% fatality rate.. While this fatality rate is provided that medical resources are not stretched.

Have you started your production or finding ways to start producing this items. Everyday talking about the control is pointless where basics cannot be fulfilled. China can erect a hospital within days, is it that hard to produce the mask n sanitiser. Few steps had been circulating by nations in fb to temporary close the schools etc which may help in the transmission n infections but this wasn't implemented. Is this your reasons to test whether kids can get infected easily because most cases are adults and old folks. Your move is useless. The employers n employees have started to suffer due to this illness/crisis. In no time will start no pay as productive stop/slow down. Employees will have difficult times with no salaries for the daily nd ends meet and etc. Are there any specific ways to help them out if this happens. What plans do you have?

If you take Vitamin C tablets (for chewing/sucking, or the effervescence type, then have to replenish every 4 hours). Can also take Vitamin D3, Zinc and Selenium which are also important for a strong immune system. [I have not been to the doctor anymore for 16 yrs ever since using this method.

The three individuals were among 206 passengers who returned to Japan on Wednesday on a government-chartered flight.  A man in his 40s and a woman in her 50s do not have any signs of infection, but they have tested positive.  Another man in his 50s reported pain in his throat and later developed a fever before testing positive.  The number of people in Japan who've been infected now stands at 11.

If I wear one in crowded places & public transport to protect myself from the potential bugs in the air, will people think I'm the one who is sick (since I'm wearing a mask) & ostracise me instead?  If you do not want people to mis-use the FOUR PRECIOUS SURGICAL MASKS PER HOUSEHOLD you are dishing out now, you can tell people to USE THOSE 4 MASKS only when they are sick cos those 4 masks are meant to be used that way.  Please do not dish out such generic advisory to make it sound like it is wrong to wear mask if well.  It can potentially mislead the ignorant in the public to think anyone wearing a mask must be sick.  Such advisory just serves to further stigmatise mask-wearing & promote wrong behaviors.

It means, they need more proof. And if people stopped from travelling, started using mask, or other preventative things, where/how they can finalise their findings?  Just like this interview says:  Q: Is shutting borders the answer to containing the spread of the virus?  A: “If countries just shut down during disease outbreaks, as happened in west Africa with Ebola, that can make things much worse. During that outbreak, the country struggled, WHO couldn’t get their people in, they couldn’t get biological samples out. The economic impact of being shut off made things worse.

MPs and government don’t take mrt everyday to get to work so honestly you all don’t understand.  Wearing a mask is uncomfortable but why do you think they are being snapped up?   It’s annoying to keep hearing our leaders say only wear if you are unwell. If you encounter what normal citizens have to face daily with sick ppl sneezing and coughing in the mrt carriages, then you won’t keep telling us only wear if we are unwell.   If we dont wear, we will most definitely become unwell. Can you blame citizens for accusing the leaders for sitting in their ivory towers and not understanding the problems healthy ones are facing in the trains?  In these circumstances, the way to stay healthy IS to wear a mask.","Jan 31, 2020"

It's the children, the elderly folks, and those with an already compromised immunity in our families.  Apparently, the system has so far failed to detect the asymptomatic but already infected Wuhan residents who managed to roam freely in our public places using our public transport, putting the public, especially those who work at the front-line, at unnecessary risk.   Personally, i am concerned about how robust the system really is.  Even with the help of contact tracing ( which is both time- and resources-consuming) in the aftermath, how likely is it able to get hold of all those who have been in close contact for reasonable amount of time with the infected persons?  And then, by quarantining these close contacts, how much inconvenience it would cause them, their families and their employers ( or industries)? For them, it could translate to loss of income/ manpower, and/or increased medical bills. Who is going to compensate for these?  In a nutshell, isn't prevention better than cure?","Jan 28, 2020"

If something happens to her (mum) - my friend is not able to come back because she no longer holds a Spore passport and because of the current travel restrictions she will not be allowed in.

It happens everywhere too.   The numbers are relatively small. We are a free country. You don’t have to sneak out secretly. You can openly declare that you’re leaving for good by renouncing your citizenship.   Most Singapore-born citizens though prefer to stay. This is our land, our home. All our family and friends are here.   Why would we want to be considered as migrants or second class residents in other countries.   Even the worst amongst us will still have a place here. No one can tell you to go back to your country. The government of the day still have to take care of you. That’s your citizen’s right. You can’t be deported at the whims and fancies of the State.
