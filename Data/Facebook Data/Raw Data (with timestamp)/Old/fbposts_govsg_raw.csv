Vaccination for seniors have begun with pilots in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar, and more vaccination centres will be set up so that all seniors can conveniently receive their vaccinations.

Halimah Yacob
27 January at 18:20 Â·

I was at the Outram Polyclinic this afternoon to get my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The process was quick, simple and not painful at all. I also talked to several seniors who had received their jabs and they gave the same feedback. They shared that it was easy to register either at the community centre or online.

I want to encourage our seniors to quickly go for their vaccinations to protect themselves as older people are more vulnerable to COVID-19. I hope that family members will assist their parents and grandparents to go for their jabs.

The Government has made vaccinations free and very accessible with vaccination centres located near peopleâ€™s homes and polyclinics, and it only requires a little effort from ourselves. Letâ€™s together build a stronger immunity for ourselves.

Lee Hsien Loong is at Singapore General Hospital.
8 January at 12:40 Â· Singapore Â·

Got my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine today, together with Director of Medical Services A/Prof Kenneth Mak. We got vaccinated early to show Singaporeans we are confident that the vaccine is safe and effective.

Prof Mak and I were monitored for 30 minutes after the jab, just in case we developed any side effects, e.g. allergic reactions. Happy to report that we both felt fine.

Today we started vaccinating healthcare workers from public healthcare institutions. We aim to start vaccinating elderly people from February, and then other Singaporeans and long-term residents.

Vaccinations are voluntary, but I hope that when itâ€™s your turn, you will go for it. It will be free, it will protect you and your family, and it will help keep everyone safe. â€“ LHL

Lee Hsien Loong posted a video to the playlist Speeches.
18 December 2020 at 11:01 Â·

The COVID-19 outbreak in our migrant workers dorms took a tremendous combined effort â€“ by government agencies, healthcare workers, dorm operators, private sector organisations, and not least the workers themselves â€“ to bring under control. The situation is now stabilised and Iâ€™m happy to see that all our migrant workers are healthy and safe.

Today is International Migrants Day, an apt reminder to thank migrant workers for their contributions to our nation. You have endured a difficult period. As we enter Phase 3, more restrictions will be eased, and workers will be able to enjoy more communal activities. Workers will also be offered the vaccine, with more details to be announced.

We will continue to care for our migrant workers, just as we care for Singaporeans. Let us continue to work together to keep one another safe.

16 December 2020 at 13:56 Â·

2020 has been a tough year, and the economic impact of COVID-19 will likely be felt for some time to come. We are introducing the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) in January next year, to provide targeted support to lower- to middle-income employees and self-employed persons who are financially impacted by COVID-19, and have lesser financial means and family support, while they search for new jobs or training opportunities.

Applications will open on 18 Jan 2021. Successful applicants will receive up to $700 (for job loss or involuntary no-pay-leave) or $500 (for income loss) per month for 3 months.

Learn more about the CRG through these infographics or visit go.gov.sg/CRG. Please share this with someone who may benefit from the Grant.

[Flying our National Flag ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬]

There are few sights as stirring and revealing of our national pride and solidarity as the display of the Singapore flag outside our homes. Itâ€™s an expression of love and a symbol of our national values (plus, a reminder that National Day is approaching!)

Thereâ€™s been some concern raised after certain media reported that those who continue to fly the flags after Sep 30 will be fined. Let me assure you: as far as I know, no one has ever been fined for this, nor do we plan to do so.

But in cases of deliberate disrespect against the flag in any way, we will of course take action. These rules are meant to safeguard the dignity of our flag. Thereâ€™s no reason to â€œpunishâ€ those who treat it with respect and dignity, and are proud to showcase the Singapore spirit. Patriotism is not just a right, itâ€™s simply right.

The Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem (â€œSAFNAâ€) Act which governs the use of the national flag has been in place since 1959. We amended the legislation in 2007 to allow us to display it from our homes from 1 Jul to 30 Sep - and following public feedback, did a one-time extension this year to start from 25 April as a unifying symbol during COVID-19.

Unrelated to the recent news, MCCY had already initiated a review of SAFNA to look at a number of issues, including to allow more occasions on which our flags can be displayed, while always protecting its dignity from extended display or neglect. Please share your suggestions on how we can continue to use the flag to express our pride and identity at https://go.gov.sg/singaporeflag.

Singaporeans have shown incredible grit and resilience during this testing period. While the Singapore flag remains a symbol of everything we stand for, I ask that you also never, ever wave a white flag when it comes to standing up for our nation and fellow Singaporeans.

Lapses in the community, or by people who do not observe safe management practices can lead to a flare up into large clusters.

As of 5 Aug 2020, 12pm, MOH has preliminarily confirmed an additional 908 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore.

Of these, the vast majority are dormitory residents who were tested during their isolation/quarantine period, even though they are asymptomatic. They are amongst the final batch of workers being cleared and they come from dormitories with a relatively high prevalence of COVID-19. Hence MOH expects the daily case counts to be high for the coming days, before tapering down thereafter as the Inter-agency Taskforce completes the dormitory clearance.

MOH remains on track to clear all the dormitories by 7 August, except for a few standalone blocks in the dormitories that serve as quarantine facilities. There are presently about 9,700 workers in these quarantine facilities. They will have to serve out their 14-day isolation periods, and be subject to an exit test before they are able to resume work.",5/8/2020 19:31,,,,,212,9,0,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10158666597903686,[],10158666597903600

Singapore Economic Development Board - EDB
14 July 2020 at 18:30 Â·

Misinformation can spread faster than a virus in an outbreak. To combat fake news amidst COVID-19, Singapore leverages technology to disseminate accurate information in an innovative and efficient way. Official government channels like Gov.sg's Whatsapp and Telegram deliver latest news updates right into the hands of Singaporeans, while web portals, such as Urban Redevelopment Authority's SpaceOut and GovTech (Government Technology Agency of Singapore)'s MaskGoWhere and FluGoWhere, provide timely information on key COVID-19 initiatives.

Beyond these efforts, Singapore also tapped on AI technologies to gather essential information crucial to the fight against COVID-19.

Minister Gan added that most of the community unlinked cases were asymptomatic, and were only detected via proactive screening of workers. It is necessary to curb the rise of these cases with unknown sources of infection to keep the community spread low.

WORKER MOVEMENTS AT S11 DORMITORY ON 5 JULY 2020

The Ministry of Manpower is aware of a video circulating online, on migrant workers gathering at S11 Dormitory on Sunday, 5 July 2020.

The migrant workers who gathered were dormitory residents who are residing in a cleared block for recovered workers.

On that day, the dormitory operator was re-assigning rooms in the block, to group workers based on their employers and worksites, as part of the Safe Living measures that dormitory operators must implement. The measures are to reduce the risks of reinfection of COVID-19, and to enable migrant workers to return to work safely.

The initial instructions from the dormitory operator had caused some confusion amongst the migrant worker residents, which led to them gathering at the common area. The dormitory operator immediately tried to resolve the situation, and was able to disperse the gathering within 30 minutes. All the residents involved were wearing masks.

This new measure comes as Singapore prepares to reopen international travel through green lanes with various countries and regions.

He added, however, that the cost of COVID-19 testing and accommodation at a SHN facility will have to be borne by travellers, with the exception of Singaporeans and permanent residents. This is to ensure that any move to reopen travel will be both safe and sustainable.

1.01585E+16,"While most activities will be allowed to resume in Phase Two of Singaporeâ€™s exit from Circuit Breaker, there will be a small exception to this list, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong at a Multi-Ministry Taskforce Press Conference on 15 June 2020.

Activities involving large numbers of people within enclosed spaces for prolonged periods of time - such as religious services, concerts and cinemas - pose a risk of clusters of infections. The resumption of these activities will therefore take more time.

Minister Wong urged Singaporeans to keep up with safe distancing and safe management measures, and to not see Phase Two as an indication to let oneâ€™s guard down.

He emphasised that retail businesses will be subject to capacity limits and that individuals or groups of not more than five persons must adhere to the one-metre rule at all times.

Live music, screenings, singing and voice training classes will not be allowed, as they pose higher risk of COVID-19 spread through droplets.

The device expands upon the current TraceTogether app, and provides a solution for individuals whose smartphones are not effective enough to supply contact tracers with relevant data. He stressed that, like the app, the token does not track a userâ€™s whereabouts in real-time, and any data that may be used for contact tracing will be accessed only with the consent of the user. Furthermore, all data will be kept secure and used only for purposes of expediting contact tracing efforts.

1.01585E+16,"Contact tracing can now be carried out in under 24hrs, down from the previous 2-3 days, with the help of digital tools, said Minister-in-charge of Singaporeâ€™s Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan at a Multi-Ministry Taskforce press conference on 8 June 2020. Apps like TraceTogether have helped contact tracers identify close contacts of patients with COVID-19 more quickly, and can also provide important and timely information in cases where patients may not be in a fit state to be interviewed. This development, he added, is crucial in Singaporeâ€™s efforts to keep COVID-19 cases down in the midst of our phased exit from the Circuit Breaker.

To address calls to relax measures to permit some social gatherings, he stressed that evidence indicates a vast majority of COVID-19 cases are spread at events that involve social interactions and gatherings. He calls on Singaporeans to understand the spirit of the regulations and continue to uphold precautions which will enable Singapore to enter Phase 2 early.

Minister for Manpower, Josephine Teo explained that workers whose employers have approval to resume operations, and are housed in dormitories cleared of COVID-19 will have a green status on their SGWorkPass App. These conditions must be met for a worker to resume work safely.

She was speaking at the Multi-Ministry Taskforce press conference on 1 June 2020.

1.01585E+16,"At the Multi-Ministry Taskforce press conference on 1 June 2020, Director of Medical Services, Professor Kenneth Mak announced that face shields will no longer be treated the same as masks. He emphasised that face shields should only be worn in some situations where the wearing of masks may not be practical.

Such examples include:
- Children, 12 years and below, who have difficulty wearing masks, or keeping a face mask on for prolonged periods of time.
- People who have health conditions that may result in breathing difficulties or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for prolonged periods of time.
- People who are speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture style setting where they are largely remaining in a single spot from which they are speaking and are able to maintain a safe distance away from others.

Face shields worn on top of a mask can also provide some additional protection to prevent the masks from getting wet and minimise people touching their face. However, masks will continue to be the default situation for all.

It has been more than 30 days since the circuit breaker began. More than a month ago, I was still working at a studio, going to the hawker centre to have kopi-o-siu-dai and wanton mee with my studio-mate. Today, dining out is out, the playground is closed, and masking tape is everywhere for social-distancing measures.

It is a challenging time as we cope with the new norms that would likely persist beyond the circuit breaker. Most of us are staying at home. Working and learning form home and coping with it in our ways: cooking, music, art, yoga, writing or plenty of Studio Ghibli films. Some are going beyond by volunteering, promoting social awareness, raising charity funds to help the less fortunate, the migrant workers, and the elderly.

Behind the scenes, there is a whole system and team of people working to keep Singapore running so that we could stay at home, taking care of our loved ones and working with peace of mind: deliverymen who could bring a little comfort like mee chiang kueh from Ghim Moh or bubble tea. Supermarket workers who stock the shelves with pasta sauces or vegetables. On the front lines, medical personnel, the SAF and first-responders and volunteers are keeping our daily situation in check as the pandemic continues to develop globally.

Test methods will comprise PCR and serology testing to detect both currently infected workers, as well as those who have recovered from COVID-19. This helps to clear affected dorms thoroughly of the infection.

At the same time, he noted that many currently infected workers are recovering well, with an estimated 20,000 workers set to be discharged by the end of May. This will put Singapore in a favourable position to begin taking steps to reopen the economy in a cautious and calibrated manner.

Instead, precautions like safe distancing and good hygiene practices must be continued as part of a â€œnew normalâ€, in order to prevent any sharp resurgence of the virus.

He also added that steps are being taken to manage the outbreak in the migrant worker dormitories, so that workers may return to work safely as economic activities are restored.

MINDEF clarifies errors in a Facebook post by the Singapore States Times.

Ministry of Defence, Singapore (MINDEF)
7 May 2020 at 02:56 Â·

Clarifications Regarding Infections in Expo CCF Published by Singapore States Times on 6 May 2020 of an NSF Infected with #COVID19

MINDEF refers to the 6 May 2020 Facebook post by the Singapore States Times, on infections among staff at the Community Care Facility (CCF) at Singapore Expo. That post contained a number of errors. There has been no reported case of infections among staff under the SAF deployed to take care of COVID-19 patients at the Expo. The 20-year-old male Singaporean citizen cited by the post, who was confirmed by the Ministry of Health in their News Release (5 May 2020) to be COVID-19-positive, works under a different healthcare group. Neither is he a Full-Time National Serviceman (NSF), as claimed by the post, but a trained nurse from a private agency. The Singapore States Times also claimed that none of the national servicemen deployed by the SAF at the CCF had any experience in the hospitals. This is again wrong. Some of them are doctors and medics with prior hospital experience.

The SAF recognises the inherent risk to all its staff deployed in the CCF to care for recovering COVID-19 patients. Careful attention had been paid to the training and preparation of all staff to institute and maintain protocols to protect themselves against infection. These protocols are emphasised repeatedly. Nonetheless, as with all healthcare and administrative workers on the frontlines against COVID-19, risks of infections are continually present. The SAF will step up its vigilance and do its utmost to prevent such infections.

Given its history of repeatedly communicating multiple falsehoods, the Singapore States Timesâ€™ Facebook page has been designated as a Declared Online Location by the Ministry of Communications and Information, with effect from 7 May 2020.

<<Supporting Singaporeans during crisis>>

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit many Singaporeans hard. For those who are affected financially, we want to provide support.

We have received more than 500,000 applications for the Temporary Relief Fund, and applications have closed. The TRF provided interim assistance for those affected by COVID-19â€™s economic impact, until schemes like the COVID-19 Support Grant and the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) come into effect.

We recognise that Singaporeans may need more support after this month. That is why we have decided to enhance the COVID-19 Support Grant when applications open from May to 30 Sep 2020.

When we first announced the Grant, it was intended to support local employees who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 situation. Now, it will be extended to support:

a. Employees placed on involuntary No-Pay Leave (NPL) for at least 3 consecutive months, and

b. Employees who have had sustained salary reduction of at least 30% for 3 consecutive months.

Those who have lost their jobs, or are placed on No-Pay Leave for at least 3 months, may receive up to $800 a month for 3 months. Those who have lost their jobs can also receive employment and training support from Workforce Singapore (WSG) or Employment and Employability Institute (e2i). Others on involuntary NPL will have access to relevant courses subsidised by SkillsFuture Singapore. You may apply for the Grant from Monday, 4 May.

Those who have had their monthly salaries reduced by 30% or more for 3 months may receive up to $500 a month for 3 months. You may apply for the Grant from Monday 11 May.

We encourage you to apply online at go.gov.sg/CSG (goes â€˜liveâ€™ only from 4 May) with your supporting documents. You can email Ask_SSO@msf.gov.sg or call the ComCare hotline at 1800-222-0000 if you require assistance to apply online. If you are unable to email or call, you can approach your nearest SSO (go.gov.sg/ssolocator) for help with the online application.

Do note that full-time National Servicemen, interns, and self-employed persons such as taxi or private-hire drivers, insurance agents and delivery persons are not eligible for the COVID-19 Support Grant. Self-employed persons may be assisted under the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (www.ntuc.com.sg/sirs/).

We are also proactively helping existing ComCare clients. If your ComCare assistance is ending between now and July 2020, we will extend your assistance for a further 6 months without the need for further review. Families on ComCare whose circumstances have worsened during the COVID-19 situation may approach SSOs to review and possibly increase your current level of ComCare support.

New ComCare clients will also generally receive at least six months of assistance.

With the enhanced COVID-19 Support Grant and proactive ComCare assistance, my colleagues and I want to give you and your families more support as you seek new employment and training opportunities during this crisis.

Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis)
25 April 2020 at 14:00 Â·

An article alleging questionable practices in Singapore halal certification process is being circulated online.

We would like to clarify and debunk the allegations made in the article.

Muis manages the process of halal certification in Singapore based on the highest standards of governance, as expected of the Singapore Public Service. All processes are ISO 17065 certified throughout all stages of application, and key decisions on halal certification are made by an independent panel in Muis.

Muis applies the same rigour in determining whether to recognise foreign Halal certifying bodies (FCBs). While Muis recognises that FCBs operate in different social, religious and legal contexts from Singapore, Muis only recognises those who are able to demonstrate that they adhere to similar standards adopted by Muis, as well as the clearly stipulated terms and conditions for recognition. This includes organisational governance and competence as well as compatibility in religious standards and guidelines.

No one single individual, within or outside Muis, can influence the outcome of any application in any way. Muis places the utmost priority in ensuring the integrity of its Halal Quality Management System, to provide assurance and confidence to consumers.

Muis takes a serious view of such misleading reporting. Muis is looking into the matter and considering taking action against the publishers of the article. We would like to urge the community not to circulate unverified claims, and to approach the proper authorities if in doubt.

Clean & Green Singapore
19 April 2020 at 22:20 Â·

""A patron expressed his appreciation for our efforts and bought us soft drinks as a gesture of his appreciation. It was very encouraging!"", shared a volunteer who was deployed at Adam Road Food Centre. During the weekend deployment, our SG Clean Ambassadors, were also heartened to see that most of the patrons - young and old - were wearing their masks and keeping at least 1m apart when queuing. Many have also brought their own containers for takeout and helped reduce the use of disposables. Thank you for doing your part!

Much thanks to the Ambassadors too for giving up your weekend to help remind patrons to follow the important measures. Your important contribution is much appreciated.

Let's all do the right thing. The health of all depends on us.

1.01583E+16,"Elaborating on the Ministryâ€™s three-pronged strategy, Minister for Manpower, Josephine Teo, emphasised that safety distancing measures have been heightened in foreign worker dormitories to actively contain the spread. In the first prong, dormitories with existing clusters will be locked down and the movement of workers within the dormitories will be restricted. In the second prong, these safety distancing measures will also be applied to dormitories with no clusters to further prevent the spread of the COVID-19 infection. Lastly, workers in essential services have been placed in separate housing facilities instead of dormitories and have undergone medical screenings to ensure that they did not have symptoms before moving into alternative accommodation.

Celebrating apart, but together in spirit.

This year, our Tamil, Malayalee and Sikh communities celebrate New Year, Vishu and Vaisakhi differently due to the current circuit breaker measures to stem the rise if Covid-19 infections. Much as we would like to, we canâ€™t go to the temples and we canâ€™t be with our friends and loved ones.

So this year, while we canâ€™t celebrate the new year together in person, we will do so in spirit!

In particular, I invite all Singaporeans to join me in wishing our foreign worker friends, many of whom are confined to their dorms and unable to go out for celebrations, a very Happy New Year too!

We have received many queries from good-hearted charities, social service agencies and ground-up groups whether they can continue community service outreach during the Circuit Breaker.

During this period, we want to ensure that vulnerable people continue to get essential support. At the same time, all of us need to stay home, reduce our social interactions to the minimum, and go out when absolutely necessary. Only then can we reduce the spread of COVID-19.

To strike a sensible balance, charities, social service agencies and ground-up groups can approach the National Council of Social Service if they need their activities that provide essential aid, such as food and financial support, to be whitelisted. NCSS will coordinate and work with you to ensure that our vulnerable get support during the Circuit Breaker, while ensuring that they are kept safe and your volunteers and staff achieve stringent safe distancing. Some activities must continue, others can be modified or temporarily suspended.

Meanwhile, essential social services by MSF (e.g. our SSOs, residential homes, designated community services providing critical care) will continue to serve our most vulnerable among us.

Let's work together to help our most vulnerable get through this crisis. If you come across someone in the community who needs assistance, please contact the ComCare Hotline at 1800-222-0000.

Safe Distancing Measures in Public Spaces in HDB Estates

[POLICE DO NOT CONDUCT ROAD BLOCKS TO ENFORCE ELEVATED SAFE DISTANCING MEASURES]

There are messages circulating via text messaging services making false claims that members of the public had been stopped at police road blocks and fined for not complying with the elevated safe distancing measures. This is not true. The Police have not conducted road blocks specifically to enforce the elevated safe distancing measures, and no passengers have been fined at road blocks for not complying with these measures.

The Police conduct road blocks to detect offences such as for drink-driving, and other law enforcement purposes, such as to detect wanted persons. Nevertheless, if the Police come across motorists and passengers flouting the elevated safe distancing measures when conducting such road blocks, the Police may take enforcement action.

The Police urge the public not to spread unsubstantiated information which may cause public alarm.

With the #circuitbreaker in place, more workers are concerned about Job Security. When workers worry about their job security or their pay, itâ€™s my job as the Labour Chief to be concerned. With the Solidarity Budget in place, the support from the Government will greatly help employers to bring down their manpower cost so that jobs can be saved. Let me explain to you how.

Firstly, Government officers will be deployed to the dorms to provide for the daily needs of workers and to ensure hygiene, cleanliness and safe distancing standards.

Secondly, Medical posts will be set up in the dorms to screen for infections, and to separate healthy workers from ones who are sick.

Reaching out to Singaporeans in more ways than one.

In a situation like this COVID-19 outbreak, we need to broaden access to information across as many platforms as possible to reach everyone with reliable, clear and timely information.

We have been doing our best to keep you informed about the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation through many platforms - digitally, like Gov.sg website, Gov.sg WhatsApp, Telegram and Twitter, and traditionally, through newspaper and television ads.

To complement these efforts, we are now launching the COVID-19 Info Bot, that will give you quick answers to topical questions and concerns. The COVID-19 Info Bot is accessible on the Gov.sg website or by visiting www.gov.sg/infobot, and will help you navigate through all the information.

The information on this Info Bot is tailored to specific groups â€“ for students, parents, businesses and employers, and workers. It will carry summarised information relating to COVID-19 from various government agencies, ranging from mask distribution, home-based learning for students, workplace closures, advisories on good hygiene practices, being socially responsible and more!

Share this COVID-19 Info Bot with your loved ones and friends.

1.01583E+16,"Looking after the welfare of foreign workers residing at the dormitories gazetted as isolation areas includes tailoring to the different dietary requirements and preferences of the workers.

Hereâ€™s a look at how MOM has been working to improve the quality of food.

Singapore Ministry of Manpower
9 April 2020 at 09:21 Â·

You must have seen several posts being circulated online on the catered food being distributed to the foreign workers residing at the dormitories gazetted as isolation areas.

Some of the posts claimed that the food was substandard and inedible.

Over the last few days, MOM has been working with multiple professional caterers to progressively improve on the quality of the food, as well as to tailor to the different dietary requirements and preferences of the resident workers. And we will continue to make improvements along the way.

Here, you can see photos of the dinner we catered for the resident workers at Toh Guan Dormitory yesterday evening. The MOM team interviewed some resident workers on what they thought of the food too.

When the COVID-19 outbreak began, A*STAR tasked our researchers and engineers to channel their focus towards coming up with innovations that would contribute to Singaporeâ€™s fight against #COVID19.

These have included work on diagnostic test kits, therapeutics, in-silico modelling, and the employment of computer vision and deep learning to detect lung infection on chest x-rays, among others.

One ground-up initiative that has emerged is that of a DIY mask, the result of brainstorming from student researchers.

The DIY mask can be easily assembled using everyday items. This is timely, and will support the ongoing safe distancing measures.

We hope this video will be of help to all Singaporeans. Stay safe, everyone!

FALSE MESSAGE CIRCULATING IN THE PUBLIC REGARDING DOOR-TO-DOOR DISTRIBUTION OF REUSABLE MASKS

There are false text and audio messages circulating via text messaging services, claiming that there are people robbing residents under the pretext of distributing masks, purportedly under a new government initiative. The message also claimed that the residents would be made to try on masks believed to be doused with chemicals which made them lose consciousness.

This is untrue. The Police have not received any report regarding such incidents.

The Police urge the public not to spread unsubstantiated information which may cause public alarm.

The Police take a very stern view against anyone who knowingly spreads false information to mislead the public and will not hesitate to take actions against such individuals.

There are no government initiatives to distribute masks directly to households. Instead, all residents with registered home addresses will be able to collect reusable masks at designated Community Clubs/Centres and Residentsâ€™ Committees from 5 to 12 April 2020. Collection details are available on https://maskgowhere.sg.

[Joint statement by the Singapore Tourism Board, Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Police Force]

Following yesterdayâ€™s announcement that all entertainment venues will be closed from 26 March, 2359 hours till 30 April, we are aware a number of nightlife operators intend to host â€œfarewellâ€ events tonight that could result in large numbers of people congregating. These events undermine the fight against COVID-19 and increases risk to public health. If you are planning to attend, we urge you to seriously reconsider, if not for your own health, then for the health of those around you.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforceâ€™s decision to enforce stricter safe distancing measures aims to significantly reduce the risks of seeding new local COVID-19 clusters, which could strain our healthcare system further.

From now until the stricter measures kick in on 26 March 2020, 2359 hours, nightlife operators must continue to strictly implement safe distancing measures announced by the Ministry of Health on 20 March 2020. Events with 250 or more participants must be suspended, while operators of events with fewer than 250 participants must implement all necessary precautionary measures, including ensuring a distance of at least a metre between all participants and reduce mingling amongst participants.

These safe distancing measures are enforceable. Officers from government agencies including the Singapore Police Force will be on the ground to monitor the situation and carry out enforcement action over the next two days. The Traffic Police will also be conducting island-wide enforcement operations against drink-driving during this period. We will not hesitate to take action against anyone who fails to comply.

During this time, we appeal to Singaporeans to exercise good judgement and social responsibility. This will play an important part in keeping fellow Singaporeans and our loved ones safe in the midst of this global pandemic.",25/3/2020 14:32,,,,,176,17,40,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10158214063088686,[],10158214063088600

Jawatankuasa Kerja Berbilang Kementerian (MTF) hari ini mengumumkan langkah-langkah ketat untuk memastikan jarak selamat dalam sebarang perhimpunan termasuk membataskan jumlah perhimpunan seramai 250 sahaja. Pemerintah perlu memperkenalkan langkah-langkah tambahan ini dengan serius untuk mengekang penularan virus COVID-19 di tengah-tengah peningkatan kes-kes baru khususnya yang diimport dari luar negara.

Selaras dengan langkah-langkah baru ini, Muis akan bekerja rapat dengan masjid-masjid untuk mengusahakan cara terbaik bagi melaksanakan jarak selamat di masjid-masjid, apabila kita beribadah dan sebagainya, sebelum masjid dibuka kepada para jemaah pada Jumaat depan, 27 Mac.

Muis juga akan mendapatkan bimbingan dari Jawatankuasa Fatwa bagi penyesuaian yang ingin diperkenalkan. Maklumat lanjut akan diumumkan minggu hadapan. Saya harap masyarakat dapat meneruskan sokongan padu dan kerjasama anda supaya kita terus mencegah Masjid daripada menjadi kelompok jangkitan COVID-19 dan memastikan Singapura selamat.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 today announced stricter safe distancing measures to prevent further spread of the disease, especially among vulnerable segments of the population. This is in view of the pattern of transmission among the locally transmitted cases. Ministry of Health, Singapore found that the spread occurred during events at the workplace as well as social and religious gatherings. These safe distancing measures must be stepped up urgently in tandem with our parallel efforts to tighten our borders and to ring fence any infection clusters.

In line with the new measures, Muis will continue to work closely with our mosques to assess how we can operationalise safe distancing when our mosques open its doors to congregants next Friday, 27 March 2020.

The Fatwa committee will be consulted to guide us on the proposed adjustments that will need to be made to our prayer practices, in accordance with safe distancing requirements. More information will be available soon.

As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, I thank our community for your strong support and commitment to overcome this challenge together. I look forward to your understanding and strong support to ensure the safety of our mosques, our community and our fellow Singaporeans. Together, we can get through this!

Chan Chun Sing

Was at Changi Airport this afternoon to receive a very special cargo - more than 300,000 eggs meant for domestic consumption.

About a quarter of the eggs we consume are produced locally and a significant number come from Malaysia. However, we also have many other source countries which we have identified over the years and are able to activate them quickly when the need calls for it. This applies not just to eggs but other food products and essential items.

We managed to activate this option in a matter of two days and I would like to express my appreciation to Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR), the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), Singapore Airlines and SATS for helping us to bring the eggs in so quickly.

These efforts to secure and diversify our food supply have been developed and strengthened through the years. Even though we have a robust plan in place, we do not take it for granted and reassess it regularly to test its robustness against different scenarios. This is how things have always been done in Singapore and will continue to guide our approach to all issues, big and small, going forward. CCS

Update to The Community: Day 3 of Mosque Closure

Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.

Last Thursday, Muis took the unprecedented step of closing our mosques for at least 5 days, to allow us to begin thoroughly disinfecting our mosques, as well as work with MOH to undertake contact tracing of the jemaah attending the large scale event in KL and their close contacts.

I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the communityâ€™s understanding for the need for the temporary closures of our beloved mosques and the adjustments and inconvenience we have had to bear as a result. This is a necessary precautionary measure, as we gather in mosques in large numbers every day, and especially so on Fridays.

I would like to add that we must take special care to protect our seniors in the community, as studies have shown that the mortality rate is much higher for those aged 60 and above who contract the virus.

Alhamdulillah, many Muslims have expressed support and understand it is our duty to protect the community and larger society.

MOH has since shared information that the infected individuals have been to 10 of our mosques since they returned from KL, and could have close contact with other jemaah in our mosques during this time when they were infectious. As such, we are issuing a public advisory with MOH to encourage persons who have been at the mosques during this time to take extra care and precaution.

The number of positive cases in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei have also risen significantly over the past 2 days, among the returnees from the KL event.

In the last few days, there has also been news of some members of the community attending other large-scale religious gatherings overseas. We appeal to the community to avoid such events during this period.

In the meantime, the cleaning efforts in our mosques are proceeding smoothly. We are closely monitoring the developments, and will provide updates on the reopening of our mosques in due course.

[Budget 2020: Responding to Challenges in a New Decade]

This year, we usher in a new decade â€“ one marked by tectonic shifts in our operating environment, and growing uncertainties.

Against this backdrop, Singaporeâ€™s economy grew by a modest 0.7% in 2019. This was the weakest growth since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.

Just as the global economy was beginning to recover, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 outbreak hit unexpectedly last month. This brings new uncertainties, felt across the world.

He also announced that Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) will be re-activated to better detect and manage infections: https://facebook.com/watch/?v=1818018308335573",14/2/2020 23:30,,https://video.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/86604357_2582188015223497_5058750594492137472_n.mp4?_nc_cat=101&ccb=3&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=WMxkXka_IuIAX_YjRr4&_nc_ht=video.fsin5-1.fna&oh=47ff16f519a26b487ea2dc969c7e6c54&oe=6026CCCC,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/cp0/e15/q65/s320x320/81127143_614354229347698_8354308910865186816_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=3&_nc_sid=ccf8b3&_nc_ohc=Va7O4tO4DjQAX-Tu2gR&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=9&oh=ccc6bb81215c6e3929d570e59f225338&oe=604B92B2,6.14E+14,276,24,0,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/videos/614353079347813,[],10158084491703600

1.01581E+16,"There is no need to rush to buy essential supplies.

Let's play our part, exercise individual responsibility, and not hoard items unnecessarily.

Chan Chun Sing
7 February 2020 at 12:35 Â·

There have been many reports this evening of people buying up food and household items at our supermarkets. This has resulted in photos of temporary empty shelves in our supermarkets circulating on social media.

I understand that people are concerned after the announcement this afternoon that we have raised the DORSCON level to orange.

We have done so as there are now a few local cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to China. This is a scenario that we are prepared for and we will put in place additional measures to minimise the risk of further transmission.

MTI is in close contact with our retailers and I assure all Singaporeans that there is no need to rush for essential supplies like rice or instant noodles. Our supply lines for these essentials are intact and there is no risk of us running a shortage of essential food or household items. We also have our national stockpile for essential items.

However, we must all play our part, exercise individual responsibility and not hoard items unnecessarily. This will create undue panic and is unhelpful to the situation at hand.

Collective defence is our strongest defence. Let us all stay alert but remain calm and collected. The Government is monitoring all aspects of the situation closely and will always make sure that the needs of Singaporeans are met and catered for. CCS

,"There have been many reports this evening of people buying up food and household items at our supermarkets. This has resulted in photos of temporary empty shelves in our supermarkets circulating on social media.

I understand that people are concerned after the announcement this afternoon that we have raised the DORSCON level to orange.

We have done so as there are now a few local cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to China. This is a scenario that we are prepared for and we will put in place additional measures to minimise the risk of further transmission.

MTI is in close contact with our retailers and I assure all Singaporeans that there is no need to rush for essential supplies like rice or instant noodles. Our supply lines for these essentials are intact and there is no risk of us running a shortage of essential food or household items. We also have our national stockpile for essential items.

However, we must all play our part, exercise individual responsibility and not hoard items unnecessarily. This will create undue panic and is unhelpful to the situation at hand.

Collective defence is our strongest defence. Let us all stay alert but remain calm and collected. The Government is monitoring all aspects of the situation closely and will always make sure that the needs of Singaporeans are met and catered for. CCS

<Masks for all Households; Use Responsibly>

We have sufficient masks in the national stockpile if everyone uses them responsibly. Responsible usage means following medical advice - only those who are sick need to wear masks; for those who are well, there is no need to wear masks.

Over the last 9 days, we released more than 5 million masks from the national stockpile to retailers. They were snapped up in hours. Yet many Singaporeans are still unable to get a mask. The current situation is clearly not sustainable.

This is why the Taskforce has decided to change our distribution method, as my colleague Chan Chun Sing and I announced this morning. First, we will prioritise the national stockpile of masks for essential services, namely our healthcare workers at the frontline. Second, for the general public we will release masks from the national stockpile directly to Singaporeans. In particular we will provide a packet of 4 masks each for every local household.

We are doing this to assure all Singaporeans that if any member of the family falls sick and needs a mask, they will have one at hand. But remember to use the masks responsibly. Do not wear the masks immediately. Keep this as a precaution and use the masks only if someone in the family falls sick and needs to go out to see the doctor.

I know many Singaporeans are concerned about the virus and want to protect themselves and their families. The best thing to do is to uphold good personal hygiene. Wash your hands regularly with soap; do not use your hands to touch your face; if you are sick, see a doctor and stay at home until you recover.

With individual and collective responsibility, we can maintain a strong defence against the virus, and overcome this together.",30/1/2020 15:22,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1oM7j5CZFhkAX8vp2ZQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=65a620a8f3d820a3f5065c8064279c27&oe=604D4EB6,,,,198,61,39,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10158035302133686,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1oM7j5CZFhkAX8vp2ZQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=65a620a8f3d820a3f5065c8064279c27&oe=604D4EB6', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1oM7j5CZFhkAX8vp2ZQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=65a620a8f3d820a3f5065c8064279c27&oe=604D4EB6', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1oM7j5CZFhkAX8vp2ZQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=65a620a8f3d820a3f5065c8064279c27&oe=604D4EB6', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1oM7j5CZFhkAX8vp2ZQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=65a620a8f3d820a3f5065c8064279c27&oe=604D4EB6']",10158035302133600

WELCOME HOME!

SCOOT TR121 from Wuhan which touched down this morning at Changi is special. It carried the 92 Singaporeans who were stuck in Wuhan when PRC decided to lock down the city. You can imagine their anxiety and fear! Their ordeal is over, though we have to put them under quarantine for 14 days.

TR121 was made possible through the dedication and sacrifice of many agencies and colleagues. We thank the MFA officers who gallantly escorted the Singaporeans back! We thank the CAAS, CAG, ICA and MOH colleagues who worked through the days and nights! We thank the SCOOT pilots and crew members who made this flight possible! On behalf of the MOT family, thank you to all of you!

As always, we stand together to help our fellow Singaporeans. This was what we did 17 years ago, when Singaporeans came together to battle SARS. With the experience from SARS, we started our thermal scanning much earlier this time at all our air, sea and land checkpoints.

We will conquer this Wuhan Virus, like how we did as a nation 17 years ago.

In view of the first confirmed case in Singapore, MOH has put in additional precautionary measures to reduce the risk of importation of a new coronavirus to Singapore.

MOH advises Singaporeans to avoid travel to the whole of Hubei Province. Singaporeans who need to travel to the affected areas should regularly check MOH's website (www.moh.gov.sg) for updates.
