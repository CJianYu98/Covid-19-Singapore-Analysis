*** important***
fbposts postid is in column M!

Csv auto convert large numbers (>15 digits) to scientific format.
To perserve original postid, had to concat into a different column (M).



#
fbcomments format: postid, username, comment, timestamp

if comment == ''; means theres no text (could be video, gif, sticker etc)
