Welcome to my Facebook family online communication platform!!!  Regarding the chaos of the world, rebellion will occur. Therefore, a country with talents will prosper, and a country without talents will decline. How do you know this is the case? Those who are also exaggerated and act in real action will not be able to realize their ideals after all. This is the inevitable end of those who love fame and exaggeration, but do not govern the country and love the people.  Didnâ€™t it say in the Book of Changes, â€˜Iâ€™m in a high position without the corresponding virtues and talents? 'So those who donâ€™t do practical work and like to deceive and advertise their reputations will become weaker and weaker. Those who do not have morals but pray for happiness will inevitably end up in poverty and embarrassment. Those who have no credit but enjoy their salary will inevitably suffer Insult and suffer disaster.  Since there is today, why did you do this? There is no international law, really deserved, these are known to be self-inflicted. A must watch! Wuhan chemical Covid-19 virus in china is the root of all heartache. Wuhan chemical Covid-19 in china lied about a deadly virus that paralyzed the world economy. The latest Covid-19 virus has been diagnosed with 2.240 people, killing more than 790,000.

Now if we going to go for another round of reduction in cpf, how many more years is it going to take to see our employer's cpf contribution portion resume back to normal again when the contribution by employers now is already lower and not on par with employees. Besides majority of all the monies announced in the last budget already gone to helping employers n companies. Help given to individual is already so minimal! Besides, cpf contribution is required to help sustain our mthly housing instalment, by lowering it employers again coming up lesser monies & even if employees get the extra few % in cash, its pointless, its just helping to make up for salary shortfall, then you will also get cpf shortfall in terms of repaying housing instalment meaning we are digging into our own spare cpf monies to sustain the housing instalment.",
