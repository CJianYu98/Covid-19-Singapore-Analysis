Why stop there. They do provide us our daily necessity too. We must be fair. If not we might lose their supply chain.

101581528,69992900,Mohan Prakash,Mar 10 at 2:03 AM,"Well done , because Malaysia will take about 10 years to vaccinate the whole country. If they inoculate 10K dose per day x 300 days is 3 million dose a year , their population is 30million , so it will take 10 years for the first dose.... second dose, yearly booster dose, PM change, Ruling party change .....so if you consider all this factors, god knows how many decades more or this will not end in our generation. .",
101581528,69992900,Lim Hwee Hwee,Mar 9 at 11:46 PM,Spending some money to make the community safe. Isnâ€™t it benefiting for the society at large? More money had already been spent on securing vaccines at an early stage even before trial results are out. Money went into the drain for vaccines with results that did not reach the standard. So it is nothing to compare with giving it to them for free.   Looking far sighted and long term is what our govt have been doing. Priority should really be given to people who come into contact with larger group of people a day.   It make sense to vaccinate Malaysia delivery driver and accompany personnel looking at the high covid rate there. This will keep Singaporean in contact with them safe and in turn prevent spread of covid to locals or forming of a covid cluster thru them. ,

After the 3rd vaccine (Sinovac) arrived in Singapore, people said govt double standard. Why some took Pfizer n why Not everyone given Pfizer (sound contradicting compare their views when govt first announced they bought Pfizer).   Than when govt roll out to old age citizens to take the vaccine, they blamed the govt for using the old age as guinea pig, some even urging other not to take the vaccine. Now the govt said giving those invited lorry driver the vaccine (which these group of people urging Singaporean NOT to take) the same group blamed the govt.

WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,

While the origin of the novel coronavirus is still unknown and conspiracy theories have caused widespread panic, experts said that timely information disclosure to the public would benefit global unity and cooperation against the pandemic, which had infected more than 150,000 people and killed 5,400 around the world as of Saturday.    The Fort Detrick laboratory that handles high-level disease-causing material, such as Ebola, in Fredrick, Maryland was shut after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a cease and desist order to the organization in July, 2019 according to local media.  The suspension was due to multiple causes, including failure to follow local procedures and a lack of periodic recertification training for workers in the biocontainment laboratories. The wastewater decontamination system of the lab also failed to meet standards set by the Federal Select Agent Program, media reported.  The lab, which was closed more than half a year ago, recently caught public attention as a petition submitted to the White House website on March 10 listed some coincidences in time between the closure and the COVID-19 outbreak.   For example, ""a large-scale 'influenza' killed more than 10,000 people"" in the US in August 2019 following the closure; and the COVID-19 epidemic broke out globally in February 2020 after the US organized Event 201 - A Global Pandemic Exercise - in October 2019.   The petition also noted that many English-language news reports about the closure of Fort Detrick were deleted amid the worsening COVID-19 pandemic, raising suspicions over the lab's relationship with the novel coronavirus.   Petitioners urged the US government to publish the real reason for the lab's closure and to clarify whether the lab was related to the novel coronavirus and whether there was a virus leak.   ""It's not a small issue, the truth should be published,"" an internet user commented.   ""The world deserves to know the truth,"" said another.   Ni Feng, a deputy director of the Institute of American Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, called on the US government to increase transparency in the COVID-19 pandemic related issues in response to wide-spread doubts.     The origin of the virus should be decided according to scientific research, but the urgent issue at the current stage is to cooperate in the global battle against the pandemic, Ni noted.",

WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,

Despite knowing it'll have one of the greatest effect on vaccine hesitancy? Just, wow. Also surprised that I haven't seen this old news.  Between saving more lives by reducing vaccine hesitancy, and reaping in more profits from increased demand, what could be preventing them from getting vaccinated early?  Still waiting for news of them taking the vaccine. It's probably reasonable to assume they have not yet gotten themselves vaccinated.  Surely the Pfizer executives would have the best information to weigh risk-benefit? Why should Singaporeans believe benefits outweigh risks, when Pfizer executives haven't demonstrated belief in their own product, in America with much higher covid risks?  For people that still think ""not cutting the line"" is a valid excuse, consider that they've sold vaccines to Singapore, which should be at the very back of the line, due to how well covid is controlled, compared to most other nations.  "" our company ran a lot of polls to see what would take people to believe it. And one of the highest ranking â€“ even higher than if Joe Biden takes it, even higher than if the other presidents take it, is if the CEO of the company takes it. So with that in mind, Iâ€™m trying to find a way that I will get vaccinated despite if it is not my time just to demonstrate the confidence of the company. But we have made the decision that if we have to do that, we will not do it with our executives. So none of the executives and board members will cut the line. They will take it as their age and occupation type is the time for them to take it.

He went on to say that Sinovac had denied reports that Brazil would get a similar vaccine at a much lower price of $1.96 per dosage. â€œThe $1.96 price per dosage price is incorrect, because the shipping cost alone is at least $2 per dosage. Sinovac is currently seeking the origins of this report,â€ he added. Honesti said the decision to set the potential vaccine price was based on the amount of investment put into phase three of the clinical trials and the efficacy test.  https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/10/13/covid-19-vaccine-to-be-priced-at-rp-200000-per-dosage-bio-farma.html",

101581267,36947900,Jake Ng,Feb-26,"We are not safe until everyone in the world is safe.   Vaccination helps prevent death and serious illness from COVID-19, but it may be less effective in preventing infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.  The virus and the disease are 2 different things.   In simple terms, those who have the disease are definitely infected by the virus, but those who are infected by the virus may not necessarily get the disease. This can be explained by the many asymptomatic carriers of the virus.  Meanwhile, everybody should continue to observe safe measures. ",
101581267,36947900,Stefan Masuhr,Feb-25,"With all due respect for a normally competent government, this is a dangerous path that is being proposed.  â€œPreventing new outbreaksâ€ is not a useful risk measure, â€œpreventing material excess deathsâ€, or â€œpreventing material stress on the hospitalisationâ€ could be. Preventing new outbreaks has the (popular) zero risk sound to it.   Getting the population vaccinated largely makes sense and speeding up would even be better.   â€œThe world having the virus under controlâ€ is a meaningless phrase unless itâ€™s qualified by what risks are to be prevented. Otherwise itâ€™s very easy to drift into zero risk territory again.   Itâ€™s very populistic to stay in the abstract and have an external catch all condition that means all and nothing. The government is typically much better at being precise, actionable and practical.   Prevent excess deaths and excess hospitalisation by a focused and accelerated vaccine programme would be imho a better message. ",
101581267,36947900,Shanika Dilini Pathigoda,Feb-25,"Israel research already proved the real-world results of post-vaccination as 94% efficacy. Singapore must expedite the vaccination process.

101581254,10437900,Cheng Chua Pang,Feb-25,"My understanding of vaccines:  If vaccinated, the body's resistance to the virus increases, then: 1) The chance of getting the virus decreases. 2) Even if you get the virus, most people don't need medical attention to recover. 3) Even if medical care is required, most do not need to be in hospital. 4) Even if you need to stay in a hospital, most will not be life-threatening.  According to information from the online Sinovac vaccine trial results (12,396 people took part in the trial): 1) The chance of getting the virus is reduced by about half 2) Only 16.3 per cent of those who have been infected with the virus require medical treatment (83.7 per cent do not require medical treatment to recover). 3) No one who needs medical attention needs to be in hospital or life-threatening.",

Rather than just pin point on the origin of the vaccine. Just look at the method or approach used. West vaccine is new method, which is not proven. Just a trial, which they inject the virus (unharmful amount) and let your body build immunity to the virus. So, question, what happens if your body didnâ€™t react to it? So, what happens to this amount of virus? Will it mutate to a new string? Will it create a new disease? East method, which is similar to BCG vaccine. It kills the virus to a certain amount n your body picks it up n build immunity to it. It is a proven method for decades.... if u have no virus in your body, basically nothing happens. So, why would u say it is more harmful for the east method? Canâ€™t really understand these haters opinion",

Every day and night i think of him and always wish he would come back to me, I was really upset and i needed help, so i searched for help online and I came across PROPHET SHANGO that he can help get ex back fast. So, I felt I should give him a try. I contacted him and he told me what to do and i did it then he did a (Love spell) for me 48 hours later, my husband called me and told me that he miss me and the kids so much, So Amazing!! So that was how he came back that same day, with lots of love and joy, and he apologized for his mistake, and for the pain he caused me and the kids. Then from that day,our Marriage was now stronger than how it were before,All thanks to prophet sanoawo  he is so powerful and i decided to share my story on the internet that Prophet SHANGO  is real and powerful spell caster. if you are here and you need your Ex back or your husband moved to another woman, do not cry anymore, contact this powerful spell caster now.1)If you want your ex back.

101581121,74077900,Louis Ooi,Feb-18,"Did you know only 94 people were selected for 'tests before approval of Pfizer vaccine ?Talk about a quickie..  Dr Julian Tang, Honorary Associate Professor in Respiratory Sciences and Clinical Virologist, University of Leicester, said:  â€œThe results for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine are encouraging â€“ but it is so far based on the outcomes of only 94 participants.   â€œIf the 90% â€˜efficacyâ€™ was based on the analysis of 10,000 participants, along with similar safety data, this would be much more reassuring.  â€œOther practical problems still need to be addressed â€“ how will GPs and other providers deal with the -70C storage?  How long can the defrosted vaccine remain useable (up to 5 days?) â€“ so there will be inevitably some wastage if a certain number of doses are defrosted that are then just not used in time?  â€œAlso this is a new vaccine design â€“ we donâ€™t have any other routinely used licensed viral vaccines based on this mRNA technology.  So how will the vaccine perform if repeated boosts are needed if the duration of the vaccine-induced immunity is relatively short?  â€œAnd how will the vaccine perform in the elderly and those with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and other chronic heart, lung, kidney disease that make them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19?  â€œWhat about the performance if the vaccine in those who have already had COVID-19 and have circulating antibodies?  â€œWhat is the reason for those who fail to respond to this vaccine?  And will this also be a problem for other COVID-19 vaccines for those individuals?  â€œHopefully more data will be forthcoming to give us more reassurance about the efficacy and safety of this new Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine â€“ and help us understand and perhaps even predict, to some extent, the responses to the other COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in development.â€  Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham, said:  â€œItâ€™s great news that the Pfizer vaccine is reported to be 90% effective, but itâ€™s important to understand what that means.  For a vaccine to be truly effective it needs to protect those most vulnerable from suffering severe COVID-19 or prevent those less vulnerable from becoming infected and then transmitting the virus to others.  Simply reducing the appearance of symptoms in people",

101581098,45987900,Peter Ngern,Feb-17,"[ The Fourth Industrial Revolution is of a scale, speed and complexity that is unprecedented. It is characterised by a fusion of technologies â€“ such as artificial intelligence, gene editing and advanced robotics â€“ that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological worlds. It will disrupt nearly every industry in every country, creating new opportunities and challenges for people, places and businesses to which we must respond. ]  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulation-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution  [ PROCUREMENT PROCESS Three vaccines soon looked viable - Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac. The first two vaccines use the new messenger RNA technology. Sinovac is a traditional inactivated virus vaccine.  mRNA vaccines teach our cells to make a protein that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. This is different from traditional vaccines that put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies.  The group made its first advance purchase agreement with Moderna in June, securing it with a down payment. In August, it bought the Sinovac vaccine and advanced talks with Pfizer-BioNTech.  Though Moderna appeared to be the frontrunner, the US Food and Drug Administration gave its stamp of approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine earlier, on Dec 11.  Singapore followed suit, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announcing in a televised address on Dec 15 that the Health Sciences Authority had approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. ] https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-covid-19-vaccine-shipment-edb-shortlist-negotiate-13823698  [ Recognizing the broad potential of mRNA science, we set out to create an mRNA technology platform that functions very much like an operating system on a computer. It is designed so that it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs. In our case, the ""programâ€ or â€œappâ€ is our mRNA drug - the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein. ] Modernatx website.  https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/mrna-platform-enabling-drug-discovery-development  [ Dr. Louise Lagendijk, MD, PhD: A Harvard-educated doctor with an extensive background in molecular genetics explains messenger RNA and potential autoimmune issues that could result from the new RNA vaccines. ]  https://archive.org/details/dr-louise-explains-messenger-RNA-and-RNA-vaccines  [ MANY DOCTORS FROM AROUND THE WORLD ISSUE DIRE WARNING: DO NOT GET THE COVID VACCINE!! ]  https://rumble.com/vdarst-many-doctors-from-around-the-world-issue-dire-warning-do-not-get-the-covid-.html  The Great Reset https://brandnewtube.com/watch/the-new-normal-documentary_ecuUiUhHpP9INeh.html  The Great Resist World Freedom Alliance https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=113646157366425&id=100638895333818 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SEsjvkIJlZs",

Chinese, Malays, Indians, and Europeans live peaceful prosperous lives. They could be Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, Muslims, Jewish, or atheists, all finding their rightful place in this amazing nation.

An infected person can't be vaccinated, that how vaccine works, it protects the uninfected staying guarded using our bodies antibodies replicating the mrna strain to develope immunity to fight off or neutralize potential viral infection. Then again, perhaps the ministry could provide more information for people with allergies and how much if any, impact it may render to persons with allergies, would it be safe for those with allergies to get vaccinated and would the vaccine be effective if anti allergy pills are taken prior or post vaccination, or whether it poses any more eminent danger such as death for allergy peeps.

Covid 19 can touch anyone and can be fatal even to young people. Every country is hungry for the vaccine to protect its people. Singapore is lucky to be the first Asian country to receive the first batch of limited covid 19 vaccine. The Committee has recommended that the higher risk frontline staff should be protected first with the vaccine. It is understandable that people can have reservation on the vaccine. Experts have studied how vaccine works not for one year or four years but over a century. There is no need for them to approve it if it is not safe for use. Should the vaccine goes wrong, not only it will ruin their reputation, they may also be charged for manslaughter. But for people to say that they know better than these experts that the vaccine is not safe. How? Through what expertise do they know about vaccine? The key to protect our loved ones and others is through inoculation of the vaccine. The earlier the world is inoculated, the earlier our loved ones are protected, the soonest the demise of covid 19 pandemic.",

101579826,99032900,Keng Hee,"Dec 29, 2020","A few thoughts come into my mind ( since vaccination is not made mandatory )  1.  Have an indicator (dial, dashboard etc) indicating % of Residents in SG having vaccinated.  This should help publicise Singapore as being a safer city to conduct business.  This indicator must be updated daily and available on all main stream media.  2.  Like NEWATER, where ministers YAM SENG to the newater bottle, similarly, all Ministers, Mayors, MPs, the Expert Committee can do the same to lead by example and show the world we don't talk but do.  By default, all Superscale officers must lead by having vaccination.  How do we otherwise achieve herd mentality where the leaders at the top just say charge and stay behind the troops.  3.  There could be an app ( perhaps and extension of TraceTogether ) which gives you a virtual passport that you have been vaccinated.  With vaccination comes privileges, perhaps the privilege for travel.  4.  All front line medical staff. including Safety Distancing Ambassdors, must be part of the wave.  Healthcare workers from Head of Departments, Doctors and nurses must go take the vaccination.  How do we achieve 70% vaccination when our healthcare workers are not even 100%.  Teachers who interact with students must be vaccinated.  In fact, while it's voluntary, make it a criteria for getting bonus.  In the 70s, ligation was used to provide benefits for mothers who wanted to stop at 2 and was highly successful.     5.  The currently announced ""staging plan"" looked skimpy.  There must be more meat.    6.  Have competition to show which constituency is leading the vaccination penetration.    Let's do this the Uniquely Singapore way.  It's the execution that counts.  And the sooner we get more vaccinated, the faster will be the economic recovery of Singapore!",

The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.  ..........  Page 39 â€œDetection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.â€  â€œSince no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/Î¼L) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.â€  Budâ€™s comments:  The PCR test has multiple probes designed insilico (i.e. in a computer) from the GenBank sequence database based on the N gene, not from isolated and validated sequence of SARS CoV-2.  The N gene sequence codes for the glycoprotein coating that encapsulates and protects the RNA in the virus from nucleases in the body which would break apart the RNA sequence of the virus.   The CDC document is very concerning.  Without validation against isolated, filtered virus using either standard Kochâ€™s or Riversâ€™ postulates (methods which have been used to validate cause for every other pandemic including SARS CoV-1 from the 2002-2004 pandemic), vaccines are being created based on synthetic sequence designed to cause invivo human cells in the living, healthy patient to produce one or more proteins from the S-spike protein on the virus, but neither this sequence nor the protein it produces has been validated against the sequence of the S-spike protein on isolated SARS CoV2.

In the midst of trying to rush a solution/vaccine  will end out  costly n causing great sufferings to those who take the risk or being pressured to take it. Pharmaceutical companies rushing it out for $$$ not for saving lives. Singaporeans r wise to hesitate n hv valid reasons to hesitate!!! Even if pm or ministers put up a brave/crazy front to take the vaccine, we shouldn't' take it otherwise it will be sheep to slaughter house. The first few countries that take the vaccines will suffer the most, look at brazil that started vaccine n 35% have adverse effects. One can say it's bec from china but just bec it's from other countries wl make the vaccine safer? The truth is there is no vaccine yet that has been carefully studied n research which need years to do it. Rushing a vaccine out is totally irresponsible n dangerous. Wait n see approach with masks n precautions plus keeping immunity high is the best n only approach now. Don't make the same mistake as masks, it is that obvious to wear mask but our gov miss it. Now it is very obvious vaccine is premature. For mask except for those who died we can reverse it by getting everyone to start wearing mask but for vaccine once taken you can not reverse not a few but many will suffer adverse side effect in years to come. So please think not twice but a million times whether to go for it.",

Adverse Reactions During Vaccine Trials The media appears to have played down the severity of adverse reactions from vaccine trials. However, the results are actually quite worrying. Take, for example, the genetically engineered mRNA vaccine from Moderna. Its Phase I trial involved 45 subjects (between 18 and 55 years of age), divided into three groups of 15, each group receiving two inoculations, one month apart, each at three dose levels, 25 Âµg, 100 Âµg and 250 Âµg.  Every single test subject on the highest and on the preferred intermediate dose suffered some kind of adverse reaction. At the lowest dose, 1 out of the 13 subjects became so sick that he or she had to be hospitalized, with 7 out of 13 (54%) having adverse events. 80% of those on the intermediate dose suffered a moderately severe adverse reaction (with the other 20% suffering mild adverse reactions). At the highest dose, all 14 subjects experienced adverse events with 21% (3 out of 14) of subjects suffering â€œone or more severe adverse eventsâ€. The trial was based on exclusionary volunteer selection â€“ in other words, the healthiest volunteers were selected to be test subjects for the trial, and not those who were immunocompromised. Individuals who were pregnant, overweight, smokers, suffering from respiratory problems, have a history of seizures in the family, suffering from autoimmune diseases and so forth were excluded.  ",

101577317,32467900,Soon Tze Chien,"Sep 6, 2020","No Long-Term Safety Studies Of mRNA Vaccines Modernaâ€™s vaccine candidate, as well as the Duke-NUS vaccine candidate, are mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines are a new invention and have never been administered on anyone (save the volunteers currently involved in trials), let alone on the entire population. Therefore, there has not been any long-term studies on the safety of mRNA vaccines. Antibody-Dependent Response of Vaccines Not Tested â€“ Likely to Result in Deaths of Those Vaccinated Since the first SARS outbreak in 2003, scientists have been trying to develop a vaccine for SARS. However, the development of an effective vaccine for SARS has proven to be very problematic. One study is indicative. Ferrets were injected with experimental vaccines and then exposed to the live SARS virus. When examined, the ferrets were found to have developed severe hepatitis indicating liver damage.  This is due to an effect known as Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). ADE occurs when a vaccine produces binding antibodies instead of neutralizing antibodies. The binding antibodies help the viruses to enter the cells of organs more easily. A dengue vaccine introduced into the Philippines was halted and recalled in 2017 after at least 130 children died from ADE caused by the vaccine, despite the vaccine having been already approved by the World Health Organization as being safe.  Since administering a challenge test (exposure to the actual virus) is deemed to be unethical in human trials, it will not be known whether the COVID-19 vaccines currently in trials will cause ADE in humans.

101577317,32467900,Soon Tze Chien,"Sep 6, 2020","Virus Interference Could Cause The Vaccinated To Be More Susceptible to Future COVID-19 Virus Mutations There is already evidence showing that the current COVID-19 strains are mutating. How confident can we be that the vaccines that are currently being developed will still be effective by the time they are released into the market? If the current COVID-19 strains are mutating, we may face problems in future if we are currently vaccinated for one particular strain of the COVID-19 virus. Studies show that after administration of the flu vaccine, there is a 440% increase in the likelihood of being infected by other non-flu viruses.  This phenomenon, known as virus interference, may cause those vaccinated with the current COVID-19 vaccines to be more susceptible to infection by future mutations of the COVID-19 virus.   Pharmaceutical Companies Likely Immune From Legal Liability, Liability Likely To Be Borne By Governments The pharmaceutical companies creating the COVID-19 vaccines have already sought immunity from liability for harm caused by the vaccines.  If these vaccines cause harm, the financial liability is likely to fall on the governments which mandate them. This will not be the first time that governments have to bear liability. For instance, the United Kingdom government paid out Â£60 million to 60 individuals who suffered brain damage from the swine flu vaccine in 2014.  Immunity from liability, plus the potential to earn billions of dollars from the COVID-19 vaccines being developed, is a recipe for temptation that may lead pharmaceutical companies to cut corners and rush the vaccines into the market instead of taking adequate time to ensure the safety of these vaccines.

Concerns persist that COVID-19 vaccines could cause antibody-dependent enhancement, which can potentiate viral entry into host cells and worsen disease. that vaccines generating antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may bind to the virus without neutralizing it. Should this happen, the non-neutralizing antibodies could enhance viral entry into cells and viral replication and end up worsening infection instead of offering protection. ""if the gun is jumped, and a vaccine is widely distributed that is disease enhancing, that would be worse than actually not doing any vaccination at all.â€  Vaccines typically take at least 7 years for development. Long term impact must be studied. The most recent ADE related adverse impact was seen in the dengue vaccine which was approved by WHO and given to children in Philippines. It was halted after 130 children died after being vaccinated.  Please make effort to boost your own immune system through proper diet, lifestyle, sleep, avoid smoking, etc  ",
