Please wear your masks and do your part while the vaccination is on-going.   Thank you.

101581435,49857900,Tan Jolley,Mar-05,"Singhealth is a private entity. The responsibility and goal of a private entity is to make lots of profits, not lowering costs. The private entity will keep raising fees and the government will try to subsidise as much but it can't keep pace with the  private entity. For example ,the subsidised fee for A&E to pay has been increased from $50 to about $120 over the years but the actual fee charge is about $360 today. The more the actual fee charge is increased, the more the subsidised fee to pay. The government should maintain a public hospital where fees are regulated for the lower income group who does not have enough to pay for medishield coverage. Malaysia has public and private hospitals, why can't Singapore."

101581394,7612900,Elke Smith,Mar-04,"It is ridiculous if you live  100m across the street from a school and have to travel 1km to another because of this balloting. We were lucky to get in. I feel this alma mater thing is overrated. Just make it that if they donated money, then can get place."
101581394,7612900,Ken Ochiai,Mar-03,â€œChildren should be able to get a place in one of the schools near where they liveâ€. The problem with it is that most of the popular schools are concentrated in the Bukit Timah prime lands and only the rich few people can afford to live there ðŸ˜© 
101581394,7612900,B QR Ernest,Mar-03,"More places should be given to phase 2B.. for children eligible in all other phases there is no effort involved.   Phase 1, you just need a sibling. 2A1, parents just need to spend a few hundred dollars to join alumni, 2A2, just need to be old boy/girl.  Phase 2B is where you have parents who have no connections -like 2C - but who are willing to put in time and effort to serve as school parent volunteers, in the grassroots, church and clans."
101581394,7612900,Jillian Wong,Mar-03,I think should take a look at the grassroots leaders priority in phase 2b.  The active service period should be extended from 2 years to 3 or more years to better gauge the parent's level of involvement and to filter out those who are in it soley for this perk. Common to see some active members Mia after p1 registration.
101581394,7612900,Sun Poh,Mar-03,"Please scrap parent volunteer scheme under Phase 2B as it is a form of â€œI help you, you help meâ€ bribery."
101581394,7612900,Micky Ng,Mar-04,"Personally, I think itâ€™s only justifiable for Phase 1 to stay status quo. If you have current siblings studying in the school, it makes sense for their little brother and sister to be given the priority.  Phase 2 should be for those who live within 1 km from the school! Itâ€™s just madness that there are so many of our school children travelling from Punggol to their parentsâ€™ alma mater school in Toa Payoh and for kids living in Toa Payoh to travel more than 2 km because we canâ€™t get a place due to the fierce competition of the â€œso called better schoolâ€.  MOE wants to phase out academics streaming to ease competition, then why is the Phase 1,2 and 3 registration still around!  Getting into the good school that parents used to study; Phase 2A, only teach children that they are entitled!  Paying church and clan to get into the school? What kind of value does MOE hope to inculcate our future generations?! "
101581394,7612900,Joe Teo,Mar-04,Same cake but cut differently. How about make it simple.. 2 phases: 1km and beyond? Cannot imagine has to travel instead of attending nearest school from home
101581394,7612900,Ying Quah,Mar-03,Priority should be given to local Singaporean kids. I myself have seen those that are new citizens have been able to get into popular school whereas for us who is within the km based are unable to get into  .... why is that so ?

101581394,7612900,Yani June,Mar-04,It is time to consider scrapping off the voluntary work and those with RC benefits. It is the most absurd scheme. Only retain the alumni and sibling scheme...

101581345,52387900,Ye Naing Tun,Mar-01,"Bloody Sunday has sparked calls for an interim government and R2P  ***************************************   On Sunday, a global holiday, Burmese people are not able to rest like millions of people around the world.  Bullets fired by those who pledged to protect the lives and property of the people, regardless of their lives, for the future independence of the country.  Bombs;  Fighting between numbers sticks has made history as a bloody Sunday.   The United Nations has confirmed that 18 people have been killed and many more injured in a brutal crackdown on a month-Fri uprising that day.   But the people of Burma are increasingly calling for tougher sanctions than the default Western condemnation of the United Nations, which is monitoring the situation in the country.   The situation is likely to get worse as the people are determined to fight hard for their future because of the fear of living under a military dictatorship.   At the same time, they are calling for help, using the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) enacted by the UN Leaders' Summit in December 2005 to protect their citizens from authoritarian regimes that are killing them violently.   There are three major stages in R2P.   The first step is for every government to establish a genocide site in its own country.  Ethnic cleansing;  We must protect ourselves from war crimes and atrocities against our citizens.   The second step is to put pressure on the government to comply with the international community if it fails to do so.   If the third step fails to do so, the international community must take timely and effective action in accordance with the UN Charter.   The situation in Burma is now clear that the coup d'Ã©tat is brutally killing its loyalists and civilians, and that the first and second steps have been taken.   The implementation of the R2P must be reported to the UN Secretary-General's Security Council, and the armed intervention must be approved by the Security Council.   So far, 80 UN Security Council resolutions have been adopted.  13 General Assembly resolutions;  The Human Rights Council has approved the need for R2P with 50 resolutions.  This is especially true of African countries.   In the current situation, there is a lack of funds and resources to intervene militarily.  The United Nations has strongly warned the coup not to move forward since the talks began, but it could be very effective and could save many lives for the people of Burma.   In this case, the UN Secretary-General himself does not need to ask for a request from the relevant government, but only on the ground.  The United Nations Secretary-General has vowed to try to thwart the coup, but the Burmese people are now questioning him about how many more should be killed in a war-torn country.   The situation in Burma is now facing serious social upheaval, and if it gets worse, it could lead to civil war.  The coup d'Ã©tat was so shocking that it, like the previous 72-hour gin, is now releasing a gin that says no foreign intervention in the event of a civil war.  There is no need to go too far and prove that this is not Gin.  You can see Russian troops attacking President Assad during the Syrian civil war.   Min Aung Hlaing faces the crisis of inviting international intervention even more violently, and the people and the military and police are as disgusted as the Fascist Japanese.   At home, the CRPH is preparing to form a caretaker government.  The CRPH does not have a rival government, as some say, because it has the legal right to do so.  Naming a rival government would be tantamount to recognizing the coup as a government.   The CRPH is now widely recognized by the people across the country as their legitimate government.  At the same time, there are a number of ways in which CRPH can be used to undermine public support.  His men are attacking him with criticism.   In collaboration with the CRPH, ambassadors and staff from many countries have been recalled for fear of participating in an internationally recognized diplomatic offensive, and instructions have been issued not to have any contact with the CRPH.  In addition, those who do not wish to join the CRPH must report to the Military Council by March 6, as the previous election as a Pyithu Hluttaw member has been canceled.  The Irrawaddy reports that the government has issued a statement saying it will take severe action.   But no one will take their orders for granted by force of arms.   This is why the CRPH recognizes that they are becoming a major threat.  CRPH's international relations representatives now include senior US government officials;  The lower house and the upper house are in contact with each other, and they should be encouraged to say, ""The military option will not be ruled out.""   The International Criminal Court (ICC) has set up a Special International Criminal Tribunal (ICRC) in Cambodia to try the crimes committed by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Cambodia after the break-up of the coup d'Ã©tat.  Even conscripts were sentenced to prison terms.  Many were imprisoned and forced to live with their children and spouses.  Therefore, we must be aware that the crimes we have committed have been in the shadows for many years.   It is also important to consider the geopolitical situation in which the United States and its allies will never have a Chinese-dominated Burma, as the Cold War of the twentieth century has shifted to the Asian front instead of Europe in the twentieth century.   Secretary-General of the United Nations;  US Secretary of State  A number of countries, including Indonesia, the EU foreign minister and members of the Asean front, have issued a statement condemning the massacre on Sunday.   Who will legitimize a government formed by people who are killing unarmed citizens?   The uprising must be won !!!"

It's not like a kindergarten or a Child care... it's a tution centre... so these kids comes from different Kindergartens or Primary schools. Pray hard... pray very hard that this is not a start of a new cluster. Those staying around the area must be careful when u have schooling kids... when ur kids are not well pls go to the doctor and get them tested. Pls dont be foolish and let it slide... Covid is not flu.

101581273,76177900,Bobby Tan,Feb-26,"Why is the report giving the public the impression that vaccinnated person will not get the infection or spread the virus? If they understand how a vaccine works, they should know that a vaccine will boost a person's ability to fight the infection more efficiently and effectively. It also reduces the severity of the symptoms, if there are any to begin with. Moreover the verdict is still not out whether the current Covid-19 vaccines can really totally prevent transmission.  Finally based on my understanding, one has got to realise that Sars-CoV-2 virus often do not elicit any symptoms in the infected person and yet that infected person can still transmit the virus to anyone."

Kids and teachers who visited the branch 2 weeks before she had symptoms until the day she was sent to hospital should be quarantined immediately.  Government please note  next thing you don't want to happen is you realise the whole of yishun and few schools will start to form cases and clusters.

101581252,7162900,Jimmy Beany,Feb-24,"He seem to have forgotten that children under 16 and pregnant woman cannot take the vaccine not to mention those with auto-immune and with serious allergies. The moment you allow mass import of people without SHN, you expose them all to the risk of getting the virus. Also just because you are vaccinated does not mean you cannot be a carrier of the virus. The symptoms are reduced, that's about it.  The constant deluge of imports even with pre-departure tests and SHN, shows that certs can be faked."

We are demanding the immediate release of all political activists and journalists unlawfully arrested Oromia, EthiopiaðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹.  We strongly request that to release Our Leaders 27 days of hunger strike  #OromoPoliticalPrisonersOfHungerStrike  #Starvingforjustice  #FreeAlloromoPoliticalPrisoners #JusticeforHachalu  #OromoProtests #FreeJawarMohammed  #FreeBekeleGerba #freeAbdiRagassa #FreeColonelGemechuAyana #Freedejenaxafa #FreeMeleseDirribsa #FreeHamzaBorana #Freeshemsedintaha #FreeMichaelBoran #FreeLammiibeenyaa #FreeDawitabdeta #FreeKennasaAyana  Day 27 of Hunger Strike at Kaliti Federal Prison. ____  Jawar Mohammed, Bekele Gerba, Hamza Borana and other Oromo political prisoners are on their 27th day of a hunger strike in Kaliti Federal Prison. They are all in critical condition. Seven of the strikers are hospitalized, and all of them have developed kidney problems.    The prisoners asserted that they started this hunger strike because of a worsening political condition and the derailed transition to democracy.   The Oromo political prisoners put their demands as follow:   1. Release All Oromo Political Prisoners  Jails and prisons are full of Oromos, more than any other group in the country. Currently there are more than 50,000 Oromo political prisoners in Ethiopia. In Kaliti alone there are more than 5,000 Oromo political prisoners, constituting 90% of the nationâ€™s entire prisoners.   There are also more than 30 Oromo political prisoners in Ethiopia who returned from different parts of the world following the 2018 promised transition to democracy. Among the returnees are high ranking officials of the OLF & OFC, including the most influential young political figure from the U.S, Jawar Mohammed.   Therefore, release all prisoners of conscience languishing in Ethiopian jails and prisons, of which the overwhelming majority are Oromo political prisoners.  2. Allow Oromo Political Party Offices to be Opened and to Operate Fully  More than 103 offices of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) across the country, including the HQ in Finfinne, have been closed by the government. More than 90 Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC) offices across Oromia are also now closed by the government.   The ruling party must stop the alienation and systematic disenfranchisement of the Oromo Nation from political participation in the country. Government must allow Oromo media TV station offices that were closed and their licenses suspended to be reinstated and to resume operations. We also demand that they organize an  all-inclusive national dialogue before the national election.  The government must open up and widen the political space in order to bring the derailed transition back on track, so that all who have vision for the betterment of Ethiopia could participate in a free and fair election.  Hence, the hunger strikers demand is to open and allow opposition political parties offices to operate. Stop the alienation, systematic disfranchisement and to open up the political space equally for all.  3. End Mistreatment of Families of Political Prisoners  Government security forces must end mistreatment of political prisoners while they visit their loved ones at Kaliti Prison and elsewhere. End any inhumane treatment of prisoners under custody or under investigation.   _____"

I never believed that anyone can solve someone's problems.I could rudely reply to the posts about the healers with insults little did i know that one day they will help me. The most grateful news of how my situation changed after a long period of suffering in an abusive marriage. My husband used to drink a lot and he loses all his mind and he could beat me up for no reason, I tried to settle matters with him but he kept a deaf ear, the worst thing was that I had failed to give him any kid, I conceived him twice but had miscarriages this made all his family to hate me and considered me as a person with bad luck but in reality I wanted to have kids so much. I looked for help in many places. Some used to tell me they could see darkness around my life and others could say bad luck while others could not give a serious reason behind my problems.and i that made mi to spend a lot reaching to the exetend of selling some of my things trying to get a better life with my husband bt i wouldn't loss hope,because of the situation i was facing! They all used to promise me good results but none could deliver, Most of the times when hardships come to us friends are few I was left alone crying every day and as a result, I lost my job because I couldn't perform well. Many friends left me and my husband filed a divorce and I became a laughing topic but I never lost hope. It was last year when I saw people writing about Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 and I felt interested to contact her one more time. I made my problems known to Mama who advised me to be cleansed from all that was making me suffer and to open up my luck in everything I do. I was asked to buy materials to help me which I did we begun the prayer and results were delivered in Four days. I thought it would be so easy but some stones remained unturned till last week when my husband came up with un apology to me for all he has been doing, he confessed for cheating and I forgave him and finally yesterday when i went for the check-up and the Mama confirmed that am two weeks pregnant with no complications. Am hoping to be a mother soon. Any woman out there facing the same in your love life please don't be ashamed of looking for help just contact Dr. Mama Shamirah +27790792882 privately by either a Call or Whatsapp or Email: mamashamirahsince1970@gmail.com "

The kiasi and kiasu culture in institutions do not allow for APNs to exercise professional judgement independently. Their decisions and actions invariably need to be rubber-stamped and endorsed by a registered medical practitioner for almost everything except the most routine of nursing tasks. "

When this government knew that there is an increasing number of COVID-19 countries, they donâ€™t even stop allowing people to get in so that they can keep the economy going. Yet you scold the people from going to work when they are sick. You think the government can be supporting them? You think companies will be sympathetic towards them. If this government is acting irresponsibly with their actions with peopleâ€™s approval, then they just have to live with the fact that people need to keep their money flowing even when they are sick. They are just following the leaders. If want to blame, guess who is first to be blame? Only the rich can have the right to earn money at whatever cost? What a bunch of hypocrites we have in this country."

Like wearing a concealed suit during flight.

We understand you cannot publicly and officially support the Peopleâ€™s fight against military coup in Myanmar. Even so, we request you not to empower, cooperate with and enable the military council which staged the coup unlawfully and against the peopleâ€™s will.   Many financial institutions in Singapore help the operation of the military junta and its businesses. Singapore is no longer in a stage to profit from the ill-gotten gains and do business with the state mafia like Myanmar military council. Pls freeze all assets and accounts associated with the Myanmar military council in Singapore-based financial institutions.   Do not strengthen the blood-thirsty hands that pull the triggers and kill innocent people in Myanmar."

Truth be told; the seizure of powers is a direct result of facing rejection by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi TWICE when the military tried to negotiate with her for their own interests.   The first negotiation was to renew the term of â€œCommander-in-chief Generalâ€ position for another 5-years to which our peopleâ€™s leader refused.   The second negotiation was to chair the Commander the â€œPresidentâ€ position to which our leader also bluntly refused.   Military coup and its seizure of powers is solely based on these two main reasons. The matter of True or False will be revealed, ascertained and proved for those who were involved and helped in this negotiation process still remain alive today.   The people of Myanmar must cease to go to work in order to destroy and bring down the system of military dictatorship. You will need not only to refuse to go to work yourself but also to encourage those around you to do the same.   #MilitaryDictatorshipMustFail"

What if the current vaccine does not have defences on this new kind of virus. This is another way to protect the frontline workers from getting infected. They will not be economic lost . They still have to be SHN or Quarantin upon arrival. Looking at those countries which does not have virus in the communities. What is happening now.Do you think those virus are from their communities. Our view is No.It is from those import.

This is a heinous crime and it is a rebellion against Daw Aung San Suu Kyi led Civilian Government.   We, People of Myanmar, do not recognize a rebel group led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and his puppet co-called a new cabinet.   Myanmar people are now showing their support for a democratically elected government through a series of non-violent ways such as non-cooperation with junta and its autocratic system; boycotting junta and its affiliates businesses and ex-communicating with their dummies; and, since yesterday, hundreds of thousands of people are staging the mass demonstrations around country.   Civil Servants and government employees are not going to offices in Myanmar starting from 8th February 2021 (Monday) as part of the Civil Disobedience Movement to show their support for a democratically elected civilian government.   People of Myanmar overwhelmingly voted for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi led NLD party and we only support our legitimate government led by President U Win Myint.   We, People of Myanmar, have a democratically elected parliament, the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH).

All front line workers must be vaccinated (2 jab) before come in contact with those import. Why he did not see the doctors ??? Earning lost .Will be Quarantin if infected . What is the preventive action . Companies are to pay their Medical fee .This include 60 days hospitalization cost. Why??? The tax payer $$$$ must be well spend. This is our view only.
101580893,37417900,Kenneth Cheong,Feb-09,Common sense tells me there's a high probability he caught it from the people he is ferrying to the shn facility. Don't they put on ppe?
101580893,37417900,Patricia Choy,Feb-09,1. Why was the bus driver unvaccinated? Should he not have received the vaccination before the engineer? *Unless he refused the vaccine  2.

Now we had frontline workers infected by imported cases. Did the MOH and the taskforce bother to find out why so many cases of sick people with  symptom not going to the doctor? would be because of the compulsory 5 days medical leaves? Most workers only have 14 days medical leaves."

101580893,37417900,Top FanJames Wong Kamkiat,Feb-09,"I assume that the driver needs to pay for his own for doctor consultation fees. Ultimately it is the cost(of medical fees) that impedes SEPs or ground people for digging into their own pockets for Doctor consultation at first instance of flu-like symptoms. It is not cheap(you know) to see a doctor; it is half a day wages (for the ground people) or between seeing a doctor or putting a meal on a table? MOH, think again!"
101580893,37417900,Andy Wee,Feb-09,The reason why we cannot open nightspots etc is because all these imported cases are the new dorm of 2021 The residents already played their part and are losing patience

101580893,37417900,Clarence Haw,Feb-09,"â€œHe developed a runny nose on Jan 31 but did not seek medical attention, MOH said.â€. This has been the standard de facto reply. As CNA reporters,donâ€™t they question MOH about their response? As many have commented, it was no fault of the bus driver. If having a runny nose means seeking immediate medical treatment and self isolation, most of the SG population would be queuing at clinics & hospitals. "
101580893,37417900,Anastasia WS,Feb-08,They should make it mandatory to seek medical advice upon onset of symptoms.

101580893,37417900,èƒ¡ç‘žå¿ ,Feb-09,"The SG strategy from the ways the control measures , front line and high risk groups gets tested every bi weekly is to allow all activities to resume as normally as they could while the infected cases can still be monitored and control within a small sum of controllable cluster. gain some but loose some. Who to sacrifice and who to be save has always been clear . No one has the right answer since pre covid until now. Every country has diff approach. Who are we to judge which is the right and best move. Only the elected gov has that right."

101580893,37417900,Michael Tan,Feb-09,Seeing a doctor during this pandemic will get at least 3-5days medical leave. Some companies are looking at it as a casual MC & somehow affect the workers performance. Some are hesitating to see a doc if they think itâ€™s just a cough or flu. No doubt itâ€™s not wise at this time of pandemic. Perhaps companies shld do away with all this MC as part of their appraisal in accessing the worker performance & encourage them to see doctor if unwell.

First, the military stopped the use of Facebook where Myanmar civilians have been sharing news and Civil Disobediemce Campaigns. Now, the military has completely shut down the internet, cutting off the country from the rest of the world.   I cannot contact my parents, relatives and friends. My friends have not been able to contact their families either.  Civil disobedience campaigns have spreaded across the country, with health professionals being at the forefront of it. Myanmar civilians are fighting peacefully for the end to military dictatorship once and for all. We are all fighting peacefully for democracy.  The pans and pots bearing campaign is still going on every night at 8 pm to show rejection to the coup. In Myanmar tradition, pots and pans are banged to drive evil from your home.   May the World know that we are resisting the coup and fighting back peacefully.  Please help Myanmar by calling your Govenrment and your representatives to take immediate and swift actions toward these military junta. #crd #savemyanamar  #rejectmilitarycoupmyanmar #HearTheVoiceOfMyanmar"

Just 6 days after Myanmar military has seized control of the country in a coup and detaining the country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratically-elected leaders while making up charges to hold them, Myanmar has now gone dark. First, the military stopped the use of Facebook where Myanmar civilians have been sharing news and Civil Disobediemce Campaigns. Now, the military has completely shut down the internet, cutting off the country from the rest of the world.   I cannot contact my parents, relatives and friends. My friends have not been able to contact their families either.  Civil disobedience campaigns have spreaded across the country, with health professionals being at the forefront of it. Myanmar civilians are fighting peacefully for the end to military dictatorship once and for all. We are all fighting peacefully for democracy.  The pans and pots bearing campaign is still going on every night at 8 pm to show rejection to the coup. In Myanmar tradition, pots and pans are banged to drive evil from your home.   May the World know that we are resisting the coup and fighting back peacefully.  Please help Myanmar by calling your Govenrment and your representatives to take immediate and swift actions toward these military junta. #crd #savemyanamar  #rejectmilitarycoupmyanmar #HearTheVoiceOfMyanmar"

Is the temperature monitor devices effective to detect those who have this virus but taken panadol before they pass through custom or any safe entry building??? FW get infected. Where did he get infected from??? As a prevention .Should all FW be place on designated route. Eg . Not travel in public transport. Stay within the work place or work sites and temporary not allow them into the communities. If this vaccine is full proof . 100 per cent of FW must be vaccinated.

101580864,77017900,Jackson,Feb-07,"To be honest, as I said Houng-Koung and Taiwan must think about carefully Myanmar Military coup. On other side, China Government advocated Myanmar Military coup early. Because, Chia is having a plan to control the Indo-Pacific affairs, which completely instills a sense of communism to the South East Asia Countries as they will become an One China Country. ( According to One China Policy). And then, South Asia Countries ( such as Loas, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam,..etc) will have to go under the communist inevitability. ### As we are South East Asia citizens and love democracy. So, we have to move together in unity to get Democracy for our countries. We all need the truly human rights and must demand justice for as we really love Democracy. Donâ€™t say anything, think about carefully China and Myanmar Military coup if you have a smart brain. Please, combine with Myanmar Citizens and had better attain to get Democracy for our South East Asia countries. We will have to fight for our countries democracy,human rights, the younger generation. #Reject Myanmar Coup. # Against China Policy, and China Economic Trap#"

Doctors and nurses from over 180 hospitals and medical departments in Myanmar walked out of their duties despite being in the middle of the pandemic, leading the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) by refusing to work under dictatorship and calling for help from the international medical community.  . MYANMAR COUP: Amidst chaos in the COVID-19 crisis, the military unlawfully seized control of the countryâ€™s sovereignty by overthrowing the democratically elected government which won a landslide victory in a recent 2020 election. Myanmarâ€™s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the President Win Myint were arrested by the armed forces before dawn of 01/02/2021 which ultimately led to Dawn of Injustice. BACKGROUND: Myanmar had been under Military Junta for 50 years (1962 - 2011). Military dictators were notorious for how brutal they were to their own people, slaughtering thousands of civilians across multiple uprisings. Despite being a Buddhist country, they did not hesitate to gun down Buddhist monks in the 2007 Saffron Revolution. A hard-won democracy was achieved after people had elected Suu Kyiâ€™s party for the first time in 2015.  . WHAT ARE THE RESPONSES: Waking up to a morning only to find out your world has turned upside down is not novel for Myanmar people but we are certainly filled with utter dismay due to mayhem brought about by the Burmese Military. So far, it has been a â€œBloodless Coupâ€ given that the military used lethal forces against protesters previously. People are banging pots and pans at nightfall during night-time curfew as our tradition to do so to force â€œEvil Beingsâ€ out of neighbourhood.  . CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT (CDM): Healthcare workers in Myanmar had initiated the movement expressing opposition to the authoritarian rule. Medical students, preceptors and rectors had also joined forces to defy continuing medical education under dictatorship. As the campaign picked up steam, other university students, lecturers and staff from government organizations became a part of CDM.  . OUR OBJECTIVE: Our main goal is to abolish the bureaucratic chain of illegitimate military regimes, once and for all, using a non-violent approach. We are protesting for the release of our leaders and the return of sovereignty back to the civilian mandated government.  . WHAT CAN YOU HELP: We need your VOICE. We would like you to spread the message of what is happening in Myanmar, and we need your SUPPORT. The immoral regime is weakening us by using psychological warfares including warnings to revoke medical licenses, unjust dismissals and offering specialized training as a quid pro quo. We would like the international medical community to stand together with us. Even a tweet, a social media post or a letter of moral support to our brothers and sisters would mean a whole lot to fuel our endurance in this longlasting battle against injustice using the following hashtags:  #HearTheVoiceOfMyanmar  #RespectOurVotes  #CivilDisobedienceMovement  Credit"
101580841,15782900,Peter Chua,Feb-07,"Say so much also useless. At this current state, the only way is to protect ourselves and adhere to the basic preventive measures. Wear a mask and properly whenever we are outside. Try to avoid crowded and confine places or keep a social distancing wherever possible. Wash or sanitize our hands regularly as we are bound to touch so many things including changed currency notes or coins. The most dangerous place is the food outlets where everyone remove their mask for the food and drink. An infected person may be sitting around us. Try not to talk so much during meal and can do so after food with our mask put on. Only we can protect ourselves including others."

Our leader Daw Aun San Suu Kyi & president U Win Myint and many others are still detained and under house arrest.   This is the violation of human rights.

One of them is no shouting of ""Auspicious Phrase"" during loh hei even with our mask on during this CNY. Latest measure is no light up for the OX decorations in China Town. They the Ox will say thank you very much because they can rest early. More upgrading of measure may be coming to counter the virus. Bear in mind now is already 2021 and not 2019.

Hence, while we do not know who are those uniquely few, strengthen ur body by taking supplements and live a healthy lifestyle. Studies had discovered that Vit-D is helpful to the body in fighting against Covid-19. And itâ€™s esp more so for pple like me above 50yo whom may hv Vit-D deficiency.

Just 6 days after Myanmar military has seized control of the country in a coup and detaining the country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratically-elected leaders while making up charges to hold them, Myanmar has now gone dark. First, the military stopped the use of Facebook where Myanmar civilians have been sharing news and Civil Disobediemce Campaigns. Now, the military has completely shut down the internet, cutting off the country from the rest of the world.   I cannot contact my parents, relatives and friends. My friends have not been able to contact their families either.  Civil disobedience campaigns have spreaded across the country, with health professionals being at the forefront of it. Myanmar civilians are fighting peacefully for the end to military dictatorship once and for all. We are all fighting peacefully for democracy.  The pans and pots bearing campaign is still going on every night at 8 pm to show rejection to the coup. In Myanmar tradition, pots and pans are banged to drive evil from your home.   May the World know that we are resisting the coup and fighting back peacefully.

You may think imported is imported, won't affect the local community, but they still add on the risk to Singapore. If this goes on sooner or later local community cases will have to rise simply because Singapore is just a 700+kmÂ² island which you can literally walk the whole of Singapore in just a day"

101580804,27762900,Erich Flores,Feb-05,"The coronavirus IS a biological weapon developed by USA when Trump was President. And they conveniently passed the blame to China and got the tycoon-controlled US media to flog it so, everyday. The truth eventually prevails. (Source of Covid-19 - USA  Trump is over! Many acts of injustice will kill themselves, and the sky has the eyes and does not avoid it!   Heaven has reincarnation,  Who did God let go? Shocking!   Today the poisoning killer was finally found, and it really was the United States!  The truth is creepy, the new crown virus is man-made and originated from the P3 virus laboratory in North Carolina, USA ! Greg Rubini, a well-known American intelligence expert, officially revealed the secrets of this day in an interview with the First News Network television channel.   According to Greg, the new crown virus was genetically engineered as a biological weapon. It originated from the BSL-3 laboratory in North Carolina and was developed by Professor Ralph Barrick.  He also stated that the virus was spread from North Carolina to China, Italy and the entire United States by the ""dark government"".   Greg once tweeted and questioned Trump : Why didn't you tell the American people that the virus was made by the United States?  Why not make it clear that the new coronavirus itself is a biological weapon? Coincidentally, Professor  Montagnier, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of HIV , recently revealed to French reporters that the new coronavirus is not naturally occurring, but is carefully developed by biomolecular scientists . Montagnier also said: Obviously, professionals have added HIV sequences to this virus from bats.  This is undoubtedly the biggest and worst poisoning case ever .  Since the outbreak of the epidemic, rumors about ""the new crown virus is a synthetic biological weapon "" have been heated up, and scientists from various countries have been working hard to trace the source of the virus.   As early as February, Indian scientists discovered the HIV virus insert in the new coronavirus , which proved that the virus was artificially designed and synthesized .   In mid-March, scientists discovered that the new coronavirus extracted from a patient in Washington state had an evolutionary cycle of more than half a year.  With the deepening of research, many countries in the world have turned their skepticism toward the United States.   Japan, Italy, Australia and other countries all have early confirmed cases originating from the United States.   Subsequently, Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, admitted that many of the deaths of the ""flu"" that broke out in the United States in September 2019 were caused by the new crown virus .  In this regard, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country also questioned the United States on Twitter. After the arduous efforts of a team of reporters in Virginia, USA, it was finally traced back to patient zero . This Covin-19 patient zero is indeed an American soldier who participated in the Wuhan Military Games in October last year. Her name is Maatje Benassi .  This American female officer has a very special background. She has a great connection with the P4 Biochemical."

101580784,52467900,One Opinion,Feb-05,How did she pass the swab tests during SHN then?
101580784,52467900,Mini Sing,Feb-05,"Because she has recovered and was not shedding active virus. Antibodies can take several days/weeks to develop after an infection and often stay in the blood for weeks after recovery. The PCR test is so sensitive it could be picking up fragments of dead virus from old infections and it cannot distinguish between genetic material (RNA or DNA) from infectious virus and the ""dead"" virus fragments that can linger in the body long after a person recovers. And that is what happened when she took the latest pre departure Covid PCR swab test.  So a Serological test was conducted to confirm if it was a current infection but the tests came back postive    confirming it was likely a past infection. In general, individuals are likely to test positive for their serological test if they had contracted COVID-19 more than 10 to 14 days before the test."

If they need to see their family, the person in Singapore should fly back to their country to see them.  Many people contributing to our society from neighboring countries had not seen their families for months or year. This is a pandemic. Do what we can but there should be a limit."

True, that nobody want to be sick, but you are putting yourself (and others) at risk.. not worth the trouble of having to self quarantine for days, repeated swabbings and still ends up being tested positive.. #lesstravel #stayputfortimebeing"
101580759,73417900,Jason Yeoh,Feb-04,She went back to India on nov 2020 and back to sg on jan2021. And got covid. Who is paying  for her expenses 
101580759,73417900,Sherine Kong,Feb-03,Although we are in phase 3 reopening my family continues to minimise time spent outside. We do grocery shopping on weekdays to avoid the crowd. We dine out less. We stay home more. It upsets us when we read in the news some foreign talent or their dependents are flying back and forth frequently as if the pandemic is over and brought the virus back to Singapore with them and into our community. Very angry!
101580759,73417900,Kelvin Yeah,Feb-04,LTVP is it so essential? Why keep allowing and issue such passes at this pandemic? Why allowing a country that is so high infection to come in SG everyday? Is this so called proper risk assessment being done? Stop playing with fire on people's life for god sake.
101580759,73417900,Kok-Wai N Lezlie Foong,Feb-03,1. Failed to swap at the end of the 14-day SHN but cleared to return to the community 2. 14-day SHN shown once again to be possibly insuffcient 3.

101580759,73417900,Robert Tan,Feb-03,1 community case is very negligent but should not take it lightly. Everyday those clowns and jokers are importing huge number of cases is more worrying.
101580759,73417900,Patrick D Soh,Feb-04,Does that meant the onset of the virus is after SHN period?. Why no extension of longer SHN duration for traveller from such country.  This is not the first case reported.

101580759,73417900,One Opinion,Feb-04,"Actually this case in my personal opinion goes to show how an imported infection slips unawares into the community. This is in fact the second case that was asymptomatic as well as if they donâ€™t take a pre-departure test, their infection would have gone unnoticed. Trying not to imagine that they have gone round spreading in the community already."
101580759,73417900,Swan Kua,Feb-04,Seems like Imported cases on long term pass seeking refuge in Singapore.

101580759,73417900,Tan KC,Feb-04,People like this who travel in and out of S'pore should not be allowed to enter. They don't care about the risk caused to this country because they are not citizens. Why citizens sacrifice and restrict travel while such people can travel in and out freely without consideration. The authority must explain to the citizens of this country.
101580759,73417900,Fook Kee Ho,Feb-04,"This called into question how reliable is the swab test? Can she really remember all the places and persons she met during the 14 days she was out of her SHN? It does not give Singaporeans any comfort whether MOH reclassify her as an 'imported case' or not. She would be infectious during the 14 days out of her SHN period. Hopefully we wouldn't have stricter restrictions before the lunar new year. A lot of local F&B businesses are already affected by the latest restrictions. Will Singapore economic be greatly affected if she is not allowed to go back to India (Nov. 30) during the period of highest covid-19 incidences, returned within a month and fly back again after a month including 14-days SHN? Our Govt. 'encouraged' S'pore companies to ""work from home"", why not 'encourage' foreign companies to work from Singapore?"
101580759,73417900,One Opinion,Feb-04,This is a pandemic and they are flying in and out. Is there a strong justification? 
101580759,73417900,Adrian Pok,Feb-03,"Seriously, what the heck is going on? These people are entering and exiting Singapore as if itâ€™s a hotel, and bringing the covid-19 virus with them, and potentially infecting the rest of population after they are supposedly â€œcovid-freeâ€ after their 14-day SHN"
101580759,73417900,Kenneth Cheong,Feb-04,Looks like need a longer stay home notice...Should extend to 4 weeks just to be sure. Also good for hotels revenue.
101580759,73417900,Chien Nelson,Feb-04,The way they report so nonchalantly show that it is so norm for them as if this is not unexpected.....

101580759,73417900,CK Tan,Feb-04,Joggers should jog during off peak hours.  I have seen joggers who jog during 7 am next to the children who are going to school.  The virus does not care whether you are jogging or not.
101580759,73417900,Aernawaniz Abu,Feb-03,can you imagine if she didnâ€™t have to travel back to india and didnâ€™t take the 2nd swab test? why are we still allowing people to come in when they clearly hold a threat to the community? not surprising if there are asymptomatic cases in the community right now given how high our daily imported rates are.
101580759,73417900,Yu Fong,Feb-04,"Can we ban long term or short term visit pass holders coming to Singapore from high risk countries? Especially from India or Indonesia?Above community case shows this person travel frequently between India and Singapore on monthly basis.  If they need to see their family in Singapore, they can do zoom meeting like us. They don't need physical presence here. Otherwise, please extend their SHN from 14 days to 21 days! "

101580752,99057900,Joe Koshi San,Feb-03,If they insist on importing Infected people at least think of the well being of the citizens. How can they put them on home isolation? I'm sure their home has other people there. Then he/she pass the bug to the other hse member. They will go out & infect others when they go out take public transport and eat at coffee shop or restaurant. Is having more than 8 family member together more dangerous than having infected people stay together with negative family members?

101579905,19647900,Siti Nor'aini A S,Jan-01,I guess its inevitable.. travellers coming in and out everyday.. and those workers working in certain industries are very vulnerable in getting infected and sadly spreading it to their loved ones.. the need of foreign helpers for many families dont help either.. to close our borders indefinitely dont help too.. sigh.. we can just hope all will recover soon enough.. #staysafe #staypositive
101579905,19647900,Sheliya Wong,Jan-01,"Gathering from the article, I know itâ€™s not nice to hear but ...Frontliners and their family members also must be considerate lah. In my personal opinion and observations, if you know you are a frontliner , then you and your immediate household should have the moral responsibility to please take all precautionary measures whether or not you have been required to do so. This is not only public health safety but also for the sake of your own families, friends and neighbours. Government and company may come up with new precautionary restrictions but if the frontliners and immediate household themselves do not adhere to these also jiaklak one. Sometimes they think never mind one lah. Got so serious meh? or they think no one will know. Like previously, air crew come back no need SHN. Thatâ€™s a no brainer lah. Where got no need quarantine one when other travellers have to do 14 days? Even now, 7 days self-isolation. Who knows if air crew donâ€™t observe ? It will take maturity and civic-mindedness of frontliners and their immediate household to help stop the spread of the virus. Sorry not nice to hear but this must be pointed out. #SGUnited"

Now we see the real reason the PM said its voluntary to take the vaccine, knowing full well of this.

101579360,5192900,Choon Lee Liew,"Dec 7, 2020","I am suggesting to take a critical look.  It is not very meaningful to have zero local community cases for x number of days if things don't change.  It is only zero detected local community cases, till the day when someone got a bit 'sicker' and get referred for testing.  In the meantime, the daily or almost daily imported cases should be a cause for concern.  I don't know the details of course.  But apparently the imported must be on plane or have been at the airport facilities, and there may be interaction with local ground staff or anyone else who happened to be in close proximity before the case was detected as an imported case.  All it takes is just a small slip and the 'carrier' (who may end up as asymptomatic but will still pass the virus) will then be out in the community.  How do we reduce that risk drastically ?  Especially if somehow this daily statistics of imported cases don't seem to take a 'rest' at all.  What will happen to the medical staff and other folks who take care of the new, increasing cases and they also have families to go back to at end of the day.  I am sure all 'possible' precautions have been taken, whether at airport, the plane, facilities or at the medical venues but can we relook at reducing the source drastically enough so that we wouldn't be worrying about a possible wave."

This means you now need to self isolate and take the COVID-19 test. I cannot give you any information about the person or the whereabouts of contact due to privacy laws. But you need to be tested within the next 72 hours. So, can I get the best mailing address for you so that we can send out a testing kit?â€  After you give the address, they will ask for your payment card number and details quoting that the test kit and results is a $50 charge and is not free.  If you refuse to give them your bank card / credit card details, they threaten saying that there are penalties for not complying.  So, please be wary.

When you burn natural resources, it needs to have a justifiable purpose. When you burn it to bring people to their destination, it makes sense to do so. When you burn it just to satisfy nonsensical egos of being up in the sky? That's just a pure waste of fuel and contribution to emission, nothing else is achieved than to satisfy the cravings of minds wanting to be in the air.  Since there aren't many flights these days. I think it would be good to consolidate flights in a certain terminal and leave the rest for a big scale shopping dining concept that includes as much aircrafts as the freed up terminals can accommodate. Cabin crews can double up as retail / dining crews for the time being till passenger flights frequency recovers.  Heck even if you convert the freed up terminals to accommodate more cargo flights, that makes more sense to burn fuel than to fly to nowhere."
101577652,61002900,Kheng Leong Fong,"Sep 20, 2020","I think can modify the initiative a bit. Perhaps give passengers the inflight experience without the plane actually taking off! This would cut down on unnecessary pollution and environmental impact.

Do it on a small scale to test out the responses like a pop up dining or shopping concept first."

Is there a proper channel for the suggestions? My suggestions will be, since planes and pilots need to fly once in a while for obvious reasons, SIA can allocate the flying slots for paying passengers to be boarded in business/first class seats with related services/meals for the duration. This is one experience not many commoners have the luxury. I would not pay for eco seats services hor. Please dont charge like $5k hor, we are also subsidizing your servicing flights too. In addition, do have planes to nowhere running along the taxiway/runway and parked for a cheaper experience in the stated seat classes. Lastly, allow us to use the $100 to off set the experience.

It may be hard to let go of the so called prestige or the idea that ecoomic growth must always go up to survive. But just as we are getting used to idea that population growth is not a must to survive, the same should be said for economic growth and consumerism either. Maybe we will all turn into a Hunger Games scenario where flights are only possible for the ultra rich. Maybe travelling physically will be something our kids and grandkids do once in their lifetime. Whatever it is, arguments about economy vs environment is pointless. There is no economy without a planet. Look at US if you are not sufficiently worried.

Thought SIA had turn ON their engine and left idle for 30min every week or 2 (base on I think CNN insider or something similar to CNN. Their interview w airport on how the craft maintain.. I know many are park at desert airport. Low humidity n less rust.)  So even the plane are well taken care of.. the pilot n co pilot skills might not be that good due to long time never fly.  So is a win win situation.  Let the plane fly to nowhere.  Oh perhaps can take a short tour. As in non disembarking destination... er.. say    Fly from Singapore to KL or Indonesia or anywhere not more then 7 hour in return flight.  Example..  SG to Siam Reap touh n go back SG. Within 6 hour.  So for people like me who can only afford air tickets but not the tour n stay there to have a once a life time flight experience.

101577652,61002900,Gabriel Goh,"Sep 20, 2020","The answer is suggested in the question: ""Flights to nowhere"". Is that where SIA is headed?  There are three issues to flying in general, and not just SIA. 1) Will people want to fly again? Based on the ""demand"" for flights to nowhere (in Taiwan and elsewhere?), the answer may be yes. From a personal perspective (if I am representative of many if not most people), yes. We WANT to fly, to travel. But CAN we? 2) Will people have the wherewithal (resources) to fly again? During this lockdown, people lost jobs, lost income, dug into savings, put off projects while they pilfered resources set aside for those projects, spend to keep businesses and income streams alive, and basically depleted or at the very least diminished their savings, financial reserves, and resources. In the short term, they will be working to rebuild their reserves. At the same time, airlines will be recovering from the global lockdown and devastation to their industry. They will have to rethink and restrategise their business. Where in the past, business travellers are a sure thing and leisure travellers can be enticed with low fares to offset costs, that may not be the case in the future. Business travel may be severely cut. Why fly when you can zoom? Why lower fares for leisure travellers when you cannot entice them? 3) Is it responsible, environmentally/morally right to fly again for frivolous reasons (like touring)? Regardless of whether tourism is frivolous (yes, it is a major global economy), commercial flights are a major contributor to pollution because of jet fuel. However more efficient/environmentally friendly aircraft are nowhere in sight (the Celera 500 is still at least 5 years away, and it is NOT scalable to even say a 60 seater. Maybe AirAsia can!) Electric planes are not exactly on the horizon (tho, the Celera 500 is supposedly ready for electric, but it is not tested.) So how can we fly to Japan, Australia, Europe or Americas without the polluting jet engines?  As for SIA, as a purely International Airline, it needs international flights. This is the major problem in the long run."
101577652,61002900,Vincent Woon,"Sep 21, 2020","Stopping this service don't mean that the planes don't get to fly. Given that pilots need to clock their hours and the planes cannot be grounded for long, it seems that the only choices are for them to (I) fly an empty plane, or (ii) fly a plane with some passengers. The other way is that post Covid, you want to ride in a plane with pilots that had only flight simulator training the past year.  Our carbon footprint for this service given our size is likely to be insignificant compared to what the bigger countries emit"

101577003,162900,Peter Chua,"Aug 24, 2020","As long we follow strictly to all the safety measures, we will be quite safe. Otherwise all who were in the same location with them would have been infected. Don't stay too long in a confine or crowded area. Any where, a infected person, though wearing a mask but not properly coupled with his/her hands touching so many things in the public place could cause transmission of the virus  unknowingly. Since we also touch countless of things, it is very very important to wash or sanitize our hands very very regularly. But practically, I believe not all will do it. Therefore, if possible choose one of our hands to touch anythings while the other hand is reserve to touch our face if need to which should be washed or sanitized once we use it accidentally/wrongly. But again how many people will do this safety method ? Sometime, we could be sitting next to a infected person in a bus or train or anywhere but have we been infected by them if we follow all safety measure ? If not, what will happen to the whole population by now ? Some people complain why there is no social distancing in buses or SMRT trains. Could they show us how to do it since so many people are taking it especially during peak hours ? By doing so when one reach their work place, it could be half day gone. Then all will start to push each others just to be able to get into the train so that they will not be late for work. And the blaming weapon will start to fire. And then,we would have to run thousands of trains and buses and at every 60 or less seconds interval in order to cope. But how about the cost of operation ? How about paying 10 times our normal fare ? Then we will hear another different complain. Inside a bus or train if it is not urgent, try not to talk or use the HP and loudly. One can always sms or whatsapp and arrange to talk later. It is very interesting to dig into the cause of those who are infected if they "" CLAIM "" they have followed strictly with the safety measures. I often observed people not wearing a mask properly (may be due to breathing difficulties. It will be more worst with N95 mask due to its low micron). Some wear their mask covering just their mouth with the nose fully exposed. It defeat the purpose of wearing it. To be more safe don't go near those who never put on a mask after their meal at eating place but still talk so much, laugh so much and sometime even quarrel or argue for reasons only known to themselves. To these people, please find an open and isolated suitable space to continue . You may not infect others or they may not infect you too if either party is an infected one. This is the logic."

You are a news platform, and that means you ought to dispense news without any racial prejudice... Why is that when it is reported that a Singaporean or a PR got the virus, no race is mentioned...

When cases were low, some people said that not enough tests were being done or that the G was hiding the numbers because GE is coming. When cases increased, they said this was the result of re-opening too soon and that there will sure to be a spike in two weeksâ€™ time. Why does it seem to me that some people just like to spread negativity and hear bad news? It is expected that cases will increase as we re-open but if everyone takes personal and social responsibility, we will be okay."

Many construction and infrastructure projects are still unable to resume because the dorms are not fully cleared. Large number of migrant workers have yet to obtain the green light to start work. Many of these projects will be delayed and no one can tell how long these projects will be delayed which is very disturbing. The longer this take the long the economy will be impacted.

Thus I am glad the article gave a clear distinction between those really suffering from OCD and those who merely have obsessive compulsive traits.   For those who like to call themselves OCD, have the behaviour severely interfere with your life?  Quote from article ""The repetitive, ritualistic thoughts, ideas and behaviours seen in clinical OCD are very time-consuming for people dealing with them, and they significantly interfere with several important areas of the personâ€™s life, including work, school and social interactions.  Some people have obsessive-compulsive traits that are less severe. These traits are often observed in high-achieving people and are not clinically debilitating.''

World communities  got to 1)accept the existence  of spiritual  sicknesses affecting mankind.  2) to gain spiritual  knowledge, appreciation n acceptance of surrounding elements..'human existence  is dictated  by surrounding  elements.'.3) to live harmoniously  with Nature Creation.  The appreciation of elements, take for example..  ..Medical Science (MS)  advocate the use of medical cream to deal with itchy skin rashes/blisters caused by Airborne  Viruses (AVs)  .ie.. from chickenpox, foot n mouth infection..  Asian Holistic healing techniques  in dealing with these AVs that causes itchy skin rashes/blisters is by simply applying 'freshly burnt  ashes' rubbing over on affected skin area will effectively stop the itchiness n spread..n later drying up the rashes.  This is abt applying element to deal with spiritual  sickness.  The application  of freshly burnt ashes can also be applied  to blisters, stopping the spread caused by the close-contact herpes zoster virus...but this application  mustn't  be construed  as a cure,  just stopping the spread only.  Cos,  dealing with close-contact viruses required another form of treatment. That is by applying this treatment  logic 'if it's an unorthodox sickness,  it got to be treated  with 'unorthodox  herbs'.   In fact,  we Asian Holistic practice is trying to set a new precedent  in dealing with spiritual  sicknesses.. Therefore,  in dealing with modern days spiritual  sicknesses, mostly  virus derived, it's time for MS to take a back seat.. Just do wat they (MS) are good at by using antibiotics thus,  applying this treatment  logic 'good germ kill bad germ' To learn more abt the existence of spiritual sicknesses...can be viewed at "" https://yangholisticcentre.com/ "" Email :yeodanny5@gmail.com.

With that dateline, Parliament will need to be dissolved by Jan 2021. Our annual budget is typically announced in Feb and it covers a period from Apr current year to Mar the following year. Meaning, once Parliament is dissolved in Jan 2021, if elections hadn't been held by then, the govt cannot pass any budget for next year. Meaning no war chest to continue the fight against CoVid-19, whether via personal grants or business grants. Also means no budget at all for Apr 2021 - Mar 2022. A stand-in temporary govt will also not have powers to pass a budget. So there really isn't a choice whether to hold the elections or not.

If this is to be expected,  should the task force be even more cautious about reopening communal-dependent environments like schools? Say maybe just allow the graduating classes to go back to school or consider the option to let parents decide if they mind taking the risks for the kids of other levels to go back to schools. For those who opt to stay home, MOE can explore the idea of virtual live lessons. Maybe that will placate and cater to parents with different degree of anxieties? This is a new world and a new world means we all have to try whatever possible to make things right which is protecting lives and livelihood. It is time for school leaders too to get together to brainstorm how to better protect their shared workplace instead of just waiting for MOE HQ to give directives. This is a good opportunity for school leaders to step up their act because you know your schools best. And patience is key too while we all scramble to find best solution for this new world. Whatever it takes, it is best that we avoid another 'dorms' scenario. Because if schools fall victim next, it would mean  households would be next. That would be dire."

The ministry also said that a confirmed case had visited Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre on May 26 from 9am to 10.30am.  Those who had been identified as close contacts of confirmed cases would already have been notified by MOH.  As a precautionary measure, persons who had been at these locations during the specified timings should monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit. They should see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose), as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.

My meaning is they try to test 5k per day, but after only 1k, already have 11 local cases. So better stop, if not, sure got more local cases, then siao  lioa.!  Omg! That's not healthy at all. ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±"

Just worry how we can quickly get rid and back to normal You are lucky enough to be able to give your comments here to complain and worry. Please think about those who have to worry how to get money to settle theirs households bills and utilities. If you worry, just do your parts or donâ€™t go out.  Spare thoughts for our fellow Singaporean due to CB, their income was affected or Zero return. Please donâ€™t let others think that Singaporean just know how to complain only. We hope everything can quickly back to normal so that those affected can start to get back to work to have a proper income to settle theirs bills. We need to end the phases fast for those to be able to work again to earn their living. Remember if you keep complaining about cases up and now or CB so fast removed, then stay home. Others need to get back to work to earn for a living during this hard time so CB really need to lift up quickly. Spare thoughts for others who are in hardships now.  Donâ€™t rub salts on others wound. We are a nation so we need to stand up for each other. Stay Safe and take care!"

101574833,87102900,Alvin Kuo,"Jun 3, 2020","<One Farrer Hotel general manager Gilbert Madhavan told CNA that ""relevant authorities determine who are selected for testing based on public health priorities"".>  Reading from the comments, guess a number may mistaken that the priority group refers to vehicle owners only. What it probably means is that there are people which needs to be tested due to their work requirements (e.g. essential services) or through contact tracing and currently the only way is to request them to come physically into an healthcare facility to be tested.  This drive-thru approach is an alternative where some can come in their own vehicles and they do not need to disembark for the healthcare workers to test them. This implementation was already done in Korea very early in the crisis and it is a win-win situation as it reduces the need for those to be tested to have any interaction with others as compared to having them to come into a building physically.  Don't have to interpret it as privilege group just because they come in their own vehicles."

101574780,64087900,Goh Meng Seng,"Jun 1, 2020","Thought of the Day - No Confidrnce in Headless Chicken PAP Leaders  The whole PAP Government 4G Task Force are led by HEADLESS CHICKEN!  They keep changing rules and regulations like changing diapers and underwear!  Most importantly, they are totally out of touch from the reality on the ground and they lack differential common sense as well!  For a start, how can we actually have confidence in PAP leader who thought Cotton comes from Sheep?   How can we have confidence in leaders who keep changing Rules and Regulations.  From You don't need to wear mask to, compulsory must wear mask.  From food handlers can wear spit guards to spit guards not allowed.  From Face Shields are as good as face mask to Face Shield can only be used  when social distancing is possible to face mask is default!  It really makes people wonder whether they know exactly what they are doing in the first place!   Putting on a mask or face shield or even a spit guard will have Two functions with varying degree of effectiveness. It is PROTECTION from infection by others and PREVENTION of infecting others.  In order to understand what are suitable in different situations, we must understand the nature of how this virus spread.   The virus spread by large and tiny droplets of saliva and mucus. It may also be spread by aerosal.  It can spread through speaking, coughing or sneezing.   Although I am no expert but common sense tell us that as long as ALL people could prevent their droplets of mucus or saliva from getting spread to other people through speaking, coughing or sneezing, everyone will be protected by such preventive measures.   In the context of UNIVERSAL Masking, the most important function is Prevention of spreading saliva and mucus to others, while Protection from infection will become secondary.  Thus, no matte what, we must ensure that everyone should put on something which will PREVENT WEARERS from spreading saliva and mucus to others EFFECTIVELY.  Between a Plastic Shield vs a piece of paper based mask, which will be more effective in preventing water droplets from passing through and spread to others?   That's a no brainer question.   I have dealt with face mask sourcing and there is something called Splash Test.   Surgical masks have to pass the Splash test  by blocking up to 95% of fine droplets before it could be certified effective.  Splash test is a simulation of saliva and mucus  being cough out or sneeze out at a certain pressure.   Many of the face masks in the market are actually not certified or even tested!   Cloth mask which are not made of non woven material will have doubtful effectiveness as well.   A plastic shield or even a plastic spit guard will definitely be more effective that a paper mask which is not tested or certified.  Spit guard may have much weaker prevention of infection by others due to the fact it is open on the top but it is close to the mouth as well as the nose. Whatever sneeze, coughing or saliva from wearer will be effectively blocked right at the outlets of mouth or nostrils.  Face shield protects the eyes, mouth and nose, from direct hit while at the same time prevent droplets from straight trajectory. The only weakness is that droplets could still drop directly downward from the mouth. But as long as no one is position below the wearer, that's pretty OK.  Face shield may not be suitable for MRT or buses because there might be people sitting below the wearer. Other than that it is perfectly alright in the context of universal masking!  Face shields with proper cover on the forehead provides good protection for most situation. It should be made mandatory for those who are jogging or exercising where they can't wear face mask.   When you are exercising, you will be breathing out heavily and there will be occasional cough or sneezing. Thus it is illogical to exempt those who are jogging from putting up a face shield or at the very least, a spit guard!  If those highly paid headless chicken had really walk around and observe, they will realize that a lot of people will wear their masks with nostrils exposed.   Due to our hot weather, a lot of expats and people from temperate countries are not used to wearing a face mask under hot sun and high humidity. This is why we can see so many Caucasians are resistance to wearing masks.  Not to mention those who work as hawkers and cooks in hot kitchens. It is impractical and unnecessary for them to wear face masks when a spit guard would be more sustainable and effective.  Most people have misconception of universal masking. They were thinking more on the Protection function rather than the more important function of Prevention in the context of Universal Masking where everyone is putting on something in front of their mouths and noses.   Well, I would not take issue when people have such mistaken view or concept which made them coming to the wrong conclusion about Face Mask and Spit Guard, but for THOSE SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT and Highly paid Experts, Civil Servants and Ministers to be so clueless about Universal Masking, that's really TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  Well if they are really clueless, just learn from the very front line country, China!  Right from the start, they have put up a comprehensive masking directive cater to different situations and scenario. They classify situations into High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk...Etc.   They differentiate between different types of masks and now, they encourage the use of face shield in practical and pragmatic situations.   How could our HIGHEST PAID Ministers in the world become so mediocre in comparison to the Chinese counterparts who are only paid a fraction of their salary?   How could Singaporeans have any confidence left in PAP leadership if they can't even get such simple things right?"

101574748,12527900,Jun Jie,"May 31, 2020","Don't expect local cases to drop anytime when phase 1 opens up, it will be a complete opposite instead as more businesses resumes means more people are out,never be complacent. Always maintain good standard of hygiene, it is for the sake of everybody's well-being and health. Put yourself into the frontliner's shoes, they have it even harder because of the close contact with COVID-19 patients, stay safe and we can overcome this."

At the reported testing of 3,000 tests per day allocated for FWs we will spend the next three months testing these FWs.

If I were the healthcare worker attending to the infected who told me he/she went places like Jem and Don Don Donki, I would have given him/her a piece of my mind.  While the majority of Singaporeans stay home, there're these few idiots roaming around, putting us all in jeopardy.  If they are roaming around for non essential matters, they should be denied of healthcare subsidies and pay the whole treatment out of their own pockets."

I'm just a simple man who understands lack of transparency will only lead to erosion of trust. If you don't publish daily number of tests conducted, nobody will trust you.  Cumulative total LAST REPORTED by MTF interns: 218,996 (as of 25 May 2020).  Here's how you should learn and improve on transparency to gain trust and support:  The New Zealand Ministry of Health provide a time series for tests per day and cumulative tests. The daily figures begin on 9 March, and the cumulative figures date back to 22 January when testing began.  Latest DAILY update from the Ministry of Health:â£ - For the seventh day in a row, there are no new cases of COVID-19 to report in New Zealand.â£ - Our total number of confirmed cases REMAINS AT 1,154, which is the number we report to the World Health Organization.â£ - There are seven additional recovered cases meaning this total is now 1,481. Only one case remains active.â£ - There are no additional deaths to report.â£ - There is no one in New Zealand receiving hospital-level care for COVID-19.â£ - Yesterday our laboratories COMPLETED 4,162 TESTS, bringing the total number of tests completed to date to 275,852.â£"

And that precious relationships at the workplace where we can work wonders just by conversations and building real relationships as we are made to be social creatures and helps us build our characters and sharpness.

Also I am happier in the sense that im away from the office environment where there is constant surveillance, we can easily fall sick if another colleague is ill and where there is negativity spewing from gossips and general unhappiness from colleagues that somehow can make your own job unbearable.  While i do miss the rush, i feel alot more relaxed as this pace. Im sure not everyone can relate to this. Managers are struggling to ensure that their staff gets the job done. But we have to find a way to ensure this without feeling like theres someone hovering above our shoulder.

101574556,7442900,Aldrich Lim,"May 25, 2020","Why many with desk-bound jobs (those that are 80-90% of time facing the computer) will prefer to work from home. Depending on how conducive is the home environment for work.  To be honest I am enjoying this CB lockdown period and am pleased when it was extended to 1 June 2020.  But my main point is why canâ€™t this work from home be a major permanent fixture after this COVID-19 pandemic is over.  Companies can implement 3 days Home and 2 days office. Buddy rotations. OR Implement weekly rotation among 2 teams of employees.1 week WFH (work-from-home) and  1 week WFO (work-from-office).  Companies realize they donâ€™t really need desk-bound staffs to be physically in office to do the job. And realize employees are as efficient working from home as in office.  Advantages: - Companies saves a lot by reducing the rental cost of big expensive office spaces and saves a lot on electricity, water, some rental, paper .... etc. - For those taking public. No need to squeeze in the train. - Waking up later. - save money on transport. - No need to wash so many clothes every day. - No need to squeeze with lunch crowd. - Knock-off immediately and you are home. - Less human interaction (for introverts) - More time to exercise. - (For women) can do self-facial,self-hair care... etc. from morning till evening. Save a lot of time. - Blast your favorite songs whole day long when working.  Disadvantage  - Electrical and Water bills higher for employee.(But the savings from transport is much higher which covers this). - If the home environment is not conducive for work. - Those that need physical files will have problem. (Any way all companies should start going paperless soft copies filling, with accessable shared network) - Less human interaction (for extroverts) - Those companies without VPN to access their network or system are at risk to hackers.  - Companies may decide to outsource monotonous straightforward data entry jobs to (overseas back office) cheaper countries like India and Philippines. (But these countries have very high turnover rates, their employees are not as dedicated, some services are not as efficient, and risk of information being shared outside of company). - Most people pointed out you will end up working longer hours. Not necessary. You can always log-on and log-off 9am-5pm strictly office hours. Chances are those that are working longer hours at WFH are also the ones working longer in office too. Or you are very siao on, and do not know how to differentiate urgent and non-urgent matters.   However there are other variables. Which will affect other industries. Example: - land passenger transport industry will oppose. Becoz less people take taxis, grab, bus, MRT.  - F&B near office locations will be affected. - Shopping malls. Usually after work some people will go shopping. If WFH become a permanent fixture for many companies, shopping malls will be affected. (however online shopping will not be affected). - Company do not need bigger space for rental, as only half of the office staffs working in office. Commercial properties will be hit hard as lesser offices are required.. "

Most of these people do not wear their masks correctly (either no covering their nose n both nose/mouth) and keep talking to each other or over the phone while walking along the lane or standing.  Suddenly last week, a whole corner of the sitting area (including walking track) which old people normally sat n talked was totally taped out of bound.

As the parent of a child who has been affected by the 4 day closure of all PCF centres in Singapore due the Fengshan outbreak, I am left wondering how any parent without a helper or relatives who can care for the child is realistically expected the deal with a 14 day closure.   If the parent works a 5 day week, this would still mean recording 10 days of absence from work to care for the child. If the current child care entitlement only provides for 6 days annually, then how would this work? An MC would not apply either.   Why has the Ministry of Manpower not prepared employers and employees with a better support system regarding how to officially process absence from work due to the COVID 19 situation when 6 days of child care leave clearly will not suffice? MOM has only provided guidance regarding those affected by LOA or SHO, such as those who have travelled abroad. If a child care centre closes for 14 days due to an outbreak, are all children who attend the centre, and their parents, given an LOA? All we have been told is that ""employers should be empathetic"", which leaves this empathetic response entirely to the discretion of the employer and does not answer the question of how the absence will be officially processed.  The government needs to clearly state that all parental absences from work due to child care closure due to COVID 19, regardless of number, will be officially covered under LOA or child care leave entitlement.

101572491,77647900,Jon Snow,"Mar 26, 2020","The COVID 19 situation and particularly the closure of PCF Sparkletots Fengshan has brought into stark relief the insufficiency of current child care leave entitlement under conditions of pandemic.   For many working parents, child care centres are the only option. As the parent of a child who has been affected by the 4 day closure of all PCF centres in Singapore due the Fengshan outbreak, I am left wondering how any parent without a helper or relatives who can care for the child is realistically expected the deal with a 14 day closure.   If the parent works a 5 day week, this would still mean recording 10 days of absence from work to care for the child. If the current child care entitlement only provides for 6 days annually, then how would this work? An MC would not apply either.   Why has the Ministry of Manpower not prepared employers and employees with a better support system regarding how to officially process absence from work due to the COVID 19 situation when 6 days of child care leave clearly will not suffice? MOM has only provided guidance regarding those affected by LOA or SHO, such as those who have travelled abroad. If a child care centre closes for 14 days due to an outbreak, are all children who attend the centre, and their parents, given an LOA? All we have been told is that ""employers should be empathetic"", which leaves this empathetic response entirely to the discretion of the employer and does not answer the question of how the absence will be officially processed.  The government needs to clearly state that all parental absences from work due to child care closure due to COVID 19, regardless of number, will be officially covered under LOA or child care leave entitlement.

Countries all over the world have shut down schools ,totally prevent travel or visits other than the return of their own citizens, people are asked to work from home  Utility Bill's have come to a pause,  trillions of dollars rescue plan to help citizens so they can stay at home without financial burden and also to help businesses..and here we are still a crowded bus in the morning coz everyone needs to work..its times like this where we can see the type of governments in the world and how they defend their citizens."
101572491,77647900,Fiona Ling,"Mar 26, 2020","To the critics asking for lock down:  Lock down could bring economic standstill,  could mean people start losing jobs on massive scale because companies can't survive without consumption, could mean the poor suffer more because they have no savings to rely on (creating even more panic like Indonesia).. West is doing this because their cases is absurdly high and the govt responded much later than SG, and their people don't cooperate.   The citizens in EU already suffered job losses since last week, when lock down will be lifted is uncertain. Not only there's pressure of pandemic, they have financial pressure as well and about the future of their jobs. These people pay alot in taxes and insurance ,(40%-50%) so now they get min. 60% unemployment benefit. What do you get if your company has to retrench you? Are your ready to lose your income as you claim economy suffer abit is okay.   In vulnerable SG, we're dependent on international trade. Who is going to feed families if jobs are not kept? We didn't pay high tax or state insurance,  we won't get anything except to deplete savings. And what is the benchmark for ending the lock down, and return to normal living again?  Not saying lives are not more important. But understand why it's not time yet to create more problems with a lock down if SG method is somehow working in managing the curve. It's a marathon here, not a sprint.   Do you know that SG is the best case scenario for USA?! To fight pandemic yet carry on with daily life. This is the best case scenario for other western countries.   I think the naysayers need to spread more positivity. The next step may be to restrict public movement even further,  cut group outing to 2, have shopping curfew, mandatory home office. Install plastic shields everywhere to increase protection of retail F&B cashiers, etc. There are measures still possible, without a complete lockdown."

Bankruptcies, job cuts, pay cuts, forced unpaid leave, divorces arising from domestic friction ... these are all real risks that we will all need to deal with. Donâ€™t forget that for every one of us with a comfortable rainy day fund to weather a storm, there are many more living hand to mouth for which a material loss of income would be catastrophic.  Having said that, the difficulty in executing this balancing act is that because detected cases lag actual infections by 2-3 weeks (as we have seen in every other country), for any new controls implemented today, we will only know of itsâ€™ effectiveness 2-3 weeks later (in this period the number of detected cases will continue to rise).  In the last few days weâ€™ve seen the introduction of very strict measures just shy of a â€œlockdown.â€ Can we really afford to wait another 2-3 weeks to see if theyâ€™re strict enough?"

They are going to have no one other than exhausted and brave hospital staff to see them through days or weeks of barely breathing through a ventilator until they either die or recover. They are not going to be well enough to text you.  You are not going to be able to phone the ward to check in on them regularly (staff will be too busy for that). During that time, they will be completely alone, while you sit at home waiting to hear whether they have made it through.  Imagine that person is someone you love dearly.

When loved ones are removed from your home by ambulance because the virus has hit them hard, you are not going to be able to follow them there, sit by their hospital bed and hold their hand. You are not going to be able to pop in at 7.00 pm for visiting hours. They are going to have no one other than exhausted and brave hospital staff to see them through days or weeks of barely breathing through a ventilator until they either die or recover. They are not going to be well enough to text you.  You are not going to be able to phone the ward to check in on them regularly (staff will be too busy for that). During that time, they will be completely alone, while you sit at home waiting to hear whether they have made it through.  Imagine that person is someone you love dearly. Because it's going to be a reality for many in the coming weeks.  And if that person in hospital happens to be you, going through that ordeal completely alone, it would be nothing less than terrifying.  Please stay home and only go out if absolutely necessary. Social distancing is imperative right now for your family and mine."

Our government has been seen to be working hard every step of the way in hopes that they can mitigate the healthcare, social and economic impacts each measure will have. Not everything is in black and white. Just to clarify, I am not against schools closing, but it is disheartening to see individuals bashing the government and politicising the matter.  Even if you do not agree with our government, try giving constructive criticism through proper channels instead of hurling abuses and sounding like petulant children.

This is the same govt pre-school franchise most Singaporean kids go to at different locations and neighbourhoods. i took the decision to pull my kid out of school since March 3rd. Iâ€™m not gonna risk it.  i urge parents to make the decisions yourself to minimise the risk.   Donâ€™t wait for our government to make that decision for you. If you can, take your kids out of school. When attendances start dropping, the Teachers will have to stop teaching because the majority of students are not in school. This will help drive the decision to close the schools or at the very least leave only the students whose parents canâ€™t find alternative care arrangements in attendance. This would already greatly reduce the number of students mixing.  The government has been doing a phenomenal job thus far, but they cant make all the decisions for you (right or wrong), they got a lot to deal with.   Make that decision yourself. Trust me no teacher will penalise your child for not being in school during this crisis.  My heart goes out to the teacher involved, what hell she must be going through not knowing if she could have infected the children she works with on a daily basis for at least the next 14 days or more while fighting the virus herself"

101572467,61467900,Ryan Kan,"Mar 26, 2020","I do not feel comfortable, and strongly hold the view that the schools should be closed, at least for a window of time until things start to get better.  1. In the initial stages, people infected with the virus are asymptomatic, and if they contract it from anyone in the public during the multiple windows of interaction (e.g. common public transport in the mornings and after school), they probably won't know about it for a few days. Upon being diagnosed with the virus, there is a risk brought to other people of the virus within the time they contract the disease to the time when they realise they have the disease. If, in the worst case scenario, there is a cluster in school, there are potentially a few thousand people who may have been in close contact or are at risk with that individual. So what if you minimise social distancing? The virus can linger on the surfaces these individuals touch, and the air they cough into. Isn't this a big problem? This is exacerbated by the fact that this virus is highly contagious, and infects more people than even SARS within a shorter period of time.   2. Earlier, it was raised that the youth are not significant vectors of the disease. But this does not mean that they won't be infected. In the most recent news release, it was reported that many teenagers and children, who are supposed to be in relatively better health, contracted the disease in schools, and there are now clusters in schools - PCF Fengshan and Dover Court School. Imagine if people slip through the cracks of detection and cause even more new clusters in local schools. We won't be able to live ourselves, if we did not prevent the possibility to eliminate such occurrences when we could. We should be concerned, especially since the number of local unlinked cases have been increasing. We may have the capability to do contact tracing, but that is an after-event mode of intervention.   3. This is a respiratory disease, which is much more dangerous than anything else. The type I pneumocytes are amitotic, which means that cell division does not occur readily if these are damaged, although type II pneumocytes can differentiate into type I pneumocytes when required. Nevertheless, this means that it is harder to cure lung structural damages if they occur, making the virus all the more risky with greater implications if many more people are infected, if my biological knowledge is sufficiently sound.   4. If we already have existing capabilities to carry out e-learning, we should use them. Although the impact on students from moving classrooms online is not entirely negligible, I would think that if there is the formation of a few school clusters and many more people cannot even get on with work well because they (touchwood) contract the disease, the impact would be much more substantial. For the adult workforce, they are already advised to work from home where possible. I think we should strongly consider this for schools as well to eliminate as many risks as possible.  5. Although there is the fear that students may still go out during an event of school closures, ultimately the proportion who go out will be lower. Keeping schools open necessitates them to go outside and make the distance to reach school, while bringing work online reduces this.   6. Right now, due to many teachers not being able to attend school what with being placed on leave, our teachers are now extra busy, having to handle extra administrative matters with keeping schools open on top of handling the academic matters as expected of them. I am concerned that if they are overworked, their effectiveness in the force to protect the wellbeing of youth will face limitations.  I think at this juncture of time, schools should close in the interest of public health and long-term considerations. This is especially since we have other capabilities in place (i.e. e-learning)."

You are doing so well but this is too much of a burden on your own people! Not like its not spreading locally? Are the locals taking their precautions? You have to ramp this up further, stop the imported cases. Whoever comes from wherever needs to be self isolated. Stop overseas travellers. Unfortunate but they need to.

What about possibilities of people without symptoms and pass through immigration and went all over the place in Singapore then got diagnosed positive?"
101572318,1222900,Dennis Stroder,"Mar 22, 2020","The reason why we are looking like Italy is Americans don't wear masks.  China, Japan, and other Asian countries can eradicate a virus in 3 months because their citizens all know to wear masks during an outbreak.  One of the reasons the 1918 Flu epidemic was controlled was people started wearing masks.  That is how Asians learned to wear masks during epidemics."

101572318,1222900,Vincent Ng,"Mar 21, 2020",I find it disturbing that despite the 14 days quarantine apply to all foreigners coming to Singapore n yet these foreigners with covid still fly into Singapore is a clear sign that they want to be treated in Singapore despite the cost bcoz of our state of the art medical facilities.

Do you think we are really that superior? Look at Italy, France, Britain, US. Hospitals are totally overwhelmed in a matter of days once it breakout. We don't have to go through what they are facing now. Medical staffs are already short handed and extremely overworked, you are putting them at tremendous risk of being infected themselves.   I have never voted for any oppositions in my life, but these 4G leaders are truly not ready to take over the baton from PM Lee. With a twin crisis on humanity and economy, WTH... they still have a third eye on politics, talking about election.  We need strong leadership at this time, someone who can make big decisive decisions that will end all this. Prolonging the pain and we will see a greater impact on the economy. Think what happen when other countries have their situation under control? They will not open their door to SG for business. Our neighbour Malaysia have done a very responsible thing by locking down their country when the outbreak worsen. We have to really thank them for that. Imagine how many infected person would have came through our land and sea checkpoints that were kept opened by our govt.   Even more irresponsible when   our govt ask for exception to allow the 300000 Malaysian workers to continue commuting to SG for work. Malaysia took the biggest decision to lock down the country in order to contain the virus. Allowing movements in and out of Malaysia would render the lockdown useless.   So wake up Singapore! We are not that invincible... Only concrete actions can help us tide over this crisis of our lifetime.  Start swab testing as many people, activate the  900 pdph GP clinics to do swab test for anyone with flu symptoms to break the infection chain earliest possible. Isolate positive cases that are not serious in quarantine facilities.  Implement tough social distancing.   The virus can be stopped without being a catastrophe to SG.

Why MOH is not telling us how those with no links got infected?  If lawrence wong and Gan is warning us to prepare for a spike, why are they not enforcing stronger preventive measures to prevent the spike? Why wait for it to happen before using it as a reason to impose stronger measures.   One example: Social gathering of not more than 250 seems like a joke.  It's still a huge number.   At hawker centres, why food stall holders are not wearing preventive mask to ensure no accident droplets of saliva on the food?  At this time of grave concern on the COVID 19 situation, government still want to go ahead with the GE. Won't this dilute the government focus and resources in containing and eradicating this disease? It seems political objective takes priority over resolving this crisis.   Truth is, is the government doing a good job in containing the spread of the virus when all the clusters suggest otherwise? Could these clusters have been avoided if the government has imposed stricter measures in the early stage? I'm puzzled at Who praise on how our government is resolving this COVID19 crisis here if it is compared with Taiwan.   Look at the Taiwan model. Numbers of infected ppl remand small compare to Sg.   In addition they are able to turn around quickly to manufacture their own mask which allow them to sell to their citizens 3masks person per week. Why can't the SG Gov initiate and assist our local manufacturers to improvise and produce our own local mask. To this date, pharmacies outlet has no stocks to sell to the public unlike in Taiwan.   Sigh... we just have to hope for the best and pray hard for our inexperience and young  G4 government to make the right decision."

If 30 million ppl being infected by the common cold flu annually. We will be expecting 30 million ppl will also be infected by this covid19 in these coming mths.  Ãf a cold flu can be caught easily in the open..one can also easily catch a covid19 in the open.  Cos both of these two (cold flu n covid19) share rimiliar characteristics..ie..its symptoms (sore throat, cough, runny nose, hi fever n cold sweat during nightfall..in some cases. As i said implementing lock down is of no use.. Hnw long can the Sg economy withstand a prolong lock down? If this covid19 is here to sta So, the subject of lock down is out of the question.  Since, Medical Science (MS) n chinese TCM cant do a thing abt it.. World communities go to accept the fact of a 'new world order' by acknowleding the existence of 'spiritual sickness' coming into play. Is MS n TCM in a position to understand this...viruses fall under two groupings..either as 'airborne' or the 'close-contact' viruses...ie aids, hepatitis, herpes.. No doubt both share similiar characteristics such as, going after the human's sacredness/purity, spiritual head n Aura...but their approach may differ fron each other.. Take for example, close-contact vÃ¯ruses go after the body purity blood system n if left untreated, they go after the spiritual head. This is wats happened to those final stage aids patients r facing. Drastic changes to their face features, especially, the eyelook.  As for those 'comes n goes' airborne viruses....they act fast (short-cut)by going after the spiritual head's Aura. .Tat is why, u see Ã¯nfected ppl wit deadly airborne viruses get instant result n that is ' mysterious death'..so mysterinus that some infected patients were able to recover fully. This recovered fully fron airborne virus can never happen to thore being infected by close-contact viruses.  Does MS or TCM understand or able to figure out the modus operandi  of these viruses?  So how can world medÃ¯cal authorities keep on relying on MS for direction.  As i mentioned..lock down or no lock down is of no help in dealing wit this covid19 airborne virus. Its time for MS to take a back seat instand n let our Holistic Centre to set new precedent in dealing with these viruses..the so called spiritual sickness."

As such those people will continue with their holidays regardless of what you say. There is this it will not never happen to meâ€™ mentality in many Singaporean. I know of three ladies who flew to Japan only last week to enjoy the empty factory outlets there!  China is a very very good example to follow if we want to stamp our Covid in Singapore    No amount of coaxing and begging by the government is going to be effective.

I am trying to understand these Singaporeans travelling when you guys have been advising us  to defer non essential travel. May I ask for your help, we are a group of 4 over 65s of age and have placed our deposit for group tour holiday to Italy. We have been writing to the travel agency for postponement or deferment of our scheduled travel (5May) but every time the response to us that 'postponement is deemed as cancellation and our deposit is forfeited'. The deposit money is our hard-earned and hence do we have a choice of not travelling when the travel agency imposed this on us. We wrote for postponement because of our age and Covid 19 situation in Italy and the world seems to be getting worse each day. We are not wanting to take the risk, however, the travel agency is not giving us any options.  Hence I truly sometimes comprehend why pple are still travelling when you have given the Travel Advisory - it's their thousands of dollars be forfeited by the travel ageny.

I think this one quarantine period should be unpaid leave.  3) what about those that feel that they are sick but not sure and travel back because they want a Singapore hospital? Should they stay put where they are and not endanger all those on the plane. 4) Pilots and flight crew that need to earn a living... does this mean after every flight 14 days stay at home?

On the contrary, if everyone has maybe few days buffer of food and toilet paper, even from the last DORSCON orange event, then the panic will gradually decrease. Its just a natural human reaction.  With Singapore's mega stockpile, and individual's mini stock pile, isn't this better? Thats why we have a store room right? Its natural people don't want to run out of toilet paper and have to queue for one roll. The country will be even more resilient as pp are more prepared. On a positive note it is afterall not a bad thing. Just don't panic buy, please!"

If they donâ€™t come back home for treatment, where shall they go then? Even so, travel restrictions were only rolled out recently and some of these people had already came home.

The main point is isolation from others till proven clear of the virus regardless of the person's current condition. It is very hard for family members to be as professional as medical personnel in preventing spread within the family and subsequently family members to the public at large.  1) Allocate more quarantine facilities to gather those that you deem can recover on their own with no need for too much medical attention should you are at the crossroad of insufficient negative pressure hospital wards and/or medical services for all infected.  2) Stop blaming the people. I don't see how the use of words such as ""people treat hospital as hotel"" really help. People don't even want to be there if not for the unfortunate event of being infected. As a spoke person of the govt you can keep teaching and remind people on good preventive measures and try your best to calm people and show care for the infected. You cannot show people that you are flustered already with no careful consideration of your speech. We know the world is worried with no proven cure and vaccine.

Eg: If only one infected in the family under home quarantine how do house the person (proper disposable of the utensils/ rubbish), would the household be given medical protective suit when attending to the patient and proper usage instructions of the suit to protect against the virus like the healthcare workers have. Is the negative air pressure room in hospitals not necessary in home quarantine.   https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-four-deaths-in-one-family-show-danger-of-wuhans-home-quarantine-policy  On a separate note, really hope to perhaps consider the option to enforce cancellations of unnecessary recreational gathering events regardless the size of the events - not everyone is socially responsible; hence, every unnecessary recreational event is a risk as it takes just one socially irresponsible person to create a spread."

The ratio wasn't proportional. Bars were raised so high to be doctors/nurses that we have to import many from crap universities from other countriesâ€¦  A few even fake their qualifications. Why not allow more locals to be trained to be doctors and nurses? What Doctors and nurses need are EXPERIENCES and not academic performances which our system highly depending uponâ€¦ Give them more time to learn and hands on. They will out perform even the best health care from other countries. Plus point is thatâ€¦ they will do it wholeheartedly as this is also their countryman.  In SGH and NTU, there are so many foreign doctors which does not empathize with patients and their family simply because they dun have the sense of belongings here. They are just out to make some moniesâ€¦ infact, alot of money comparing to their own country. I have encountered a few foreign specialists who kept stressing patient to have surgery by them at any given chance. As patient's condition wasn't favourable and highly prone to infection. They kept using the scare tactics. To them, the more surgery they have, they gain not only experience but also incentives. A few were young and inexperiencedâ€¦ Ownself experienced itâ€¦and that happened to my family member."

We hv no right to refuse it from docking here. Here again, I bet many didn't hear the whole video. He said he is referring to those already recovered patients who doesn't need nursing care anymore but are kept in hospital only for the purpose of doing further tests (I assume recovered patients still need testing every few other days) to ensure the virus does not recur. So it is a waste of (taxpayers' money) hospital beds, equipment & medical staff's attention for these  recovered patients when others need them more. Even if there's enough hospital beds, pls give our medical staff a break, else they keep having to serve food & drinks while u treat hospital like a hotel. I'm sure currently alot of nurses are working long hours or defer AL due to shortage of medical staff. At least if patients discharge early, they can rotate to go home have a good rest & family time before next patient's admission."

In Singapore, the extent of infection is not widespread.  Thus, banning big gathering is drastic.  Life has to go on. The solution is in each one of us.  If you are sick, see a doctor and stay at home or if you have in contact with someone infected, do a self quarantine. However, if you need to go out for some reason, wear a mask and avoid going to crowded area.

It was the perfect storm actually.   While it is important to try to go about life as normal as possible, it is shown repeatedly that the major clusters happened largely in air-con enclosed crowded environment. There are many studies and also factual patterns of more rapid spread around the world with climate 10-20C, 45-65% humidity (wuhan/italy/iran/south Korea) - a simple Google will tell u that the climate of the countries above fall in that cool+dry zone. Here in sg we are very blessed with hot+humid all year round, the natural environment does not promote rapid spread hence that is likely why most clusters happened in air con enclosed crowded environment.

They had to have singing programs for oldies, Lohei dinner and close interactions with hundreds of people in the ballroom. Two parties, all intertwined. All during the crisis, when the Dorscon level is orange. Not only that, the confirmed cases went everywhere while sick, some went to work, one woman did a community club hopping. And they must have spread everywhere including friends, family, public places. I am just alarmed at the level of ignorance and indifference these people have about the crisis that is happening in our country and in the world. Don't these people read/listen to news at all?

A 72-year-old man who attended the dinner and is currently being observed in the isolation ward of the National Infectious Diseases Center said in an interview with the United Evening News today that he learned to sing, and she happened to have two dinner tickets. The wife was present, but they did not expect that they were both sick. He is not sure if he is on the list of confirmed cases released by the Ministry of Health last night. To his knowledge, an estimated four or five people at his desk were infected, including himself and his wife. He remembered that everyone used their chopsticks to fish and sauerkraut that day, without using chopsticks. He and his wife both had fevers the evening before yesterday, so they called an ambulance to the hospital. This means that they became ill 19 days after the dinner.  åŽŸæ–‡é“¾æŽ¥ï¼šhttps://www.zaobao.com.sg/znews/singapore/story20200307-1035101 æ¥æºï¼šzaobao.sg æœ¬æ–‡è‘—ä½œæƒå½’æ–°åŠ å¡æŠ¥ä¸šæŽ§è‚¡æ‰€æœ‰ã€‚å•†ä¸šè½¬è½½è¯·è”ç³»æˆ‘ä»¬èŽ·å¾—æŽˆæƒï¼Œéžå•†ä¸šè½¬è½½è¯·æ³¨æ˜Žå‡ºå¤„ã€‚"

This means that each virus particle is coated in a membrane that is made of fats. Disinfectants work by disrupting that membrane (kind of like how washing liquid breaks down the oil stains of your char kway teow plate lol)   Another thing in case people donâ€™t know - coronavirus did not originate from corona beer so you can continue being alcoholics, corona is just another word for crown and under the electron microscope the virus looks like it has a crown  Pls do not panic, most cases display mild symptoms and will resolve, the only ones who can be seriously infected are the very young, very old, pregnant or immunosuppressed (as in you have concurrent illness as well, that causes your immune system to be weaker)   Stay safe, wear mask, wash your hands "

Many complained that govt is not able to trace so many cases - actually it really depends on how much an infected person can recall his own movements over the last 14 days in great detail. Unless you keep an hourly log - how to remember who you met or where u might have touched and then touch your face for u to be infected? I cannot even remember what I had for lunch one week ago!

A lot are wondering about the progress in the  development of a cure. It is understandable that a 100% cure has yet to be developed given how quickly things have evolved.   However, with the number of patients who have fully recovered both locally and around the world, it shows that certain treatments and/or medications are effective in general. And, considering that this virus has global attention, progress should have already been made in developing a cure.   Updates in developing the cure will help ease anxieties and encourage everyone to play their part in the meantime.   Unless, a cure is still a long unforeseeable time away.  If so, it is very worrying."
