101580964,53397900,Janet Tan,Feb-12,Must be so thankful to the one that kept on importing the Covid-19 daily and pass it to our own locals ..such a amazing job ðŸ‘,
101580964,53397900,Angela Lim,Feb-12,A lot of people are unwilling to see a doctor now because they only have *14 days of MC and their *PB are sadly tied to how many days of MC they submit per year. ,
101580964,53397900,Jason Poon,Feb-12,"We always have people of such around. Rather depending on a safe environment I would have a ""always unsafe"" environment mindset. Always mask on, wash hands regularly where possible, don't touch our face etc",
101580964,53397900,Joseph Lee,Feb-12,"With the exception of the NSF, the rest of the other community cases have the same issue of not seeking medical attention and continuing to work/ go out. Their reckless behavior put more people at risk. So when will these people be charged to ensure such irresponsible behavior is stopped?",
101580964,53397900,Frank Young,Feb-12,Why name the Swenson's location but not the old man's shop unit?  He was infectious for a week and working at his shop. He didn't have trace together. So people needs to know if they went close to his unit or not lah!,
101580964,53397900,E Wonder,Feb-12,"They should bear the cost of treating them.  PR status should be revoked.  They are wasting our resources, taking the trace together token but not carrying them around... Utterly irresponsible..",
101580964,53397900,Richard Foo,Feb-13,"Cancel their PR immediately. They are considered as murderer. Look at the numbers of elderly and they just can't be bothered. Very angry with this kind of people. Stop this nonsense MOM, MOH.",
101580964,53397900,Ben Oh,Feb-12,Now blame people for not using Trace Together! I will not use also in fear of the government tracking my whereabouts!,
101580964,53397900,Chelsey Chen,Feb-12,"â€œHe first developed a dry cough on Jan 28 and ""anosmia"", or loss of smell, on Feb 9, but did not seek medical attention, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).â€  Loss of smell is a well-known symptom of covid... still donâ€™t want to see doctor?! What a F*cker ðŸ¤¬ ",
101580964,53397900,Solomon Tan,Feb-12,Time to make TT compulsory. Or else it make no sense for having the TT programme for contact tracing.,
101580964,53397900,Terry Sim,Feb-12,How many more Chinatown visitors have come into contact with this guy. How many more stall holders will be tested positive and how are the visitors to China town who have contacts with them traced.  For me this is a Pretty scary situation.,
101580964,53397900,Ruth Ruth,Feb-12,Gateway is open and some of those who came in did not abide to SHN and QO. Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s spread. Those working in Changi Airport should be given shower facilities to shower before they go home. Please also give them better mask and hand sanitizer for better protection ,
101580964,53397900,Alvin Lim,Feb-12,IMHO those who purposely sabotage contact tracing efforts shouldn't get to enjoy free medical treatment for Covid,
101580964,53397900,Chris Yau Teng,Feb-12,We stand or fall together. Please carry your trace tokens with you at all times. Otherwise we will end up like our neighbours with thousand of new infections everyday.,
101580964,53397900,Sammy Chan,Feb-12,We waited for more than 10mths to finally reach phase 3 and these 2 covidiots still living like Feb 2020.,

101580964,53397900,Gita Sesh,Feb-12,"Did not use TT, didnâ€™t go to doctor, but went everywhere. And at work at Chinatown at the time of CNY shopping period. How irresponsible these people can be? Please let people know which stall, otherwise many may be freaking out.",
101580964,53397900,Gabriel Chia,Feb-12,"To those who carry tracetogether tokens, please ensure that the tokens are working fine. Tokens with blinking red light or rapid blinking of green light indicates the battery of the token is running low. Get them replaced at any community centre.",
101580964,53397900,Shermin Tan,Feb-12,"Everyone shld play our part by seeking medical advice during such a period. One of the reason why they don't is because they don't want to be swabbed. It like people who look for job but due to the need to swab, they turn down offer. I really wonder is stomach important or refuse to swab important.   The govt should look at what is the reason why ppl do not seek medical immediately and certain penalties shld imposed. Else we have walking virus carrier around us. Should also imposed penalties for ppl who do not open trace together or never bring token with them. Why so secretive that no one can know your whereabout?",
101580964,53397900,Jaja Sapari,Feb-12,"Thus trace token or apps is not helping as ignorance people just dont care less or more..pretend to forget,turn blind eye,batt low,to avoid safe entry or detect them.IF THIS CONTINUES,it will increased ..take care ,stay safe..",
101580964,53397900,Yuan Jie,Feb-12,"Sure, it's irresponsible of them not to carry TT token, but those who were there and blaming them go ask yourselves whether you've brought those tokens with you as well first.",
101580964,53397900,Teo Jack,Feb-12,If phone no battery the app also useless. And if I want to do illegal case. I won't use my own token. I will wait my family member asleep n steal their token. Both are useless implementation.,
101580964,53397900,ì–‘ì§€ë¹ˆ,Feb-12,How the PR stall owner checked into the Chinatown Complex?   How the PR son checked into Changi Airport and Swensen?,
101580964,53397900,Sanila Wutama,Feb-12,66-year-old permanent resident....can a person forever just be a PR without any time limit?,
101580964,53397900,Top FanEli Za Beth,Feb-12,"Noticed that these days local transmission cases are detected in people who do not seek medical attention upon falling ill.  People are not taking this seriously.  Why?  No more deaths from Covid-19 in Singapore?  It's so easy to come across people who do not wear mask (quiet streets, at bus stops before the bus arrives, late at night, at sitting areas in void decks, doing 'brisk' walking...)",
101580964,53397900,Elliot Lin,Feb-12,"Why is MOH demonising them because they didnâ€™t use TraceTogether?   First attempting to deceive, then blackmailing now demonising? The more the government does this the more resentment there will be. ",
101580964,53397900,Akimoto Emi,Feb-12,The PR fatherâ€™s status should be revoke and send him back to his original country.,
101580964,53397900,David SG Chin,Feb-12,"Both in f&b, imagine how much people they shared the virus with. And with no trace together, how to properly contact those who came near them during this period?.....",
101580964,53397900,Christopher Chiew,Feb-12,"Maybe after what Dr. V had said, they scare to turn on the TT.",
101580964,53397900,Leon Lim,Feb-12,Airport is a dangerous place because we allow infected to enter. Don't blame them for not using TraceTogether. Blame should be on those who allowed infected to keep entering the country without a care.,
101580964,53397900,Emdy MK,Feb-12,"Very irresponsible, should revoke their PR status.  ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ ",
101580964,53397900,Ah Ben,Feb-12,"Trace Together token is not compulsory at the moment. Until the idiotic garment decide what the F they want, don't put such idiotic headlines out bcos it is not the People's Fault. It is the Fault of you stupid government who don't know that the hell you are doing. So much for a bunch of overpaid goondus.",
101580964,53397900,Rayner Lim,Feb-12,I rather all places implement only TT for entry. So these irresponsible people would have to lan lan use TT wherever they go since they dislike to consult doctor even when they have symptoms. Govt have to stop being complacent already,
101580964,53397900,Jay Tan,Feb-12,"If wanna blame those who dont use TT, then might as well blame those who keep importing cases. Coz the root of all community cases spread comes from imports.",
101580964,53397900,Mahmood Abdul Hakam,Feb-12,Ah best...later Hari Raya kena sacrifice again...last year CNY can celebrate Hari Raya lockdown...this year round two issit?!,

101580964,53397900,Qi Lun,Feb-12,This is something government should realise.  Collecting Trace Together token is one thing and having the responsibility to bringing it out is another.

101577565,44287900,David BK Tan,"Sep 16, 2020","""The EUâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation is one of the better known, and strictest, frameworks - increasingly becoming a model for other countries to follow. ""  As someone who has just developed his website following EU's GDPR framework, it is a good practice but the onus is on the website owner as it requires some self-declaration. The owner might not be technically competent to access the risks on all the software he uses and so it might not be a comprehensive solution to address security risks.  I took a look at China's proposal ""Global Initiative on Data Security"" (å…¨çƒæ•°æ®å®‰å…¨å€¡è®®) highlighted in the above news article which unfortunately is short of details. The English translation is attached.  Some technical details look promising. For e.g., the Initiative highlights :  ""States should encourage companies to abide by laws and regulations of the State where they operate. States should not request domestic companies to store data generated and obtained overseas in their own territory.""  So user data would be stored in the country where they are collected and thus would not be stored in overseas servers.   One tweak I would like to see though is that companies could house their data regionally in trusted countries like SG as it is uneconomical if data have to be localised in every country. This would help to promote job growth for SG as a regional data centre.  https://language.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202009/09/WS5f58364da310675eafc586ee.html",

The COIN generated in the app can be exchanged into XYO cryptocurrency which has a real world value that can be used to purchase things.  There is already an Xsgd cryptocurrency set up by xfers Singapore built on the zilliqa platform. If you allow the virtual mining of xsgd while in possession of the Bluetooth device like in the COIN app, not only will it help contact tracing, but allow those to earn some spare cash along the way.",
