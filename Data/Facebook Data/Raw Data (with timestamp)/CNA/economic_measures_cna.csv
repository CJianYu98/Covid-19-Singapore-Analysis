Pro-communist elements resorted to â€œextra-parliamentaryâ€ struggle through organised strikes and acts of arson and vandalism.   The Communists pose the biggest threats to SGâ€™s National Security.

101581354,75407900,Faith Sun,Mar-02,"Yeah, when people raise issues about the workplace issues for the workers in Singapore and the unfair employment for Singaporeans, they must be external foreign forces. Locals will never do that as they are self serving, selfish and ignorant. They are those xiashuey, idiots and untalented lots for they will do anything for crumbs and carrots. Very true as how the way you and your kakis think for foreigners are more talented and they are always interfering with the domestic politics.

101581294,14622900,David Ho,Feb-26,Why not go through all Govt projects or purchases or wages to  cut down on spending. Do away projects or purchases which can not earn income and not necessary. If world economic get worse. Comsumers will spend less.Taxes collection will be less. Getting more for the reserve and borrowing $$$  is not wise The only solution is cut down on spending . More export of goods and services. Build and maintain  only if necessary.Use less FW or FT or EP or PR. Private home lease change it to 50 years or less. Why ??? $$$$ is flow out of the country.
101581294,14622900,Michael Tab,Feb-26,"Ministers these generation is totally different from the old guards. New generation are more money minded. Instead of saving the country, they create unnecessary post for themselves paying so much of a salary. Commoner like us are task to multi task  at work & yet ministers are not. Are they?"
101581294,14622900,James Abeyratne,Feb-26,Would it be possible for transparency to be realised by just magnifying how 20years of reserves were gobbled up in this pandemic situation... Oh by the way... Please do not hesitate to qualify how it is  mathematically 20years . And in the process  kindly enumerate how the reserves were built up in ratio with our GDP  growth...  and please for  us simple folks we would like to know the continued revenues to the government over the the last 5 years contributed to the reserves
101581294,14622900,Joseph Chin,Feb-26,Champion DPM! Doing what he is best at; keep throwing $$ into the bottomless pit!
101581294,14622900,Ng Hua Gee,Feb-26,"There are not many 20 yrs . Luckily we has reserve to fall upon. Or else many company were collapse and unemployment . It not just recession, but depression. The next wave is after effect of self inflicted,  artificial jack up the share market during depression. Once it fall , it is extream  another crises like any war effect, worlds wide  Are we prepare? We can escape one year, but 5 year is a long period."
101581294,14622900,Ed Nolan,Feb-26,"Hahaha, the govt operating revenue not only excludes untilised investment returns of $19.6 billion but also land sales revenue of $11.8 billion estimated for FY2021. This means that not only is there no deficit, but the reserves will actually grow by almost $20 billion in FY2021 even during an extraordinary crisis such as Covid19 pandemic, based on SG govt's own estimated untilised investment returns and land sales revenue alone. Based on similar figures over the past decades, it is clear that Singapore govt has more than sufficient fiscal room to spend more of its untilised investment returns, while continuing to ringfence land sales revenue for reserves, such that the enormous reserves will still grow by a healthy amount every year. And yet we have many ignorant, stupid or disingenuous voters supporting a GST hike and posting nonsense as though reserves are being spent."
101581294,14622900,Jimmy Jimmy,Feb-26,"Don't say 20 years, 200 years also okay what. Reserves are meant to be used during rainy days, if not what are they for. Siao."

Soughts to build up revenue is a must in everyone's life not we because we are always touching on the issue of money but because is for livings generation after generation which we cannot delete these raising demands n both sides have to be equalised to avoid complications down the road.

Yes our ah gong says to be prudent but didnt say you can anyhow spend.

Once in a while MAS will transfer extra funds to either GIC or Temasek to grow the NIRC contribution....is it wise for MAS to transfer funds to GIC instead of investing the funds by themselves ? GST should not be seen as the only tool to raise funding to use for government projects....if everything just increase GST....then there is no need for PAP to exist anymore....because any political parties can do that function too.  What PAP 4G ministers should do is to try to create more routes of revenue....just like what the pioneer generation of pap leaders did during the early years of independence.

Is the electricity levels going to be counted as an overall consumption in SG,  thus increasing the payments to households in the end? That is not clearly stated in the budget what the effects of such will cost to people. If household consumption is separated that's different..but knowing this Government they will find any excuse to raise prices everywhere to recover money spent during this pandemic period. "

101581075,28682900,Cheong Tuck Chee Garry,Feb-17,"As a mature Singaporean, I could benefits from this initiative but it still depends on 3 factors; 1. HR department will have to override their existing hiring software used to screen through suitable jobs applicants and revert back to manual screening. Most would not bother as the process is time-consuming and they have to take on other duties like payrolls, training, etc. Hence they would just give excuses to MOM that they cannot find suitable candidate and still hire foreign workers. This is the sad local hiring culture! 2. Large portion of the people who are in the HR field are non Singaporean. Can't blame them if they preferred to look after their 'own' people.  3. The Chief Hiring Officers will not be doing their full diligence as they will be busy with office politics and getting certifications like ISO, Bizstar, etc, instead of checking how effectively their companies are in hiring locals. They just don't want to keep digging deeper and just treat the symptoms but not the root of the problem. In conclusion, I applaud this government initiative but don't think this is sufficient to change the mind set of the local hiring culture."

Everyone kept quiet until I brought it up, before they say they will take one month to refund me the money for 2 leg scans.

Since they are mentioning that tackling climate change is urgent.   Am not sure of the details, but what I heard was the rebates given out through Road Tax etc, will cost the Government, some $100+ million? Cost, really?  What about the increase in dollars that people will have to pay for petrol? For every 50 litres, that's $5 more per car, per fill for intermediate grades.

101581073,9542900,David Ho,Feb-17,How to return the 53 billion taken from the reserve. Wage cut for those top earner working in the Govt sectors. Higher tax from those top earner both in the private or Govt sectors. Social tax on foreigners eg DPH.PR. Build and maintain only if necessary. Eg East coast MRT line can be delay until they have earn enough $$ from other MRT lines. EW and NS line interchange delay in building it. Raise up those low land coastal area first since the rate of raising sea level is small. Extend the lease of HDB flat without bring it down and rebuild.This save lot of cost for the residents. Do away those useless R and D which products or services are not sellable. Eg What can a robot dog do in a confine space in search and rescue operation. Cost cutting in all Govt sectors. Eg Since most students perfer poly route into university.Cut down PU from two years to one years . Pri sch cut down to one years.O level cut down to 3 years .Study smart .Do not study hard. Spend less than the tax collected. The tax collected depend on the number of residents in the workforce and the population number. With an aging population .They will be less residents in the workforce thus comsumer spending will be less .Thus less tax can be collected.Depending too much on the internal economic for tax  .The residents will get poorer. More export of goods and services .These are our view only.

MOH is using aggressive testing regime by using ARI method  (Acute respiratory infection)  ARI Symptoms can include: congestion, either in the nasal sinuses or lungs. runny nose. cough. sore throat. body aches. fatigue.  This aggressive testing regime enables us to determine the extent of infection in the dormitories.   Those who are confirmed with COVID-19 infection will be reported in the daily tally of newly confirmed cases. We started with the dormitories with a higher incidence of infections, and are continuing to test the workers in the other dormitories.  ""Due to the need to prioritise, we are not be able to test all in the dormitories at one go"".  ""But if any worker were to report sick or show ARI symptoms, we will immediately pull aside and isolate the worker from his room-mates, and ensure that he receives the necessary medical care.""  This allows us to provide medical care quickly to the symptomatic foreign workers, and to ensure that those with higher risk factors or have more severe illnesses are transferred to receive care at our healthcare institutions.

Not just the Gov deciding what needs fixing, but also from the people (not the #returnmycpf nonsense), what works, how comms can be better, etc.  As for global and external challenges, Covid-19 accelerated tensions and animosities. But don't be deluded that the US-China geopolitical contest will lessen with or without Covid-19. The world need to brace for an almighty decade or more of tension and disharmony. Trade wars, marginalizing countries maintaining cooperation with China, technological suppression of Chinese companies, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines, etc. The complexity and difficulties SG will have to deal with these next 10-15yrs is a titanic challenge the likes of which we have never seen in our lifetimes.

Is this a political thing, like either for or against the ruling party? These measures announced are for the benefit of ALL Singaporeans, are they not? Did you not claim that you, as the opposition party, are working for the benefit of Singaporeans? I have always maintained that I'm neither pro-govt nor pro-opposition, but pro-Singaporean and all these measures I believe, only seek to help Singaporeans. Certainly, there will come a time in the near future, when the economy is strong enough, that some taxes will go up to replenish our reserves. That is to be expected and if done at a time of plenty, is a less bitter pill to swallow than if no assistance is rendered now.  If you don't think DPM Heng or these measures his finance ministry came up with is deserving of a standing ovation, don't stand. No one is forcing you to. What are you trying to say when you give a standing ovation, but don't applaud? Who does that? If anyone knows of a current living culture/civilisation that practises standing ovations without applause, please enlighten me.  On a side note, also noticed two persons sitting further back, taking the lead from Mr Pritam Singh and standing up only after seeing him begin to stand up. Hint of who is well and truly the top dog in the WP now perhaps?"

You know that there are many clueless who cannot see that what you have thrown to them, we have much to pay later. I know GST will be up after 2021 and you are back to doing what you want. Singaporeans too clueless that when you  give them a hand, youâ€™d take back an arm. They Applauded your actions but will continue with their complaints. Too many cheap people around that sell themselves for so little which is to your gain so that you can continue with your million dollar salaries. Things will be back to the same again as Covid-19 is your opportunity to plug your loses in the sovereign fund and win votes. Most importantly as more of the people are infected with the virus, they will forgive you easily because their eyes are on the shiok shiok crumbs. These are my opinions as opinions are never wrong."

If you've a job and a livelihood,  and if the Govt takes steps to ensure that you are able to continue with life as it was before the crisis hit, doesn't it benefit you more in the long term? Rather than always asking for handouts. Does this mean you want the easy way out? Get handout money, no need to work? Not realistic, right? And if you are still able to hold on to your job, which is what the budget is trying to help you with,  why do you want/need additional free money?   All these kinds of free handouts requests just helps drain our reserves, and when the next crisis hits, what are we going to be able to do if we have no more money left."

Just remember who said that itâ€™s not as severe as sars and like common flu would go away?   Who refused to shut the doors to China, when America and many other countries already shut their borders to China. Even Chinaâ€™s â€œclosest kinsâ€, Russia was among the first to shut the door, North Korea would execute any chinese crossing into North Korea. Even in China, till today, other provinces still closed their doors to Hubei people. A fight broke out between Hubei police and Jiangxi Police over the lockdown of a bridge access for Hubei people into Jiangxi. Chinese donâ€™t even trust their own people, but our PAP welcome them with open arms.   The virus had already broken our defenses. It is just a matter of weeks if not months before more unknown clusters come out.   And at that time, I wonder if you would be happy counting monies while one or more of your loved ones are in ICU or body bags?   Itâ€™s very easy to curse and lament with hindsight, but then again, many at the first instance had advised this government to shut their doors, no?   Happy Corona(virus) days to come. Cheers!"

The latter is certainly more powerful and serious.  This means that the Singapore's reserves have been blown away by the mighty storm.   In plain language it is gone.    NO more cash flow, the cash flew!   Oh, now I understand.  Dear PEOPLE, the cat is out of the bag.   Bo Lwee Leow!   Whenever the Si Kwee Kia PM LHL calls the GE take the bold step and go for your life ......Vote PAP OUT!    Your lives will be better.   Fortune favours the brave.   Don't be kiasee, kisasu and kia chenghoo.   Most important:  Mm tang sio thum!  Or don't go for petty stuff (Hokkien).   Vote in the New Government.   Singapore will be RESTRUCTURED.  From the top down.   NO more wayang.  You will get The Real Deal that is truly beneficial.   P.S.  I'll reiterate:  The PM salary should be $600,000.00 a year.  NO further claim payable and NO bonus.  That's it.  All perks that go with the office stay.  The ministers will then get a proportional sum of what the PM earns.  Ordinary MPs to get $18,000.00 when first elected.  After serving one year they will be paid $20,000.00.  Monthly.   ALL politicians must work full time.  Absence from Parliament question time must be justified with a written excuse or doctor's certificate.  NO sleeping in Parliament.  Suspension if caught napping.  This is the beginning of The New Dawn.   RISE!   Be Responsible, Inclusive, Sagacious, Ethical.   More, more, more.  These are NOT thought bubbles that will ultimately burst and come to nothingness.   There must be details, details, details.   Just for brevity and to avoid tedium this is just a snapshot of things to come.   Believe me, YOU are heading to The Better Place ......The New Singapore under New Management who know what they are doing.   And, they (The New Government) will do it right for YOU!

In August to September 2019 there were no less than 10 cases of people reported with an ""unknown coronavirus"" disease in US media.  More than 14k US people died from the flu from August 2019 till now. The CDC admitted a few days ago that they could not be sure whether any died of COVID-19 because none were tested.  2 Japanese tourists caught COVID-19 from visiting Hawaii, prior to the outbreak in Wuhan.  The 7th World Military Games in Wuhan on 18th October sees the US sending 350 athletes to the games. They won zero medals. Were they sick?  In the course of the games local Wuhan media reported of athletes going down with infectious diseases.  2 weeks after the games, local wuhan people were detected with an unknown respiratory disease.   Genetic tests proved that US has 5 strains of COVID-19. China has 2 and originated from the 5 US strains.  Italy tested that most of the infections in the countries had no Chinese connection and might had been present for a long time."

101572044,34887900,David BK Tan,"Mar 13, 2020","To understand the origin of covid19, one has to look at viral genomes as they do not lie. Below study by three Chinese scientists and a scientist at St Louis University using global data is revealing. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2?fbclid=IwAR2CGS10WR9_5KUxmsWTfNBSD7W5_OXdgLR_Pts5EcW807oRyysMg3msF78  They discovered that there are two sources and Wuhan's source (Type II) was like a child virus and it inherited from a parent (Type I). So Type 1 source could spread itself or mutate itself to create child viruses just like the case in Wuhan. But there was no Type I in Wuhan so Type I was from a different location.  Their study makes sense because when one looks at the example of Italy. Italy has banned the Chinese on Jan 31 which is also what SG had done but Italy's measure was more stringent as they banned all flights from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau too. If one looks at the current outbreak, it happened from late Feb onwards. Given the 14 days of incubation period, the outbreak if spread by Chinese visitors shd have started in mid Feb. So its current outbreak could be due to Type II (a child virus just like Type I mutation in Wuhan) or directly from Type I which source is not from China.  Indeed, as reported in the Guardian https://bit.ly/3cG7OBt : ""....laboratory tests that isolated a strain of the virus from an Italian patient, which showed genetic differences compared with the original strain isolated in China and two Chinese tourists who became sick in Rome.""  The current global outbreak happens because the western countries believe that it is a Chinese disease (by eating wildlife) and they never look at their backyard that the source is actually there."
