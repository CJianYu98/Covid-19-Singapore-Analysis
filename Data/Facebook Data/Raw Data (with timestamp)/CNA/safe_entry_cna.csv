101575160,80002900,Rul Abd,"Jun 14, 2020",The numbers are those detected. I am just saying that the numbers will never be zero as many now are asymptomatic cases. Not trying to make the issue small. Take the numbers into perspective as well. How many have recovered? How many in ICU? How many in care facilities? How many of the new infections are from existing clusters?   It is not about putting our guard down either. It is about being responsible and do what we have to do to ensure as much as possible we are keeping one another safe.  This is really a balancing act between public health and the economy. It is tough.,

It's not an issue of who will get infection, but when, Just like H1NI and H5N1 flu. We don't know who has it and who doesn't, or perhaps those who have it might have been able to get better from it by themselves over time. I guess in the meantime is about taking the necessary precautions yet moving on with life. And pray for the vaccine to quickly come into fruition.",

Be grateful, live with the new norm. Change your way of living with hygiene, don wait for someone to change it for you. Some how it's a good sign that we see the figure rise and deflate and at a consistent level, Not a sudden surge in the open community. This also show how effective our system works. As long as the virus not contained globally. Don be too happy with zero figure. Lockdown, circuit Breaker etc will not do us good at all. Economy must move on... We must live and move on like usual with a little bit changes. Rotting at home will not do us good. When you are out of money, out of job, out of food, you will know covid is not the worst.

They do extremely well to break new records  40000 people infected by  Coronaviruses,new high records of dengue clusters developing due work stoppages and new records of 26 deaths.  Why they never wear masks in conferences and parliament in enclosed air conditioning room while citizens are fined in open room conditions by circuits breakers regulations? Why crowded public transportation social distancing can peel away by transportation minister Khaw boon wan while their citizens are fined for carpooling? Why can people action party members of parliament require sheep to produce cotton?Why  they only consider more important for dormitory workers and their elections victory  instead of their frontline workers, students ,pass permit holders workers and old parents helplessly in their families ? Are the reserves funds wasted in these circuits breakers regulations until the people action party members of parliament gold standard reputation tarnished according to international BBC and CNN reporting?",

Standing infront of cash counter staff to order, one customer is transparent to them. Either taking and laughing having good time together or not interested in serving that customer. Very rude F&Bs staffs attitude. You and i will be paying for food charged. Different treatments to customers. Now no dine in customers are allowed. Only take away. Business is as per normal but different until circuit breaker lifted. Donating free meal, to someone who can afford. Stupid. It's their choice. Every businesses only profit and money making. Back then, food quality and worth paying for and not expensive. Now, it's tasteless and expensive, we still buy and eat. Quality failed. Prices are up. Profitting. No hygiene. Spoil and drop on floor can take and put back in trays and sell. Serving foods no hand gloves and mask.  Sometimes food comes with hair. Special ingredients added. Same all F&Bs.
