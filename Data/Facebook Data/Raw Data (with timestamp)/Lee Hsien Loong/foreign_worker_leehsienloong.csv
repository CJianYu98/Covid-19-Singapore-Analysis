Because I go to all the malls in the neighbourhood is always packed with people. All businesses are doing great. Long Q with no social distancing. But people who run business in the city are closing down because you made all the people to work from home . Cannot pay rent because government help only till July. Now the landlord after the retail shops for rental. So no people coming to work. So how can the retailers in the city survive?

33472270,5339980,Ong Yong Peng,"Jun 14, 2020","Good to see that the situation is under control, and Singapore is starting to reopen the economy.  But the pandemic is not yet over, much effort is still required in passing on the correct information to the public, the community and the foreign workers.  To ensure restaurants can reopen safely, it is a good idea to indicate at the entrance the maximum number of patrons allowed, so that there is no argument.  In Australia, the rule is 1 person per 4sqm.  The restaurant has to further limit the number if there are additional health or safety concerns.  It is encouraging to see the government assisting small businesses to adopt digital payment.  However, to minimise costs for unnecessary subsequent upgrade of equipment, service providers should consider wireless and edge technologies, solar and battery backup power, cybersecurity, etc.  The more the service providers can do to lower adoption and operation costs, the more small businesses will take up the practice, and the more savings flow to the individual consumers."

Moving ahead, how do we be able to cost effectively cope with covid 19 recovery phase and immunity phase.  Your trace tracker can add a step counter to sync with the Health 365, save on your budget and it has a reward effect for those who wear it to win vouchers for hitting 10k steps..  All the sites using the same method or different? What's the cost to recover ratio? What the elements that have the highest recovery? How to lower the cost while maintaining efficiency?  This is not a sprint, more like a marathon. Devil on the detail. Prevention vs detection. Dive in the policies and guideline in social distancing, contact tracing. Food/Lifestyle/Work/Transport all need to change.  Btw inform Google playstore and Apple App store, Huawei Appgallery to block all Fake Trace Together application.

I guess our FWs in the Dormitories, are equally worried as to what is going to happen to them next. Like many have shared, these people (FW) at dormitories should be thanked for building our infrastructure and keeping Singapore clean.  We should really do our best to assist these people with the best we can to keep them safe and reassure their family back home that they are taken care well during this time.

The success of the CB is the big deal. As individual , should we should all bear the social responsibility ,sacrifice a bit to ensure the big success."

32096690,9095780,Siva Rajoo,"Apr 21, 2020","Sir , It‚Äôs a good idea to extend the CB measures . However, I hope many of the essential services that are allowed to continue operations should be also revised and reviewed and we should further cut back on movements.   For a start , there are so many essential services concentrated in Changi Airport and as a result a lot of staff movement which includes a significant number of work permit holders. So this is one area where we can scale down as airline frequency is quite Low. Can we consider having Changi airport to close for one month so that we also carry out necessary renovations and upgrade. This is the best time to speed up any infrastructure upgrades when there is no pax movement .   Any flights in the meantime can be operated from Seletar airport if possible.  So we can still have freighter cargo flights operating.   We need to consider cutting down on essential services movement as much as possible. Let‚Äôs all hope our efforts bear positive results soon. Thank you sir.  #sgunited"
32096690,9095780,HS Chin,"Apr 21, 2020","Not sure to make the decision to extend the CB by another month at this moment is the correct one as so far, majority of the cases occurred at the dorm and local cases around 20. As we moved to the 2nd half of the CB, we should see the local cases coming down even further.  I think to make the call whether to extend the CB on the end of 3rd week will give us better visibility on our measures. CB has huge impact on our economy with many businesses affected, workers losing their jobs and students not learning much from HBL.

Now, they have cost the country's economy hundreds of millions of dollars in a month, caused our nation's reserves to be depleted, and exacerbated the economic hardship of our people, with the government having to pick up the tab! All this for personal greed. Given the havoc they've helped to wreck on our economy, it seems only just that some of the money spent on shoring up our economic defences should be clawed back from these individuals."

Currently, we have to use a pen and paper to write down our particulars, this added an opportunity for the virus to pass to one another, as viruses are known to stay on surfaces for extended periods (up to 3 days on paper and plastics).  For the same reason, I try only to touch the things I need to buy, avoiding any unnecessary exposure to myself.  My solution is to have a simple functionality added to TraceTogether, using the camera function to scan a QR code at the premise when we enter.  Do what we need to do and quickly leave.  This was used at the recent airshow at Changi, the only difference, we pre-fill our particulars, just scan & go! Those without smartphones may still use old tech - pen and paper. Do this even after CB is over as SOP until we are clear of the woods."

With the circuit breaker measures add on for another 4 weeks till 1 Jun, it is impossible for males not to have their haircut.  Have you guys ever consider those people that are in essential services? These people include police officers, firefighters and etc. They are facing the members of public, and 6 weeks without a haircut will make them look very unprofessional looking.   Please reconsider to include hair salon - basic haircutting service as an essential service, especially for those in frontline. Thank you."

However, as there are still big pool of reservoir of unlink cases, and in the spirit to prevent new wave of Covid 19, may I propose to government to consider to postpone all non essential hospital medical appointment and non essential civil suits file in high court as well as state court. Of course, urgent criminal cases must and should be adhere to original court schedule.   Below is my definition of non essential medical appointment and non essential civil suits   Non essential medical appointment refer to medical condition that is not life threatening or non respiratory related symptom.   Non essential civil suits refer to suits that was file with the court on or after November 2019 as these cases are still in the early stage of proceeding and can afford to wait until the Covid 19 is more stabilise.   The above proposal will reduce the human traffic in these 2 essential building and thus reduce and eliminate new wave of transmission. "

32096690,9095780,Philip Wee,"Apr 21, 2020","Dear Mr Lee, in order to beat this virus by end of eCB, just think we need the task force to move much further ahead of the curve. Just as I tweeted not to waste the original CB period and implement compulsory wearing when leaving the house, I am glad with or without my tweet it is implemented. Just my thoughts on few areas we may want to think about to get ahead. First, current contact trace methodology is not effective when it comes to asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic. Even though I am not comfortable with the contact tracing app due to privacy concerns, please make it compulsory. We need to relink the unlinked cases through location/time overlap analysis with patient 0, coupled with testing to find patient -1. We need to use technology to shorten the analysis. Second, if the possibility exists that the pandemic will last far beyond eCB, we need to have a more effective mask strategy. Cotton masks while reducing the level of contaminants do not have the same trapping properties of a simple 3 ply surgical mask. A Canadian study have shown such a mask is sufficient besides offering some more protection to the wearer. Third. We need to use our science teams to figure out how to make aerosols settle quickly or maybe trapping it especially in aircon places. Maybe it is in the form of a diffuser/purifier. It will be a reusable solution not just in Singapore and for future epidemics. Fourth, we cannot just sit and wait for Jun 1st and than figure out, can we re-open, how do we re-open, etc. We plan on a worst case basis that the virus will take a long time to address, so we need to be smart about how do we still open. Do we use mass testing for e.g. figure out who is already immune and be deployable ? do we open office building by building, or sector. How do we use enhanced contact tracing to quickly contain the cases, can we get testing down to 1 min and implement quick test at buildings, etc. The rainy budget is not bottomless and more SMEs fold, it will be worst than the property bust we have seen before. regards"

32096690,9095780,Kai Xian,"Apr 22, 2020","Sir:  I propose for the Ministry of Healthy and relevant agencies to impose a shutdown of food delivery platforms such as Grab, FoodPanda, Deliveroo etc, to prevent new clusters of Covid-19 transmission and the spread of the virus.  It has been evident in the past two weeks of 'Circuit Breaker' that delivery riders have faced tremendous pressure in their job of delivering F&B to customers at home. Shortly after the announcement of tightening and restriction of what is deemed to be ‚Äúessential‚Äù, a number of videos have circulated on the internet which displayed the rowdy behaviour of delivery riders and F&B workers. Some of the commotion between the riders and stores resulted in close contact of these persons in their individual bids to put their point across.  Such behaviour is fairly understandable- likely due to the pressures of increased orders and lacklustre management of orders. These delivery riders on the ground are helpless except to do their utmost to fulfil their daily orders. The delivery platforms have also been purported to be almost impossible for delivery riders to cancel orders in view of unforeseen situations such as long waiting times or out-of-stock items. These circumstances inadvertently culminated into displays of frustrations, jostling, and hurling of insults or abuses. It has also been evident many F&B locations are ironically, the ground of close gathering of delivery riders who have almost no option to practice safe-distancing at these crowded venues. The mood of Singaporeans from all walks of life is expected to run high through the Circuit Breaker period, and occurrences of these unfortunate disputes are likely to increase.  One cannot be certain that all delivery riders or F&B outlets are Covid-free. It would take just one infected individual in the nucleus to spread devastating consequences deep into the homes of families waiting for their orders.  The measures at wet markets and supermarkets are quite effective in allowing families to purchase groceries. Food establishments also remain open and people should have little difficulty to get food and drinks for consumption.  It is timely that the Ministry consider a shutdown of the delivery platforms to minimise potential outbreak of the virus within the community."

32096690,9095780,Frankie Jeremy Lee,"Apr 21, 2020","One of the best perspectives of the current situation that I read so far :-  From Dr Sharmil de Silva:  I think the thing most people don‚Äôt understand is that the lock down is in place to slow the progression of the disease, NOT to eradicate it by end of May.  I think people are missing the point because they naively think the govt will somehow get rid of it so life goes back to normal. These are people who have ignored the global reality since January. This is the dangerous delusional thinking that some people are applying in their assessment of the situation when advocating we should stop the lockdown because they are literally only waking up to this thing now, or when we were initially shut down. So let‚Äôs lift the curtain a bit.  1. Flattening the curve means slowing down the disease so that hospitals can cope with the sick. It does not mean eradicating the disease all together.  2. No government will be able to eradicate the disease this year. It‚Äôs here until a cure or a vaccine is found   3. A vaccine is at least a year away. That‚Äôs April 2021. The earliest vaccine trials just started late last month. It takes 18 to 24 months to make, test and assess the efficacy of a vaccine. So 1 year is literally a Hail Mary.   4. There is NO going back to normal. Your normal will not exist for at least a year. Economies globally will keep bleeding and we are likely to have rolling lockdowns until a vaccine is found.  5. Even when the ban is lifted, tourism and hospitality industry, and many others will not see an increase in business for at least a year. Until a vaccine is found people will continue to self isolate even when a lock down is lifted.   6. The only reprieve we are going to get is if we have thousands of people who have been infected and recovered and minimum deaths so that we have some level of herd immunity. That is also still a theory that is yet to be proven because some countries think they may be seeing people get reinfected. Even with that in place normal is not feasible because fear still reigns and people will remain isolated until safety is guaranteed- cure or vaccine. Refer to point 3.  7. The above is still 6 months away. We are projected to reach our peak in September. That means, bleeding economy, rolling lockdowns, death and chaos until then.  8. The decisions made in the lockdown like no alcohol and no dog walking or running and no e-commerce are not made with the privileged in mind. They are made with the masses in mind. What you allow in the suburbs you must allow in the townships and those two things look very different in execution.   Now our government is doing the best it can and they have reacted faster than most developed countries. Our progress is still better than most and right now we‚Äôre riding the dumb hope that somehow BCG gives us some fighting chance (still unproven).   So please please we all need to do whatever we can to help our neighbors, help each other, support our government and stop having delusional ideas about any level of normalcy at the end of this month. Adjust your projections and hunker down.   This is not a joke and it‚Äôs not even anywhere near any semblance of real yet.   Normal is dead. Let that sink in. But HOPE  is very much alive!"

From that smile, I see his great love for his work.   Truly SG, as a nation is generous and kind by heart. No wonder this country is so blessed. God bless you SG!"

Neighbours DO NOT CLOSE doors and walking around, without any care or concern. I hope Social Distancing can be Explicit that All HDB home doors are closed, to prevent people just walking in and out up and down  stairs, because there's no prevention of distancing. Next, It is a very crucial preventive  measure because 80% of us live in HDB. If neighbours are careless, just imagine!

Generally the ground is calm to accept it as we see our government did not sit on it BUT all out to close the gap. To filter out the affected in dormitory asap.  I agree with Forum letter today that when we do execise, mask must be on, without exercise for 1 or 2 months will not risk our lives. when i went  NTUC today,  i see every where people flouting the rule under the cover of exercise by putting on the the sportsshoe or ride on a bicysle to jalan jalan without mask on. This has created unhappiness in the ground, many has sacrified to stay home and only go out when necessary and most have obeyed when out must with mask on all times.we must not allow these trouble makersto put our effort in vain  People are unappreciative of the flexibility granted But exploit them for own convenience or try to be hero [ BUT remeber when hero created, someone must die or many will dies]. Previuosly complained no mask to wear BUT now masks distributed, don't want towear.  Would like to thank you and your Team for the strategy and sustainable plan put in to contain 1st and 2nd wave and now 3 waves."

Due to our structural limitations, and that migrant workers are essentially younger, fitter and healthier, perhaps we may explore a form of ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù strategy to mitigate this crisis provided that infected symptoms are mild or asymptomatic, not in danger and that welfare prioritized.  Recovered patients can voluntarily donate plasma to help speedy recoveries of their friends.  Recovered patients can become and add to our increasing ‚Äúimmunized‚Äù core migrant workforce numbers to further help our economy and start more virtuous cycles.  Our best and brightest scientists can study this and plan this into a workable strategy and maybe the world may also start their own workable ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù strategy which is safer for the population."

Although it may affect human rights or privacy , a tracing app should be made mandatory for all. The app is installed automatically on all mobile phones by the telco . Visitors are not to be exempted . We need to work out the security and this app disabled on departure for visitors. ( Perhaps we can work out an agreement among the ASEAN members) 2. It may be difficult to put back all the FW into the dorm again and alternatives cannot be produced overnight .  Suggest that the temporary accommodations be used as long as practicable such as yet to be demolished HDBs , empty schools , empty barracks etc. Floatels and cruise ships are just too expensive .  3. In the long run , we have to consider seriously the question of FW accommodations . It is impossible to have hygienic communal toilets and kitchens . Remember all those SIT flats that were torn down.

You were praised by WHO, initially, for handling the pandemic. Now, it's only a matter of time, before the foreigners in the construction industry, situated in the dorms, carry on a snowball effect onto the rest of Singapore.  I would like to sincerely thank you & your team, for this eye-opening event, with you insistently, wanting to hold the General Election DURING the pandemic. Have we not learned from Israel?? They had theirs & the numbers JUMPED!! There's no predicting, but there's prevention. We've gone into protection mode wayyyyy later than other countries.  Guess now, you will retract your statement you made, on how, ""Covid-19 is less deadly than SARS"". Now, regardless well or unwell, everyone's to put on a mask.  Can the cloth masks actually prevent the virus from entering us?! Sometimes, it's best to hear from experts, who aren't afraid to speak the truth, not because they must listen to someone else, but because, that's what's best."

Please add just a few more measures: give all infected persons with mild symptoms and frontline personnel vitamins A, C, D and zinc (10,000 IU, 1000 mg, 5000 IU and 30 mg every day); ensure all meals are low in sugar and refined carbohydrates but rich in vegetables, fruits and fibre; and add a serving or two of yogurt with live cultures every day. They must have adequate protein in their meals. And make sure they all have 15 minutes sun exposure on large areas of their bodies between 10am to 4pm. Dark-skinned folks will need to spend more time under the sun (2-4X). These measures will give them internal qi to fight the infection or prevent frontline from getting struck down by the virus. If resources allow, please make those vitamins and mineral available to the wider population at cost and urge people to consume them on a daily basis. It only costs $1 a day at normal retail prices."

Symptomatic people to get tested --> these are the true community cases.  What you mention is mass testing? (at population level) i.e. What we are doing in dorm? The dorm number is so high because large number is being tested daily. These numbers consist of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. They are doing this because of the unique living environment that prevent them from basically obeying any form of social distance."

31976397,56965370,Kelvin Leong,"Apr 17, 2020","Dear Mr Lee, I have some suggestions on how to combat the pandemic outbreak. There is much we can learn from how South Korea successfully arrested the outbreak after a terrifying start.   Firstly, we need to significantly ramp up testing so as to identify the infected, especially the asymptomatic ones. I watched a video in which a South Korean medical expert explained that the main reason why they could contain what seemed like widespread community transmission was by extensively testing the population so that the infected could be quarantined. Even though South Korea's situation is now under control, they still have public booths available for any member of the public to be tested.   Contrast that to Singapore's situation. My friend who was sick visited a clinic and requested for a coronavirus test but was rejected. He was deemed not to exhibit sufficient symptoms to be tested. But hasn't the coronavirus been proven to be asymptomatic? In light of that, we should not be turning people away for tests. We have to be more proactive in order to quickly identify the infected before the spread worsens.   I understand there is a political price with extensive testing, as the numbers could significantly increase. Indeed the South Korean president was initially embarrassed by the speed of the outbreak, but his willingness to swallow the bitter pill has won him the respect of his people as he managed to arrest the outbreak. His party won a resounding electoral victory. We too must swallow the bitter pill in order to stop the outbreak.   Secondly, may I suggest that we get the best PITs from the SAF to design some home-based fitness routines for all ages. In the absence of a vaccine, the best medicine to fight the virus is exercise. Exercising is crucial in building up our immune system, which is an important way for us to fight off the coronavirus. It is also a good way to relax our mind and cost nothing. We can air exercise routines live on tv, and encourage everyone to participate at home. This is a good way for the nation to bond in this time of crisis. "

For the population at large to be able to grasp the effectiveness of the CB measures for which they are taking ownership of, 2 sets of curves must be shown(community & FW).

This should not have happened if the ""think tanks"" have given a thought about this obvious situation with FWs. The relevant ministries should have been aware of the living conditions in the dorms. They should have equated the situation in infected cruise ships to these cramped dorms and should have taken preventive steps. The dorm operators should be punished and held responsible for spreading an infectious disease. We have not heard a squeak from the owners/operators of the dorms. Are they still allowed to carry on? They make money during normalcy. Now tax payers' money is used to correct their negligence. Add to this, government agencies overseeing these dorms have not admitted to shortcomings.... they pride themselves in their ability to overcome problems as they develop."

What monitoring measures has MOM put in? This spread in the dorm has shown how we have not shown true compassion and respect to these workers- as employers, as fellow men and women and as a country.

All the FWs and FDWs are provided with accommodation unlike some in other countries where they have to live out on their own. So, I think the FWs and the FDWs are well taken care of here in SG.

The large migrant workers numbering 200k to 300k is not sustainable for now and the future. It will have to be scaled down whether industries like it or not. Those labor-intensive industries have to be phased out and moved to other countries. Now that we have identified that community spread is not the cause of the surge, perhaps we may want to rethink our strategy going forward. The next thing most citizens are concerned whether these virus will spread to our local folks thru public transport, shopping centres, malls and hawker centres and food court. Thank you"

That means do a 100% check on all the workers staying in dormitories all over Singapore whether there are cases or not. Because nobody knows which dormitories are already infected and how many are.   After 100% test, those confirmed cases are to be separated out immediately for quarantine. Those tested negative are to continue stay in their dorms for another 3 weeks or so. Then the testing n monitoring process continues.  We will also need to look into the welfare of our maids. Probably previously they have made contact with friends in the dormitories. To play safe, or kiasu, it should be compulsory for employers to send their maids to go for test.  If we did not move ahead to being proactive, then reactive actions will be too late.

The government needs to relook into housing conditions and management of facilities and cleanliness for our foreign workers and their living quarters once all this is over .   Errant companies who reap millions of dollars of profits but have paid scant attention to the housing management and welfare needs of their foreign workers need to be taken to task .    Many of us are not unaware of their tough lives toiling in the heat for hours daily and they go back to cramp and squalid conditions.  But most of us have chosen to be blissfully unaware of their plights and take their contributions towards our nation building for granted.   Let‚Äôs get real, many Singaporeans are secretly xenophobic towards these foreign workers; they who build your lovely homes and towering sky scrapers .   Blame only the government ?

While the exponential increase in the cases is a cause of concern, it's also a real opportunity for us Singaporeans, 4G leaders and young Singaporeans who may not have gone through ww2 to go through the baptism of fire.   Comments from other countries media have pointed that the 2nd wave of transmission has knocked us off our feet. It has. The question is how we bounce back. Bouncing back with ingunity and guts lets us learn a better lesson than if we had got by with solutions such as hotel stays at rasa Sentosa. We want to be remembered for bouncing back, beating the curve, being able to continue our lives after the CB. That shall be our gold standard.   It is clear that the leaders are moving away from the strong statesmen approach of the yesterday towards a consultative, multi agency, evidence based approach. We all have to rise to the challenge. The 3 prong approach does not sound aggressive enough. In time to come, more solutions will be need to be deployed to solve the issue of migrant workers density.   At the citizens front, we need to be aware that this is like a war. And during war time, we don't eat ding Tai feng."

They are not allow to leave the room. As a employer we cater food for the workers but the dormitory operator reject as they comment that all food will be supplied by MOM. The food that they supply is not accepted. PRC workers don‚Äôt take spicy food but they are given curry which is not suitable for them ... The food that they supply to blangadesh worker is not edible. Some of my workers have food poisoning after eating the food... How is this accepted and allowed? We, as employer want to take care of them and want to supply edible and better food for these workers yet not allowed. When we feedback to dormitory operator, they say it‚Äôs under MOM care but when we inform MOM, they feedback it‚Äôs dormitory operator care, SO who should we really look for to change? We are definitely together with the government in this period of health crisis, to help this covid-19 situation but we hope something can be done to improve their living condition. After all, they come a Long way to work here and we want to Ensure they can live well even under quarantined."

According to a report by TWC2, a foreign worker in great pain was unable to get Panadols even! After many calls, he was told to call for ambulance that cost $150. How can a worker afford that?How come MOM did not set up a doctor/clinic on site at all dormitories to treat non-virus sicknesses of workers, since e workers are quarantined n cannot leave dorm to go see outside doctor? As a first world nation, this is unacceptable. MOM must seriously address this issue ASAP. It was said that our foreign workers will be well cared for. Please Ensure that quarantined workers at all the dormitories have a doctor/clinic onsite to treat their non virus sicknesses. We seek your help on this urgent issue for our foreign workers Sir.

Why IKEA, Courts  now. I heard from my neighbour still people buying and buying, long queue despite the govt reassuring us not to panic buy.  My bro told me tekka market very packed until the veg seller auntie got worried. She told my bro that she is closing her stall for the next 3 weeks. Dear people pls stay home pls cooperate. No body wants to see you go without food. Just give a call to get food delivered to your door step. That's what we are doing. My fridge is empty, but it's fine with me. We are 4 in the household.

Unlike other bigger countries, Singapore being a small nation  (population and size) has a advantage and in best position to implement a mandatory covid testing exercise for all. The rapid test kit is easy to use and efficiently screen suspected patients. This will immediately and effectively filter out those infected individuals and more importantly those undetected carriers. Along with our resources, this exercise can be carry out smoothly and effectively at all community Centers islandwide. Do hope the team can consider studying this option. Thank you. "

To the authorities, I urge you give the public a tougher stance and stop making the 'STAY HOME' a compulsory one. Anyone going out must have an urgent need to be out.

I suspect some FWs (WP, EP included) and foreign students with Covid-19 are staying low & not going for test especially with work-from-home, study-from-home wef Tuesday.   We should make their employers/sponsors personally responsible for their accommodation if they want to keep them in Singapore.   Some are still illegally lodging in HDB and private apartments turned into dormitories.   May I suggest URA, HDB and MOM work together to stamp these out. They must be given more authority to enter these premises when neighbours report them.  And increase the penalties on such owners.  I used to live in an apartment block and a few of us owners reported on an unit that was converted to a dormitory with temporary partitions. For years, the authorities were unable to enter the unit and the tenants knew what to say when authorities came knocking. This should not be so difficult if MOM records show more than 8 tenants including FWs/students registered under the same address.   Another measure is to get FWs update any change of their address online with each move as they tend to move frequently.  And the owner has to confirm their occupancy. "

Unlike the situation in Spore people are living their lives as usual as if nothing happened at all.

It has better ventilation too. Just need to put up temporary walls so as not to let too much wind blow in. You could also deploy army medics(serving and reservist) to help out if manpower were to run short for the medical staffing. Yes, maybe some NSmen or NSboy wouldn't want to be in the front line, but I believe most would as it's of national crisis. It's inevitable for our numbers to increase with so many Singaporean still having the habit of queuing up and clustering. Old behavior can't be changed overnight as we all know too.  Maybe you should be seen as more strict about it in your public address. Maybe then we Singaporean can get the message right. Something when we see you smile, it makes us unsure.

I have my humble suggestions to offer to your team. 1. Tag to the wrist those who are on quarantine to ensure they don't move around to spread to others. 2. I still see long queues at ntuc. People are buying excessively and causing the long wait for others. I suggest limit what they can buy to only 1 basket load or at most $50 worth of items. This applies even if they queue with their helpers. Please don't allow them to use trolleys as they stack up too much n leave trolleys lying around everywhere. This cause others who only buy few items to wait for a v long time, half an hour or more to get to pay. 3. Enforce stricter measures for people who break the rules like heavier fines or go to jail.

If people keeps taking everything out of the supermarket while government says they have enough supply, we are placing a ""sell position"" of the country, and the more ""sell position"" people does, the harder for government to negotiate with foreign suppliers, and when food price increases will cause more people placing ""sell position"" by visitinig supermarkets more frequently but not necessarily.

This clearly reflect the irresponsible, arrogant and selfish attitudes of some of our citizens. This is indeed a shame to say the least. Perhaps it‚Äôs time for more harder measures and stronger words as well as harsher punishment to be implemented. After all these are very difficult times that Singapore is experiencing and being confronted by an unseen ‚Äòenemy‚Äô that is growing threateningly uncontrollable by the day! For a start all Malls should be shut to discourage crowds, wearing of masks should be made mandatory when taking public transport, gathering of 10 should be scaled down to not more than 3 and social distancing guidelines must be strictly adhered to or else appropriate punishment be meted out promptly.  Hopefully you are right that in the weeks to come we may see a drop in local transmission. Thank you and God bless!"

As far as we know, some dormitories have their own minimart, food court, eateries etc.  Are we missing too many loopholes ?  We also see that a lot of foreign workers have no knowledge of what is going on now, what is covid19, how it is affecting people if they do not practice social distancing and good hygiene. They are seen to be sitting on crossed seats and still gather in groups and speak to each other in close proximity. Many of them do nt understand or read English, so they can‚Äôt understand such notice too even when they enter the mall.   Also pls refrain from allowing our seniors from working in the dormitories and places that‚Äôs high risk pls ...   Can make it a mandatory to close the F&B outlets in the dormitory clusters, so that those elderly who worked there are forced to stay home ?  My mom 64 a singapore citizen is working in sungei tengah dormitory as a hawker, and her employer is simply not bothered because it‚Äôs her boss‚Äôs best chance to earn more $$$ with foreign workers all being lockdown. Her boss is not stationed there himself to work at all. So he won‚Äôt face any risk of infection. We have been persuading her to quit but she see no risk. Instead she feel it‚Äôs hard for her to get a job at her age so she wants to continue despite the high risk. Today she is still going to work, even on weekends. Waking up at 4am to reach dormitory before 6am, and slog until 3pm. We are all very worried about her, even my aunts have been persuading her to quit but old ppl is really stubborn .  Only laws and government can stop her now...  Pls pls pls... May I beg the government pls consider this appeal, can the government do something abt it, maybe  provide catering packed food delivery for them instead to minimize human interaction ??"

It would be ideal if density at these dormitories are reduced significantly.  However, more can be done now to ""actively attack"" the virus transmission at these dormitories, the top priority now is to identify & isolate any more potential infected carriers especially asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who may not realized they are carrier. Most men(which the bulk of these dormitories workers are, would probably have been more busy with their work at workplaces previously)& will tend to be less fastidious about COVID-19 prevention measures like safe distancing with others in dormitories & enhanced hygiene measures, so health officials may need to come out with programs to educate & emphasize to them the importance of personal hygiene(not touching face without thorough washing of hands with soap & water & after visiting toilets & before meals etc.)in their native languages for any who have difficulty comprehending English. Facilities owners will need to increase frequencies of toilet/bathing area cleaning at these dormitories as well.  With current development of Singapore's own rapid test kits which we have shared with neighboring countries, it should be time to ramp-up production of more of these accurate test kits as there may now be a need to conduct more tests on any potentially infected dormitories residents for early detection & isolation to prevent even higher transmission numbers.  Contact Tracing/Investigation Teams will need to quickly establish & identify any potential close contacts of current confirmed cases of dormitories residents & authorities would need to quickly mount a larger scale COVID-19 testing on these close contacts of the confirmed cases who may appear healthy now at these dormitories so as to identify & isolate any asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who will not realize they are sick yet & halt any further transmissions in such higher density dormitories setting & reduce the burden on Singapore Healthcare workers & facilities."
