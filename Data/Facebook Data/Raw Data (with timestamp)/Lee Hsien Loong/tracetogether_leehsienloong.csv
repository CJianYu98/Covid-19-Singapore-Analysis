40712711,79602220,Dep Trai Tan,Feb-18,"Dear PM , please consider allowing overseas citizens to return and pick up their luggage from home friends or family members, so that we could just collect our personal items and fly off immediately, without having to be subject to the 14 days stay home policy. Alternatively, please allow returning citizens to show proof of covid vaccination or recent negative pcr test, in order to waive the 14 day quarantine requirement. Thank you."
40712711,79602220,Ethelred Fernandez,Feb-17,Thank you dear PM for ensuring that vaccine is available for all citizens . Take care and God bless 
40712711,79602220,Lim Seng Heng,Feb-17,"Thank you PM Sir. On a separate subject, I am puzzled that nobody in JTC is aware of the clearing of the Kranji woodland until after only about 3 weeks later. Surely someone in the higher up ranks at JTC must be not doing his job well. Clearing of a forest is unlike clearing of rubbish at rubbish chutes that may take just 10 mins to complete the job. Clearing of a forest takes weeks if not months to complete. Meanwhile where is the oversight, supervision and communication by JTC with the contractors, I wonder? Honestly it is quite akin to security agencies illegally leaving the protection of an installation for weeks without anyone higher-ups knowing it. "

40543075,94631910,Mantha Srinivas Sastry,Feb-11,"As we bid adieu to the year of Rat 🐀, which has been challenging and unprecedented in more than one way, here’s something positive to look out for a Oxcipious new year.  There are 20 strokes in 疫情，the Chinese characters for pandemic.  There are 20 strokes in 痛苦, the Chinese characters for pain/hardship.  There are 20 strokes in 疾病, the Chinese characters for illness/disease.  There are 20 strokes in 生死存亡, the Chinese characters for life and death, survival and demise.  2020 is gone. And so we hope that pandemic, hardships, diseases and death will also be gone.  On the other hand:  There are 21 strokes in 健康, the Chinese characters for health.  There are 21 strokes in 幸福，the Chinese characters for happiness.  There are 21 strokes in 富贵，the Chinese characters for wealth.  There are 21 strokes in 和睦, the Chinese characters for harmony.  There are 21 strokes in 勤奋，the Chinese characters for industry.  There are 21 strokes in 崛起, the Chinese characters for ascendancy.  And so it seems 2021 will be a year of HEALTH and HAPPINESS.  Taking this opportunity to wish all the hero’s both in front line, backend and the resolute Singaporeans during these difficult times, a very Happy New Year. Gong Xi Fa Cai. "

40195341,74775920,Puneet Walia,Feb-17,"Dear Sir  Its time that SG Govt formulate new entry permit rules for SG based professionals, both local and expat, so that business travel cud resume.    Such an arrangement shud now be based on the fact that travelers can be, and shud be, Vaccinated on priority. I will go to the extent of asking SG govt to charge vaccination fee for such people.   2. Such travellers shud be allowed to travel seemlessly without entry permits and  3.  If there is  mandatory SHN requiement for such people, it shud be in the confines of their home rather than hotels.    It must be acknowledged that this disease is not going to go away in a hurry and it cud be 4-5 years before everythingnis back to 2019 days.  In fact there may be no 2019 again for our generation.    Hence, this travel restrictions cannot go on its current form forever and shud be relaxed, at least to allow businesses to resume work related travel.    Thanks n Rgds   Walia P  Gxxx906M"

40195341,74775920,Michael Loh,Feb-01,"MOH booklet (given after vaccination) says... *Please refer to photo* It is a good reference and informative. However, it does not address the immediate 48 hours. Only if side effects get worse or fever persist after 48 hours.. Than SEE A DOCTOR. If the person takes MC within the 48 hours, is it covered under ""Covid vaccination MC"" or deduct from the 14 days annual medical? In revenue bus service companies, the number of MCs taken is peg to Yearly Performance. For Taxis and PHV drivers, they will be more worried about vehicle rental if they fall sick after vaccination. Part timers or ""hand to mouth"" workers will be worried about salary if they fall sick after vaccination. MOH should address or work with the relevant authorities to sort this out and ""TRY"" to assist as much as possible.  Else it ""MIGHT"" discourage affected Singaporeans to get vaccinated."

40195341,74775920,Arunachalam Ramasamy,Jan-30,"Prime Minister Mr. Lee Hsien Loong, you are so cool.  Thank you for leading us to be confident and reassured that taking vaccination is a safe and wise move. We  will definitely follow   to take our vaccination when our turns come. So grateful that we  are provided with this opportunity of arrival of  early vaccination when everyday there are so many infection cases spiking up in other countries. It shows your great  leadership with respect, passion and commitment to support current and future global challenges, including pandemics, climate change, extremist terrorism, sustainable development and cybersecurity. May Almighty shower His blessings abundantly with lots of peace, health, prosperous and happiness to you and entire world communities’ 🇸🇬💞🙏🌹"
40195341,74775920,Hujjatullah Sahib,Jan-29,Salute Sir for examplary conduct and reasonable transparency. This would go a long way to inspire confidence in public.
40195341,74775920,Michael Yee,Jan-31,"What if Singapore and China becomes the exception rather than the norm with the rest of the world. What if the rest of the world decides to open up their borders since COVID is already spreading rapidly and no point in border containment. It means airline flights and other international travel will become ""normal"" but neither China or Singapore is willing to opt in since we have a different strategy from the rest of the world which is hoping on herd immunity via mass infection. Our herd immunity is via mass vaccination. Did our leaders even gave this a thought or response as usual in a knee-jerk fashion?"

40195341,74775920,Lau Siew Wah,Jan-29,"感谢李显龙总理率先打了这个疫苗,让所有新加坡人都知道这个疫苗是安全可靠的! 今天打电话到MOH 询问我先生可否申请早点打疫苗，因为我先生是长期在中国工作的，这次春节回来，希望能打上疫苗。当回中国的时候也会多一层保障。可是得到的答案却是不行！许多在外国工作的新加坡人早期响应政府的鼓励要新加坡人走出国门到外地创业。可是我们这些人在回国的时候却得不到政府的帮助。其实我们也是高危险群，现在外国的局势也不明朗，许多国家的病例在增加，加上要坐飞机等等，心理上也有一点阴影和缺乏安全感。可MOH却告知现在只给70岁及以上的年长者优先，其实新加坡的疫情还是在可控范围以内，倒是我们这些需要经常出国的人其实是处在高危险群的！MOH也告知我说，其实有许多这方面的询问，都是得到被拒绝的回复！既然都有这么多的询问，为何当局不能正视这个问题？帮帮我们这些无助者。一个在外打拼的新加坡人回到新加坡向政府求助却得不到帮助！我希望当局可以考虑将一些疫苗优先给这些经常要步出国门的国人， 同时也让其他国家的人知道，新加坡是一个负责任的国家，绝对不会把病毒传到其他国家去！"

After watching videos of a staff nurse collapse after Vaccinated and there are people who've got infected after getting vaccination with covid infection and all that,  but we know how reliable our government is.  We sincerely believe our government will always do thier best for all Singaporeans.   This videos maybe rumours or true story we don't know.  A friend of mine got vaccinated in one of the Singapore's hospital for front line workers but the rest of the staffs did not volunteer to get vaccinated  just because  they got no clear picture of our vaccination.  For now after your speech I hope whole of Singaporeans will get vaccinated.  I'll be the first for sure.  Thank you sir for all the support you've given us.  God bless you always"

39656161,60167720,Arunachalam Ramasamy,Jan-10," Thank you Prime Minister Mr. Lee Hsien Loong for sharing Teck Ghee Edu save Awards ceremony and the importance of education. This Education Award Ceremony is to recognise, reward and motivate students to do well in schools and also reaffirms a clear position that no individual should be denied a good education because of financial constraints. Congratulation to all the award recipients and their families for their achievements in this tremendously challenging year. Good wishes to all Singaporeans and entire community of the world for better days ahead with more peace, health, prosperous and happiness. "
39656161,60167720,Nam Kok Koo,Jan-10,👍👏 PM Sir. Likewise please do have more bursuary awards to low income students. So their learning journey can continue and break the vicious circle.
39656161,60167720,Chia Emilene,Jan-10,"Good Morning Sir, thank you for the encouragement on the vaccine 💪. Good done & congrats to all the students."
39656161,60167720,Pauljohn Chee,Jan-14,"The Singapore schools students is getting better and better, 🍒thanks to the MOE dedicated program to enlist the best teachers available. We are entering the 4th industrail revolution very soon. China is moving very very fast in technology, can we keep up with them. Probably yes, and no depending on quality of our students. In the present environment our students are exposed to tremendous distraction. One way to counter this is to promote weiqi or Go. I notice countries like China,Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan do have quite a big Go playing population.Are we missing something there?. Weiqi may looks simple but is consider as one of the noble arts in these confucius influenced countries."

39600428,60725050,Johnny Sinon,Jan-08,"The govt of Singapore was proactive in dealing with the pandemic and procuring vaccine for their citizens. They ordered early and have enough for the entire population as well as migrant workers. While in the Philippines, the entitled have received their smuggled illegal vaccines and the rest of us will wait maybe towards the end of 2021. Truly our government is the best and the brightest. "

39600428,60725050,Qingyong Woon,Jan-08,"For the sake of our government stability and risk management, I would like to propose that 1/3 of the cabinet takes each of the 3 approved / going to be approved vaccinations. This will prevent any adverse unknown side effects and show trust to our citizens."

39600428,60725050,Jeffrey Ng,Jan-08,I'm indifferent to the vaccine. Scared of the needle. Fear of being on camera. Freaked out at the attention of the media. 😂🤣
39600428,60725050,Johnny Lim,Jan-08,"PM first to take vaccine, some people may say that PM self-protection for himself first. If don’t be the first to take, people say PM scared of side effects so let the citizens take first. Take also kennah, don’t take also kennah. Hard to please a certain group of people who always surely have something to pick on the government. "

When I hear you on your video posts and addressing us the nation I feel that we have people that care and think about things seriously and carefully.  I have lived here now since 2005 so singapore is now my home and it’s always painful to look back to the my motherland and see how bad things are going for them because of the structure in the Uk. The media are free to say what they liked so they gave wrong information resulting in people being against masks. They were too kanchong about what action to take.   We’re as here everyone involved has done a magnificent effort to keep us all safe. Thanks PM Lee, thanks Fransis Wong and everyone else that was involved from Our home team forces to volunteers at the cc "
39600428,60725050,Chan Chan,Jan-08,"I have a question, by right need wear gloves or no need wear gloves for Healthcare workers when applying vaccination?? Dunno why but I feel something is missing here"
39600428,60725050,Didadi T Ko,Jan-09,Should get some rest after injection. Work stress will obstruct your qi natural flow And definitely avoid any vitamin C n Citrus fruits n foods for a few days to prevent unnecessary surge of body fluids concatenating . From personal experiences.

39600428,60725050,Teng Bang Wei,Jan-09,Can't imagine the amount of pressure the staff nurse must have felt to vaccinate the PM.
39600428,60725050,Sun Haoran,Jan-08,👍👍But nurse is supposed to wear gloves..right..

39600428,60725050,Sha HS,Jan-10,"Waiting for my turn for vaccine! The faster Singapore rolls out , the faster our economy kicks back in. If election votes was done within a day , using that strategy on collecting votes, maybe we can start vacation process using that organised structure 😅 Maybe not completed within a day due to check ups required but we can definitely completed it within 1-2 months if it was well organised just as the elections was. Just an idea 💡"

Most seniors are succumbed to Hypertension, Diabetes, High Cholesterol, T.I.A., Cardiac  problem n Depression etc. In view of their taking these long term medicines will they be contradiction with the effects of the vaccines?

39357668,19819320,Adrian Chew,"Dec 30, 2020","Great that our healthcare workers are having this added protection first. There have often been comments on how the spotlight and adulation are always focused on them. Well it is fully justifiable.  Even during pre-Covid 19 times, the doctors and nurses are overwhelmed with work and yet they are still dedicated, caring and professional towards their patients, sometimes working beyond their shift hours. At times can really see that they literally work non-stop. Thus they fully deserve every accolade and praise heaped on them.  Stay safe and wishing everyone a healthy and blessed year ahead."
39357668,19819320,Victor Lee,"Dec 30, 2020","The front line workers are unsung heroes. Priority should be given to them. Thereafter, the pioneers and seniors.   We must thank our government for the free vaccinations and grateful to the leaders and officials who worked hard to secure vaccines for our citizens."
39357668,19819320,Nam Kok Koo,"Dec 30, 2020",PM Sir believe the challenge is even as free vaccines are progressively available for 🇸🇬 however as it's on voluntary basis hopefully many Singaporeans and eligible long term residents will go for vaccination. No one is safe unless everyone is really safe.
39357668,19819320,Allirajan Ramachandran,"Dec 30, 2020",Thank you sir for all the efforts in bringing in vaccines early here 🙏🏼
39357668,19819320,Andy Wee,"Dec 30, 2020","Front liner, thanks you for putting yr best to ensure what we have today, the best result seen so far amongst our asian country. U deserve the first to be vaccine, stay safe n happy new year's."
39357668,19819320,LU Kee Hong 吕奇峰,"Dec 30, 2020","As a Singaporean n fellow human being, I would advise u against taking the vaccine as u hv preexisting health n medical conditions.  Let your colleagues n the last-line-of-defence medical health care personnel, vulnerable groups n essential workers hv their jabs, if they so wish. The clinical trial results r not 100% n the results fr actual field vaccination exercises r the real deal.  Bless Singapore."
39357668,19819320,Ryan Tee,"Dec 30, 2020",Thank you PM Lee for bringing the vaccines so fast. Many good years ahead
39357668,19819320,Vaidy Swamy,"Dec 30, 2020","GREAT START!!! One request - How about 5million vaccinations in 50 days? (Biden has promised 100million in 100 days).  Benefits Changi can open up  faster!  Big group of SG Healthcare corps volunteers (including me) waiting to volunteer and help the process.  Understand its easier said than done....but our SG is the best!! Ministry of Health, Singapore"
39357668,19819320,Mei Siyong,"Dec 30, 2020",Thanks to our government! Thanks to our medical team! And many people who want to make the vaccine reach Singapore safely!  Thank you all!
39357668,19819320,Tita Rosales,"Dec 31, 2020",Still do the health protocols despite getting vaccinated. Staying clean alwAys is key to getting rid of the virus 
39357668,19819320,Joe Yang,"Dec 31, 2020","Instead of a testing regime, government should urgently look into inoculations of the frontline workers who are exposed to foreigners or foreign entities - namely the aviation (air crews) and marine sectors (engineers who board foreign entities docked in Singapore etc); not just looking at vaccinating the frontline workers of the healthcare sectors. With the access to protective gears, adequate knowledge and experience, healthcare workers are less vulnerable than those workers of the aviation and marine sectors, who also will not know if they are in contact with infected persons or contanminated objects. Please think out of the box."
39357668,19819320,Loh Kim Meng,Jan-01,Good to have vaccines for now but we must improve the strength of the vaccines thus more investment is needed. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are only 95% effective. There is another 5% in which the virus might have a chance to mutate and form a even more deadly virus in future so we should not be celebrating yet.
39357668,19819320,David Ckw,"Dec 30, 2020","Hopefully as we are more experienced, the roll out can be expedited to reach out to all soon."
39357668,19819320,Pei Pei,"Dec 31, 2020","Hi sir , would u be so kind as to consider installing air conditioning for all primary schools ? We're Singapore. Yet we dont even have air conditioner in our schools. It's really 讲不过去.... All the international schools in sg have aircon! We must truly be a world class education hub. Pls support your teaching staff and students with a more conducive environment. I mean, all your headquarters have aircon , so why not schools ? Poor teachers and students....."

39357668,19819320,LOh OhAonghusa,"Dec 30, 2020","Well Stated Lee Hsien Loong ! It is important to use N95 Masks , which are used during Haze. Wash Hands as Regularly as Necessary And if in doubt, then Wash Your Hands Anyway! And also Keep Social Distance.   Remember, the Corona Virus Pandemic has a New More infectious Variant which First Surfaced in The South East Of England at Approximately just before Christmas 2020.  Prevention is Better Than Cure.

39357668,19819320,Philip Chan,Jan-03,"Dear PM, All front line parties should be the first consideration to get protected; Land, sea, air staff, public transportation, Tourist companies staff, hotel. These are most essential team of people to get protection as they face higher outside virus infection risk . For inner countries people as along external exposure people are protected and inner people keep safety measures in mind and continue to practice well  we can fight this war better."

This is a coronavirus and already multiple variant forms of the coronavirus have appeared. It can become a vicious cycle if the global fight against SARS-CoV-2 is not aggressive enough and gives too much opportunity for the virus to mutate.

So.... in case you wish to take holidays, visit other countries and/or family members, either you take the shot or you your freedom will be confiscated. Am I wrong? The other vaccines which are not compulsory in Singapore does not have any influence in our freedom.

Even with vaccines, please do not lift the mandatory mask wearing until all traces of viruses are eliminated.  ** Patients don't immediately develop COVID-19 protection after being vaccinated.  ""We know from the vaccine clinical trials that it’s going to take about 10 to 14 days for you to start to develop protection from the vaccine,"" Ramers said.  Even after those 10 to 14 days, patients still need a second vaccine dose for full protection. ""That first dose we think gives you somewhere around 50%, and you need that second dose to get up to 95%,"" Ramers added.

A layman gets masks up, sanitises often when at work may find vaccines useful for NOW. It makes sense to protect working class families. Do what is best for your situation 😌😷😇"
38975608,50306590,Helen Teo Walton,"Dec 15, 2020","Thank you, Sir for taking good care of us. However, I wonder how long the vaccine will remain good for? Is one shot of the vaccine good forever? Or does one have to take it every few years? Or every year, like the flu vaccine? The article states the following, but then it's still not clear how long this vaccine is good for.  ""It’s possible that in the months after vaccination, the number of antibodies and killer T-cells will drop. But the immune system also contains special cells called memory B-cells and memory T-cells that might retain information about the coronavirus for years or even decades.""       The ""It's possible"", ""might"" sounds so tentative..."

Your statement implies the loved ones of people who get the vaccines, will be v protected if they don't get vaccinated.  From many vaccine experts, those vaccinated still have to wear masks and social distance."
38975608,50306590,Robson Lee,"Dec 15, 2020","Thank you Sir, for the informative article. I fully support and applaud the decisions of the government. We are indeed very fortunate to have a responsible and competent government helming our country. The sterling political leadership enabled Singapore to overcome a very difficult period during the lockdown period with minimal casualties. We must not forget that the global pandemic is still a major problem in many countries. Singaporeans must never be complacent because we are not yet out of the woods. The situation can deteriorate very rapidly for Singapore if there is any let up in our measures and preventive safeguards that have been put in place. Let us all continue to stay vigilant and prudent. We have a responsibility to keep ourselves and our own families safe.  "
38975608,50306590,Goh Boon Gee Larry,"Dec 18, 2020","Singapore with the recent record of 0 local community transmission is definitely commendable. Assuming that  Singapore citizen starts taking up the vaccination, the risk from vaccination is somehow misplaced. Nevertheless, we will never know what the future beholds, I still think the higher risk segment such as front line workers has to be mandated part of the vaccination program."
38975608,50306590,Jeffrey Sim,"Dec 16, 2020","Like all medicines and vaccines there will always be side effects or long term harms. The truth is in the short term if many refuse to be vaccinated the dangers of Covid infections will continue to ravage society socially and economically. Noble act by the leaders to take the first steps. I suggest creating vaccination passports for those vaccinated so that they will be allowed more freedom to travel and resume normalcy. For those who choose not to be vaccinated, well its your choice to continue with restricted movement measures. "

38975608,50306590,Paul Lim,"Dec 15, 2020","Sorry Sir, I beg to differ. As far as I know, these vaccines have no studies done on long term effects and it does not promise that the vaccinated will eliminate the possibility of transmission. So I do not see how it is a way to protect oneself and others for a disease with 99.97% survival rate and most do not even know they have it. According to research, asymptomatics are also not a driver of the pandemic. I do not see any logic of why life cannot go on as per pre-CB without vaccines."

Actually it was only 2, but found to be unrelated to the vaccine. The other 4 did not even get the vaccine, they only got the placebo. The key issue is a great study in motivation. Consider if say, after getting this vaccine, the person can go back to pre COVID-19 status. Means, go anywhere, no need to wear mask, no social distancing, no limit of people to be with. Then everyone will queue up for it. The thing is after getting this vaccine, things remain the same, with all the measures that we have to adhere to. "

38975608,50306590,Yew Hui Phoa,"Dec 15, 2020","A virus infects a cell and directs the cell to make more virus copies, killing the cell eventually. For the vaccine, the mRNA package enters the cell and directs it to make spike proteins, which present themselves on the cell membrane, or they or their fragments might exit the cell. The immune system reacts to the spike proteins, learning how to inactivate them as they mount an immune response.  It is new technology. This application as a vaccine will probably not give us The Handmaid's Tale or Umbrella Corporation. I would be more concerned about future applications that could be more sinister."

We dont base facts on just what a article reports, without putting up proper studies and evidences, right?  There is a good chance of non specific illnesses/disorders arising as a result of mutation of virus, or when the vaccine binds the target but does not eliminate it successfully. This may lead to cytokine storms which may be worse than the virus itself. The article nor vaccine trials seem to have NOT provided evidence that these ADE (aka disease enhancements) will not be observed. It is more common to happen with respiratory illnesses or vaccines."

38143640,68626270,Ong Yong Peng,"Nov 17, 2020","Without a vaccine or an effective treatment, many governments are looking for effective ways of subduing and suppressing COVID19 spread.  This is difficult for two reasons (1) the virus can spread without any symptoms in some patients and clusters form before you know it, (2) long term lockdown is not sustainable and its economic impact can be too harsh for some countries.  With the help of technology, people can work from home or even study from home.  Restrictions can be put in place, like wearing of masks, social distancing, etc.  Not to forget the efforts of our frontline workers.  However, as we slowly reopen and talk about travel bubbles, I think most important is continuous education on the public knowledge of the coronavirus, personal hygiene and social etiquette for the new normal."

Due to no strict rule it becomes  confusing and double standards like that making extra work for public service investigation unnecessarily, certain semi sector unwise manager grab this opportunity to force staff come to work place when they could work from home, if employees trying to fight for their health safety but by then 2nd phase is over already, Shall  the one who set the pharse without clear explanation being demoted?
