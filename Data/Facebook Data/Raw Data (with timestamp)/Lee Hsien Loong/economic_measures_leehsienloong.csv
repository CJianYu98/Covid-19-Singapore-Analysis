40685914,63203520,Bohdi Tree Tree,Feb-18,"Singaporean now with average age of >42. Employers need employ people with capability and not just look at age number.  Many seniors even in 60s still very active, healthy and can be good mentor. Isn't PM Lee already 70, DPM Heng in 60? Are they too old for employers ?  Maybe gov can impose tax rebate for companies with staff average age >50. Then those with staff average age <35, to pay more corp tax."

40685914,63203520,Ramsey,Feb-16,If not for the visionary thinking and the blood sweat and tears by the Pioneer generations we would not even have a reserve to depend on during this terrible crises. We should never ever take our fiscal reserves for granted.  Other countries are larger and even have natural resources to depend on. We only have this man made natural resource which is our reserves. So it is impt to cherish it and also a moral imperative to put back the money for the future generations to use when another crises unfolds.
40685914,63203520,David Lim,Feb-17,"I go through Singapore from nothing in 1959 when I am 9 years old. Today if we somebody and most other nations talk good about us. I am poor living in Tampines rural area from 1950 to 1974 with no tap water, electricity, telephone, TV, fridge etc  but only a small philip radio to hear the news. We live in attap house with no cement on the floor. Just imagine how poor we are with 9 siblings. Honesty if you are rich and somebody many friends will talk good about you but if are poor and few will contact you."

36944062,93955380,Andrew Deane,"Oct 6, 2020",As a normally frequent business visitor to SG I praise the response of your government. But like all economies there has to be a time to open up but with sensible precautions. I am visiting Dubai in November from the UK and it is their approach which is an example on how travel can be handled. I have to provide a negative Covid test certificate taken within 96 hours of flying but can go about my business when I arrive in Dubai without quarantine. When leaving I have to once again provide a negative test before getting on the plane. Is Singapore considering similar approaches to business travellers?

In this everchanging business climate, It's time for the government to change the same old approach of subsidizing courses only when the attendee passes a test. I want to attend higher level courses at subsidised rates with just a certificate of attendance so that I can receive quality training with little stress. The old mindset of subsidies only when I pass the test is a hindrance. It takes the joy out of learning. Having training allowance is a bonus, not a must. Not everyone is yao gui. There are individuals looking for upgrading of skills and knowledge who are, however, not exam savvy. Don't just do the paper chase. Do the skills chase. Be relevant to our needs."

33276062,7302060,Koo Shirley,"Jun 6, 2020","Dear PM, i was quite confuse with the JSS grant . Is the 75%  meant to help on employee salary during this pandemic？ Cause most of the employers were saying that the 75% grant was not meant to be fully pay for employee.（Hence is up to them（employer）to decide. Therefore, alot of them especially in beauty industrial were not having  pay with the 75% grant support. Thank you"
33276062,7302060,Hujjatullah Sahib,"Jun 5, 2020","Great to hear a help package for Singaporeans from a relatively helpful government in this highly unpredictable  world.   Would it be helpful for Singaporeans in the unemployment limbo from even decades before the advent of Covid-19 and its consequent negative impact on the labor market ?   Anyway, kudos for a very mature, responsible and positive handling of the post-crisis onward track for not just Singaporeans but for expatriates as well !"
33276062,7302060,Joe Coolman,"Jun 6, 2020","Dear PM, generally the sporeans appreciate the efforts spent by the govt to contain this virus and helping the economy via the budgets. However, as ordinary folks dont really feel the financial aid is really helping as spending is increased as a whole not to mention inflation. Some measures are deemed confusing and impractical but we endure in fear of the laws. Certain ignorance or negligence of the ministries had led to the FW figures and this has dampen our reputation. We are waiting to see what actions are taken with the ones causing all these extra burden to spore reserves and perhaps it may be reflected in the next election."

33276062,7302060,Cecil Goh,"Jun 6, 2020","Thank you PM. The road ahead is long and in fact, the road ahead has changed, with the pandemic accelerating the decline of certain old norms, giving rise to new norms. Even as the world and Singapore re-opens, we enter into a new norm, a new environment for social interactions, digitalisation, business and global connectivity has risen.   We are confident in the Singapore Government to steer us into this new dawn. And at the same time ensuring that no one is left behind.   It is a task that will have to be accomplished together. A stronger and better social compact between government and citizens.   #SGUnited"

May I plead to you that we do not force them, as it will make their life very stressful & miserable. Instead  I would like to suggest that they be allowed to use debit cards like the Kopitiam Card or Passion Card. All they have to do is TAP on machines located at hawker stalls & be given a receipt. And they just have to charge cash into their cards at ATMs or Banks with the assistance from the Bank officers if needed & they do not have to handle cash regularly. Thank you, Sir."

Someone younger will experience different degree of difficulties.  It is too easy to just pay the one month salary in lieu of notice and there is nothing the poor employee can do. MOM advised that as long as they pay the required notice, there is nothing we can do. In Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, anywhere outside Singapore.. protect employees better.  Life is really tough for us in mid 50. PM, can you please do something for us? It is too easy for company to push us into hardship and at this age, we need money most to plan for old age and to see through children education.

This sum is enough to create 200,000 millionaires.  (is my sum correct?)  This is big, big money.   Is betting hundreds of billions of dollars ...the ONLY way to save our economy?    Is there NO other ways ?  Other countries are solving the Pandemic problems...by doing other things  to ensure the survival of their business…. and to create jobs.     Peter Druckers, the master guru of business management said: :""Never pour money and resources to feed  your problem...it will grow bigger""  He added :..""Starve your problems...feed your opportunities instead""   Only Trump, Europe and other rich countries spend money to solve their pandemic problems.

Social groups came forward to lead movements, individuals came forward and donations overflowed, corporates developed their own creative outreach both in their business and socially ..,, in the past, we simply lay in on the government to do everything while we praise or complain. First time, I see active action from government +social groups +corporates+ individuals all playing their own part and in momentum. Its really happening ! We dont need to see Covid end to know that as a society, we graduated !The heart of Singapore is alive, kicking and in love. There are groups who failed us by being silent but a great silent majority stepped into their gap and filled it. ❤️"

If no major spike in infection, then let’s move to 35-40 for next 3 weeks and so on (same condition - shud not stay with elderlies). This probably will help in opening up the economy faster .. also in case anyone in that age group falls sick he may not require serious medical attention, hence less burden on the medical system. May be this approach can help open up. I understand compliance is an issue, but we can use the trace app to check and monitor.  We can release the rest of the population once we have confidence that others outside do not have infection.   Just sharing a thought for your kind consideration. "

They should be solely for typical Singaporean.  All these SPR/foreigners do have contribution, however, we never short-paid them either! At the end of the day, they will be backed to your home.  So please, I urge Singapore Government to use the reserve wisely.  Moving on, expect more spendings in the future! We can NEVER be able to go back to that prime time 2 decades ago! Savings can never catch up the huge spendings! We must keep the reserves for our future generations! We must be financially strong and secured and not always been bullied and take advantage of by our neighbours.

33007346,99989210,Sharon Ng,"May 26, 2020","Dear Sir,   First of all, thank you for approving the Fortitude Budget. It must have been a really tough decision to make as it cuts deep into our GDP.   I too have lost my job in the digital banking sector as a MarTech Digital Analytics & Data Science specialist Singaporean. I am highly skilled.   During CB period, I’m taking global cyber security certification right now utilising my skillsfuture TOP up credit of $500. Thank you 🙏 😊 for that.   In fact, I was abruptly & unlawfully laid off by foreign talent senior managers/MDs in our own local Banks. I was new to the bank, last in, first out situation. Unfortunate or unlucky. Culture eats our livelihood for lunch!   However, we do need to cut back on our generosity and to stop giving our meals away now.   We need to stop 🛑 ✋ using globalisation as an excuse for massive FT hires with no proper screening of their competency for the roles offered in our country. MOM & SIR needs to step up on credentials validation.   Many of whom are employed with fake tech certifications laundered and layered into our workforce.   Is there a way of which we could measure the per capita income or success metric per Singaporean with these funds at a -20% deficit of our gross GDP?   As a Singaporean, it is immensely painful to have to dig deep into our reserves of which we’ve saved since our independence. My grandparents worked hard for these savings.    Earnestly, I hope these funds would really go into supporting jobs for Singaporeans as oppose to FTs who are over supplied in our current market’s macro economic situation.   With an over supply of FTs all vying for the same buffet of jobs in the Tech, AI, Data Science, Digital Banking, Analytics, Customer Experience, Agile Workflow...etc the list go on, Digital Transformation at scale type of jobs.  In comparison to FTs, Singaporeans are actually more well skilled, well travelled, well equipped as compared to many other FTs from neighbouring countries.   I do not believe the average graduate from our local universities would lack lustre in competencies as compared to those in other countries.   In fact, Singapore has TOP talents due to our education system as compared to the rest of the world.   When we create digital transformation jobs, we need to Ensure it is a Singaporean being offered the job.  I’ve personally witnessed Singaporean CVs being rejected as the senior MD or hiring managers are all from South Asia.   Is globalisation really doing Singaporeans justice in this economy or do we Singaporeans will have to resort to working overseas as FTs too and thus causing talent brain drain in our own homeland.   Yes we should and we must be inclusive in our society.   However, it must not come at the expanse of a Singaporean’s reason for being in this country, and contribution in many ways to this country of which we call,  home truly.   We really need to step up in protecting Singaporean jobs, both young and old. Constant offshoring and outsourcing of technology jobs to South Asia, isn’t growing our economy but other’s.   Many local employers cite Singaporeans being too expensive to hire.   However, FTs are even more expensive than Singaporeans with condo housing and car allowances in their total package, doing the same job function.   So why not hire a Singaporean as opposed to an entire Dept of FTs? Why isn’t the quota strictly adhered to?   I hope the Govt will look into each sector, industry and regulate the influx of FTs for the survival of our future economy, during and post covid.  Sincerely, I hope we can emerge stronger as a people and a nation of Singapore 🇸🇬 after this ordeal. #sgunited   Thank you Sir 🙏 😊 "

31497261,98423390,Chris Teo,"Mar 28, 2020","This is the best Government in the world. I say this without a single doubt and also not because of the Resilence Budget. Generations of PAP government leaders have done so much for Singapore and this 4G Group of leaders will do likewise. My confidence in them in growing by the day. If we head into the General Election in the coming months, I  wish every Singaporean will seriously consider giving our previous vote to the PAP and give them a strong mandate to lead us forward."
31497261,98423390,Veronica Lee,"Mar 28, 2020","Dear Mr Prime Minister Lee, we greatly appreciate your government efforts to buffer the Covid mpact on the people.  Please stay healthy. I feel that with the current situation, we should make of our reserves very prudently. I feel that the outbreak could take about 2 years to come under control with the virus infecting the whole world, and the re-infection cycle repeating again. Feel that we should have prepare enough hospital beds and resources to handle about 3000 Covid patients in case the situation worsens. Thank you and your government to try to keep the jobs afloat and coming. I am trying to find a job in the market myself and feel glad that you truly understand what some of us are really feeling now in the current situation even though it is not so larger population in general. Thank you and take care."

And if there are still people who doubts the efforts of your government, I am telling them to look at how the other countries are faring. Even the US of A looks so ill prepared and has now become the new epicenter for the virus. Fighting between themselves just to get ventilators and PBE ‘s , while the frontline medical staff are using ‘trash bags’ as a last resort. I therefore applaud and thank you for the absolute clear paths in handling this. Stay safe and well , Mr PM Sir!"

This will definitely help a lot of Singaporean’s which I believe are having this issues. I hope the government and MAS could work with the bank during this period .    As for the bank , they could help with lowering the interest rate to help Singaporean tide over this crisis ..  I hope you and minister of finance Heng Swee Keat  can help to make this work.

Condemnation,Complaining and Criticism is will never bear a fruit when it has been planted and it’s a sickness for many! Today Singapore no matter what is there is standing strong and proud for me! And who is behind is?The chosen ones by the people who have believed that will be done. If you are a dependent of a government to run your life,than follow!And If you think that you can do it by yourself,be independent!As same as children who follow their parents who are righteous and will become the same. You are the result of a decision made! As I have traveled to many countries,thes nothing like Singapore’s liveability with total dependence and security out there as a foreigner in another country! So foreign talents here have a say to run our city?no !but they make our city to be and  serve us to be better of many complainers can’t! Pls be a Singaporean👌 I thank you Mr.Lee for me to be proud and say’I am from Singapore!"

31388789,6174790,Soon Huat Seah,"Mar 24, 2020","A very good morning PM MR Lee, WHO is an important organization that is put in place for the well being of the world. It certainly has to seek funds from every member country to face the challenges of a pandemic. The current pandemic is worst than we could ever think of. It requires sincere effort from all nations. However, such a situation is difficult because some political  and religious leaders have their own ideals and differences. Some countries lack the resources and expertise which could make covid 19 an even bigger threat . Social behavior and mindset plays a crucial role in combating the situation. Covid 19 has crippled the world’s economies and has claimed the lives and livelihoods of many across the globe. Wonderful that Singapore is playing our part by pledging US $500,000 in response to an appeal by WHO. Personally, I feel that it is for a worthy cause , not only for us but for the rest of the world as well. Thank you and appreciate PM Mr Lee for acting in the best interest of Singaporeans."
31388789,6174790,Flora Cheng,"Mar 24, 2020",I sincerely hope the 2nd support package gives the small size FDW agencies some assistance to survive tis down time.

All tis has cost and most important there are employment for our Singaporean staffs.  With tis Corvid19 pandemic many middle to small size agencies are badly hit since Dec 2019.

Those whose parents can't be home can have their kids go to school and do online learning under the supervision of teachers. This way, not only majority of the students will be away from the big crowd (since many parents either work from home or are stay-at-home parents), those whose kids needs to be in school will also feel safer with their kids being exposed to a smaller crowd. The teachers too won't be double-loaded with having to prepare materials for both physical and online learning (for those on loa) and they themselves won't be exposed to a big crowd too.  Please take a look at the kids at the bus stops, car waiting area, buses, trains etc. They are jammed packed!  Once they have come into contact with so many, and someone were to sneeze, it doesn't matter if the rest of the day they are sitting a mile from the rest.

31388789,6174790,Hong Yang,"Mar 27, 2020",政府做很多，点赞。只是从现在起，那些要隔离的人都应该在酒店隔离，而不是居家隔离，因为居家隔离要不整个家庭成员都隔离了，要不就等于没有隔离。因为隔离真正目的是防止病毒携带者传播病毒。在家隔离的人，如果一家人不注意，不是一人传一家，一家传全社会吗？所以政府的政策需要准，狠，迅速掐断来源。前1-2月限制中国人过来，那些劳工都是集中隔离。现在欧美回来的留学生也需要同样对待，因为这样的做法是为了更好地保护国人。

31388789,6174790,Adeline Ng,"Mar 25, 2020","Thank you very much PM Lee for everything you and your team has done for Singapore during this Covid-19 Pandemic.    Why are Singapore Pools Betting Centres and Singapore Turf Club not included in the latest measures to curb increase of Covid-19 spread which requires Bars and Entertainment Venues to be closed with effect from 23:59pm 26Mar20 to 30Apr2020.  There are hundreds or even thousands of people in these places during the Singapore or overseas horse racing days.  Based on my understanding, the betting centres are open everyday except Mondays.    Please review and take action as these places could increase the spread of Covid-19 if there is one person with Covid-19 in each of these centres, this could spread to many people.   Thank you!"

In Singapore, no matter how poor people are, we do not see a community of people living in cardboard boxes and living next to a river as their main source of water supply.   We do not see people dying from hunger. There are many avenues to seek help in Singapore. The Singapore government does care for her people.   I have heard people complaining about the high salaries of our Ministers.   A good worker is worthy of his hire. Why begrudge them of their salaries?   They work very hard behind the scenes. Their hair turns white very fast. To accuse them of receiving high salaries and not doing anything much is most erroneous.  There is no perfect government in this world. Ours is already the best that one can get.   We who live here in Singapore are very blessed people. Recognise this fact and you will be a happier person.   And every human wants to be happy, isn't it?   Try gratitude in your heart for a change and see whether it works to give you happiness.   It is cost -free and will not hurt or harm you."

Probably MOH or relevant authority can look into this or implement this in all Foodcourts across S’pore. Especially, during this period of Co-VID19 - people who dines outside are very careful ... I saw them using disposable cutleries instead. See pic taken in Pier 21 BKK ... a pot of slow-cooker with hot boiling water for dipping. 😊"

Contrast this to the many brickbats thrown at our Singapore government by our very own citizens. No matter what the government does or does not do, it is wrong. Nothing pleases these people.   In life, we can choose our attitudes, responses and behaviours.   We can choose to be unhappy and angry complainers or to be grateful people.   It all boils down to personal choices."

A good article to share for your reading while you travel on the road to the Parliament.  Enjoy this Sharing is Caring story from a China Pastor.  Topic : Quiet China. Pray for Wuhan.  Human caged and eat exotic animals. The cause and effect , Human quarantine Human in home cages worried abt CoronaVirus pandemic spreads across China. This is Chinese KARMA teachings !!   Find this article rather insightful-😷👍  “The hustle and bustle of China has finally halted , the restless society has calmed, and the busy Chinese people gradually nested down.  “The wild animals that were once cage by humans finally managed to keep humans in ""cages"".  “Humans now have  lowered their proud head and began to think quietly: Are we still the king of the earth?    “Mankind has come head to head with the power of nature once again.  “Facing the threat of death, human beings have begun to reflect seriously, only to realize that a lack of awe-inspiring social truths will lead to more harm and more risks.  “The greedy heart is being purified , and the mouth that loves to eat is being punished by the virus.   “The people who have been soaking in the bright red and green lights, all night have been driven home by the virus.  Go home.  “There are lesser people on the street, fewer cars on the roads but , the air is getting fresher, the haze has gone, the sky is turning bluer, the sun is getting brighter, and the family is drawing closer.    “Harmony has descended in people's hearts putting a value in relationships.  “People who have not read for many long years, have picked up books at home.   “Parents and children who have had no or almost no communication with each other, couples who find difficulty talking, have opened the lid of the conversation box.   “Children who do not know how to respect the elderly have begun to be filial.  “The virus taught human beings a vivid and profound lesson. It made them understand awe.   “It shouted to one’s ear, to realize what is called ""Good Times”, feel what is true love on earth. It brought us gradually to fall in love  saying “Return to the Road"".   “We should really be grateful for this ""enemy"".   “We need such an “enemy"" in our fragility to give us a “reminder"" to have ""empowerment"" once again.   The virus will not leave so quickly, until there is a “cultivation"" of good human habits, and it will not continue to rage because human love will gather more power to defeat this plague.   “Time will tell us everything, and prove what is right.  “I really like ""quiet China"", and I hope Chinese people will take the initiative to build a ""quiet China"" without the virus reminding them again.”           ""*Quiet China; good""*  Written by a Chinese pastor sent to a brother in Istanbul via friends in Singapore.(translated and edited for clarity )"

Post budget speech, again, I went to sleep peacefully and work up early morning  peacefully. I know we we are safe and well loked after.  I am I am indebted to all who contribute, also as our scarce fiscal reserves are still safeguarded, unlike most countries in the world. We only know to well, having learned from global and regional contagion risks and crises, the importance of being prepared. Many countries have much to learn and emulate Singapore.  We also need to do our part and contribute. As for doing my part and making a humble contribution, I hope to leave to Pakistan to attend  an International Peace Conference, with the hope of learning about their peace process and peace dividends, to build relationships that will help to build stronger buisiness relationships between Singapore and 20 countries who are members of the International Peace Leaders Institute. And simultaneously, I am negotiating with many other economies and forums to partner, to achieve the same.  Many blessings for continued good health to your family, staff, and all teams fighting hard to protect the little red dot.  Singapore Special Voices also send their thanks and best wishe to all of you.  Three cheers to the World's best PM and PAP. You have my support and vote.  Deep gratitude from a very proud and loyal citizen, ❤️🙏 Chaitri  (Chai) Hapugalle"
