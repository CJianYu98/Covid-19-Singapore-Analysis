I'm really glad that 2020 is coming to an end. My condolence to families of those who have passed away due to Covid-19. May God bless their soul and they rejoice in the heavenly realm. The free Covid-19 vaccine from the Government is a God-sent gift of health to poor Singaporeans who want to be vaccinated but have no money and cannot afford it on their own. I am glad that our Government take care of this group of poor Singaporeans. 🍇

38951362,23882380,Tan Kok Tim,"Dec 15, 2020","Mask-wearing and safe distancing ....do we see the bigger picture to prevent community transmission of the virus?    The vaccine is not a cure but a preventive measure.      Will red dot encourage the UN and the WHO to do this:  the UN and WHO should get all countries to cooperate and shut down for 40 days and 40 nights to stamp out COVID-19?     The best of time is now for the countries in the northern hemisphere during this wintry period [Christmas, New Year 2021, and the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays] to shut down for 40 days [like in the olden days of the leprosy infection to quarantine the new arrivals until the all-clear signal to let them out]. Now is the time to do just that for the all-clear of infected persons to stamp out COVID-19 and force it to have a natural ending.  As for all other countries, those at the equator and those in the southern hemisphere [summer time], all should unite and comply to shut down too for 40s day to stamp out this disease well and good. Can the UN and WHO obtain this universal cooperation by all countries around the world to shut down this earth for 40 days and 40 nights at the same time? Time for the whole world to go into hibernation for 40 days.  If we don’t do we want to continue with the madness for another 400 or more days worldwide affecting the economy and all aspects of human lives. Choose wisely to have a suffering of 40 or 400 days physically, mentally, economically and socially, or do we want more than 400?"

38951362,23882380,Micheal Sheikh Ruth,"Dec 15, 2020","Good news, god bless Singapore. I have a question, why the country spends so much money on smoking on designated areas only and advertisement. Why not ban cigarettes completely? Save a lot of money on health care, save our money. People will live longer. And I know it’s a individual effort. See chewing gum was difficult to clean up the environment so ur dad banned it. Well tar is more difficult to clean up. It stays in our heart. I am a smoker and I have been going thru a tough time quitting it. Manage to cut from 20 to 10 now. Maybe ur leaders are smokers too and that’s why it’s difficult to ban it. I was in prison and I had no choice to not smoke it. But then the outside world isn’t that tempting but still I picked up the habit. Doing the right thing is important. I have done my part to cut down half. Can the government join us to help stop it? "

Still, the disturbing reports and social media comments and clips emerging from different corners of the world regarding the NECESSITY and the efficacy of the series of vaccines considered, makes me wonder if a truely independent panel of Singaporean experts have been first consulted or is Singapore too, though very unlikely,  blinkeredly following the dubious medical  technocrats lolling at the WHO ?"

Is it true that food and beverages must not be served at and before solemnisations? What does that mean? Even if the beverages are served to our guests who are seated down in tables of 8 pax?  The programme outline of our solemnisation cum wedding event will be as follow:  6.30 pm - Zone A guests arrived and seated down in tables of 8 pax  7 pm - Zone B guests arrived and seated down in tables of 8 pax  7.30 pm - Solemnisation ceremony (while total 66 guests remain seated down in tables of 8 pax)  8 pm - Wedding dinner starts (5-course dinner)  For the Zone A and Zone B guests, after they arrived at 6.30 pm and 7 pm respectively and seated down, we wish for the vendor staff to serve drinks to them while they remain seated before and during our solemnisation. So that they do not have to wait for so long till 8 pm when the wedding dinner starts to have some water.  May we know urgently if any issue with this?  Grateful and thank you!!  Anna Chia & "

Government have been helping the poor and businessman in this Covid, we appreciate what government have done 👍.  There is one small group that government have missed out, multiple properties owner. 😃  Multiple properties owners are also badly hit by this Covid same as the business owner and the poor.  We should not neglect these group of Singaporean as they have contributed a lot of money to the country reserve, ABSD, BSD, rental income tax, personal income tax. 😃  Just give these group of people one time of $2000 each to show government appreciation. 🙏🏻  Don’t forget this group of people are badly hit and they have contributed to the nation building.

Without these so called red ants,  we may find ourselves in more difficult situations. I have seem public treating SDAs with no respect, being very rude and even threaten to harm them. Totally uncalled for. Let's all work together to keep Singapore and our loved ones safe."

This is Singapore, a country I'm deeply proud of. For my government, for my people, for what Singapore stands for: happiness, prosperity and progress for our people.

Sometimes, we do genuinely forget to wear our masks. I encountered a few times in the lift, when my neighbour, happily chatting with me and had forgotten to put their mask on till I gently reminded them. Haha.  And it’s usually the elderly. So SDA, pls be gentle and do not shame them if they are caught without mask or not putting them on properly. Good job to you guys!  ♥️👏💪👍"

It is not to say that we should tolerate inconsiderate people intentionally pull down their masks for own conveniences at other risks; it is necessary to have a sensible and reasonable judgement call for these safe distancing ambassadors. They are after all human beings who also mingling in their own groups and not keeping safe distancing while walking in not so crowded places."

And we respect for what they  have done since the beginning of the pandemic and stretch of CB times in order to make Singapore safe and still able to move around with assurance of safety. So long we follow and take the healthy measurable precautions strictly in order that we can be able to be connected with pple especially Christmas Festival is approaching soon.  Though keeping the measury precautions is quite tough and inconvienient for most but slowly when it becomes a new norm , many can get used with it as really pple can find btinging much safety for everyone as ckmpared to many countries not taking precautionary measures still can be in danger zones especially those have the seasons of coldness !"

Even wearing a mask is restricting their freedom 🤦 If Americans have any amount of respect for the 270k plus lives lost in the usa they will stop their selfish disgusting arrogant mindset and wear a mask

Then when we finally see sime light, then we found we need to face the expensive swap test.  This is really unacceptable for paying S$186 for a Covid test!!  In Hong Kong, it is free of charge for those preventive testing for resident and cost only about S$45 (HKD240) for those with a report for traveling.  Perhaps Hong Kong government face a lots of challenge from the society, then they learnt how to be more considerate.  And now, I suspect will Singapore need to get into such scenarios to learn?"

We should thanks our government and all Singaporeans who are all very cooperative and heeds our government advice what to and not to do.That's why we are rated the less infections. Should we really had a good vaccine that immune us from being infected again, who should we give the vaccine first to? 1). Inject those business man that needs to        Fly frequently. 2) Those who needed to travel overseas to       Carry out important task. 3 ) Those who are going for tour are to get                   Injected before going overseas. With this three group of peoples first to get the vaccines,it will help us to boost the economy and our airport will be kept busy . This will lead to our airport needs to employs more people. Same to others countries if the they did the same I believe this will revive all our economy. When the tourist comes,here comes our people busy with work and hotels will be revived. Lastly all before going overseas must confirm negative test."

We're seeing many nations having a 2nd wave, would it not be better to err on the side of caution and close the cinemas instead?  To watch a movie, I need to travel on bus and trains. I need to head down to a shopping mall filled with people, and finally, I trap myself in a room with others.  Safety measures are but preventive actions, and is not 100%, Even if unlikely, the risk is still there, and there can potentially be the irreversible cost of life."

With the election over, my personal view is the result was rather watershed and not as hopeful as expected! I guess one of the  main reasons  besides having more alternative voices is  PMET jobs expectations which I am considering it as a deep rooted issues amongst Singaporeans in the age group of 30 to 45 years old. This segment are losing job opportunities to foreigners. I have educated nieces and nephews ( master, honours degree and diploma holders from respectable and esteemed Singapore’s university and polytechnic)in the early thirties  and am afraid if MOM continues to bring in foreigners to fill those positions, am sure they will be greatly disappointed ! I reckon this age group falls on ‘swing voters’ category, hence please practise caution as they are feeling frustrated and  create job oppty for them and probably would I suggest ‘returning’ the job back to them and creating better oppty for SG future.

34342143,76641240,Chan Ying Tang,"Jul 14, 2020","Sir, I think the people in Sengkang must also have taken by surprise that the WP won because they took for granted that the PAP will always win and so they voted for WP without much thought of their capabilities.  Don’t think it’s because that they are younger or more able to relate to the younger residents in Sengkang because the WP candidates - the two women are not married yet. Overall, I think it’s very dangerous a thing for many Singaporeans to have taken the PAP for granted, overheard a conversation that these youngsters keep voting for oppositions or for a change are playing with fire.  What if really the PAP lost and are not the ruling party anymore? 冇眼睇!"

34342143,76641240,Kim Kok Ho,"Jul 14, 2020",执政党胜得很辛苦和危险。国人要甜头也要反对权力，甘蔗要有两头甜。反对声音很动人，很得人心，但太多的反对党将分化选票，也可能让国家一夜变天。人民应该在第一轮中先选出真正有政见和能力和多元的声音的反对党，然后才能与执政党一决雌雄，而不是让执政党来和零散的少数侯选人的党竞选。即两当制较合理。若最后胜出的反对党有和同等数目的侯选人，来和执政党竞争，那才是公平的选举。也是人民的福气。

Words are easy but only when one wears the shoes does one realise how difficult it is.
34342143,76641240,郑启岁,"Jul 13, 2020","这次大选人民行动党选票下滑，(提早三个月大选也许对执政党有利)第一主要原因是阻断冠状病毒。第二中美贸易战有极大关连。以上两种情形都造成许多中小企业倒闭员工大量被裁退，形成许多员工失业，大学毕业生寻找工作困难，这不是政府所愿意看到的情形。他们这批失业人士以年青人佔多数，在在野党忽悠之下更不滿执政党治理方式。年青人较为冲动，不以理智去分析这种环球性失业浪潮。政府从国家储备金內拨出上千亿元，作为各阶层援助金以协助人们渡难关。政府己体现出关心人民的生活。放眼天下有几个国家能像新加坡政府这样关爱人民。 还有一件事，就是投票时所造成选民排长龙情况出现,。要了解有一小部人有情绪化的因素，心中不滿就不假索会将手中 的票转移投向另一方。"

Could you please tell us what is your plan to get singapore back on track, and if is there one at all? Is the strategy for herd immunity to take hold in the dorms or is it to wait for a vaccine?"

33657573,13486950,Joshua Tan,"Jun 19, 2020","Dear PM Lee, I am Glad most businesses are doing their best in social distancing. Today I went to the Popular bookstore. A store area with more than 1000sqft only allow less than 20 customers with all of them wearing mask. The rest had to queue. However, this photo is in Holland Village. Bars are so crowded that it is impossible to see any social distancing. Adding to that, no one is wearing mask since they are drinking. Shouldn’t we act on this before it is too late? Shouldn’t we be more stringent to bars where almost all of them are not wearing masks?"

33596951,37426500,Đào Duy Văn,"Jun 17, 2020","Process: knowledge, skills, wisdom, and Enlightenment. How to learn? By massive action. You put the dots of knowledge, definition into mind. The more you use, the better you are until you do not know why you gain that. What needed? Love, support, understanding, patience encouragement from outside and inside. Then you will know Let all realize Key to human problems.  KEY:  Emotion comes from head, not heart Man search for feeling not meaning: house, car, ring, iPhone, Gucci, tattoos. Man's action is driven by NEEDS.  SLEEPNESS COME FROM WORRY OF THE DISEASES OF YOUR CHILD, THE ANGER OF THE WORKPLACE, THE FEAR OF YOUR FAULT MAY BE REVEALED. What's pill?  Do we forget? IT IS THE MIND  I doubt God and Holly: things changes constantly so no Constant ego after death. Jesu, Socrates, Gandhi, Luther King... was crucially killed. Lock, guards save the Pope  What is your name? What would be your name if your parents like another name? So if the name is a conditioned idea, do you think: religion, taboos, rituals CODED?  The living standard increases substantially but why the rate of mental illness, autism, ADHD, suicide, gunfire are soaring? Is there any hidden unknown philosophy may help?  The world is dependent, independent or interdependent? Do depression, autism, ADHD, violence, school problems and domestic problems, suicide, gunfire have hidden relation that we can effectively solve all?  And  The living standard increases substantially but why the rate of mental illness, autism, ADHD, suicide, gunfire are soaring? Is there any hidden unknown philosophy may help?"
33596951,37426500,Đào Duy Văn,"Jun 17, 2020","Life is art,  Life is simple, do not make it complicated.  Spirit can never measured by material.  Try to logical it, we will hit paradoxical world. Like paradoxical of Socrates. Like emptiness and egolessness when we try to find what life is. Like the way in Taosim.  Best of all, roots of all religions is love, kindness, compassion, virtues and principles. How do we know we are on the right way? Check the greed. Check the anger. If they have these, all words are cheatings. These come from Ingnorance. 8 Noble paths.  When we on the right way: we will free from greed, anger and ignorance. Then we can sense inner peace, peace of mind on a chaos life. Reach enlightenment, awaken with knowing nothing. Live with mindfulness. Peace in eating Peace in giving Peace in taking Peace in spending This life is touching, moved, inspired. They are our real friends, called Gods or great men in the history. To the healers: we are only repair the different fruits of same roots. Buddha taught: greed, anger and ignorance are the roots of all suffering.  I just have feeling that: autism, adhd, depression, stroke, addcition, violence, gunfire.... are the different names of suffering. Naming to know it, Not naming to seperate it as an seperation entity. You can never find real cause You can never find concrete cause. Because: the world have characters changing, and interdependent, nothing stay the same: we have Planck time. All we live under the hologram. Our 5 senses are too small, too little, too illusive to know what the world is. Just breathing, feel the breathing, calm the mind, feel the body, watch the thought, contemplate on things: we will find, life is miracle. Try to find the roots: then repair it. We will find it is astonishingly simple and astonishingly effective. This is the Tao This is the way of great men. They find earth is heaven! We are live on heavenly earth. Scientist can never find any place like earth in the distance of millions of light-year. . . . We will fail, if we help and still have full of Greed, Anger and Ignorance! No matter how Rich, Wealthy, Success, powerful we are, we may still suffer lots of these signs.  We may still suffer if we still the slave of greed. Greedy men have hundred wants a day, the will not be satisfied with half of that wants, it means they will anger,  or not happy, in other words, they may still suffer stress in Abundance living.  It is the mind, not the conditioned of living It is the combination of all senses make the eating, living, enjoying or suffering that we may not notice, but it still controls us unconsciously. Ex: will you pay $1000 for hearing a song played by a great violist in the subway? Will you pay $1000 for a delicious meal served on the dirty street sidewalk? Will you enjoy food in the restaurant in five star hotel when you know your kid ill or in danger? Why you need all hundred factors to enjoy a delicious meal in the five-star hotel: air, color, perfumes, waiters, waitress, customer services, cloth, forks, music...? Do you go for eating with mouth or what? Got it: all combine into a phenomenon, then from it, it makes the quality of feeling. Sorry, I see men just search for feeling. So it can make you what make kids poor in eating, sleeping, learning, and playing. It is the meeting of hundred phenomena, it is the illuminating of thousand phenomena or the hologram of millions of things.   The best way is to learn the lifestyle of great men in history, not rich men! If not, many people may have to take medicine for the months, years, decade or lifetime just to find the temporary relief. We maybe are wrongly coded about Rich or Money.  FORGOTTEN STRESS Stress cause insomnia Stress makes poor learning Stress make poor eating Stress makes we act unusually Stress reduces sexing Stress can break school and family. And Maybe  Autism, ADHD, depression, and suicide have the key of helping lies in the mechanism of medicine, lifestyle, love, anti-depression medicine, good communities, a good act, kind works; all have the same mechanism of creating happy hormones in the body: serotonin, oxytocin, and dopamine. Health comes from balancing.  REDEFINE OF STRESS The right definition of stress: human beings have basic human needs described by Abraham Maslow. Anything threatens of satisfying these needs will lead to Fight and Flight responses. If people cannot change the situation, threaten, they will be the victims of STRESS AND STRESS HORMONES. You will easily find the keys to all social phenomena in: ""Awaken You Wonderful We"" if you are familiar with the books of Malcolm Gladwell: Outlier, David and Goliath and Blink. These books give me a lot of question to ponder and find out the good answer by combining medicine, pharmacy, sociology, leadership, psychology, philosophy and religions.  It is in Mind.  Meditation, alternative therapies, NLP, Affirmation, love-hug-kindness can help to control and master the mind.  Science reaches to the fail of finding a single cause of the diseases from the mind: mental illness, thinking, and poor abilities.  Because the mind is not like body. The body will give away all you put in just in several hours or days according to its half-life: food, vegetable, medicines, chemical, additives, mercury, gold, nutrition. Even body can heal the small abnormal cause by X-ray.  But the mind keeps all in the conscious mind and subconscious mind. Millions of events, phenomena called Negative thinking, negative events, negative emotions and negative experiences compound into diseases in mind, brain, body, abilities, genes,  and health. It covers all terminologies in medical books. They are interdependent factors. How can Scientist figure out a single CAUSE?  ****************************** V. The reviews:  Văn Duy Đào well read article, i agree with it, some on here are assuming Autism is a disease or caused by pesticides, i have limited social skills as well as my boys,only downfall. assumptions like these are what keeps people looking at us like we are freaks, there is no cure and never will be, hate to say it but my parents had mental disorders my mom bipolar my dad OCD, maybe the cause all ik is i am unique therefore blessed, i can go through life wishing or i can go through life accepting and coping, i wish i could do alot others can like socialize, i wish my kids were like everyone elses, then i realize that all 3 of us are truly blessed with health, family and love, love for ourselves and others even those who judge us, you are a very intelligent individual and reading your comments has enlightened me, ty  ************ Thank You Duy. I am happy there are more people who know we are all humans and we can all heal. As you might have read, I already healed part of my 'autism' �� And still integrating more towards oneness with all of myself and with all that is. I am so thankful for this experience and happy to share this with the world. Because I have been there I can show the world it is possible!! And yes, I'm into meditation, healing, energy work. Many experiences of Oneness/Dao /Source... We all are one... thank you for your offer, and your message, You also are doing great work for humankind! Love, Els **********************"

But I am very concerned as LTA Facebook today, seemingly through its action, are indicating public transport no need safe distancing. However, I think wet market is still adhere to safe distancing. Thus this is confusing to the public. Your above words stated that we still need to remain cautious & vigilant. I hope the government can help clear what’s the protocol regarding safe distancing? We sincerely are concerned and worried about our health. Hope to have some clarification on this. My sincere appreciation. Thank you."

33162164,15107700,Paul Chieng,"Jun 2, 2020",Thank you for lifting some SD measures so the economy can restart to gear 1 again. But I must say that there are still many disobedient selfish residents who still disobey the previously imposed SD rules until today and the enforcement is very lacking even today when I visited Bedok Mall to buy some essentials I saw a person standing at the entrance exit of the mall eating and with mask on chin. He's probably very hungry but at least can eat in the car or some corner away from public. Nobody bother to stop him and no ambassador was in sight to advise him otherwise. I hope the authority can place more emphasis on enforcement and rid the society of these selfish people that will lengthen the CB period than it already had.

33162164,15107700,Desmond Loo,"Jun 1, 2020","Thank you Mr PM Lee. To my knowledge, most SME companies, which are permitted to operate on Phase 1, do not actually have any directions for employees to work from home or return for work at offices. They simply requested all employees to come back for the entire day even though their jobs are not essential or can be performed at home. I reckon they should advice employees to work at offices on a half-daily basis or staggered them to work on alternate days during this phase."

Many paid a high price for the complacency as they became depleted of resources to survive the second wave of hills. Together with fellow healthcare workers (HCW) and all in Singapore we will continue after CB to stay focused, viligant and unrelenting in the mission to protect our community from Covid-19. We are very grateful to the Multi Ministry Task Force for protecting us HCW with adequate supplies of full armour of PPE as we continue the battle each day with vigor.

33162164,15107700,O'riz Secada,"Jun 2, 2020","I have a question... When Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan remove a safe distancing sticker from the seat of an MRT train, isn't it allowing people to gather together in a compact close space in the train. Why is the safe distancing rule not applied in the train and in e bus? Virus may be easily spread in such close proximity environment between one another. Out in the public, social distancing rule is enforced very tightly even after 2 June 2020. Rules applied not consistant. Please advise."

Except with more shops opening by phrases where we have the choices to shop for certain items now but shop and go with masks and safe distancings. We must all play a part not to have a 2nd wave .Remain vagilant Singapore ."

33162164,15107700,Loh Kim Meng,"Jun 2, 2020","Hi Sir, with regards to those who are still concern about safe distancing on public transport. I would like to suggest the govt should enforce employers to have staggered shift for reporting to work. Work from home should first be enforce follow by staggering shift. Employers will not follow if govt just says it is advice. Many employers still don't buy the ideas of WFH. They will adopt traditional way because employers don't trust employees working independently out of office. After COViD-19 life will never be back to pre COViD. It will new normal. I hope every one will embrace it and not dwell on the past."

33162164,15107700,Ronald Leng,"Jun 2, 2020","🙏🙏  We are thankful.  We must stay resilient; keeping our guard taller.  It is easy to be wise after the event- making us resilient.  Historians will write more about hard truths on前人栽树 后人乘凉.  Many saw what happened at workers' dorms.  Many parents are concerned and nonplussed on schools.  MOE did little little to high classroom density (1:35 teacher to child ratio) to futureproof against future covid-X attacks.  In contrast, MOM does more for dormitory workers.  High classroom density does not make sound safe-distancing sense.  As parents , we hope more sustainable and permanent efforts to reduce the high classroom density.  We hope for turning point - more be done for our schools; adopting best practices in our local international schools is one.  We are thankful."

Times are bad and tough. We need to stay positive and care for one another. We can walk out of the pandemic once we stay united and contain Covid cases. Most cases are from domitories. Do take more money to help local jobless Singaporeans. Request employers to be liability to spend on the foreign workers food and Sim card. We have helped them 3 months with natural reserve.

The whole covid -19 situation is so fluid . No one will know what is going to happen. There is always a decision make based on situation . So pls be grateful  and thankful that you are in the good hand of Singapore government. Just look at the news and see the world what their government had done and plan for their citizen . You will realise how fortunate you are . There is always a gaps in everything ppl plan and it difficult to fill up gaps . However, it is better than not do anything or cannot afford to do anything . There are so much of uncertainty now so ppl pls stay calm and be united . Everyone just stay at home do our part and fight this virus war together. Everything will be in place  when things are more settled and stable once everyone has the same mindset. We need to bring everyone together and narrowing our differences and not pushing everyone apart . Everyone must have heard about the phrase United we stand divided we fall.

33162164,15107700,Lynne Tan Xinlin,"Jun 1, 2020","Thank you Mr Lee. One of the allowable work post circuit breaker is for previously suspended renovation to resume. However, this is not happening easily, leaving many ID, contractors and home owners in a very frustrating and binding position. My family has been deeply affected. Our house don’t even have a main door due to sudden suspension of work. A home is the basic necessity of a family and with seniors as well as an infant in the home, we are living in uncertainty everyday. Thus far, the BCA procedure has been ineffective, confusing and very frustrating. While my ID has received approval, many of her sub contractors have not. In addition, there were insufficient slots for workers to sign up for the safety course and swap test that needs to be done before work can resume. This could take weeks or even months to complete. We need this procedure to be reviewed in order for the much needed suspended work to resume. It is meant to be prioritized right after circuit breaker so let’s make it a priority. Hope to receive your support in moving this work along. All we want, is a place to call home."

33162164,15107700,Flower Dome,"Jun 2, 2020",Sir very confusing message if safe distancing need be maintained why transport minister tear away all the distancing stickers? So every one again crammed like sardine in enclosed cabins? ! Isnt a contradict to your direction?
33162164,15107700,Xavier Tham,"Jun 2, 2020","To all those who said we should not remove sticker and markings on public transport, lets just say MRT, maybe you like to say how do you think it can be done to maintain 1 metre apart and leave 3 empty seats between passengers. During CB its possible becos only that limited number of essential people are out and running. Its common to see buses running empty and trains operating with so little people. But with Phase 1, dont even say Phase 3, with the opening to allow more people to go to work, maybe you can advise or suggest how possible is it to do it, rather than just say should still practice safe distancing in trains. Everyone knows, should. But how?? Your suggestions may not get a reply, i believe they are also trying to figure out a way on how to do it. Like what, from Pasir Ris once full with people at all markings and seats taken up with 3 empty seats between them, dont allow anymore people to board when reach Tampines? Doors dont open and continue to Simei? Or put up a bell to press like on buses to indicate you want to alight, so that from that door if 3 alight only 3 can board? Cmon, give suggestions for them to consider and think also. Its simply not possible. CB period can be done, cos not many people out there. Everyone knows it should be, safer to continue one more month, two more months, but how?? I also like to know how. Maybe out of 200,000 suggestions they can find 1 that works."

However, today my renovation Contractors tell me that they cannot start work after 2 june on my 90% completed house because of bureaucracy and delay in getting their required certification and approval from the authorities even though they have made applications more an a week ago since the announcement by you were made.  The earliest they can start is in end June ( almost a month later)because they are allocated that timing for them to do the online test???   They all tell me they are ready and will follow the measures implemented but the timeline announced by the government is not realistic due to the current obstacles they are facing😓.  Please explain what is happening? Why make such optimistic announcements when on the ground it is not ready or possible to start. Hope you can look into this hiccups and bottlenecks with the relevant authorities.   We, home owners are suffering and being constantly being chased by Contractors and suppliers to deliver and complete their obligations as they are incurring holding and other cost and we are also incurring cost ourselves as we cannot shift into our homes.  We all understand the need to be cautious but why make such announcements when on the ground it is not helping us all. Some of the other homeowners that I spoke to express their frustrations too as our contractor are push around by the various departments when they try to expedite this process.   Please assist to address this in your coming discussions and next parliament session during this difficult time.   Hope to obtain a favourable reply soon "

33076982,35959520,Angeline Teo,"May 30, 2020","Dear Sir, how about legalizing the ownership of cats in HDB flats? There has been an increase in people abandoning cats in HDB estates and also irresponsible ownership such as not neutering or spaying the cats, illegal breeding to sell and letting cats roam around, especially at dangerous places such as the ledge. As long as it remains illegal, many irresponsible owners of cats will continue to behave this way. It is in the humans and animal’s welfare to legalize it and enforce regulations on cat ownership in a responsible way, such as ensuring the cats are registered as pets like dogs, so as to be able to hold the owners responsible for abandonment. Animal welfare should not be limited to some species and not others. Singapore is a first world nation with 3rd world animal welfare considerations. I sincerely hope this will change soon! "

33076982,35959520,Jeff Tan,"May 29, 2020","Thanks, PM Lee for sharing the lovely photo.  This is the Zouk otter family.  They originated from the Singapore River (near the former Zouk).  Zouk mum gave birth to 6 adorable otter pups at the Singapore Botanic Gardens in late 2019.  Sadly, only 2 of the 6 pups survived (see the link below).  This is the same family that appeared in the news lately at KK Hospital, Little India and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  As the pups are bigger now, they have been venturing around to look for a new home.  They went as far as Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park on 12 May, but were chased out by the Marina otter family.  Hope they could find a new home soon.  Agree that we should protect our native biodiversity and find ways to coexist with our local flora and fauna.   https://www.facebook.com/228574651250769/posts/793262941448601  For those who want to find out more about the otters in Singapore, do check out this informative interview with our local otter expert, Siva aka “Otterman”:  https://omny.fm/shows/money-fm-893/weekends-otters-in-singapore-with-otterman-n-sivas"

32849055,18238790,LY Tan,"May 20, 2020","I have a question bugging me. For visiting of parents/ grandparents, is it limited to those elderly who are living on their own? Or inclusive of those living with other relatives like children and grandchildren? Technically speaking, siblings are not suppose to visit each other. What is the rationale behind the move? So the elderly can have some form of companionship (thus, those without children can request for siblings or other relatives to visit)? Or just so they can have some physical contacts with their immediate descendants? Pardon me for asking, as different rationale may lead to different answer to my first question. If it’s just for provision of companionship, then maybe those living with other relatives may not be allowed more guests to visit, as this may contribute to higher chances of cross-spreading due to big group gathering. My intention is not to create issue but rather to have a more informed understanding of this new rule."

You might not aware that many of the small beverage shop are not entitled for any of the govt financial aid, and these shops are the sole breadwinner of the family. Keep closing them for another month will develop mental illness before the family starve to death.  Please allow these small shops to open, you can't keep them close until the community case drop to zero.

32849055,18238790,Lydia Koh,"May 20, 2020","Dear PM Lee,  Thank you for being empathetic and sensible during these crazy times. However I'd like to point out that it is confusing to say we're exiting circuit breaker when nothing much is really changing. People still aren't allowed to socialise, shops and gyms and public facilities are still closed. The first month was sensible, the second month was a safeguard, but why are we essentially extending lockdown for another month? Our community spread numbers are low and most people have been staying home for the past 2 months.  Some thought should be given to those who are literally earning zero income right now, eg. fitness instructors and personal trainers, freelance photographers, event organizers, and small business owners not allowed to open. How can they survive with bills to pay but 3 months of no income?   Why are children allowed to go back to school and visit their grandparents (the highest risk group), but siblings and significant others and friends are not allowed to visit?   More clarification would be most appreciated here, and hopefully further easing of CB measures similar to phase 2. And please don't say CB has been ""lifted"" or is ""ending"" because it most certainly is not.  Really appreciate what the govt has done for Singapore so far, but these recent events have been honestly confusing. Hope this feedback is helpful. Thank you."

The mental health of everyone else is important too, and we all just want some human connection with loved ones without any risk to / interaction with the general public. To me, it’s way less risky than going to the supermarket or markets, allowing all hair services at hair salons, and definitely way less risky than hundreds of kids co mingling and then going back to their respective homes. Pls consider, thanks. I know I speak on behalf of a lot of people who aren’t living in the same household as their loved ones and have been feeling the strain as we are the ones who have been abiding by the laws, and not trying to meet them in parks, public places, supermarkets or their homes secretly.

If its because other teachers are not working during this period, its doesn't mean that they dont leave their house. And its compulsory test for all preschool teachers, why make them (us) travel instead of catering for our safett and reduce our exposure? Couldn't there be mobile swap test bus arranged to go nearby centres to sway the teachers? All schools are closed and all the school buses are avail to be used as mobile swap station. Hence, i personally feel that there is a lapse on this area which should work on."

32849055,18238790,Norlin Abdul Karim,"May 27, 2020","Personally, I am not comfortable with my girl returning to school when I am still working from home indefinitely. How is it possible that an organisation values the health and safety of its employees but MOE doesn't place the same importance for our children? There are examples abroad where the virus has spread among kids when schools reopened. Are you 100% confident that won't happen here? Not only do I have to worry about my girl getting infected, I live with an aged parent. So my concerns are VERY valid here since I have a vulnerable person living under my roof. And younger kids can't be trusted to maintain 100% social distancing on their own which means you are putting me in the position of having to walk by girl to and from school. More unnecessary trips outside the home than encouraged, am I right? Twice a day, 5 days a week? You also failed to get all the teachers and school staff to do the swab tests like the ones done for pre-school teachers. Just because schools closed for a month doesn't mean that none of them went out every other day or weekly for essentials like marketing and grocery runs. They could be asymptomatic and be a risk to our children. I think you've lost the plot if all these haven't been considered. I agree with many parents here about giving some time to see how the effects of coming out of CB impact the nation before sending our children out to the front lines."

This clearly shows the spread can increase if we are planning to ease out the CB.. we need to reduce the maximum number of contacts of people which could happen while traveling, working in offices, in schools and etc  .. Now maximum people are working from home that is actually helping to reduce contacts and hence lower corona virus cases ..

Note I just a white collar who can afford to work from home, not a restaurant owner non a retail shop owner, I just provide some views from a 3rd party and of course with all the easing suggestions first and priority must come a stricter safe distancing rules implementation to prevent a possible second wave, thank you.

Why risk the children and students and also make them go through the discomfort of putting on masks for long hours in school, in addition to their perspiration? It is better to be patient and wait for the Covid 19 situation to really show significant improvement before getting the vulnerable children and students to go to school. Many parents are worried for their children's safety. Hope the government be flexible enough to let the children stay home in this period.

32849055,18238790,Avon Quek,"May 21, 2020","Minister Lawrence, please consider to reopen swimming pools on 2 Jun onwards for people to exercise since you have allowed people go back to office and students to schools, allowing businesses, dental etc to offer services, worship (5 pax) but you yet to allow serous people who like sports to exercise.   Please consider each time allowing 5 to 8 pax for swimming as serious swimmers certainly keep to their lane and never interact, they will get out of the pool after 20 laps  and chop chop go off.   Also according to medical reports, virus dies in the water so we will not get infected. If we do get infected due to swimming, we pay for our own medical bills.  People can’t just keep eating and working without serious exercising especially in this hot summer . We really hope the task force led by you and minister Gan to consider our request seriously and ASAP. Thanks much ⛽️⛽️⛽️💖💖💖🌈🌈🌈"

So to say so long as someone is in running attire and seems to be engaging in some physical activities they would jolly well be deemed eligible for that exemption? Well, with nothing from the authorities done so far to curb such occurrences is a sure sign that nothing has yet happened on the running tracks yet, perhaps.

Our profit margin is very small in view of competition and spiral cost increased over the years.  My foreign workers are seperated to live in different places to be in line with Mom requirements. Unfortunately one of the group stay in the dormitory contracted with covid virus. I have to shift them to a safe place to stay. In view of cost and easy management of my staff I gathered them to stay in the same place after medical check up to ensure they are all healthy while looking for another place for a group of 9 to stay. To my dismay most of the places like hotel which suggested by Mom rejected our application as they said if this group stay in a infected place before they will reject.   Even there are some landlords willing to let us rent they jack up their rental too high with no fault of ours. Mom staff has been giving us warning and I have written many letters to our MP and minister for help but no respond till now.   We are striving to survive in Singapore and we gave limited resources. Our profit margin from past and current projects are too leen for us to substantiate this unforseen cost.   We seek your help to provide solutions for us to survive and bring bread home for our family.  Fire mechanical engineering pte ltd

As pple r not required to wear mask when exercising, any asymptomatic  infected person go workout in a aircon gym will spread to the rest. This is very high risk. The same apply to all indoor enclosed facilities  for sports ..new clusters can easily happens as all it takes is one asymptomatic infected person  no mask n exercising in an enclosed  space. Also not wise  to allow 2 to 3 hours hair services such as hair perm, dye n treatment to restart. It's risky too as hair saloon r aircon enclosed  space.. If covid is to stay we need new norm.. less enclosed sports facilities more out doors exercises n facilities instead, hair saloon services that take longer than an hour shld be done in enclosed individual room or enclosed partition..limited numbers n by appointment."

32849055,18238790,Nrmh Ashburn,"May 21, 2020","Probably to step up by providing the rest of the citizens with Swab Test. Go ahead deduct our medisave. By all means. Make use of it rather than we don't or won't have the chance to make full use of it. Example : knowing that couple of pre sch teachers with positive Covid-19 with NO symptoms.  Luckily they took the initiative to have the swab test on them. If not? So now, what about the rest of us? How do we know in our house hold one or two diagnosed with this virus without us knowing or they themselves know?  I think government should step up taking it's citizen's medical seriously.  Take batches to go for swab test. Community centres , padangs with tent or whatever it takes. Assigned team, issue citizen with appointment. Taking turn to take the test. We will definitely be more than happy to know if we are being taken care of rather than kept asking us to stay home/wear mask/social distancing etc.  Hopefully this will make an eye opener for ALL OF US that knowing that this virus can be a guest without us realising, is best to have all of us to take swab test.

Almost 90+% or more cases were from FW dorms and as what our HM proudly declared, SG Covid-19 death rate is only 0.08%! Why can't Phase 1 be just 2 weeks & Phase 2 be 1 just month...!!! Businesses & workforce were already on WFH since 7 April and the longer the phases ride out, the more difficult will be the recovery challenges for SG businesses and our  economy to bounce back. Even if phases are speed up, businesses (primarily F&B, Retail & Travel) and the economy may not necessary pick up due to the new mandatory SOP i.e. safe distancing, etc...  China, South Korea and a few others are struggling to come back from lockdown as they cannot afford another lockdown despite the second waves!!!  With this second wave and the global travel restrictions still in force around the world, the respective countries' local retail trade consumption  not only did even resume but had dropped drastically as fear of global recession sets in amongst their workforces with many jittery over their job security and worldwide retrenchnent. MNCs around the world have gone bust within this short span of Q1 during the past 2-3 months, leaving a trail of declared bankruptcies in the wake... one after another!   Japan, one of the world's biggest economy is already in recession. The same cannot be said for SG... not only can we not afford a recession, we cannot survive a recession! So, please think twice before applying over cautious knee-jerk reactions simply for the sake of the emulating others in the play against Covid-19 number games. Covid-19 is here to stay and life must go on. Period. Let's just bite the bullet, get up and push on with life before life gets ahead of us... without us!  😓😓😓"

I would like to draw attention to many people who are living alone (eg. Singles) and have not been allowed to socialise with anyone and it is uncertain when they can do so. This leads to enormous mental strain due to living alone and feeling cooped up. Like for families, can we have a provision for them to meet with safeguards like 2 metre distancing etc?"

32849055,18238790,Helen Le,"May 25, 2020","Dear government,  Under Phase 1 of the lifting of Circuit Breaker measures, hair salons will be allowed to offer all hair services, including rebonding, bleaching and colouring services that translate to customers spending long hours in the salon. It comes as a great surprise to me that the government feels that this is safe, while deciding that nail salons should not be allowed to reopen.   What makes nail salons less safe or less essential than hair salons?   Please do not get me wrong. My intention is not to petition for hair services to be suspended. My belief is that nail services are just as essential and can be conducted just as safely. As such, nail services should be allowed to resume at the same time as hair services.   Haircuts were deemed essential from the very beginning, and limited to one hour.   I strongly believe that manicures and pedicures are equally essential and can be kept to the same time limit. Ask anyone with ingrown toenails and they might tell you that pedicures are more a medical necessity than a vanity project. We are trained professionals who do not just beautify nails; we treat and we correct. We have many long-term clients who come to us regularly to help relieve the discomfort and pain of ingrown toenails.   Just as a haircut is necessary for basic grooming, so are manicures and pedicures. In a similar vein, extended hair services such as colouring and perms are similar to nail services like extensions and nail art. Not quite so necessary, but many might argue that they are essential for emotional and mental well-being. As the saying goes - if you look good, you feel good.  If hair salons are allowed to offer the full suite of services from 2 June onwards, why is it that nail salons are not allowed to open at all? Surely safety is not the reason.  Hair services can be done safely with social distancing measures and enhanced hygiene and disinfection protocols. The same can be said for nail services.  Even prior to COVID19, our nail technicians wore face masks at work. As the situation developed, we increased our precautionary steps and stepped up disinfection frequency, conducted temperature checks and had customers fill in health declaration forms, rearranged our furniture and reduced the number of workstations to ensure more than a 1 metre distance between clients, and also provided handwashing facilities, face masks, hand sanitizer, etc for our clients’ use.   At no point in time does the nail technician touch the client’s face. We only handle hands and feet, which are then washed and sanitized after the service. This makes us in fact even safer than a hair salon, where the hair stylist touches the hair, which is a lot closer to the client’s face than the hands are.  In fact, we go even further in implementing safety measures. During the Circuit Breaker, my salon already placed orders for safety equipment such as goggles and face shields, and table top barriers to minimize the chances of transmission via droplets in the air. We also plan to allow for greater buffer time between appointments to allow for thorough cleaning and disinfection of workstations.  It is a fact that nail services can be as safe, if not safer, than hair services, with all the measures as described above.    Yet, we are being relegated and overlooked, not allowed to resume business at the same time as our friends in the hair industry. In the meantime, the government tells us not to make manpower cuts or wage adjustments. Of course, we want to treat our staff well. Anyone who has the means would not choose to sacrifice their staff welfare or shutter for good. But please, tell me – how do you expect a nail salon to stay afloat when their income is through services, and not goods? We cannot rely on selling products to generate enough revenue to cover our staff salaries, rental, and other fixed costs. Every day that we stay closed means we bleed a little more. Any longer and we will haemorrhage to death.    Do you know how many workers are employed in the nail industry? That is the number of jobs that will be lost if you do not allow nail salons to resume business soon. It is a labour-intensive industry with low profit margins because our revenue is limited by our manpower. Our meagre profits do not afford us the luxury of waiting months before opening for business again.   If nail services were non-essential or compromised safety, I would not have said a word about having to stay shut.   I strongly urge you to reconsider and allow us to resume business from 2 June onwards.   We are just as safe and just as essential as hair services. Some might say we are more so.

I must admit, I feel the same way. Enjoy the clear skies whilst it lasts."

Slow paced, no pressure, go home with someone actually at home, having dinner together, watch tv together, yes tv, and not hp, seeing strangers actually helping and caring for strangers. Life is like 30 years ago. I actually now know my neighbours name. And one main important thing for me personally, i have spoken more to my dad and done things together more in these 2 months than we ever had in the past 10 years. Seriously. I mean we are not exactly on bad terms. Just that i drive day, he drive night. The only times we talk is that splitting few minutes, if we meet. So not that i hope for the virus, but i can touch my heart and say thank you for this break in life, these slow 2 months to really reflect on my life. If only the virus will end, and we can continue at this pace. Cherish these balance 2 weeks people. Cos this chance will never come around again in our lifetime."

No need to wake up early to complete their HBL lessons and be reminded by their teachers that they have yet to complete certain assignments. We are indeed blessed to be here in our little red dot. We have a team who is working tirelessly to ensure that they make the  right decisions to bring the number of Covid-19 cases down. Many of us are thankful to the SG govt for all that has been done for not only the citizens but also non-citizens alike. Thank you. Sir, you need to  take care too. Stay Home, Stay Safe."

Do have a great time and enjoy yr family bonding time with each other staying at home with the stay-home activity and  idea programmes organised by MOE, and National Library Board with the Singapore librarians.

However I have observed that on the approvals of workers on-site for essential services, there seem to be a lack of coordination between Enterprise Singapore, MOM & MTI.  This has caused much inconvenience to the essential services industries. On another note, I hope that easing of CB restrictions should given priority to small companies with less than 10 employees or maybe less than 20 employees. These small companies are the worst hit & survival is critical to them if they are not given a lead start to resume their businesses. Appreciate if you could look into the above concern.

Both documents require company endorsement. I would like to ask during CB, no company is allowed to open and how can an employee get such document? Also, for low income job, it is pretty hard to ask HR to get such letter after retrenchment. So, if a company refuse to or dragging in providing such document, the retrenched employee will be stucked. Imagine this group of people who have to support family but failed to get documentation will be very difficult.  Why can’t the criteria be a bit flexible such as the ability to provide Cpf contribution history as a document proof- such as no contribution for X months then can tab on to the grant? Hope you can kindly consider. "

32425335,45809320,Hui Chi Shing,"May 5, 2020","Dear PM,  May I know when property viewing for rental purposes will be permitted? I have seen a number of messages in some Community Chat Groups asking for urgent help in finding alternative rental units during the CB period as their existing tenancy agreements are due to expire. Please pardon me for saying there is an apparent disconnect between permitting house moving but not (rental) property viewing during the CB period as residents cannot easily find replacement units without viewing.  I believe (rental) property viewing can be permitted with certain precautionary guidelines (e.g. compulsory mask wearing, social distancing, full record for future tracking, etc.) and on the basis that no large number of unknown parties will be involved in the process.  I hope the Government can look into this matter and take necessary actions accordingly.  Best regards, HUI Chi Shing"

32425335,45809320,SH Sham,"May 8, 2020","PM Lee Hsien Loong why there is no authority to monitor those gathering in hdb home during CB? My above neighbour keep on holding gathering and having people come, stay, eat for hours in their house. Making noise for hours. From day 1 CB till to date it has been many times they have other people gather in their house. I had called the police to inform and they said will inform hdb when the hdb officers are now work from home. Others ask me submit case to One App, I did but till to date there is no action or authority to monitor them. On 6/5/2020 they had party in their house. Before that also they having guests coming to their house.  It just put us at uneasy feeling. We also want to have our family or friends to come over especially during this fasting month but as the rules did not allow we forget about it for the time being but why there is residents that simply break this law again & again. What did Housing & Development Board do about this kind of law breaker? How was the law that not allowing anyone not in same household to come to our house being implement? Imagine if their visitors those who have covid-19 without they know it, they will put all the residents in my block in ‘danger’. If those that did not wear mask, did not practice social distancing being punish and fine please do so to those who simply invite others and gather in their house during CB. There is CCTV at the ground floor facing the lift and also CCTV inside the lift this is all the tools that can be use to monitor who come to hdb home.  There even CCTV at the ground floor staircase.  Thank you. "

Some of the things seen online are appalling, such as views by one Critical Spectator. As a nation of ppl whose forebears came to this island poor and who struggled so that we are where we are today, I think the majority of Singaporeans can appreciate that it is a coincidence of history and geography that these men have had to come here to work as labourers  - it is a matter of choice but what kind of choice do many of these have? Could we encourage everyone to show more compassion instead of smugly claiming that these men CHOSE to come here so they should not be expecting a bed of roses etc."

32153787,21858140,Fong Fattchee,"Apr 23, 2020","TIL lockdowns in epidemics are removed progressively over a few observation cycles as the standard exit strategy in the outbreak playbook.  When the lockdown was announced from 7 April 2020 to 4 May 2020 in Singapore, we knew there was no chance the lockdown would be completely lifted on 4 May 2020.  Assuming the 1 Jun 2020 extension meets all objectives, we will still only have a progressive rollback of measures over months as each COVID cycle is approx. 11-14 days.  If you as a business owner is holding out the hope of a quick return to normalcy on 1 Jun 2020, you are deluding yourself. A more accurate timeline is more likely to fall in July or August depending on your specific sector. The experts already know that a quick exit on a large aggregate of measures will risk a peak too high for the healthcare system to cope. The rollback of measures will probably start with the schools.  I hope this information is helpful as a data point to my fellow business owners navigating this storm.

I am not too sure the need to actively test them since in the beginning of the Covid-19, you said that we may not even take any action other than take care of those who succumb to the virus if the number get too big? Afterall, it really depnds on individual immunity. Is there a way to confine the worker to their dorms and sites, so long as they are not sick from Covid-19? Other countries are trying to move on by ringfencing the vulnerable post lockdown. Hence, post CCB, hope we could do the same by ringfencing the vulnerable so that the rest can resume their lives with the existing safety distancing, mask wearing etc. Hope that this can also apply to the migrant workers who are healthy whereby their movement is restricted to their construction site and the dorm. We should isolate the workers with underlying conditions as well as those of certain older age group. The rest should be allowed to work and have their movement restricted to sites and dorm. We can also provide entertainment such as movie nights etc for the dorm. This way, we can take care of both our economy as well as the workers who will appreciate not having to be quarantined. "

32022399,36505350,Mario Tjiong,"Apr 18, 2020","Unfortunately we are already nearing the halfway mark of the circuit breaker and there are still people who think lightly of the situation or are actively thinking of ways to ""game"" or ""get around"" the system to continue to meet up or socialize. There comes a point in time where these people cannot be considered to be ill-informed but must be considered to be willfully uncaring of the consequences of their actions. If fines cannot make them do the right thing, perhaps enforced solitary confinement will.  "

32022399,36505350,June Tan Lin,"Apr 18, 2020",Thank you Sir.  Just a suggestion: maybe you can brainstorm with the multi task ministry team to do a nationwide test to fish out the undetected cases.  I know it is a mammoth task.  Just a consideration.

We really want to break this and I believe we can if everyone makes an effort and not judge and blatantly defy decisions made by yourself and the cabinet ministers - which in my opinion is sound. The instruction is so simple- stay home, wear mask when going out. Elderly need to take care. You are not asking for anything more. What else do they want? I fail to understand. God be with you and guide you and the ministers in your decision making. Thank you once again. We got your back Sir."

We have a dependable healthcare system, responsible leaders. No one method works for a pandemic like this, you have try all ways, even thou it might not be perfect always, but at least to me and my family, we trust you had done the best!

As your kind self mentioned that though it’s early but there are signs of a slower viral community spread, which will give healthcare system more bandwidth to deal with the cases appearing each day....  I am very blessed to be in Singapore during this critical time specially the leadership your government and singapore people have shown in dealing with the lockdown, running essential business and dealing with “non-compliance”.  The fight is far from over, it’s a long marathon and will require lot of stamina to deal with it financially and emotionally.

Why not totally close MRT & public buses . Use only taxi & PHV for essential service people in this way you can help all this driver to boost their income at the same time I believed contact tracing are much easier in case driver or passengers were found to be covid 19 carrier, because PHV passengers require to book their ride via phone & whichever platform company will have record of Drivers & passengers.

Generally the ground is calm to accept it as we see our government did not sit on it BUT all out to close the gap. To filter out the affected in dormitory asap. I agree with Forum letter today that when we do execise, mask must be on, without exercise for 1 or 2 months will not risk our lives. when i went  NTUC today,  i see every where people flouting the rule under the cover of exercise by putting on the the sportsshoe or ride on a bicysle to jalan jalan without mask on. This has created unhappiness in the ground, many has sacrified to stay home and only go out when necessary and most have obeyed when out must with mask on all times.we must not allow these trouble makersto put our effort in vain  People are unappreciative of the flexibility granted But exploit them for own convenience or try to be hero [ BUT remeber when hero created, someone must die or many will dies].

And the other cases in the community has decrease. It has shown that the circuit breaker has prevented spikes in the community and I am really happy that Singaporeans from abroad have been brought home safely. The circuit breaker has seen great changes to work, schools and families but it’s all worthwhile to protect our lives. We thank you for preparing Singapore for a needed circuit breaker and ensuring that our basic needs especially food supplies are readily available. Personally, I feel that if the circuit breaker needs to be extended, many of us will support the idea, to ensure that covid 19 is really under control and that it will be safe for us to step out of the circuit breaker gradually, still observing social distancing, taking care of our health and seek professional consultation from doctors if we are unwell, and the use of surgical masks to protect ourselves and others.   I hope we will reach a “0” new cases one day, soon, and the zero is maintained for say, 2 - 3 weeks at least before the circuit breaker ends so that we won’t risk having another wave 🌊.   I was informed that schools in HK will reopen 28 days after achieving 0 new cases and they will reopen in batches.   I think that is a really good practice for consideration.   Thank you for reading my comment, please take care too."

The government has allowed their employers to transport them in flat bed trucks with no seats. They stay in overcrowded dormitories and are packed likes sardines with 12 persons to a room. The dormitories are not clean or sanitary. The dormitories were like a time bomb waiting to explode. They have now exploded with many infected workers. Singapore should treat this as a wake up call to treat our indispensable foreign workers like a First World country should and not in the disgraceful way in which they are treated now. I feel angry when I see foreign workers sitting on the ground eating their lunch. I see exhausted foreign workers stretched out on the ground to rest.” After the Covid-19 pandemic/CCB is over, the Sg Govt must do a thorough inquiry on why our MOM, NEA, BCA, dorms owners/operators n/or other relevant agencies had allowed the above poor living conditions to happen for so many years. They must be taken to task and take the blame for not able to do their job. Take away the license of the dorms operators/owners n impose a heavy penalty. In the mean time, all HDB 's elevators floors must be marked by tapes for safe distancing. Due to the small space in the elevators in the HDB estates, it should not allow for more than 4 persons in each of the elevator at any one time. Its urgent, n must be done immediately."

As of April 19, there are a total of 6,588 Covid-19 cases in Singapore, with a total of 11 deaths equivalent to 0.2% fatality rate, and 22 ICU cases. The reason why Singapore ’s case fatality rate so low lies in that of all cases, there are 5011 work permit holders who are not senior citizens and not living with their families, accounting for 76% of the total. Non-vulnerable groups can easily beat the coronavirus through. These work permit holders as non-vulnerable groups lower the fatality rate and ICU number to very a very safe level. This inspired us to implement head immunity among non-vulnerable groups, so as to achieve safe and low-cost herd immunity globally."

Not even 1 person there had any concept of what 1 metre away meant. This included some staff members. There was no attempt made to take control, as in maybe limiting the numbers into the mart itself, or trying in vain to remind people to keep their distance. Actually people shopping were rude, dismissive, and kept cutting in, many carrying small children. No fear of a raging virus, at this stage, beggars belief. I wouldn't be too surprised if staff would have an even worse time trying to convince these clueless, careless and callous shoppers. I was rather distressed. There was no way to keep my distance, despite my telling someone to keep theirs. I left as soon as I found a way out. It was a fertile place to pass any infection. I pray that is not the case."

Then we thoroughly disinfect the whole building or the dormitory. Finally we shift healthy workers back to their dormitory after necessary test, e.g., swab test. This would still be a very complicated process involving a lot of details to be carefully handled, but maybe it helps request fewer rooms to solve the critical problem we currently have?

Without an effective treatment for covid-19, everyone has the chance of getting infected, falling sick, and suffering physically and even financially.  I applaud the government's recent efforts on the foreign worker dormitories. The workers may have insufficient knowledge of the dangers of the virus, and may delay getting medical attention when not feeling well. These increase the risks of further spreading the disease within the dormitory and into the community.  Enhancing the dissemination of information is key, especially to those workers who have underlying medical conditions.  The work of the inter-agency task force is vital to slowing the spread by identifying those with symptoms and isolating them from the others, setting up quarantine facilities so that the sick can get the care to recover from the disease in peace, as well as providing correct health/medical advice and information."

32022399,36505350,Si Cheng Choon,"Apr 19, 2020","Dear PM,  I would like to suggest a help line is being set up to provide advisory to the social distancing ambassadors. I have seen a video circulating about a grab rider questioning an ambassador if he could have a cigarette break (without wearing his mask, of course).  I think the ambassador from LTA managed the situation well, not escalating it but he is neither well trained nor authorized to answer some of the tough questions.  While the grab rider may have been rude, I can understand his frustrations as he is out there delivering food which is an essential service yet he has to ""hide"" to eat his lunch and take a cigar ette break.  It would be great to have this setup to continuously update and adjust polices where feasible."

32022399,36505350,Sabrina Moey,"Apr 18, 2020","The aggressive tests from the MOH explained the high rising numbers of Covid19 infected rate for the past one week plus for the foreign workers. The swab test conducted to the foreign workers are even healthy looking workers who display no symptoms or very mid symptoms. This is like checking and removing all coakroches even down to every drains n pipes of the whole house. Many countries are adopting the 'wait till the cockroaches eventually start crawling out n resting on the bed' approach then their health care will then begin to deal with it and buying time for vaccines to intervene in due course..Our infected figures will be alarming for sure since with such aggressive testing but if our medical and MOH facilities and resources are able to substain then it is definitely a good move in a longer term so that even the vaccines will not be out this year we can still contain it . but if our medical facilities are totally exhausted because of the local transmission added to the infected rate,then the CB will have to be extend for another month probably to subdue the local transmission so our MOH and medical team can better focus on the foreign worker infected case."

I know the task force is trying hard, but if they cannot self-reflect to accept and understand the root causes of the spike, and still cannot identify to stop the potential new waves, then they are wasting nation resources and putting nation lifes and health at risk for being a back-seat drivers.

Because I m confused, in the past when haze struck SG, psi hit the unhealthy mark, no one dare to go out w/out mask or even exercise at Park. Now tis virus is of no smell but is highly infectious, ppl go exercise or out w/out mask. Will they fall sick or grow fat from not exercising for a month, they can conduct home exercising. Maybe sir, you shd put a stop on outdoor exercise w/out mask. Bcoz if they catch the virus or spread it, more will get sick, and they will get fat once been isolated, they will be fed 3meals day lying on the bed till they recovered. Lastly, a lot of us is thankful for the given $600, majority of us need it, but to some, they can't use it, bcoz of their stubbornness for not wearing mask when they r out.

32022399,36505350,John Bpth,"Apr 19, 2020","Dear Prime Minister,   I believe the circuit breaker can, to some extent, bring about some positive results. However, the rising numbers of new cases in the last few days do not bode well for Singapore and do shake the people's confidence that the situation is improving. You have explained the actions being taken by our noble health and medical team members whose efforts deserve everyone's applause. With concerted effort from everyone, I believe Singapore can overcome and drive away the dark cloud soon.  I do have a few comments though and seek your open heart and mind to listen. (1) Could the case numbers from the dormitories be preempted or at least mitigated? (2) Have the dormitory owners and operators not taken sufficient pre-emptive initiatives at the early stage when case numbers in Singapore were in the 2-digit range? (3) Nevertheless, when the Covid19 storm ends, hopefully soon, could the relevant government agencies work hard to set and monitor new guidelines to bring about better living conditions for the migrant workers who I respect for their contribution to our nation. (4) While existing dormitory standards may be considered decent, but Covid19 has revealed some deficiencies. I like to clarify that good dormitory standards do not just refer to the hardware. The way it is managed and monitored are equally important.  I am a retired Singaporean and am proud of our nation. I earnestly look forward to soon seeing the end of Covid19 and returning to my normal routines. I also suggest government agencies could retain some good practices implemented currently, such as more frequent cleaning of food centres, markets, public transports, public toilets, etc where people congregate out of necessity.

32022399,36505350,Tony Wee,"Apr 19, 2020","The CB is good. Many people I observed are doing their part. But some leeway should be given to seniors who are above 65 years old. Allowed them to eat at foodcourts, hawker centres or coffeeshops. Put aside some tables and chairs with a notice to inform others that this condoned off area are for them only. And they must also  practice distancing. Reasons being at their age, some can't walk well and fast, am alone, have diabetes, high blood sugar and not very strong. If they are diabetic, their sugar can suddenly dropped and they can blackout. So they need to eat something. For those who are weak, walking home after buying their takeaway maybe difficult if they stay too far from the food centres. And being weak and alone, it is also difficult to carry their food. There are many disadvantages for this group of old, weak, feeble, alone kind of people."

Imagine if you have a house, but you only must walk out from your master bedroom, not even 1 step; you have window or balcony, please do not open, keep it close tight 24 hours a day, 14 days for the period, then this is how the so call “5/4 start hotel HSN” is now.   For the returning singaporean, not a criminal offender, not confirmed with virus yet, not even a so call suspected person. As Prisoners are allowed for morning and evening let go out of their cell, why we can’t? Even within the hotel, said designated Greenland?   Does this explain 1st world country with 3rd world country human right? In Singapore, isolation means can’t even breath at all?

We should stop and cancel all unnecessary jobs and send off all unaffected workers back to their home country. When economy recovers it be sometime later and do employ locals or neighbor Malaysians that do not need Dorminatories facilities. Sending off cancel jobs workers free up space and clean space and use it for the infected to rest. As there are no vaccine.. Just like other countries  with huge now. They provide make shift non hospital stay area as care area.  Anyway economy w slow.. So cancel the jobs early and send many home to their countries is best way to free space in Dorminatories and use the space for the balance.

They themselves are not vulnerable and supposed to have little underlining disease; 2.       They are not living together with those vulnerable to covid-19; 3.       They pose little threat to overwhelming the health caring system of Singapore, as only 11 death by now, equivalent to 0.18% fatality rate lowest among any of the world, and 23 in ICU, equivalent to 0.5% of critical rate among the live cases, though several thousand new cases added by those living in dormitories. 4.       After the heard, they could resume working without worrying any more to spread covid-19 to those vulnerable of Singapore and resurgence within WP and SP holders living in dormitories should they not be herd.  The vaccines are still long way to go to help the herd immunity, which would be reached in most area of the world by resurgence of the outbreaks eventually. However, the dormitories could make this without posing high risks to themselves, to the neighbor communities and to the health care system.  Let’s have the herd in dormitories.

My kids are all very young age 4, 2 and 5 months old. Helper can only look after young baby while husband will be looking after 2 elder one.Husband is now consider jobless as freelancer and young children are not going to school as I decided to keep them at home but with this current situation I am forced to work from home and I think there is a issue with husband handling young kids. For education this part is it possible for childcare to conduct a online learning so that we parents are able to like more focus on work from home and not stressing out. I as a mother I can handle them but the situation right now that I have to work from home and complete my work with tight deadlines I am not able to help him out in terms of talking about being productive and husband have not patient with the kids. I understand that our government had done pretty much for us and I appreciate most of it but I hope the childcare can conduct online lesson maybe using zoom. Not sure if possible but I hope things will change and turn better so that my husband can focus on things he want to do and not stressing out otherwise with crcuit breaker extended by 4 weeks many parents will have difficulties especially for parents with more than 2 kids.

Many of us here don know what billion look like but many of us here suffered due to official overlooked. No one see a cluster forming at all?? Do you really believe that?   Job lost, families suffered. Ppl are feeling depressed and moody. Some citizen are breaking the law because they cannot handle the stress at all. Who can handle 12 days at home with no money... no work... wife and children are crying and nagging? These ppl are the one that suffered. Not the ppl who comment in facebook saying good job Govt. Keep up the CB. 😔  The CB was man made. In Singapore, we really need to make sure ppl who made the wrong decision and cause the country to lose that amount of money be replaced by others who can do the job. It’s a simple request.

Fear and panic are also contributors to the situation.  If we can get the public to be conscious of their hygiene, mature and sensitive against spreading their disease or sickness to others; we can faster get back to normality.  This is a great opportunity to drive home the importance of not coughing, sneezing, clearing their noses or throats in public without a mask when unwell and even suspecting unwell!   Drive home the wearing of mask when suspecting illness, unwell or sick! And to stay home and not work if unwell. More has to be done to enable this at the workplace especially for contingent workforce employers.  If we look at Taiwan and Japan; you will quickly realise that their Covid 19 situation is very much in control. Much due to their civic consciousness and responsibilities to others.  We ought to do the same, starting now.  If Covid 19 is to stay with us; this civic consciousness and self hygiene has to be reinforced and driven to clearly to all in Singapore!

These have proven to be effective bulkheads. Recall that the first FW infections occurred in one of the newer dorms and that it did not spark a wider transmission. We shape our buildings, and afterwards, our buildings shape us.  [2] Dorm-config not the only contributor. In 2019-2020, I have visited multiple stations on the Thomson line, I have worked in Project Glory. PSSCOC style templates have safety policy mandates which are high risk in an epidemic. This includes -the safety management template for massed shift kickoffs, massing of water points, meal areas, toileting & washing areas coupled with synchronized meal times concentrated and massed construction workers at ""toolbox briefings"", safety inductions, meal areas, assembly points and pickup points.  [3]The construction safety officers - the risk experts - had no special understanding of epidemic risk. It was not significant on their standard checklist of construction hazards. Construction safety officers received no communication from MOH wrt to massing of workers in the context of existing capacities and standard safety practices as the epidemic approached.  [4] Air-conditioned buses have surface contact and high volume of return air as per design of Bus A/C. Open trucks have crowding. If it rained - side tarps were lowered and created an enclosed humid environment. Long commutes created a sustained risk exposure event.

32022399,36505350,Ming Hao,"Apr 18, 2020","Gov. sg sent a message out today to remind people to respect our law enforcement officers and ambassadors.  I think we absolutely should give them the utmost respect they deserve. They are front line people who play an important role to safeguard our health while risking theirs. They have family too, and like many of us, they have a job to do.  I hope the Govt would understand why the people are angry and frustrated, some are even mentally distressed. Many small businesses are not going to survive, and many will lose their jobs and have their income substantially affected.   The people don’t have an outlet to vent their anger during this unprecedented time. Many have placed their trust in the government, but now this faith is severely being tested, and some have lost it completely.  The people don’t know how long this CB period would last, and privately, many people believe it won’t work and we haven’t even mentioned the double standards behaviour exhibited by the PAP MPs who walked the ground during this CB period.  My point being, people don’t see a closure to their anger. Some don’t know who to blame for their plight, and others who do, know there is no chance our PM and the ministerial taskforce would own up their mistakes.   All leaders make mistakes. To be human means we all have to mess up once in a while. If you messed up, admit it and own it. Then acknowledge your responsibility and move forward. Only insecure leaders are afraid of looking weak.  At this time, admitting your mistakes earns you the respect of the people you lead and makes your leadership human. Once you have done that, the relationship with the people would get stronger and you would regain the trust of the people to move forward.  That is the real mandate the govt is seeking, and not through methods of enforcement measures, fines, POFMA or gerrymandering. It’s about winning hearts and minds.  I think this is what we need to really unite the people to overcome the crisis, and together."

What if .. what if there is some worker due to unhappiness / self worry or someone creating unrest & spread to 2 bigger dorm then 3 then 4 & so on ...   1) Question links to homeland security now is are WE ( SPF , Task force from SPF , Army , MP from army ) equip to handle ?   2) Its the fast response team able to handle as we are talking abt 200K workers ?   3) As of now, on the group in that 15 or so isolation area / zone enough security personal to handle ?   4) We SG have never never see / think of this 200k workers of where they stay might post a sparking / starting point to spread CV19 in SG .    5) This is a global pandemic hence the scale of managing will be unprecedented.   The lesson learned from the past like little India riots ( 400 or less rioters ) expose the reality of SG not prepare  let alone now in 200k workers .   I know You & SG government have been really caring to all the workers & taking care of them ..   But what if the that someone just out to creat harm to SG ..   All your ministers are now working hard to take care of us the Singaporean & those staying in Singapore.   No sure any one think / worry of what I fear as the scale of 200k workers is very real ...   We take care of them ( the 200k worker ) but the what if have to be consider .  Thank you Mr Lee .  Yours sincerely  Alvin lim"

32022399,36505350,Albert Kwan,"Apr 18, 2020",陳振聲認為，若新加坡學香港，一人一日一口罩，每日就要五百萬口罩；但疫情可能持續數月，這樣的需求根本無法滿足，所以新加坡必須有策略地使用口罩，分優次保證口罩的供應，首先是醫護人員，其次是的士司機、巴士司機或其他前綫服務人員。他承認，不全民戴口罩或許是一場賭博，但可以確保有足夠的儲備。

In short, nice on paper, no execution. Singapore government is much more reliable. They carried out and follow through what they said. They have the expert, resources, smart people. Singaporean has done very well and you should be very proud of yourself. Be confident in your government. They are doing the best they can to protect you and your livelihood. Singapore jia you! "

Thanks to my growing up years and education beside doing my National Service in Singapore I am still a Singaporean at heart. We become good citizen wherever we go and we follow the rules and regulations. I have self isolated myself before the mandatory lockdown was declared because the NZ Govt advised those above 70 to remain indoor as much as possible. The community spirit here is incredible. I get my  shopping delivered by university students who volunteered to do our shopping at supermarket, fruits and vegetables from neighbours gardens and even the postman delivered the mails to the door instead collecting them at the mailbox. This is a time where you be kind to each other and stay at home for goodness sake."

Some countries arent even testing as much and may claim they have less and less cases per day! Whatever the case, we need to work with what we have based on our methods, without concern of how other countries are fairing. Besides, we will need the neighboring countries to improve so proper trade and travel can resume and recover the economy for everyone. The importance here and now, is our people. Early intervention or not, isn't the issue. It still comes down to the people, and we need to work together to solve it rather than compare."

And yet, the lockdown she implemented is far stricter than ours. She listened to the many who petitioned her to impose the lockdown before it was too late. I don't think we can compare what we have done to New Zealand. We should admit our taskforce was slow in anticipating the tsunami of infections. I am sure you will agree that many mistakes were made, right up to the time you stepped in and introduced the circuit breaker measures. Reactive ""measured""  responses from the workgroup were repeatedly wrong and many doctors knew they will not work when dealing with a virus like this.

Limit each customer to 1 basketfull of items n at most $50 worth of these items. If they want more, they need to queue again. This will cut down the waiting time for people in the queue to pay for their items. Besides, make it a point that no one should venture out of their home by 10 pm. They must wear a mask whenever they go out. Failure to do so is a fine n no more first time is a warning. People will treat this enforcement seriously as it means they have to pay."

31805260,12010080,Margaret Subha Chew,"Apr 9, 2020","We really need to co-operate n look after/protect each other. Last Wednesday I was at ShengSiong Supermarket (Segar outlet). Not all shoppers put on mask; it wasn't crowded when I entered but within 10 mins more shoppers flooded in. Thus, I decided to pick the last 2 items n go. 1st item - lemon: a lady shopper in her 60s' (with no mask on) was picking hers, picking n choosing. I picked three pcs and as I was about to walk away, ts lady was coughing, although she did turn away as she coughed but she coughed into the hand holding onto a pc of lemon. I stood on, just to make sure she didn't put back that pc of contaminated lemon.  2nd n last item: a pkt of dried noodles, a lady in her 40s' carrying a shopping basket kept saying ""excuse me, excuse me!"" as the lane was quite narrow. I was stooping to pick up my item, so when I heard her, I stood up to give way but to my astonishment! she couldn't wait but squeezed through having a direct body contact with me. She just brushed off w/o even apologising 😠 I sincerely appeal to all supermarkets to monitor the traffic flow n get shoppers to put on mask b4 they enter and also maintain 1m distance even while picking their items; if not, all the stipulated measures to keep the disease down will not be effective!😬"

If all Singaporeans are not on the same frequency as our government and we are not united we will be the one suffering..... "
31799038,92072290,CH Edwina,"Apr 9, 2020","A great concerted effort on the part of our government to contain COVID-19. One suggestion perhaps, is to have dialect-speaking enforcement officers to emphasise the importance of stay@home, safe distancing and mask-wearing to elderly especially those who are illiterate as I still spot pockets of elderly mingling around."

It would be difficult for the officers to question every pair of people outside whether they live together or not.... We can only exercise self discipline ourselves.  Pray and  hope that the epidemic will soon be mitigated🙏🙏🙏"
31799038,92072290,KD Brody,"Apr 9, 2020","Theres is no allowance for excuses to adjust to the CCB, the message is clear..stay home or run the risk of getting infected. The more we delay in getting our act right the more we increase the chances of getting infected and prolonging the lockdown as well. So get your act together and do the right thing for yourselves, friends and love ones"
31799038,92072290,David Ong,"Apr 9, 2020","** This doctor has worked hard to make a video to educate the public. He was right. It was n’t the medical staff who were fighting on the front line. It was you and me. He explained it comprehensively and simply, and then taught him how to prevent and tell the serious consequences, that is, the pain of your life and death. Thank you for his love for making education to let you and I have knowledge to face. **  It ’s worth reposting. If everyone is educated and is also a frontline defender, the medical staff on the final front will be in danger to face the threat of their own lives! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 May you be safe! So STAY at HOME!!! **这医生用心良苦 制作视频为要教育大众。他说的对，最前线打战的不是医护人员 其实是你我。他很全面简单的讲解 然后教导知识 最好如何预防 并道出严重后果 就是你和家人的生死离别的痛苦。谢谢他的爱心制作 为要教育 让你我有知识 去面对也。** 值得转发 若大家被教育 也是前线防守的战士  不然最后战线的医护人员就有危险去面对他们自己生命的威胁了！🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻愿你平安! 所以待在家里!!!"

31799038,92072290,Irene Sim-Zeiler,"Apr 9, 2020","It is a good decision, but I think our communication to the public needs tweaking. Those of us who are on the Govt app are alerted to the press conference in English. Somehow, with the daily changes in rules, certain segments of our country are not getting the message. The elderly seems to have a hard time understanding the parameters. Some don’t buy newspapers. Maybe we have to think about maildrop instructions in different languages. Not all the oldies have kids to explain to them either."
31799038,92072290,Agnes Lim,"Apr 9, 2020",There are still group of 4 to 5 people gather at open park in Bedok South in the evening till late at night.

Teachers are being made to return to school unnecessarily. The frequency could be from 3 days a week to every day. We teachers are also human beings and we deserve to be treated the same as everyone else.  There are many centres which are milking the most that they can from their teachers by making them commute to work just to do cleaning and conduct online lessons in the centre.  We try to practice social distancing as much as possible but we share common spaces and as much as we try to take precautions, we still breathe the same air in the air-conditioned centre.  Many of us are also mothers and we have elderlies at home. By making us leave our house unnecessarily, we are also being put at risk and sometimes we can't help but wonder if we have made the right career choice.  We have tried to reach out to relevant authorities for help but they simply told us that that's the centres arrangement and they cannot intervene.  I just want to raise to your attention that many centres are looking into the loopholes from the advisory and trying to find a way around it.  Please help us as we are already at our wits end."

Haven’t they read about the outbreaks in nursing home for elderly and at the workers’ dormitories?  I strongly recommend that the government put in one new rule: 1) mandatory to wear mask in public places   I think it will have a strong psychological impact on people’s behaviour when they r constantly reminded that they have to put on mask 😷 to prevent themselves from spreading COVid-19  to others unknowingly each time they go out.   It’s time that we learn to constantly think for others.

Steps painstakingly been taking by the Government  are truly commendable, and to show our appreciation and play our frontline part,  each and everyone must fully comply with all measures.

31799038,92072290,Soon Huat Tng,"Apr 10, 2020","Dear PM Lee Sir, I am concerned that there are still inbound flights bringing in substantial number of potentially non-Singaporeans coming into the country. Even if these non-Singaporeans and LT pass holders are essential healthcare and transport workers, for them to be admitted into the country they need to be quarantined for 14 days, further straining the country stretched resources and potentially importing new cases. It further defeats the purpose if we continue to allow dependents of LT pass holders to be admitted at this juncture when globally people are exercising (and as we are as well here in Singapore) to restrain from even meeting our loved ones. So the benefit at this stage to the country vis-a-vis the risks we are importing does not quite add up. Should we not consider further tightened custom control? As an example,I was somewhat surprised to learn that we still have inbound flights   coming in from Chennai, Mumbai and New Delhi today (total pax size of 600), of which there are numerous old folks and kids when India is in the midst of a lock-down and our country into the first week of heightened measures. Our measures are only as strong as our weakest link, and would ask that you consider plugging this obvious gap. Respectfully yours, a concerned citizen."

Those who came as a whole family walked side by side, making it difficult for others to keep a safe distance as we walked or jogged past them. It seems that the number of people there is more than that at the NTUC Supermarket! I felt very worried for this situation and have decided not to exercise in the park for the time being. It gave me the feeling that the park has become one of the most vulnerable places for the virus to spread. I sincerely encourage your team to check out the different parks across the country. This is not a holiday, this is not the time to bring children and elderly out for fun. I understand that it may be difficult to stay at home all the time but this is for the benefit of everyone and for the entire Nation. I hope that Singaporeans can just bear with this for 4 weeks. Our pioneers had gone through the toughest time during the World Wars and our independence period, this is small case compared to then. I hope that all Singaporean can just be united and helped everyone to stay safe and healthy. "

Just because some companies support essential services such as oil & gas, pharma, offshore, etc does not mean is ok for some staff to go back office to work and/or attend meeting when most of the staff are not operational staff such as admin, hr, account, sales, etc. The company thinks that since exempted from suspension and working with lesser staff on lesser days they are complying to cb, when all the non operational staff can rightfully wfh by telecommuting. Companies also take opportunity to suspend payment of transport allowance for april but still insist sales staff should visit clients using Grab or claim by milage and stated that transport allowance may be changed to reimbursement in the coming months. It is a good opportunity to 'game' the system due to covid-19. It is happening in many sme in industrial estates all over singapore. Good luck to cb and good luck to sgp."

When politicians demand the citizens to sacrifice for the sake of greater good, the amount demanded is never equal - The wealthy can give up a car or two and still live comfortably, but what about the rest of us?  Just how many of us live in 800 sq. ft. housings with breathing space to exercise? It's not as though we want to sit packed like sardines in the kitchens. Not all of us have dedicated wi-fi at home either, and have to rely on mobile data plans that charge us exorbitant amounts for overuse. As if that is not enough, we get fined for not wearing masks when we go outside (... after being handed a measly piece of cloth), scarcely 1 week after being told EXPLICITLY not to buy masks so that the hospitals would have enough. In fact, just 2 days ago, the police patrols on the MRT were not even wearing masks on their round, so much for legitimacy.  The very fact that I am connected to the internet and can gripe here means that I am one of the luckier ones; what about the rest of us out here don't even have that luxury? Given time, sentiments of people stuck together for a month with nothing to do but to wait for poverty to come knocking will fester.

Focus the Gov machinery on over-communicating on stay-home and mask-wearing. Blanket the airwaves. Sound the air raid siren every day. Tell people to show solidarity to the nurses and doctors risking their lives by wearing a mask as a totem of solidarity.   Wrt to saving plastic food containers. We have an integrated PE value chain in Singapore and plenty of finished goods(plastic container) manufacturers with production lines that are happy to run 24/7. With estimates as high as 60% of F&B outlet facing bankruptcy according to their own trade association - we won't run out of food containers in Singapore but we will and can squander the next 28-days. Focus and beyond over-communicate. Minimize Yak-shaving, bikeshedding - aka ""when you're up to your neck in alligators, it's hard to remember that your initial objective was to drain the swamp"".  The German federation has made mask-wearing as a major return to work plank to complement social distancing. The Taiwanese have emphasised mask-wearing over physical spacing.

I guess its has been a good start for many singaporeans who had been co-operating well with the Govt . Many tried as much as to stay at home and by sending messages , texts and words to encourage one another to stay home as much as possible . Hope we will be able to make through to our desired date .   Wow ! We really thank you Mr PM Lee for your Leadership and setting a GOOD Example. Even though the Cabinet Ministers meet for Your meeting , you all do also Wear A Mask😷😷 and doing the Space Distancing  during Meeting  👍👍👏👏💪💪.  A Good leader will go by setting the good example and carry out what had been spoken and not just speaking of words only   When i went to do some essential things, there are still quite afew of pple feeling not important to do so . However when i see one with the mask ,  i did drop a word to encourage them to put on the mask becos by doing is to help take care and protect of themselves , ourselves and others . Hope they will learn to know the importance of wearing the mask when out    Quoted :- Yes  This is not a month long holiday, when we can go out for jalan jalan or to meet up with friends. 😂😂🤣🤣  We thank you for the smart hdps that was made as we stay at home we still  stay connected and keep 🤜🤛in touch still .   #SGUnited"

(1) why is my mom still required to go to work at a childcare Center to take care of the children to essential service workers when she cannot look after my child.  (2) why are we still silent about elderly workers going to work in essential services, (3) Can there be exceptions made to allow us to at least go to our parents house for childcare if we meet stringent conditions like we don’t go out of the homes (order food in), we only go to parents house in our own car. Hope the Task Force can consider this.  (4) Can the government or task force help explain why there is a flip flop of the rule on dropping kids with grandparents within a day.

PM, sir, the whole nation are working hard hand in hand toward a controllable CoVID-19 situation, why should we allow such behavior to disrupt and may even endanger the society.  I am sure all true Singaporeans can see for ourselves, how all the Ministers from the top to the bottom of their ministries are working 24/7-365, for us, for the country.

Don't act brave and selfish on the expense of risking the nation. Just wondering how to stagger.timing to get food and necessity to avoid crowds? Is there another APP to book a timing to avoid crowding? Now the numbers of infections is growing over each day. The only way is get everyone to self sentence themself to another jail term at home.

31783546,98893880,Samantha Wayne,"Apr 10, 2020","Today I encountered a selfish Singaporean couple in their sixties who walked by side along the stairs up a bridge and refused to give way to the others even when they were asked to be excused. Not only their attitude was bad, they even scolded others for squeezing through passed them. The disgusting thing about this couple is that their attitude changed completely and they became super polite and civil when they saw a social distancing ambassador who witnessed the incident, and even tried to explain that they were in their sixties and walked slowly. BTW, there was a lift at the bridge the couple could take. More importantly, if they are old they should not be even going out and about. Isn't this against what the government had advised - that the elderly should stay home and not venture out?  Apart from the circuit measures the government has introduced, it is also important for the government to educate our senior citizens on their manners and hygiene. Since I returned home around six years ago from overseas where I was based for more than a decade, I’ve encountered so many of our senior citizens who have this ‘I and old and am always right’ attitude with absolutely no concept of personal hygiene, coughing and sneezing openly and even spitting anywhere and whenever they like. At the end of the day, this boils down to one thing - their selfish attitude. Like what Dr Tommy Koh said, Singapore is a First World country with Third World citizens. I can now understand why Dr Koh had said this."

31783546,98893880,Samantha Lam,"Apr 10, 2020","Today I encountered a selfish Singaporean couple in their sixties who walked by side along the stairs up a bridge and refused to give way to the others even when they were asked to be excused. Not only was their attitude bad, they even scolded others for squeezing through them. The disgusting thing about this couple is that their attitude changed completely and became super polite when they saw a social distancing ambassador around who witnessed the incident, and  explained then that they were in their sixties and had to walk  slowly. BTW, there’s a lift which the couple could have used. More importantly, they are elderly and should stay home and not leave home if they can’t even walk normally.   Apart from the circuit measures that the government has introduced, it is also important for the government to educate our senior citizens on their manners and hygiene. Since I returned home from overseas where I was based for more than a decade, I’ve encountered so many of our senior citizens who have this ‘I and old and am always right’ attitude with no concept of personal hygiene at all, coughing and sneezing openly and even spitting anywhere and whenever they like. Like what Dr Tommy Koh had said “Singapore is a First World country with Third World citizens”. I can now see where Dr Koh is coming from."

31783546,98893880,Oliver Stahl,"Apr 9, 2020","Prof. Knut Wittkowski, which has been an epidemiologist for 35 years and has been modeling epidemics for 35 years. He worked for 15 years with Klaus Dietz, a leading epidemiologist who coined the term “reproduction number”, on the Epidemiology of HIV before heading for 20 years the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at The Rockefeller University, New York.   He says: With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity. About 80% of the people need to have had contact with the virus, and the majority of them won’t even have recognized that they were infected, or they had very, very mild symptoms, especially if they are children. So, it’s very important to keep the schools open and kids mingling to spread the virus to get herd immunity as fast as possible, and then the elderly people, who should be separated, and the nursing homes should be closed during that time, can come back and meet their children and grandchildren after about 4 weeks when the virus has been exterminated…. We are experiencing all sorts of counterproductive consequences of not well-thought-through policy….  Well, we will see maybe a total of fewer cases—that is possible. However, we will see more cases among the elderly, because we have prevented the school children from creating herd immunity. And so, in the end, we will see more death because the school children don’t die, it’s the elderly people who die, we will see more death because of this social distancing….  If we had herd immunity now, there couldn’t be a second wave in autumn. Herd immunity lasts for a couple of years, typically, and that’s why the last SARS epidemic we had in 2003, it lasted 15 years for enough people to become susceptible again so that a new epidemic could spread of a related virus. Because typically, there is something that requires cross-immunity, so if you were exposed to one of the SARS viruses, you are less likely to fall ill with another SARS virus. So, if we had herd immunity, we wouldn’t have a second wave. However, if we are preventing herd immunity from developing, it is almost guaranteed that we have a second wave as soon as either we stop the social distancing or the climate changes with winter coming or something like that….  [Extreme reactions] cost the US taxpayer $2 trillion, in addition to everything else that it costs, but it also has severe consequences for our social life, and depression is definitely something that we will be researching. I can say for myself, walking through New York City right now is depressing….  We should be resisting, and we should, at least, hold our politicians responsible. We should have a discussion with our politicians. One thing we definitely need to do, and that would be safe and effective, is opening schools. Let the children spread the virus among themselves, which is a necessity to get herd immunity. That was probably one of the most destructive actions the government has done. We should focus on the elderly and separating them from the population where the virus is circulating. We should not prevent the virus from circulating among school children, which is the fastest way to create herd immunity…. And the final question and answer:  “So, is there anything else you want to say about this that—what’s been aggravating you the most? Or what would you like people to know?”  I think people in the United States and maybe other countries as well are more docile than they should be. People should talk with their politicians, question them, ask them to explain, because if people don’t stand up to their rights, their rights will be forgotten.  https://www.aier.org/article/stand-up-for-your-rights-says-professor-knut-m-wittkowski/"

EVIDENTLY, SG needs to relook employing and deploying fws esp in essential services. We are too dependent on the fws across the board, SG will not be sustainable or grow without them, we need a NATIONAL CONTINUITY PLAN ASAP and this must include the NSmen as linchpins of society, not just soldiers. Hence very IMPORTANTLY SAF needs to realise we need at most 3 in-camp training for NSmen (who are indispensable as fathers, sons and resources to our economy and survival) for them to be operationally effective. Mindef needs to think and plan effectively and efficiently, more money and more training don't equate to effectiveness, we are citizen soldiers not professional ones. Min exposure to pandemic, current and future, min impact to security of SG. Who and where are the leaders in SG with the vision to bring SG to a sustainable future that values Singaporeans as invaluable resources worth investing in and worth nurturing, Who and Where are these leaders in SG???"

31759859,85797410,Amanda Lim,"Apr 7, 2020","A very hard decision has been made to close schools and many businesses. Then why not come down even harder to really stop people from moving around? So much sacrifices have been made for this month long circuit breaker, but clearly not everyone get the message to stay home. On my way to work and back there are still many cars on the roads. All 3 bubble tea outlets in Toa Payoh were packed with long lines of people. How is bubble tea essential, I have no idea. Clearly people need strong enforcement to comply, mere requests and pleading by the government is not sufficient. Do we have to wait for this circuit breaker to fail before coming down hard on people’s movement? We need this to work once and for all, or the disruptions will persist, more money will be lost, and more sufferings we will have to endure. "

In particular, the HBL program. It's a very good program initiated by MOE but Singaporeans seem to focus on the downside. It's so funny how there's more post in MOE's facebook page trying to address parents' issues about HBL than sharing information about the program. Please just support your government. You're very lucky to have leaders that care enough to provide a solution."

Will we still have enough reserves to do more later, if the situation calls for it?  PM-LHL: 1. Freeze all their Bank Account for 90 days. 2. Freeze their Salaries for 90 days. 4. Freeze their Credit Cards for 90 days 3. Give them $500 cash to live for 90 days. Put them in the 'Shoes of the Financially Disadvantage and Disability for 90 days."" After 90 days, ask them to feedback how they are coping, ya? That's the best way for them to learn Empathy and Compassion.

I know some won’t like to hear this, but half measures are no measures. Let’s work together and get the numbers down by May so some semblance of normalcy can carry on. Maybe will need laws on this cos Singaporeans sometimes only obey when the law comes down hard."

They do not understand the important of SAH.  We high light to them this virus often have no symptom in early stage anyone could be one of the infected person.  1) When SAH can help avoid getting infected from unknown infected person when you go out. 2) If unfortunately he/she was an infected person confirm only in late symptom, with the SAH it will only spreads within family and not to community.

The thinking behind it, the calibrated measures taken to keep Singaporeans’ lives safe and bearable as much as possible and communicating them well is a challenging, balancing act. The decisiveness and speed of response in the form of the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budget within a short span of time is hugely commendable! More importantly the comprehensiveness and the broad reach of the budget and responsiveness in tweaking the schemes based on feedback from the ground is greatly appreciated! As a Singaporean it is very comforting that our government always plan and think Ahead and not just react to challenges. I hope the EXECUTION of the measures are carried out as intended so that we emerge from this pandemic with minimal loss of lives and begin gradual restoration of normalcy in our lives soon. Create a channel for people to work with the government to ensure companies and individuals follow the guidelines so that we get out of this pandemic quickly as one SGUnited! Take Care! "

Hats off to you and the Singapore Team 🇸🇬.  The oppositions are undermining the security and social safety net during this critical time and we must not let them thrive. Especially Chee Soo Juan for decentralise the unity we have amongst Singaporeans during this difficult time, and Pritam Singh making our country and people vulnerable by asking “how deep are our reserves”. Metaphorically, we wouldn’t want our country and people to be vulnerable in this ‘big fish eats small fish’ world.   Majulah As One Singapore 🇸🇬. Onward and Forward."

A plethora of containment, financial assistance, etc measures have been announced and implemented. Thank you.  Unfortunately, there are still people and organisations not complying with the measures. Whilst some may have very good reasons for doing what they did, there are those who were irresponsibly YOLOing, making the last buck, etc.  Enforcement is never easy. Proper investigations (that take up our already stressed resources) are needed. And there are social, political, etc implications in enforcement.  We trust that you and your team are already looking into taking to task those who acted wrongly or irresponsibly. There is a risk of the population seeing non-compliant or (where it is gray under the existing measures) irresponsible people and organisations ""escaping"" with it, and being swayed to follow the non-compliant or irresponsible acts.  Broad and repeated communications have been made. Warnings have been issued. It may well be time to quicken the step up to enforcement and prosecution, and firm discussions (where the act is gray under the existing measures, but clearly detrimental to management of the current crisis). And to communicate this to the population.  Not that any ill is deliberately wished on any person or organisation, or scapegoating is intended."

One big mistake was letting in Malaysians after their lockdown. Some of them could be carrying the virus when they came in and could be the cause of some of the clusters here. Now Malaysia is shirking all responsibility to allow them back. Sad for these people that their own country doesn't want them back. We provide jobs for them and now have to bear the costs whether we keep them here or return them. Dealing with Malaysia has always been very problematic, but we have to firm with them. I am fed up with Malaysia for always taking advantage of us. Hope a win-win solution can be reached."

Unfortunately some humans either don’t listen or don’t take the government recommendation seriously. Your consistency which covers Bishan Park, this evening was more crowded above the normal days and to made matters worst, a sudden heavy downpour has every person huddle into shelter like pack sardines. We know well an asymptomatic person can spread and to made matter worst there are no data or contact tracing at any parks or open space.  I hope I am wrong but will wait to see the crowd in Changi Beach this weekend. How many long queues at Hawker center to “ tapoa” food and seek the sun and water,open-air as long as it is not so crowded. The question is how one defines not so crowded.  All it takes is a few careless irresponsible to put an overload on your breaker. I hope your relevant office will consider an immediate Switch Board shutdown rather than a Circuit Breaker. There is only a hope for such sickness and that is to take the bitter pill of a 100% 14 days stay home for non-essentail activities.  A Singaporean at heart."

When we are officially cleared of pandemic by the WHO, then we can start doing businesses with countries that have also recovered from the pandemic. There are countries now that have recovered and are still waiting to do businesses with us! BUT WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE ARE STILL BATTLING THIS CRISIS!  Once we have won this crisis, then we can offer to help other ASEAN countries to either cope with their pandemic or to help their economy recover. Either way a collective effort will always be more effective.   On the other hand if we are battling with the crisis, NO TOURISTS WILL EVER WANT TO COME. Think of Changi airport and SIA. And remember when companies like SQ goes bankrupt, there will no longer be another SQ. It will be gone forever.  THE VALUE OF THE SINGAPORE DOLLAR DEPENDS ON THE SERVICES WE CAN PROVIDE TO OURSELVES AND TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.   So while exercising circuit-breaking policies, think also how you can recover your businesses when this pandemic ends. Signal to the Chamber of Commerce or the ministry or any organisation your needs. The communication channels between the businesses and the government should all the more be open during this period because the government can help build and rebuild basic infrastructure so that companies can stand to benefit. THINK OF IT AS A LIGHTHOUSE FOR THE MISSING SHIPS AS THE STORM COMES SUDDENLY! THE LIGHTHOUSE WILL NOT HELP YOU IF YOU DO NOT SOUND YOUR DISTRESS!"

31752241,25873600,Tan Cheng Kiat,"Apr 7, 2020","I like to share my view on how Singapore can get to normal after the circuit breaker.  I believe the simple solution which China has been showing the world is to wear mask.  They are getting back to work, socializing and sightseeing with masks.  The simple rationale which has been floating around for quite some time is that if mask can protect medical staffs who are in intimate contact with patients then it should work in working and social environment.  There is nothing complicated about the rationale of wearing mask.  The reason for government not advocating mask wearing was insufficient supply and that was true.  But the picture now is different.   It is clear that the current situation is going to persist for quite some time and our economy cannot afford to wait for vaccine or effective drug treatment.  The simple answer is therefore mass production of mask.  I believe Singapore has the engineering capabilities to just do that. "

Our entire family can vouch for the true professionalism of the medical staffs in Singapore.   People in many other countries are not so lucky. When I was admitted to hospital, in a country I won't mention, the semi-religiously attired nurse there hesitated to treat me using gloves, even many years before the Covid-19 outbreak.

This is not yet another debate about whether breakfast is the best meal of the day. ""Remember to bring your own containers"" - This is NUTS!

31732812,86067880,Javen Tan,"Apr 6, 2020","Dear PM, I sincerely hope our government can imposed compulsory stay at home for all unless it’s for groceries and essential work, as well compulsory mask wearing when going out.  The reason for doing so is that although majority of Singaporeans will stand together and stay at home, there’s still minority of residences here whom will not co-operate without proper enforcement. This group of people are risk takers, thus they have a higher chance of getting infected and transmitting it to others. Without proper enforcement, we will be wasting this precious circuit breaker period, and eventually extending it, further disrupting our economy and this will increase our jobless rate. It will not be possible for our government to consistently support us with solidarity packages as this will eventually empty our reserves, we need to first stop the local transmissions, enhanced our immigration process - compulsory 14 days quarantine in dedicated hotels for all  coming into Singapore, which will be paid by themselves. Once we stop all local transmission, and prevent import transmission from spreading locally, we can then boost our economy by becoming a safe heaven and S.E.A command centre in fighting this virus. "
31732812,86067880,Audrey Lim,"Apr 6, 2020","Yes totally agree.  Please help to spread and remind Singaporean to do their part.

However if the government can also impose regulation to prevent employers to take advantage of the current Circuit breaker  to freeze the salary of employees , that will definitely ease a lot of employee’ worries &  fear of losing their monthly income  . 🙏🏻 with today’s new Budget to help the employers with 75% of their first 4.6k wage, the employer should also do their part to support their employees too & not simply throw the full responsibility to the government ."

31732812,86067880,Manik Bhandari,"Apr 7, 2020","Dear PM Lee, I had a suggestion for your consideration. Given the circuit breaker measures, most families would like to order provisions online, however most online services are now not able to service the demand as they are short of staff in their warehouses as well as for delivery. On the other hand, we have enterprises like Changi airport and SIA which have staff who are currently available. Can we consider redeploying some of the staff especially ground handling / baggage handling to help companies like Redmart etc to meet the surge in demand? We have been trying to order groceries online but no slots are ever available,  necessitating our going out to the supermarket in person, which exposes everyone to risk. If we can redeploy staff (facilitated by government) from businesses that have been disrupted to businesses that need more staff urgently like online groceries, it would be a win win for all. The Redmarts/Amazons will get the help they need in their warehouses and delivery networks to meet the surge in demand, the workers will get employment, and we consumers will be able to stay at home and tide over this period."

31732812,86067880,Daven Aquarius,"Apr 7, 2020","I would like to suggest that the Singapore Goverment persuade the WHO under the leadership of UN, take the lead in commencing a World wide lock down of one month or an extension if necessary for all nations instead of individual nations or States planning their own lock down which could be counterproductive.  Nations or states  that have completed their lock down could still have imported cases of covid-19 because other nations or states have yet to lock down or are not in full lock down. A very good example is the US where different states are in different stages of lock down or some are yet to lock down. Those nations or states that have completed their lock down will be hit by second or more waves from imported cases because they have not got their act together .  The World should come together as one & fight the invisibel enemy. We must be prepared to have several lock downs until we have small clusters which can be managed by contact tracing. By doing so, we might slow down the rate of infection & mortality while waiting for the covid-19 vaccine to be ready.  Please spread the message, so that we can have a World 🌍 wide lock down for 1 month or so & save more lives from Covid-19 🙏🏼"

As if the world revolves ard them n owes them a living. Quite a few of these are also hard drinkers, smokers n gamblers. Fast to complain that they have no cash for essentials, when they are happy to spend obscene sums on their vices and narcissistic lifestyle.

31732812,86067880,Fong Fattchee,"Apr 6, 2020","Decades ago, my Boss, then 2LT Barnard Tan Cheow Han, told me not to charge machine guns without having a good plan. He then made me do it again and again with my section - just so he would not have to convince me again.  I would like to know a good plan is in place before making a dash across open ground.  The mandatory closing of business premises across the economy w/o discrimination when the conditions are not yet in place for success seems like a call to line up firms to be machined gunned without a fair chance of success.  Let's be fair. Availability of bandages is not a good plan.  Closing of businesses is no auto-magical plan. It will take methodical organisation and monitoring of measures to operationalize the lowering of the R number by lowering the number of unsafe interactions - flattening the curve.  We how the Chinese gov operationalized their quarantine wrt to the limited number of times you get to go to the store to buy food with a mask and the registration of that person each time for each trip out via condo security and village committee.  Last Saturday ~50% of the people out exercising, buying food in scrums and using public transport were unmasked, they go home and marinate with their unprotected family in a close, trusted and intimate setting.  There are simplified SIR models wrt to central places and show big effects of small differences.  There are second-order effects when the asymptomatic family members take their turn going out to exercise using the same lifts or stairwells.  I have walked and inspected worker dorms and know the sights and smells well.  Prep the ground, get people to mask up in public then throw the ""close business premises"" breaker if still necessary.  We do not understand why do one w/o the other. Please explain to us so that we can understand the actions taken by the Gov."

31732812,86067880,Tan Kok Tim,"Apr 6, 2020","S$600 for all adult Singaporeans, and I asked why no option button for those who choose not to receive it?    Some did not understand why I had asked for the opt out button.     If some rich, generous, and kind hearted Singaporeans have the button to opt out, and let's.say some 100,000 rich persons opt out x S$600 = S$60m.    From this amount of S$60m not given out, it will mean the Govt has an additional S$60m to give to those in the lower-income groups.    But now with no button to press, the S$60m will be paid out.    No S$60m saved, it means the Govt does not have S$60m to give it to the lower-income groups.    MOF must have their reasons and for whatever reasons not to have the button to save the S$60m, and to give more to the lower-income groups.    I hope all can see the bigger picture that with this opt out button more dollars can flow in the down and down direction."
