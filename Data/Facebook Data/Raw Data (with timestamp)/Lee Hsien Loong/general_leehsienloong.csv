Please do not invite thousand of people here when it's still a wildfire in the rest of the world. Testing is unlikely to be 100% accurate and does not identify carriers who are still incubating the virus. Already there are cases of people who completed their quarantine and then turn up positive after 14 day quarantine. Are we really going to put our population at risk after going through a hard CB last year?"

It is good to see political leaders championing to tackle climate change, including positive results of international treaty and global cooperation.  But we know climate change is largely due to certain human activities such as massive deforestation and relentless use of fossil fuel in large quantities, so we really need scientific solutions to reduce carbon emission, develop alternative and sustainable technologies, products and related services."

40202066,4708680,Jacob Van Ram,Jan-29,"Fast forward to 6.00 in the video. To listen   This is my view,   The truth of the matter is when export remains the most important rule for all economies, access to open markets has to expose people to work in the manufacturing sector or create their own manufacturing systems to build their own fortunes within a lifetime. While people remain in the franchise and given the opportunity to forge a new system in other lands beyond within a single ecosystem to move beyond common borders or boundaries. This becomes especially significant when too many people are set in the service industry and there is a reduction in supply for people to remain employed in their adult to senior years.  https://youtu.be/SOA2wggd0tU"

If the police need access to the TT information, they should seek an legal approval from the court. This way, the process will not be abused.  Case in point: if a high ranking police officer wants to stalk a person for his own personal agenda, he would have to go through an additional process, and this will deter him from abusing the system.  In any case when there is a criminal investigation, the court will likely to be involved, and the court has a part to say which information will be useful for its legal process. "

39520001,21529330,Adrian Chew,Jan-05,For those hankering for PM Lee and the Cabinet team to take the vaccine first...I only have this to say :  The UK MHRA has approved the vaccine but these people are not satisfied.  The US FDA has approved the vaccine but these people are not satisfied.  Our own HSA and medical experts have approved the vaccine and still these people are not satisfied.  Only when PM Lee and company are vaccinated then they are satisfied.  PM Lee and the Cabinet team should be pleased and honoured that they are more trusted than the leading medical regulatory agencies of the world. 😉

Only then will my family allow my grandmother & other elderly family members or relatives to take approved vaccines.  This is to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that these approved vaccines have a very high efficacy success rate against COVID-19 in Singapore. Of course no science is perfect. But if Singapore’s political leadership & doctors in the COVID-19 Taskforce are in unison, then take the vaccines in a live broadcast."

39520001,21529330,善俊儒,Jan-06," 1.如果我們每天在谷歌鍵上“輝瑞疫苗”然後選“News""，我們會看到來自各方的對疫苗的負面報導的消息，可以說這些負面消息是令人高度擔憂的 2.負面的報導真令我們擔憂，擔憂什麼呢？ 3.我們會擔憂我們的內閣成員領導層帶頭在注射疫苗後出問題的 4.在此關鍵時刻，我們任何一位領導層都不能出問題的 5.任何一位領導層出問題都會對新加坡帶來影響的，尤其是身為一國之首的總理您！ 6.因此，我提議，內閣成員要時時留意跟進注射疫苗的進展才決定要不要讓內閣成員帶頭。 7.疫苗不穩定，出問題，領導人改變初衷，暫時不要帶頭注射疫苗，一般人民如果知道這些疫苗的負面消息，他們會理解體諒的 8.至少我週圍的一群朋友，他們都會理解的。 9.相反的，當注射疫苗出問題，民眾會質疑政府的決定的。 9.新加坡過去一年對抗冠病的成就和經驗是大家有目共睹的 10.我們不要急著在疫苗上，匆忙作決定。 11.根據各方面的報導，中國的疫苗似乎比較穩定，因為中國制造疫苗是依據傳統的方法制造的 12. 我們目前所要做的是，即使病種已經改變，我們也有能力控制社區感染群的增加，這才是關鍵 13.新加坡過去一年的經驗和努力，一定能夠做到的。 14.根據報導，英國已經發明了一種口服疫苗，服後能盡速的產生抗體 15.據報導說，這口服疫苗將於3月上市 16.以新加坡的醫藥科技，新加坡是可以往這方面突破的 17.血清撿驗法就是新加坡首發明的。 "

Though not out of the woods yet but we now can see the light at the end tunnel.  The entire year of 2020 has been a challenging year unprecedented in recent history. 2020 is a year we will never forget.   While most of us have to endure discomfort and inconveniences stemming from a drastic change in our lifestyle, others suffer the greater hardships in life after losing their source of income or even their loved ones. However, no matter what the pandemic has taken from us, we have all gained something from this massive disaster.  In fact, it is a year with great opportunity for us to learn many crucial things in our life. It's a year has taught us Patience, Empathy, Knowledge of Survival in facing challenges, adapted to unforeseen situation like never before.  When the going gets tough, the tough gets going. We are seeing discipline, resilience, courage, understanding and care for each other amid this colossal crisis more than any other times in the past. We thought out of the box for survival, economically & mentally.  We maximized the usage of technology in our daily life. We never thought before that we could chit-chat with our friends, colleagues & loved ones via Zoom & always got connected. We never thought that we could work from home to carry out our works effectively throughout the weeks without going back to office.  We had the chance to accumulate these crucial life lessions in just a year. 2020 is a great teacher    We recognise that every changing colour of a leaf is beautiful, every changing scenery of a season has beautiful view & thus every changing situation of life is meaningful.  So we never grumble or complain. Instead, we remember that Pain is a sign that we are alive, facing problems are a sign that we are strong, indefatigable & tenacious.  We will continue acknowledge these truths & condition our heart & mind, our live will be more meaningful, different & worthwhile.  This pandemic has shown us that we are capable of adapting to changes in life and moving on together as one.  Just a few more hours, we are ushering into year 2021.  Let us usher into 2021 confidently with same mindset & attitude.  Wishing you & your team a blessed & joyful year ahead. Cheers. Bobby, Resident from Pasir Ris"

38921797,7511370,Leo Boon,"Dec 13, 2020","Dear Prime Minister,   Thank you for your strong political leadership that led us as a society and as a nation out of those 9 dark months of COVID-19.   Collectively, we have reduced its spread in our country.   Now, there is more hope ahead as we rebuild our lives.    As we emerge from this dark tunnel with hope at its exit, we must help a small group of fellow Singaporeans stuck in despair.  This group is affected by Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s recall of the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) payouts that MOM had given earlier (Straits Times Dec 12, 2020 page B7 “Self-employed who under-declared income asked to return Covid-19 aid”).   It reported MOM’s letters to such SIRS recipients stated that their employment income for work years 2018 to 2019 exceeded the threshold of $2,300 per month.  But this 2018 to 2019 income was not as far as I remember a criterion when the SIRS first rolled out in March 2020.   Furthermore, many who lost their regular jobs and became self-employed such as private car hire drivers shortly before the SIRS was implemented in March 2020.  They hardly made ends meet with car rental fee of about $2,000 per month and passengers hardly existed in the ghostly circuit breaker period.     Moreover, some recipients received the SIRS payment only after appealing to MOM when their initial application failed.  If the 2018 to 2019 income had become a criterion by then, why did MOM proceed to approve those appeals?       The SIRS payments pulled these fellow citizens out of starvation through those dark months, and these citizens have started to help rebuild our economy.     Sadly, this recall of the SIRS payments casts another blow to them and might drive some of those without means into deeper despair while the rest of us move towards hope.     Also, the above Straits Times report elaborated that MOM did not respond to its queries on how MOM would handle such appeals to MOM’s letters asking for refund.   We must help these fellow citizens.  One way is to set aside the recall for refunds or make a hard leadership decision on a one-time waiver.     Prime Minister, I hope your address to our nation on 14 December 2020 can also cover this issue and let it be a beacon of hope for these desperate fellow Singaporeans.     They are part of our valuable human resource rebuilding our economy from COVID-19’s devastation.     Please help them.   "

His email is landofsolutionsolve@gmail.com and his WhatsApp contact is +2349067952280.  The day my husband left me, things appeared bleak, and the atmosphere was heavy with uncertainties. Everything seemed pale and so I decided to look for help in spell casters who have the capability to bring my ex husband back to me. As envisaged, I went on the internet and as you too have seen in your search for a reliable spell caster, I saw a lot of testimonies of spell casters in the recovery of ex husbands and loved ones. Driven by belief in Doctor Dayo, I contacted him and after explaining things to him, he accepted to face the challenges on ground. He did brilliantly well. My ex husband came back to me within 2 days of contact with more care and affection and promised never to leave me. I will therefore like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him and share this testimony to enable others in need to contact him for his selfless service to situations and problems. Commendable, he shows great courage at taking on the daunting task of finding solutions to practically any given problem. Contact him at landofsolutionsolve@gmail.com or WhatsApp him +2349067952280 and I believe he will help you as he did to me.    https://www.facebook.com/Dr-Dayo-101608578400227/ "

I was appalled to read the spread of Covid-19 in Bergamo resulting in the deaths of so many people and yet the authorities were indecisive. If we look back , it seems to me that history repeats itself.  Look at the number of epidemics, pestilences and plagues that had taken a heavy toll of human lives. It is right and just that the government instil a responsible attitude among the populace."
38617259,27223410,Jahmari Ivo,"Dec 2, 2020","Yes, everyone should learn along the way, when a new outbreak comes, one should err on the side of caution and take abundance of precaution when uncertain. How/What SGP did this time in the beginning were flawed and not on the side of extra precaution, thinking controls used during SARS were enough when reports were coming out from medical sources even if not yet ""validated/reviewed"" by WHO at the time about the infectiousness of this new virus and that there were asymptomatic spreaders."

38617259,27223410,Hujjatullah Sahib,"Dec 2, 2020",What a relief to finally discover that the virus did not originate in Wuhan and it super-spreading too occured elsewhere across the world. Yet  China was needlessly maligned and the poor Chinese lectured to on their supposedly bad management and even improper food habits ! We must learn to not just contain future viruses but even more important learn to contain future stupidities as propagated often by the MSM !

38617259,27223410,Beng Ting Tan,"Dec 2, 2020","Thanks for the article. Indeed we are always learning. We should always stay vigilant and be prepared for all possible disease assessment, isolation and prevention protocols for any infectious diseases. Although all health policies have to weight against the impact to economy...but the medical doctrine of prevention is better than cure should always take precedence. To implement such discipline and regime required to have two critical success factor: a first class public health education and a first class public health communication. Also, once we have emerged from current Covid-19 pandemic we should not leave the public experiences gained to waste to continue strengthen our health system and policy."
38617259,27223410,Xie Mingchuan,"Dec 2, 2020",Learning from experience is a great thing.   What can be greater is scenario planning - proactively examining possible boundary conditions and think about how to address them. That can make us more prepared for something that we have never faced.

38617259,27223410,Katherine Tan,"Dec 2, 2020","I’m glad and thankful that our government eased Phase 1 and 2 as and when they deemed fit. CB’s April to June was tough to get by though. Phase 3 is still .... but it’s ok.  It’s better this way than relax the rules and we ended up with a new wave of COVID (as reported in other countries). If our government has to tighten the rules again, it’s even harder to get by.  I’m sure all of us understand what it’ll be. Slow and steady win the race. "

At bare minimum we can protect ourselves by reacting swiftly as some countries have shown!

38617259,27223410,Steven Lee,"Dec 2, 2020","Afternoon, Mr. PM, sir, you are absolutely right. In real life many of us tends to forget very fast once crisis is over, and as such many don't really learn (except those that always stay vigilant at all time regardless whether in times of crisis or peaceful period).  Many of us always prefer to select the easy way out and take things for granted, and especially so when our government were too efficient, as we can always put the blame to the government (just like many of the opposition supporters love to do).  Sir, maybe it is time our good government must let them bear the consequences for their action and choice (no offence to anyone)."

38617259,27223410,Terry Tan,"Dec 2, 2020","Dear PM Lee, I was accompanying my son to school in UK recently and I am very proud of what our Government has done to regulate our cooked food handlers hygiene standards strictly, even way before COVID19.   I was in a bagel shop where I witnessed a store supervisor clearing a trash bag before my eyes, didn't wash his hands, took my order, and prepared everything without gloves and mask. I had to dispose the food out of not confronting him as I didn't think it's mandatory for him to do so. I had chosen to discard the food instead. I don't think he's the only one who practiced such acts as it's probably not regulated despite the pandemic. It's even scarier to think about those who prepare in a closed kitchens who deliver foods through online channels.   I wondered why numbers and death rates can be so high in some countries? I had also written to WHO Singapore office to escalate such observations and I have yet to receive a reply. I hope G to G can also help to share such good  practices as every precious human live matters and constantly are at risks. Our fellow Singaporeans are also living abroad.   Thank you very much for your attention. Stay blessed!"

There is no clear sign ahead that this virus will end soon. Is the vaccine a cure or prevention?  Is there a medical treatment or medical cure for COVID-19?. However, worldwide mankind has crossed the 365th day and the infection has gone up in some big countries and cities, latest there were more than 10m infection, and more than 1m deaths.  Will this madness go on for another 12 or 24 months, and will deaths go up to 2 or 3m?  What are our plans? What are our yearly roadmaps for the coming 10 years to 2031? Who will ask for it in Parliament?  ======  Mask-wearing…do we see the bigger picture?Is the vaccine a cure or a prevention measure?Will red dot encourage the UN and the WHO to do this 40 thing?  Should the UN and WHO get all countries to cooperate and shut down for 40 days and 40 nights to stamp out COVID-19? The best of time is now for the countries in the northern hemisphere during this wintry period [Christmas, New Year 2021, and the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays] to shut down for 40 days [like in the olden days of the leprosy infection to quarantine the new arrivals until the all-clear signal to let them out].  Now is the time to do just that for the all-clear of infected persons to stamp out COVID-19 and force it to have a natural ending.As for all other counties, those at the equator and those in the southern hemisphere [summer time], all should unite and comply to shut down too for 40s day to stamp out this disease well and good.  Can the UN and WHO obtain this universal cooperation by all countries around the world to shut down this earth for 40 days and 40 nights at the same time?  Time for the whole world to go in hibernation for 40 days. If we don’t do we want to continue with the madness for another 400 or more days worldwide affecting the economy and all aspects of human lives.  Choose wisely to have a suffering of 40 or 400 days, or could be more."

38565966,94403000,Koh Chong Yong,"Dec 9, 2020","Dear PM, I really appreciate the effort by Gov and Temasek foundation to protect citizens and residents. The latest mask really looks good but I found that the filter is really difficult to be assembled to the mask. Please spare few minutes to try it and I am sure you will be aware of the issue. Further more, the filter will not be able seamlessly cover the edges of the mask, the air will take the least resistance path during breathing. This makes the filter basically useless. The previous distribution of DET30 mask does not have all these issues. I whole heartily give this feedback and hopefully the procurement for the mask will make more effort to try out before mass purchase of the masks, to give better products to all of us and to ensure money well spent.. Lastly, I would like to thank you and your team again for all the helps to fellow citizens and residents during this difficult time.."

Thanks Mr. Lee for you and your government who took bold steps to deal with this Covid outbreak and tried so hard to prevent the spread.. I didn't see many countries dealing with the vivid 19 challenges of low income workers who also were part of the countries population as Singapore did... Well done Singapore ...thanks to everyone there from your government to your people... From the opposite end of this world your efforts in handling this is greatly appreciated has an impact on us all. Thank you

So far we are coping quite well but the threat of another wave is very real. This is given the fact that there are public places visited by covid patients, therefore giving the virus an opportunity to cause havoc. So far, our measures are able to keep the possible spread of the virus in the community at bay. Another outbreak would have a severe impact on our lives and economy. Well done everyone, and a big thank you to our PM, Mr Lee, for mitigating the impact that this pandemic has on our lives and livelihoods. You are indeed our savior. "

38476331,11966030,James Lui,"Nov 27, 2020","The government should take this opportunity to re-orient the Singapore economy to something more resilient. There is no point going back to the same occupations and industries - the pandemic and the mitigating measures, such as physical distancing and working from home among others, have changed the landscape forever.  Retraining for pre-pandemic jobs will not be helpful at all. Even the very format of retraining will also have to be changed.  Subsidies to prop up certain industries, like tourism, will not help in transition.  An overhaul of the economy, how we work, and how we earn are sorely needed."

38361351,73115820,Soon Huat Seah,"Nov 23, 2020","Well done and said PM Mr Lee, the pandemic is still very much not under control and is disrupting and damaging the world’s economies. Every leader, government and everyone must realize how destructive a pandemic can be. Stimulus and rescue packages rolled out by each individual state is beginning to loose steam as countries suffer not one but more waves of outbreak. World leaders must come to a realization and work together to bring the pandemic under control. All efforts could be easily wipe out, policies planned are prone to setbacks as long as Covid exists. It’s not when but “How “ should the world open up to ensure that cross border travels are safe. Wonderful that world leaders are more responsible and working towards a better tomorrow. It will take time but hopefully not too long. Wishing everyone a safe and healthy 2021."

Many thanks to both the Hong Kong and Singapore teams for working closely on this historical milestone.   商務及經濟發展局 CEDB  https://www.facebook.com/1904092703194154/posts/2852177781718970/

38019441,9868260,How Ti Hwei,"Nov 11, 2020",This is a great start towards some semblance of normality Min Ong. The government previously announced that travelers who contract COVID-19 would have to pay on their own medical expenses (although eligible to use Medishield Life). Will this self pay for COVID-19 treatment also apply for air bubble travel?
38019441,9868260,Top FanAnne Lim,"Nov 11, 2020","Mr Ong, thank you for the hard work in making the travel bubble possible. While happy, I'm concerned that the visitors are not tested upon landing in Singapore. Isn't it safer to have the Hong Kong travellers tested upon landing in Singapore? Maybe a rapid test like those we conducted before big events? The token apps will only help track but not detect since the test would have been done 72 hours in advance."
38019441,9868260,Angela Lau,"Nov 11, 2020","Commendable delivery in Cantonese, nice touch! Please work on air travel bubble to Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei. Your approval rating will soar and you'd be a gem to many."

37654868,10180660,Jerome Ong,"Oct 30, 2020","Singapore is an island nation that thrives on an open economy. This has brought us much prosperity and placed us on the world map over the decades. With neither natural resources nor a sizeable and strong domestic market to propel our already severely stagnated economy, opening our borders would be the master key in unlocking the door and turning the extremely bleak situation around. A quick test method should be deployed expeditiously which would empower us to open our borders more extensively and get the gears of our economy humming once again. More job losses and closures is a completely preventable tragedy but only if we act in a timely and decisive manner to mitigate this fallout. Government grants which have already depleted a significant portion of our national reserves cannot go on indefinitely and can only cushion the impact in the short term. Make no mistake, we are now way past the short term. May the painstaking hard work and effort of the previous generations in making our nation one to be taken seriously not end up in shambles. It would be a complete shame if we are allowed to go down that slippery and tenebrous path."

Each year a theme is created in support of GHD and celebrated worldwide .   Spore’s support of the GHD will raise awareness of the importance of personal hygiene as simple as just washing your hands regularly especially before meals and after going to the toilet .   Teaching very young children early about hand washing will allow them to form habits that will stay with them for life . Children love playing with soap bubbles and it is easy to teach them through play.   Let’s all be mindful to wash our hands regularly and properly . Wishing all a joyful handwashing celebration today 👏👍🙏
37251684,90879160,James Thong,"Oct 15, 2020","Decades ago, health science was taught in lower primary schools as compulsory subject, we learnt all manner of threats to our health, so walking barefoot was something we avoid, washing our hands before eating,after we eat etc. Somehow this wise ritual of washing hands with soap and hot water has become a thing of the past in western countries.  I was lectured by an African eat with the right hand, the left is for the other end. Guess he does not wash his hands 🤣😂 too.  Here men in gym would walk bare foot in the changing rooms, most unhygienic, they complain about get athletics foot they wonder why."

Civic consciousness and Civic encouragement are to be publicised, promoted and communicated at every strata of our society to enable cohesive  and blissful living for now and generations to come .

37223007,34499270,Meng Tat Chang,"Oct 14, 2020","What is the problem with Singapore?  ￼  Arkaneh Urairat  ·  June 4, 2020  Live in Bangkok know Thailand and Thais well.  There is one place in this part of the world which is too good to be true. I am talking about Singapore.  For people who have not been to Singapore, they may have heard a reputation for harsh punishment with nicknames such as a nanny-state or a police-state. Although it tells you something about the country that it does not reflect what Singapore is really like.  From my perception as a Thai from Bangkok, let me tell you what the problem with Singapore is.  Start the day by going out in Singapore, walk along a spick and span sidewalk under a cool-looking covered walkway from your doorstep to the bus stop or train station to take a clean-looking public bus or train without getting into the scorching sun.  Crossing the road is a breeze on a green man with a numeral signal at a slow pace. All cars stop as you walk, even at a snail pace. It’s the same wherever you are in this awesome Garden City. Taking a taxi at a taxi stand in an orderly manner, no one jumps the line or cuts in as everyone is conscious of one another. Buses arrive on time as expected in a lengthy line, neither double-parking nor conductors shouting their destinations. Passengers walk to board the buses at a normal pace to their delight. No pushing and no cut-in. A very elderly lady inches her way from one end of a bus stop to a waiting bus. With no sign of irritation from the bus driver, only with a smile, she tabs her senior card and inches her way to a vacant seat before the bus takes off. A migrant worker is attended to by a pair of the boys in Blue after the public made a call seeing him looking unwell but with beaming eyes of appreciation. A little girl spilled a drink from a bottle while walking with her mom on a sidewalk, a moment later a road cleaner wiped it off. A pretty lady in tiny shorts exposing her beautiful long legs, walking past the construction site full of men at work, but nobody has a blink of an eye, no whistle, no name-calling. The man rushed back to a cafe to his relief, a wallet he left on a seat half an hour ago was still there, despite being packed with almost full of office workers during lunchtime. All roadside trees are numbered, as are lamp posts, trash cans, and bus stops. An elderly man is walking straight to the only pay phone booth left, and the phone is working. When in Singapore, if anyone has any problem… just have to Dial 999, within 6 minutes, a pair of police officers will be there in Fast Response Car (FRC)… Help is coming!  ￼  Living in Singapore is just like fairy tales and when Singaporeans step out of their country and that is when the reality in life kicks in. Little do they know about the problem of Singapore?  I remember when a fire broke out in Hotel Fire in Bangkok many years ago. Most guests ran for their lives, some scaled down from the concrete ledges at the front, while others from the sewer pipes. Sadly, many guests have been found dead after the fire was put out.  They have found the bodies of a family from Singapore who died from smoke inhalation in a bathtub. A surviving housekeeper who told the man to leave told reporters a Singaporean man said out loud that: “Help was coming.”… Reported in a Thai newspaper."

37200810,38054570,Meng Tat Chang,"Oct 13, 2020","What is the problem with Singapore?  ￼  Arkaneh Urairat  ·  June 4, 2020  Live in Bangkok know Thailand and Thais well.  There is one place in this part of the world which is too good to be true. I am talking about Singapore.  For people who have not been to Singapore, they may have heard a reputation for harsh punishment with nicknames such as a nanny-state or a police-state. Although it tells you something about the country that it does not reflect what Singapore is really like.  From my perception as a Thai from Bangkok, let me tell you what the problem with Singapore is.  Start the day by going out in Singapore, walk along a spick and span sidewalk under a cool-looking covered walkway from your doorstep to the bus stop or train station to take a clean-looking public bus or train without getting into the scorching sun.  Crossing the road is a breeze on a green man with a numeral signal at a slow pace. All cars stop as you walk, even at a snail pace. It’s the same wherever you are in this awesome Garden City. Taking a taxi at a taxi stand in an orderly manner, no one jumps the line or cuts in as everyone is conscious of one another. Buses arrive on time as expected in a lengthy line, neither double-parking nor conductors shouting their destinations. Passengers walk to board the buses at a normal pace to their delight. No pushing and no cut-in. A very elderly lady inches her way from one end of a bus stop to a waiting bus. With no sign of irritation from the bus driver, only with a smile, she tabs her senior card and inches her way to a vacant seat before the bus takes off. A migrant worker is attended to by a pair of the boys in Blue after the public made a call seeing him looking unwell but with beaming eyes of appreciation. A little girl spilled a drink from a bottle while walking with her mom on a sidewalk, a moment later a road cleaner wiped it off. A pretty lady in tiny shorts exposing her beautiful long legs, walking past the construction site full of men at work, but nobody has a blink of an eye, no whistle, no name-calling. The man rushed back to a cafe to his relief, a wallet he left on a seat half an hour ago was still there, despite being packed with almost full of office workers during lunchtime. All roadside trees are numbered, as are lamp posts, trash cans, and bus stops. An elderly man is walking straight to the only pay phone booth left, and the phone is working. When in Singapore, if anyone has any problem… just have to Dial 999, within 6 minutes, a pair of police officers will be there in Fast Response Car (FRC)… Help is coming!  ￼  Living in Singapore is just like fairy tales and when Singaporeans step out of their country and that is when the reality in life kicks in. Little do they know about the problem of Singapore?  I remember when a fire broke out in Hotel Fire in Bangkok many years ago. Most guests ran for their lives, some scaled down from the concrete ledges at the front, while others from the sewer pipes. Sadly, many guests have been found dead after the fire was put out.  They have found the bodies of a family from Singapore who died from smoke inhalation in a bathtub. A surviving housekeeper who told the man to leave told reporters a Singaporean man said out loud that: “Help was coming.”… Reported in a Thai newspaper."

37170745,15021890,Meng Tat Chang,"Oct 13, 2020","What is the problem with Singapore?  ￼  Arkaneh Urairat  ·  June 4, 2020  Live in Bangkok know Thailand and Thais well.  There is one place in this part of the world which is too good to be true. I am talking about Singapore.  For people who have not been to Singapore, they may have heard a reputation for harsh punishment with nicknames such as a nanny-state or a police-state. Although it tells you something about the country that it does not reflect what Singapore is really like.  From my perception as a Thai from Bangkok, let me tell you what the problem with Singapore is.  Start the day by going out in Singapore, walk along a spick and span sidewalk under a cool-looking covered walkway from your doorstep to the bus stop or train station to take a clean-looking public bus or train without getting into the scorching sun.  Crossing the road is a breeze on a green man with a numeral signal at a slow pace. All cars stop as you walk, even at a snail pace. It’s the same wherever you are in this awesome Garden City. Taking a taxi at a taxi stand in an orderly manner, no one jumps the line or cuts in as everyone is conscious of one another. Buses arrive on time as expected in a lengthy line, neither double-parking nor conductors shouting their destinations. Passengers walk to board the buses at a normal pace to their delight. No pushing and no cut-in. A very elderly lady inches her way from one end of a bus stop to a waiting bus. With no sign of irritation from the bus driver, only with a smile, she tabs her senior card and inches her way to a vacant seat before the bus takes off. A migrant worker is attended to by a pair of the boys in Blue after the public made a call seeing him looking unwell but with beaming eyes of appreciation. A little girl spilled a drink from a bottle while walking with her mom on a sidewalk, a moment later a road cleaner wiped it off. A pretty lady in tiny shorts exposing her beautiful long legs, walking past the construction site full of men at work, but nobody has a blink of an eye, no whistle, no name-calling. The man rushed back to a cafe to his relief, a wallet he left on a seat half an hour ago was still there, despite being packed with almost full of office workers during lunchtime. All roadside trees are numbered, as are lamp posts, trash cans, and bus stops. An elderly man is walking straight to the only pay phone booth left, and the phone is working. When in Singapore, if anyone has any problem… just have to Dial 999, within 6 minutes, a pair of police officers will be there in Fast Response Car (FRC)… Help is coming!  ￼  Living in Singapore is just like fairy tales and when Singaporeans step out of their country and that is when the reality in life kicks in. Little do they know about the problem of Singapore?  I remember when a fire broke out in Hotel Fire in Bangkok many years ago. Most guests ran for their lives, some scaled down from the concrete ledges at the front, while others from the sewer pipes. Sadly, many guests have been found dead after the fire was put out.  They have found the bodies of a family from Singapore who died from smoke inhalation in a bathtub. A surviving housekeeper who told the man to leave told reporters a Singaporean man said out loud that: “Help was coming.”… Reported in a Thai newspaper."

Recently, we lost our mother due to dengue fever.  As she had always been healthy before the deadly bite, we are deeply saddened by her sudden departure and hope more can be done to eradicate the problem.  Instead of just stating the obvious fact which we have been hearing year after year to expect spike in number of dengue cases, what we are hoping to hear from the relevant ministry is an effective and comprehensive solution to solve this dengue problem, which has been around for decades."

Fear is the tool by which all tyranny seizes power and this COVID-19 has all the hallmarks of being a false flag.  The CDC has come out and said that more people have died from suicides than COVID. The social media is scrubbing posts which have been quoting the CDC than only 6% of the reports of the deaths were from only COVID – less than 10,000. That same report confirmed that less than 15,000 people died under the age of 55. The Germany Minister of Health admitted that the lockdowns were a mistake. Now the data on the COVID situation and mortality in Germany have surfaced showing that there has “apparently never been an epidemiological emergency.” It is time that we demand an investigation that is REAL and we expose those who have been orchestrating this false flag to force their Climate Change agenda on the world."

Singapore has always been famous for taking truely independent actions sometimes even against the wishes of the major powers. This should be kept up and the true nature of this PLANdemic must be thoroughly investigated by a competent but truely independent panel even willing to look beyond the shoulders of the foolishly-led WHO ! As a small but responsible state Singapore can ill afford to let its future be determined by Illuminati-misled international dogs !

We may not be perfect in dealing with Covid but as we see now in countries elsewhere, our efforts are commendable.  Singapore has little resources, such that our value lies in what we can derive with external economies. While looking after our own, we cannot fall into the populist, xenophobic traps that the opposition like to play  up for votes."

I think in my opinion you need an HR specialist to take in the helm of recruitment policy. Someone who can make a balance on recruitment policy on a National level. May be you could use Jamus Lim as Minister to help out as he has a better understanding of the plight of my Singaporean brothers and sisters

In fact, it doesn't cost much - in relative to the billions we spent every month. All those isolation, testings, business impact etc. Also, citizens are paying for it, not the government. Even if a vaccine costs $50, and we purchase for 5M people, it will be just 0.25 billion. That is nothing compared to the loss of business due to lock down, the cost to test and isolate, the continued loss of jobs. Every month is billions to Singapore so we should get the vaccine at the earliest date possible. Thank you."

Peace and growth can only be achieved if one shares the correct values and beliefs. Our core competencies and positions must be in our own hands, our own citizens.

Two fellow  chinese singaporeans, unlike me, had Fast Lane visas... however despite all arrival covid tests proven negative, both of them were told suddenly that notwithstanding Fast Lane, they will be required to do 14 days quarantine. Contrary to your perception, not a single officer at Guangzhou Airport had any clue about how the Fast Lane works. MY fellow traveler finally contacted SG SG consul general in Guangzhou on emergency lines and is now hoping to get back to Singapore on his originally booked flight on Sunday.  Clearly it seems you are completely unaware that MFA and ICA are also clueless about this Fast Lane, other than simply saying we have signed an agreement.... and with zero knowledge of any procedure."

But, if it helps to prevent the spread of the disease, why not? A little inconvenience does not hurt.   On the bright side, there is less noise and we talk less. Also good to see that each of us doing our little bit and not complaining like other countries. Singapore is small and vulnerable and we need to stick together to get out of this faster."

Perhaps the rules can be relaxed for groups that organize such walks and outings around Singapore. As long as they form sub groups of 5 and keep social distancing during these events. These are healthy,  outdoors activities, keep people connected, engaged and happy, enjoying fresh air and free of cabin fever. There are so many beautiful places to explore around Singapore."
35374008,16322590,Nam Kok Koo,"Aug 17, 2020","PM Sir in your post "" 44% were tired of wearing masks and limiting their gathering sizes."" A worrying cause of of grave concerns.

35374008,16322590,Michelle Chan,"Aug 17, 2020","Mask wearing shows consideration for others. In countries like Taiwan and Japan, people wear a mask when they have cough, flu or are sick. This is not practised in Singapore. People cough loudly, blow their noses in public, on public transport without a tinge of embarrassment and with no regards for the health of others. When covid is over, hopefully we will have picked up a good habit and be more gracious and considerate:)"

My children 11 & 13 are very happy to put on their masks faithfully in school while out of our house.   For me, I think I’ll continue to wear my mask even when it’s not mandated.   The safe distancing & tracing measures are just a little inconvenience. Scan and be done with it. It’s not difficult. Don’t overhype things.   There’s no need to protest or be unhappy.

We believe it is better to be kiasu for this matter as the risk is high for not only yourself but to others in terms of health. Let us pray that this virus will be conquered by all human beings with the right step of elimination. To end COVID-19 will be greatly dependent on human beings doing the right thing. As long as every single human being in the world take preventive measures and avoiding it to continue spreading then there will be hope for the human race.

Yes agree with You that its quite of a no choice for us to take it seriously over COVID 19 and follow the precautious measures in order to keep our loved ones and others in a SAFE NET  as we will never know when it will come to a end. Otherwise if we may get to loose on having to enjoy the Phase 2 of go out with people if it starts to spread again .  Wow !  Thats interesting to hear what the parish priest  Reverend Eileen Harrop had done in such a special way for the partakers to have the Holy Communion. Like this there is no human contact between her and her church members and she need not have to put on gloves when serving the church members.

As for infront of Bidadari I bought few blocks  & you bought another few blocks then you told me to buy all the blocks cos he will buy the property build by drug trafficker when this happen again- this happen previous election & many more.  I also get you to invest in gold bar & diamond for this country (many more good things we bought together).

Anyway don't be upset cos I will always be there for you for this country safety & everyone safety like what Pa told me to do.  Till todate I still hold his word.  Remember to stay away from those who had tried to call o bring us down & not worth thinking of them.  Just move forward & say Allahhuakbar 3 time whenever you face any obstacle &  before you sleep say Ashaduallahillahaillallah waashaduannamuhamadarasullullah 3 time.  Take good care of yourself & anything put your hand higher up open wide & Allah will fulfill your doa.  Salam Aidiladha."

I have approached various folks from NTUC, MOF (including DPM Heng) even gatecrashing online Mr Ng Chee Meng's eMeeting however the approach taken though very thoughtful and polite doesn't seem to address the issue.

Singaporean lives and livelihood should not be held to ransom by PAP.   All opposition parties share the SAME desire to save lives and livelihood. There’s no contradiction or inconsistency to have a STRONG OPPOSITION working with what’s left of PAP in Parliament.   No contradiction at all. But in many other ways, having a STRONG OPPOSITION will make Singaporeans’ lives better. Our voices, our preferences, our future will be more secured when there is a STRONG ALTERNATIVE VOICE in Parliament. "

No money for them even though they paid high taxes every year. Choose people to treat somemore. We are blessed to be born in Singapore. Still many people like to complain government did not do enough. Look at how other countries, the governments just leave them to die. No money no treatments. No money no testing also. Never appreciated and no gratitude, still want to complain so much. I hope PAP will win with majority votes this time as they deserved it.  我与其他国家的许多朋友进行了交谈。在covid19期间，他们没有赠款，没有医疗，没有免费的口罩，没有洗手液。我们很幸运在新加坡出生。仍然有很多人喜欢抱怨政府做得不够。看看其他国家，政府如何让他们死亡。没有钱就没有治疗。从来没有欣赏过，也没有感激之情，仍然想抱怨那么多。"

Only one choice. Vote PAP!  Despite Corvid-19, globally, Singapore is ""the"" or one of the most competitive economies in the world. Why? Thanks to meticulous and hardwork of PAP despite limited natural resources. Thankful for excellent governance and diplomatic relations, one of the world's most secure financial markets, advanced digital society, highly educated labour force, and more.   Domestically, despite Corvid-19, nobody gets left behind! Why? Thanks to PAP!  World-class  healthcare, no shortage of basic needs, including food security. PAP is working around the clock to put secure employment for all.  Many other countries lack all of the above. Most important, a PAP govt is responsible and works non-stop to ensure all aspects of security, not just food security.   If PAP doesn't continue as government, the cost of policy reversals are a serious and immeasurable harm to the sovereignty and economic development of Singapore! And our lives and that of the future generations.   Plenty of other good reasons to vote for PAP.  Your vote counts. Do vote mindfully but not emotionally during the Corvid-19 era.  But do vote! Thank you!  Sharing late evening nomination day selfie. Excited to vote!   Blessings for continued good health and safety.   (Chai) 🙏👌💕"

34000839,66720950,Kok Hua Tan,"Jul 1, 2020","#tanrottenapple My opinion: The global recession downturn already started from 2016, corporations making use of attractive book value to selfishly cover themselves like placing a time BOMB waiting for explosion. The COVID-19 Pandemic is not the main culprit, but its accelerated and faster the process which landed us quickly on the rotten ground. Whether any Pandemic or not, the world recession will still be realised slowly at years, but destruction will be far more complicated with more incurable wounds. COVID 19 could be a plot or a gift that successfully wash cards and reset the order. New round of cards new opportunities, new reset of order new development, new decisions new outlook. It’s a whole new world from now on………on the road of better discovery …better approach …better and ever………"

34000839,66720950,KC T OH,"Jul 1, 2020","新加坡又将举行五年一度大选了！ 坦白说！任何一个负责任和有理智的新加坡公民，神圣的一票是要投给一支强大，而有能力，有智慧和有远见的政客去治理国家。  我们作为选民除了要有基本的分析能力也要很有理智，理性和客观地以不同的角度为国家利益出发点去思考和反思。政府是治理一个国家走向未来好的发展和前进。  历史以来反对党政客，很喜欢说我们爱新加坡就应该给反对党一个机会？还说你们可以爱新加坡，但不等于把票投给执政党！我相信有智慧的人不会说出这番话，这是什么逻辑？  我们是选政府而不是聘请一位总裁去管理一间公司，不喜欢就换，这不是闹着玩的。有些政客是为了达到个人目地和利益或个人欲望说出一些平时在咖啡店时可以听到的声音政治化。政客把个人的私人恩怨或某种原因和国家政治和政策挂钩，我们的国家会毁在他们的手里。  新加坡是一个小红点，是受不起任何折腾，所以执政党政的政策都要步步为营。  我们不像西方大国美国。看看特朗普为了个人利益以他本人是经商人背景的去执理国家，搞得世界满城风雨。幸亏美国是个经济体和高科技大国，要不然美国被他在这五年执政这么一搞，早就垮了！ 如果换着新加坡也像大国一样选错了反对党去执政，很快就垮了！而会毁于一旦。  记得李光耀国父，他把一生和一切都贡献给了新加坡人民，用他的智慧和远见，辛辛苦苦打造出来的新加坡。看看现在的新加坡，现在的繁荣与稳定，人民生活素质不断提高, 发展成这发达国家，哪能让这些自私自利的群体，为了个人目地和利益，就把新加坡毁于一旦。  大家有目共睹，凭良知说话吧。自从新加坡1965年独立以来，每当国家有难或面临新的政策难题时，从耒没有任何一位反对党议员，站出来在国会里发表他们好的建议和意见,都只会默默在隔岸观火，只会趁机找机会捉点事批评或落井下石，全部都是负面的言论和声音。  这就是所为的反对党政客的核心？有为国家为人民做出的贡献和理念吗？这是新加坡人民所委托的政客吗？大家有目共睹，很多事实都摆在眼前，事实胜于雄辩。  反对党就只为了反对而做出反对言论批评，从耒没有一个好的见意和解决方案，试问反对党的政客这种思维会对国家和人民做出什么有利的贡献和远见吗？这能有效管理国家的政策吗？不要再自欺欺人了！  每次大选，反对党政客都会利用一小部分人民的个人不满情绪和个人欲望就大做文章，就直接批评执政党的不是！反对党每次只会拿出同样的几个话题耒发表言论，例如CPF, 消费税，老人退休金，国家储备金等等！标题重复了又重复，在那兜圈子讲到天花乱坠，但从来都没有一个反对党政客提出强而有力和具体更好的方案，只是为了迎合和满足那些不合逻辑和实际不接地气人民的心理诉求吧了！一点诚信都没有，只为了每五年选举打同样的招牌。打同样的口水战，过后就消失灭迹了。  反对党政客说现在执政党的领导人理念变质了！时代在改变，我们每个人都在改变大家心里有数，全世界都在改变，我们不应变会有更美好的未来50年的发展吗？  在竞选期间可以听到反对党领袖重点话题有那么难吗？专挑敏感话题，每次质疑现有的机制在治国有问题，大家想想新加坡可以发展54年，在国际舞台打造出辉煌地位！你说现有的机制有问题吗？你出门在外只要提起你是新加坡人🇸🇬你不感觉自豪，那份荣誉不香吗？  我深信和相信新加坡大多数人民的眼睛是雪亮的，由其在这新冠状病毒疫情齐卷全球大爆发，看看海外政客的心态，素质和品德和他们抗压的能力。如西方大国如何处理国家面临危机！如何不负责任。  我可以很自豪和骄傲的说新加坡执政党，当面临突发事件总会冷静处理问题和去解决並找出问题根源的所在，纠正措施做出成绩来,不断在改进把事情尽最大努力做到最好，真的不辜负人民的委托。当然也有那么一些是不在优惠政策上的你当然这个赞你不会贡献，可是大方面是不是都帮助了很多困难的群众。2赞赞 / 3赞赞赞 🙏✊👏🙌👍！  李光耀有句名言：我花了一辈子才建立起这一切，只要我还当政，就不允许任何人来毁掉它!”   新加坡人民，理性眼光放大放远视野看看比比世界其他国家政策和人民！新加坡国家虽只是小红点小岛国，物资天然资源非常缺乏能够从无到有到现在发达国家，是新加坡廉洁和有自律负责任执政党54年打造新加坡才能辉煌国际地位！ 新加坡全国人民，好好理性去思考要务实，事实求是。 新加坡加油哦！执政党加油！迈向另一个里程碑。👍😍🙌💪✌"

33980840,23587610,Connie Bambooze,"Jul 1, 2020","PM Lee I hope you read this message , I’ve voted and supported the PAP & ur policies but these last four years you & your team have lost sight of the man in the street . Ur party never took a pay cut during this crisis , the team let the ball drop on the migrant worker issues , levies have been collected for years , new policies are introduced and I’m sure will keep on coming to make the cost of living here so high , us middle income families are struggling . Medicare , housing , transport , food are rising , salaries are stagnant except maybe yours . Nepotism is so rampant it’s vulgar . People in office are being chosen by race . What happened to the pledge ? I’m disappointed at how the elderly , taxi Drivers, Nurses , fireman & policeman are underpaid . You are the highest paid prime minister in the world , do u care for our welfare ? U speak of reserves , why aren’t we allowed to manage our own retirement funds . U made a MediShield account , is that not enough ? U look frail , is your team able to run if you fall ill . There are only a few who actually cut the grade . Your standards of minister selection has dropped . The old guard that are leaving were stellar. This newbies are lack lustre . Pay close attention to your people , they are yelling for help . You will find this election , you will have to fight for our vote . Don’t fear monger , you educated Singaporeans, the majority of us are peaceful , law abiding citizens , living in harmony . Now we need a genuine government to lead . The elitism & nepotism has to stop ✋🏽. 2020 make ur ministers work for the people bcoz they are paid by us . Don’t raise taxes & lower cost . You really aren’t doing a good job sir & your team come across as indifferent. Please do more for the people of Singapore not the foreigners . We the citizens really need a hand . Majullah Singapore 🇸🇬♥️🇸🇬"

33980840,23587610,GongMing SunTze,"Jun 29, 2020","Dear Fellow Singaporeans! Dear Fellow Singaporeans!  In every Family, the Father knows best the Strengths & Weaknesses of his sons! Who is more good,  who is more  naughty, the Father knows best but chooses to see only the good side of his sons & loves them both!  Who is to follow the Father's foot steps, the Father knows best too!  The same applies, as I believe with our late Founding Father & Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's Home!   Today, as we know clearly, it is our Dear PM Lee Hsien Loong & not his brother Hsien Yang who is entrusted to continue the same pursuit to lead & chart the Destiny for Singapore & Singaporeans, with the same conviction & same common values as shared  collectively by our Country's past Founding Fathers, Founding & Succeeding Leaders!  Our Dear PM Lee was groomed from young!  He walks the 'GROUNDS' with his Father!  But certainly as I believed, it is not meant to be a continuation of the Lee Family's Legacy but a determined continuation to pursue & write the Singapore's Success Story together with every Singaporeans for the GOOD of our Present & Future Generations!!  A continuation to uphold the same belief that 'SINGAPORE WILL SURVIVE' against all ODDS!   To be No one Stooge!   To be No one Subject!  Our Dear PM Lee has honorably placed Country over Self & our Nation's Well-being over Family's  kinship!  He upholds our State's Office & Institutions with impartiality regardless of person!  But deep inside, from a layman Singaporean's observation, we know he loves his  Brother & Sister Dearly & Deeply!  Without prejudice, to JAKE TEO & LOW SUANG LENG, do you think our Late Stateman, our greatly esteemed Founding Father, our Founding Prime Minister believes & subscribes to what you say & suggest!  Our late Founding Prime Minister 'eat salts more than you eat rice'. He knows who is Singapore's Adversaries who write with a 'poison' pen, mis-represent His Will, & sowing the seeds of discord between his two beloved sons!  Without prejudice, To JAKE TEO & LOW SUANG LENG.  Fyi, I dreamt of our late Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew last night!  He was standing between his two sons!  He had his arms over his two sons' shoulders lovingly patting them; PM Hsien Loong on his Right & Hsien Yang on his left!  To both he said 'Beware of  Adversaries' who divide you!   They speak no truth! But write to divide.  They speak like 'SOMEBODY' but are but 'Empty'.  I faced such Adversaries too when I was Governing!  To PM Lee he said. 'Son Hsien Loong, against all ODDS continue to write the Singapore Story with your Team, together, 'hand-in-hand with every Singaporeans!  Wise & discerning Singaporeans knows what is good & what is bad! They will continue to support you!  To Hsien Yang, he said, 'Son, why are you with TCB?   As Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong has told the public, it was him who recommended TCB's Candidacy to me for consideration!  Why did TCB, distorts & told the Media I had sought him? This untrue & false!  Be wise son less you be 'manipulated'!  TCB is of Age, what is he fighting for? Deflated Ego?  Personal Pride?  Using my 'Lee Kuan Yew's Name & 'Ex-Factor' to enhance his Candidacy & Party, doing it when I am not around to attest to what he said?  I woke up from my dream & realise it was just a but dream.   Realising that PM Lee HL & Lee Hsien Yang are still Brothers after all, of the same Heritage & of the same Blood'.   Press on our Dear PM Lee, count us in!  We hope Mr Lee Hsien Yang will return to his own 'Fold'!  LAO LEE PO PI!  From a Singaporean!  From a Citizen Soldier!  😎"

33980840,23587610,Raymond Looi,"Jul 8, 2020",新加坡有两样創挙每个人都觉得骄傲的，而外国人却非常羡慕的，那就是政府组屋和公积金。90%的新加坡人住在美丽的组屋里，几乎是不用现金来买的组屋。大部分都是用公积金来付的， 以我的经验来证明，40年前我用$7000买了一问三房式组屋，当然是用公积金来付的，当时我没有钱，如果我没有公积金，那我就根本买这间组屋，一家人住了40年，现在有人出价40多万买我的组屋。免费住了40年，还赚了30多万元。 世界上还没有任何一个国家的政府做到这样的成绩的，这全是PAP的功劳。 现在我退体后，每个月可以从公积金领取800多元的退休金，非常的感谢政府替我招顾我的公积金，我才可以安亨晚年。 希望所有的选民不要轻易的相信反对党的一派胡言，他所讲的都是谎言。

Today, I have posted an article in ST, CNA, Mothership, Independent.sg, &  Heng Swee Kiat fb pertaining to Desmond Tan, ex-CE of People's Association urged him to defend on the alleged cover-up that I put forth as below:   *[For Desmond Tan Kok Ming to reply]*  As a public servant, Integrity & Transparency are upmost important!   However, Desmond Tan apparently lacked in this attribute.   In late 2019, the Deputy General Manager of Southeast CDC, under the purview of PA with Desmond Tan as CE, was criminally charged in the State Court of Singapore.  Despite numerous call to him to at least suspend the duty of the staff in view of pending court case, Desmond Tan decided not to interdict his staff, this was in contrast to the practice of the entire public service, and it goes against public interests to continue letting his staff who has been criminally-charged to continue serving the members of the public while the Court Hearing is on-going!   We can't help but believe there is element of covering up and Desmond Tan, as CE, is guilty of that!   With GE coming, I urge Desmond Tan to quickly clear the air in local media, or risk losing the entire GRC to the Oppositions!   I reiterate again that Integrity and transparency are important attributes are expected in public servant and political appointees alike!   Thank you.  Mr Terence Siah Prosecution/Plaintiff"

33889973,87829610,LY Tan,"Jun 27, 2020","Dear PM,   It is really heartening to see PAP’s new candidates coming from various backgrounds for this GE. There are many promising ones, and a lot of capable female candidates too.   As with any form of selection, we may end up with a few gems but it’s not uncommon, some less than suitable candidates made their way through.   Have you seen the respond of Mr Ivan Lim on ST to the various allegations made about him? What do you think about it? I have no direct contact with him, so it’s not in my position to determine what is the truth. However, his statement reeks of only one thing - ARROGANCE.   1. There were many things said about him from student days, NS, even till this date, in the course of work. However, he chose to pick the very, very few instances he felt he had a case.  2. Everyone makes mistakes. There is no shame in looking back on our actions of the past and learn from them. For Mr Lim, there wasn’t any sort of hint that he might have been less than right in some of his actions, nor any form of reflection throughout his entire statement.   All he did was to justify and to state his resolve to  “stay on the course and to serve”.  Can a person who is always Right (unable to reflect) be the leader we can look up to, or a steward of people who is willing to listen and serve?   Hopefully, PAP can take another look at this candidate and truly assess if he is the right choice for the people. If so, please convince us that whoever vote the team for which he is attached to is getting a worthy package and not one where we are “forced” to accept because we wanted the rest of the team.   Thank you.  "

Some loose interest in their studies after NS but some go back to school. So this is a big fear as parents have to go through. Sir don’t mistake me I am not against it but it’s our government duty to give our children the confidence that they will be given first priority terms of job security and for  their future .

33868583,48043510,Thim Thim,"Jun 27, 2020","In these critical times of a raging pandemic, resulting in economic turmoil and social norms being turned upside down, it's great to have a vision like PM Lee for greater co-operation and mutual aid among the ASEAN nations, rather than focus on self-protection and 'each man for himself' policies. With similar historical backgrounds of hard-earned independence from colonialism and simultaneous economic, educational and social development, albeit at different paces for each country, ASEAN nations have come a long way and are making a tangible impact on the world. May we continue to look after one another's back and extend a helping hand to our weaker neighbours or those more badly affected by the pandemic!"

33776233,38967010,Cyrus Phang,"Jun 24, 2020","The government has been doing a fantastic job in keeping the covid 19 under control till the best they could. They gave the people Hopes, easing the restrictions gradually while ensuring that safe distancing measures are strictly adhered as much as possible  They showered the citizens with love by giving us money, supplying us with masks and doing their best to keep as many jobs alive and even gave the people the benefit of doubt regardless whether they shown any evidence of proof of loss of income when they applied for the 500 dollars.   As much as life will probably never be the same as before in the near future, the government spared no effort in taking care of every patient who was diagnosed with covid19 and isolated or admitted in hospitals or other shelters. The government also bear full cost for the medical bills incurred due to the covid 19 throughout a reasonable time frame.  Ministers has been updating the public regularly with regards to the circuit breaker, status of the covid19, reassuring the people that the country will be back stronger than before and always putting the people as their priority   As much as the people are all undergoing a different standard of living, I would proudly say that practically everyone in this country has a place to stay. No cases of starvation to death and jobs though are lessen but still available.   We must not treat this for granted and appreciate what our current government has done for us! It might not be  up to some people's expectation but certainly I would say singapore is definitely 1 of the best country in this world.   Thankyou Mr lee and his team for all the effort and hardwork you have put into this country.   I look forward to you and your team governing this country for many more years to come   God bless singapore and everyone."

33776233,38967010,Allan Tan,"Jun 24, 2020",尊敬的李总理，我是Tan Chwee Guan，在新冠病情传播的期间您毅然的领导内阁部长们负起了阻断行动，成功了控制了病毒在社区的传播，为新加坡人民的健康立下了汗马功劳！可歌可泣。 我是位从事旅游行业38年的建国一代，由于世界日新月异，社会科技发展突飞猛进，有好的一面，然而对我们旅游行业也冲击很大、以前旅行社可以卖点机票，订酒店和组织团体到国外旅游观光，然而因为科技網络的发展我们又失去了很多商务雇客，因为航空公司可以直接让雇高自己網购和订酒店，同时在綱上可以自由的订车自由行。所以旅游行业可说是处在坚难的处境，我们所剩余的雇客都是黄金年华的老人家了，我们旅游业唯一的出路就是组团出国和到马来西亚旅游的团来赚点錢来维持公司的费用，但是有很多没有旅行社執照的无牌旅游社者在组屋吧刹自己组织旅游团到马来西亚和囯外旅游，严重了影响我们旅游行业，由于无牌旅游业者他们不用费用，不用花费一年六千多元的会计師费用和店铺租金，工積金，旅游保险费，雇员薪金等等，所以团费价格很烂。 我有一点建议，承望李总理考虑是否可行性。 1）所有的旅游巴士经过大士关口時，旅游局是否能够派一名官员在关口停车处有一个櫃台呈上旅行社名单和旅游保险一份，这样不仅能夠知道我们去马来西亚旅游的人民的数量。一旦有人感染到新冠病毒卫生部容易追查，同时也规定向保险公司购买病毒的保險，一旦染病由保险公司负责医疗费用，不用由国家来承担，同时也容易追查和阻断。这个建议有一举二得，帮助旅游行业的收入，打击无牌旅行社，而且对于国家能够知道每一次有多少人出入马来西亚，对维安也有帮助，不知李总理意下如何？

33085738,75871960,Michael Yee,"May 30, 2020","How are can emulate Vietnam with zero COVID death toll. Firstly Vietnamese already using masks for umpteen years when riding motorcycles as their primary mode of travel which is also self-isolation travel rather than public buses. So these effectively prevent mass infections. Maybe our government if they think carefully should reintroduced PMD (Personal Mobility Devices) and also allow these PMDs on the road rather than pavement while shifting the buses lane to the middle lane and only filter to the left when stopping for the few passengers instead. Likewise, the SMART super long buses are actually quite empty wasting public funds and we should now focus on using mini-vans like in Hongkong. Generic routes are considered inefficient nowadays. With mobile Apps passengers can book the travel in advance and regional mini-vans will use AI or databases SQL to match their destination and pickup times to optimize fuel and costs.  https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/29/a...hnk/index.html"

Tôi cũng cảm ơn Thủ tướng Việt Nam Nguyễn Xuân Phúc vì Việt Nam đã hào phóng quyên góp khẩu trang và bộ dụng cụ thử nghiệm cho Singapore.  Chúng tôi đồng ý rằng trong đại dịch COVID-19, chúng tôi phải tiếp tục tăng cường hợp tác và giữ cho thị trường mở và chuỗi cung ứng được kết nối. Rất vui vì chúng tôi đang tăng cường hợp tác trong thương mại nông nghiệp để cung cấp gạo và các sản thực phẩm khác. Chúng tôi cũng sẽ thảo luận mở lại biên giới cho du lịch thiết yếu một cách an toàn và dần dần, khi thời điểm thích hợp.   Singapore cũng sẽ tiếp tục hỗ trợ Việt Nam trong nhiệm kỳ Tổng thư ký ASEAN 2020. Tôi mong muốn làm sâu sắc thêm mối quan hệ tuyệt vời của chúng tôi. - Chủ tịch nước Singapore Lý Hiển Long.

I even plot a daily graph to report the trend every day. I did this since April. Though the locals are on average is abt 10/day I shud say it's quite manageable. But I couldn't find report of their whereabout of these cases. Qstns always appears asking how many more FWs In Dorm to be screened. And how long more to go in order the public will feel more confident. Trust you can help to enlighten us. Thank you Mr PM."

To save workers is to save the employers or the companies, otherwise ppl are not sick but gradually starved to death. To emerge stronger later is to ensure our present survival first. The businesses are either suffering or collapsing, It would have been a economic catastrophe if you expect a close to zero community infections for a few days before you lift up."

32499977,35062910,Harminder Singh,"May 8, 2020","Dear Pm Lee, I am an advocate for the CB, and believe materialism can not be put in front of humanity. I know about Singapore's reaching out to many pharmaceutical companies and our investments in them so that Singaporeans get the first vaccines when they are available. However, our FW's are now sequestered and receiving their due care, and, businesses are suffering, albeit, there is evidence from Germany of a second wave. It maybe be prudent to be patient and err on the side of safer model. Another pet peeve of mine is petrol prices. This is fundamental to our cost of living, and, in Australia prices have dropped to reflect the fall of oil prices but not in Singapore, nor are our petrol taxes been increased, so why are petrol kiosks allowed to possibly profiteer?"

32499977,35062910,Samuel Goh,"May 8, 2020","Slow and surely strategy may be the best, to balance human safety and economic survivability.. I believe our ministerial team briefed today the approach using testings, tracking using sensors, wearing mask, social distancing etc to manage safety risks..., and is in correct direction as most  countries fighting the CoVid19 war is doing....   To safe jobs, companies can adopt a win- win approach by negotiating salary (with government subsidies) adjustment with employees instead of making them redundant,  and readjust the salary back once the economy goes back .  I hope the government will brief the public soon, on the schedule and sequence how the various businesses are to be open, once the plan is ready."

32499977,35062910,Chang Chang,"May 11, 2020","Dear PM, I learned today the new cases came down to 486 but it’s because one of our labs is not working.  This means if we had more testing capacity, we would find more cases.  I also learned today that the UK has a similar problem... their labs are too slow and as a result, they sent 50,000 samples to the US for testing.  I really think we should collect a lot more test samples from the dorms and ask Korea for support to test some of the samples for us.  As we ramp up to 40,000 tests a day, and if Korea can help us to test quickly, say, 100,000 in the next couple days, we should be able to isolate all the infected.  Today, there are still hundreds and hundreds of infected foreign workers in the dorms not showing symptoms yet and they continue to spread the virus.  Sending samples to Korea for testing while we ramp up our capacity is the best way to quickly isolate all the infected."

May we who have to cancel our trips remember those with no place to go. May we who are losing our margin money  in the tumult of the economic market remember those who have no margin at all.

After few occasional paranoid run and hoarding of essential items, we have proven that our 2 step ahead strategy (as mentioned by Minister Chan CS) did not failed us again. We live up to our name that we maintained our port open despite the severity of CoVID-19 is another milestone that we honoured what we signed and agreed with our trading partners too.  Here, my family and myself would like to expressed our heartfelt gratitude to our government and all our unsung heroes.🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏"
32499977,35062910,Elaine Teoh,"May 10, 2020","Sir please use what we know about Covid19 to prepare post circuit breaker - namely very infectious esp due to asymptomatic spreader. Please look into how public activities can be protected after circuit breaker.   Example MOE needs to give face masks so students are safe. Hand sanitizer at entrance of each classroom. Staggering of school start times within a zone. Social distancing in classroom No CCA  Extra hygiene & disinfecting of public toilets.  MRT & Buses fitted with UVC lights that can disinfect vehicles for 20min each time at interchange. Limit the number of people in each carriage.   Canteens hawker centres sprayed with special disinfectant. . Businesses that can allow workers to work from home must still do so.  Allow for priority EARLY testing for vulnerable eg. elderly, pregnant, those with pre-existing illness like cancer asthma heart illness. Also earlier testing for those who continue with symptoms by day 6 of infection & availability of testing at polyclinics. Germany and Korea already experiencing new cases post lockdown - we need to quickly learn from their mistakes."

My family member is currently staying at Swissotel The Stamford Ram 1056 and she is experiencing difficulty in breathing due to an allergy to smoke. Yes, since yesterday she could smell cigarette smoke several times a day in the bathroom. Multiple complaints have been lodged with the hotel managers but this still did not stop. Someone is smoking in the hotel room and I’m appalled and offended that the hotel has no contingency plan to deal with this. A change of room is planned pending approval from the authorities and it’s been 4 hours since this request was made but still the approval is pending. I’m very concerned about this as smoking in the room is against the law, a safety hazard and a medical hazard to my family member. I ask for your help before any bad happens. Thank you sir "

As also the Ministers, the FAST team,  etc etc etc, even the caterers for all the food for the migrant workers! It is a lot of work literally endlessly, everyday, just to make sure Singapore survives through, TOGETHER. I can imagine because my son is involved and I see him no weekday or  weekend nor public holiday difference, just go do the work that is waiting there, everyday. No day or night working hours, just answer the call and spring to action. He is not at all in health care yet his worklife everyday is about Covid-19 and I am proud of him serving the nation. Many, many, many others are doing their respective roles, the Government is doing its best.  Some media take this opportunity to intentionally make a mockery of Singapore, some criticisms come from within. It is always easier to criticize but whoever criticize may not always be able to do better. PM Lee, thank you for your endless energy to communicate/update to the nation, please have yourself and your Cabinet to Stay Safe, Stay Strong to lead the nation to overcome this challenge.  I believe MM LKY will have his blessings upon Singapore. JIA YOU TOGETHER!"

Here's a balanced article that articulates the economic reasons for reopening schools, but also the reasons for being cautious too: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-01/closed-schools-mean-closed-economies-despite-politicians-push?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=msg&utm_campaign=telegram  Within the article, one argument was that children could be prime vectors for disease.

The 4G team is dedicated, competent and compassionate towards people . The future is bright for SG.   On a different note, many people are suffering because of the Circuit Breaker - loss of income, uncertainty about their job, loss of self-esteem, etc.  I hope that the measures will be eased soon so we can go back to our normal way of life.  I also hope places of worship will soon be open so we can go and meet our fellow members and worship God together.  My elderly friends are suffering mental anguish being cooped up at home.  They can't even go down for their more walk and exercise. Their health is going downhill.  They understand the reason for them to stay at home but it is very very tough for them.  Perhaps they can go for their morning exercise but wear a mask."

32365366,99742340,YT Be,"May 2, 2020","Mr Lee, we cannot be letting off our guard at this crucial period. We still have a number of unlinked cases and hundreds of FW cases daily. It is prudent to stick strictly to our original extension of circuit breaker measures till 1 June. Once you start to ease the restrictions, you are risking our community to more potential outbreaks. Any spike in cases and outbreaks after that will be catastrophe and overwhelming to our healthcare resources. I hope that Singapore do not imitate others in rushing to open up the economy at the expense of residents' health. Even after the end of the circuit breaker, social distancing measures and putting on masks in school, at work or in public areas must still be strictly enforced in place for a period. We cannot afford to be complacent and risk another outbreak."

However there are many imponderables that we have to look at in the future.  One is how to do better without so much foreign workforce. Can we rekindle the national productive board to come out with automation and mechanization just like in Israel and Australia instead of depending on large migrant labour? We recognized the need to have foreign workers but need to tweet it so that our infrastructure and local resources will not be overwhelmed. Thank you

32339167,20004340,Soon Huat Seah,"May 1, 2020","A very good morning PM Mr Lee sir and would like to wish everyone a healthy and happy May Day. The world is currently battling against a common enemy that has swept havoc across the globe. Every government, businesses, educational institutions, religious organizations and communities must work hand in hand to put a curb to covid 19. As long as any country has an outbreak, the threat of it spreading to others will always be there because we are very much globalized. Cross border exchanges and traveling is unavoidable. Every effort by individual country will eventually add up to become a global effort. It is to nobody’s advantage if any country is left behind in this battle. It requires everyone to do the right things right. Singaporeans have tuned in to our PM’s May Day rally and heard your call, the call for all Singaporeans to understand current situations, a call to put individual differences aside and to work together. We may not have been perfect but we certainly can learn and be better. Yes, PM Mr Lee sir, we will work with you and are confident that you will guide us through this pandemic and future challenges.Our former PM LKY said “ Each step we take is to open avenues for ourselves and our children’s future.” Do it not only for ourselves but also for future generations."

Since the epidemic of this corona virus is treating everyone equally without discriminating between rich and poor.  And the medical services that are being provided by a citizen are also being provided by a foreign worker.  Moreover, the government is very sincere in this regard.  The government has also confirmed three more issues such as monthly salary, food and medical care.  So I once again extend my heartfelt greetings and congratulations to the Government of Singapore.  I am grateful for their love."

They told us life is forever a learning process. Yes, old jobs may diminished. But in the midst of all these, new opportunities will appear. We just have to be open to new opportunities & be open-minded to learn new skills. Who knows, we may love the new jobs available. Who says Singapore has no resources? Our hardworking people are the best resources. When GOD closes one door, he will open another door for us. HAPPY LABOUR DAY TO EVERYONE! 🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👏👏👏🥰🥰🥰🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬"

Need to compete for job employments in our own homeland. Foreigners r here to tap on our infrastructures; fantastic business, health,  education  & safe environment but not for charity & deeds.  Hence it shd be win-win situation. However, too much glorification on the foreigners, especially the PMETs,  hv turned most of them into ungrateful & entitled lot, so much so that Singapore owes them a living. This is the time to consolidate and take care of Singapore Citizens first. Pls groom our locals and hv priority given to Singapore Citizens. Many haughty PRs r here with great retirement plans to return to their native lands. Nevertheless, I shall still rally behind you.

My sister who is a singaporean age 60 has married to an American national age 69. Her request is for her & her husband to stay in singapore on LTVP.  Many appeals have been rejected.   1) Do you expect her to risk COVID19 by traveling to america with her husband during this time when his 90 day tourist visa expires on 15th May?  2) Do you expect them to be separated from her husband?

It's going to be a long long wait, at least till the whole world is clear and beyond, before tourists are allowed in again. As a guide I've acquired skills in communication, patience, people management. I'm healthy, active physically and mentally. I was rejected when I applied for social distancing ambassador job due to my age. Who do I turn to? Even NTUC, of which I'm a member in Chapter, is of no help. On top of that they keep on asking paper after paper to qualify for the fund despite knowing in a free lance guide registered with them. Can there be a re - consideration of age factor pls. I wish to contribute in any service during this tough time. I believe there are many like me above 60's affected similarly. This PG needs a way out. I do not plan to retire from my profession as my years of personal experiences witnessing events unfold before me from the 1950s are an asset I don't want to keep but share. I hope u understand the plight of people like me. You n ur team are doing a great job. Thank you."

32315020,60245810,Bridgette Tan,"Apr 30, 2020","The ""Claps"" & Singing of ""Home"" sessions were great.  Is it possible to do a weekly singing campaign so we all can take part in singing (with torch lights) some of the National Day Songs such as Count on Me Singapore & Stand Up for Singapore till end of CB period...  It will be even better if we continue till National Day, as part of the National Day Celebration...  I think this is more meaningful than having the fireworks as it is costly and a lot of monies had been spent to help Singaporeans pull through this difficult time..."

Many do not qualify for any schemes because of having 2 properties. If income earned last year is really low there will be no savings. Instead there maybe more debts. Now its worst because of loss of income ,many are having difficulties servicing the loans especially if tenants dont pay rent or there is no tenants at all. Even if we sell the property it will be a long time due to current situation. Plus must return to the bank .Even if banks can defer installments but still dont have enough for daily expense with no income.  Would really help if the SEP SIRS criteria can allow multiple property owners to be eligible if their income is really low . Can just look at income level. Many self employed middle income earners are not that rich. Please help. Thank you."

It is through decades of building trust and fostering relationships with their leaders that kept our supply chain open. Like our past PMs,PM Mr Lee has vast experience and has good strong relationships with world leaders that has played an important role in making Singapore a successful and strong nation. You have to be good enough to have the respect and trust of other world leaders. Wishing PM Mr Lee good health and safety, Singapore cannot afford to do without your stewardship for the next few years. "

Today, there is a possibility it might be airborne. Every week something new, eg antigen tests, vaccine development status, our hospital and medical set up changes and requirements. It's alright to talk about system overload, the more you explain, the more buy in and cooperation from the population. Please kindly ensure that dormitory rules are revised. Our workers should not live like this in the future. It is so sad that they work the hardest and suffer the most. If it means adding costs to businesses, that's their problem to solve with better automation and we can help by lengthening construction timelines.

32241726,47645410,Linda Loh,"Apr 27, 2020","Dear PM Lee, I suggest SG should let those healthy dormitory workers go home. Let them go back to their countries . Firstly they must be missing their families. Secondly, keeping 6 pax in a room is too cramped , easy get infected. Let those already reached 14 days no problem workers go back to their countries. We can still recruit them again when situation improved.  In addition, let everyone take vegetarian. Those already infected with Covid19 , those serving 14 days quarantine, those in the dormitories , eat vege , eggs , fruits , milk , cheese , butter will do. Avoid meats , seafoods, fishes , living animals etc. this will build their immune system.  This will save their lives against infected and develop depression. Thank you.  Buddha blessed the world."

32241726,47645410,Alfred Lee,"Apr 27, 2020","Sir, this is good info. In order to further reduce the untraceable cases, I would suggest that the government should reconsider the decision of no need to wear mask when one is doing strenuous exercise. Strenuous exercise should be considered as non-essential and not doing so for the next 1.5 months will not have any impact in a person life. If a person has the virus and by not wearing mask and doing strenuous exercise will cause the virus to be spread to people who the person ran past hence more untraceable cases in SG. Please reconsider...."

For e.g. could the dashboard predict where are the other clusters to emerge? Where should we next allocate our resources to?  For the dashboard, suggest to analyse the the risk factors of death (RFD) due to COVID, from the current medical papers published, be it from WHO or the medical institutions (local and abroad).   The RFDs could be age, disease burden (type of chronic disease), smokers,  other underlying health conditions.  Cross layer the wherabouts of these people with the RFDs against the current outbreak clusters (i.e. ongoing and subsided).   Analyse the distance and you can identify the likely emergent susceptible cohort of persons to next fall to COVID19.   Also consider our readiness to fight a triple war; where COVID is combined with Dengue and Haze. Each war has its own susceptible cohort of persons which can be overlayed for the agencies to identify actionable clusters to do their interventions.   Views expressed are in my private capacity as a citizen. Tks. Sir."

It is always good to enable better transparency as it fosters greater trust between Government agencies and us. We have to fight this battle together.  With regards to feedback, I am proposing a few below, subject of course to the availability of data:   1. Please consider releasing stats on i) Number of Tests done accompanying the positive cases number in the various categories and the resultant ratio of +ve cases to tests done. This should rationalise the +ve cases number better and give us a more accurate picture of the overall trend of infection rate; ii) Subcategory of Asymptomatic Cases ==>  +ve Asymptomatic cases detected / total +ve cases and / total tested.  These added statistics will address the topic of positive cases being a function of the number of tests conducted and give a better estimation of the underlying risk of asymptomatic infections.  2. Also, if this dashboard is to be released to the public, the definitions of the various categories need to be explained (e.g. an info touch icon next to terms).  #SGUnited "

Most Singaporeans are educated and civil enough to understand how critical and tough the situations are ahead of us. Singapore needs to procure medical equipments, testing kits, a whole list of things that are needed by the large numbers of infected migrant workers, daily needs of the population, setting up centers to house the large and growing numbers of infected migrant workers, looking after the livelihoods, businesses, jobs and education of Singaporeans etc. the list goes on. The challenges are even more daunting given the current pandemic situations worldwide. We understand the challenges and the weight that you are shouldering. We are all Singaporeans , we  will stand behind you and work with you all the way. Let’s face this together as a united Singapore. We truly appreciate your stewardship and transparency.

In reality the actual numbers of cases should be much higher than reported. As long as the global situation don’t improve significantly, our economy will still be very challenging "
32225193,11144080,Soon Huat Seah,"Apr 26, 2020","Evening PM Mr Lee sir, personally I think that extensive testing on the migrant workers is a positive way to go. It is crucial that all migrant workers are to be tested. They may have to undergo more than one round of testing just like a water filtering system. People  who are are under quarantine or SHN should also be tested after their two weeks. This is to filter out the infected especially the asymptomatic . It will make isolation more effective and efficient. Such measures will require more manpower and testing kits which is currently overstretch. Everything is always easier said than done. However, if testing is not extensive, it could erase all past efforts and result in another wave of infection. These are just my concerns and I meant no offense.

It is unfair as alot of brisk/casual walkers are also not wearing their mask when using the neighbourhood parks. Then enforcement can be taken against whoever breaks the rule.

Nonetheless, Its also true just how much I wish to be home at this moment of time - but the closest thing I have is listening to the national anthem & humming to the toon of “Home” to stay hopeful & hold vigil.  Sir, It’s hard to sing those songs without tears. They mean so very much to me, and is the only hope I have at this moment.   Please stay strong & steadfast.

Both have: 1. Exactly 4 national languages 2. Mandatory military service for men 3. Huge influx of tourists 4. Very strong financial service sector 5. Significantly higher GdP compared to neighbours 6. A noticeable difference of infrastructure when crossing the bordered in from neighbouring countries 7. Embrace science and technology to be future ready while still having subtle religious undertones 8. Surrounded by countries that it borrows language, culture and food from 9. A symbiotic relationship with neighbours but a massive global player 10. Politically silent I.e. Politicians of either nation are on a person PR campaign but focused on being operationally silent  I used to go to Switzerland almost every weekend for thr four years I lived in Germany."

Singapore must answer and give clarity about how they handled workers of Indian origin and didnot focus on Chinese community who were potent asympotmatic carriers after CNY. Chinese and malay ethnic people are behaving badly with Indian labour workers, who go to missions in dormitories."

32170857,61687440,Ven Lindagala Ananda Thero,"Apr 24, 2020","Dear All Human Beings,   We are called humans not because of our physical appearance, but because of insight that we have. Only human being can think deeply and act wisely. So, the virus is spreading very fast and therefore this is high time for us to think deeply and act wisely. In fact, the virus or death doesn't care which religion, nationality, race and political party we belong to. The virus and death only care about whether we are living being or not. Since it is so, at least now, we must stop discrimination according to our own religion, political party, race or nationality. Just we must stand up as a wise Human being without discrimination to fight against the virus. By now, our main priority must be to stop spreading and transmission of the virus. However, we can see still people look forward and go out to eat McDonald, KFC, Pizza hut and Starbucks. If we do so, it is better to get ready for our funeral. This is not time for having fun or pleasing our tongue. This is not time for us to live to eat, but eat to live. So, just we need to be satisfied with what we have. There may be only one meal per day, but still we can survive by eating something. If we can't tolerate and be patient with it, we will have to suffer a lot and even leave everything. To overcome the current epidemic, we must let our conceit and egoistic ideas go and we must have a good listening skill. It is clear that we are not experts in medical treatments. That is why we must obey and follow the instructions of the doctors' and healthcare staffs. No matter how much power, money and material things we have, no one can use or no way to use those things at the moment. So, let's be united as humans and let's do our part properly. Let's fulfill our own duties and responsibilities towards the society and let's try our best to help our own government, army forces and healthcare staffs to stop the virus and to see a peaceful future.   May each and everyone be wise and have insight to act as humans without any discrimination and without any egoistic and selfish thought. May the humanity arise against the virus and may the whole world be free from the virus, its cause, its danger, its fear, its worry and its suffering. May all each and everyone and every being be protected by the Blessings of all kind hearted people's Loving-kindness and Compassionate thoughts....!"

Do go down to some wet markets and you will see plastic used to cover up all the tables and chairs to avoid people from sitting down to eat during this challenging period.  But is it a necessity to do so? What is going to happene to these plastics after the CB period? Where will the plastic cover goes?   Instead I would think getting those paid Ambassador to go  round and monitor will be sufficient.

32124346,62152550,Patrick Yonghui  Chen,"Apr 23, 2020","The 0.2% Fatality Rate of Covid-19 in Singapore Inspires New Option on Herd Immunity (update 1)  As of April 21, there are a total of 9,125 Covid-19 cases in Singapore, with a total of 11 deaths equivalent to 0.12% fatality rate, and 27 in ICU cases, or projected 0.2% considering 30% in ICU could pass away. Why Singapore ’s case fatality rate so low lies in that of all cases, there are 7,497 work permit holders who are not senior citizens and not living with their families, accounting for 82% of the total. Non-vulnerable groups can easily beat the coronavirus through, proven by German's 0.2% fatality rate of age below 60. These work permit holders as non-vulnerable groups lower the fatality rate and ICU number to a very safe level. This inspired us to implement herd immunity among non-vulnerable groups, so as to achieve safe and low-cost herd immunity globally.  To win the war by herd immunity, my proposal is that we name the soldiers and battlefield to spread the virus and beat it, while keeping our vulnerable in safe places. It is herd immunity under controllable virus spreading rather than a random spreading.  https://www.bloombergquint.com/amp/coronavirus-outbreak/a-herd-immunity-strategy-could-actually-work-in-youthful-india Infect Everyone: How Herd Immunity Could Work for Poor Countries"

Risk of an upswing of serious cases from the older population.  [3] COVID epidemic (FW) – Bring down the R number. Watch out for upswing of severe cases. Do not assume that FW outbreak continues to be mild. Real outcomes only in 1 -3 weeks. Leverage existing resources and discern each dorms layout supports or hinder efforts.    [4] Red flags raised for predicted record dengue cases (est. >16,000). Many construction sites unable to upkeep due to BCA lockdown of workers. Essential services worker not well distributed.   [5] Preventing failure mode from drawdown on hospital beds, nurses, doctors and consumables beyond capacity. Limiting economic damage as first-order goal then completely abandoned.   CANDIDATE KEY IMMEDIATE ACTION:  [1] Allow action on construction sites to upkeep anti-dengue measures with organic workers ASAP or centrally allocated firms meeting up with liaison team from site owners ASAP to handoff-takeover responsibility during lockdown and other anti-dengue actions to continue. i.e. Grass-cutting and drain-clearing. Dengue @2014 rate. We had ~8,000 hospitalizations and ~50 ICU admissions will overwhelm all new facilities.

32124346,62152550,Ven Lindagala Ananda Thero,"Apr 23, 2020","Dear All Human Beings,   We are called humans not because of our physical appearance, but because of insight that we have. Only human being can think deeply and act wisely. So, the virus is spreading very fast and therefore this is high time for us to think deeply and act wisely. In fact, the virus or death doesn't care which religion, nationality, race and political party we belong to. The virus and death only care about whether we are living being or not. Since it is so, at least now, we must stop discrimination according to our own religion, political party, race or nationality. Just we must stand up as a wise Human being without discrimination to fight against the virus. By now, our main priority must be to stop spreading and transmission of the virus. However, we can see still people look forward and go out to eat McDonald, KFC, Pizza hut and Starbucks. If we do so, it is better to get ready for our funeral. This is not time for having fun or pleasing our tongue. This is not time for us to live to eat, but eat to live. So, just we need to be satisfied with what we have. There may be only one meal per day, but still we can survive by eating something. If we can't tolerate and be patient with it, we will have to suffer a lot and even leave everything. To overcome the current epidemic, we must let our conceit and egoistic ideas go and we must have a good listening skill. It is clear that we are not experts in medical treatments. That is why we must obey and follow the instructions of the doctors' and healthcare staffs. No matter how much power, money and material things we have, no one can use or no way to use those things at the moment. So, let's be united as humans and let's do our part properly. Let's fulfill our own duties and responsibilities towards the society and let's try our best to help our own government, army forces and healthcare staffs to stop the virus and to see a peaceful future.   May each and everyone be wise and have insight to act as humans without any discrimination and without any egoistic and selfish thought. May the humanity arise against the virus and may the whole world be free from the virus, its cause, its danger, its fear, its worry and its suffering. May all each and everyone and every being be protected by the Blessings of all kind hearted people's Loving-kindness and Compassionate thoughts....!"

36611754,4308677,Brad Schmidt,Feb-20,I do know how we continue as a country with this kind of debt and no one with the courage to work against it. It is a headlong rush to disaster and the politicians congratulate themselves for doing it😡 I would like to know how I should be personally prepared for the inevitable collapse because the election results prove voters and politicians will only exacerbate this coming crisis
36611754,4308677,Dana Damon,Feb-21,"It's time that the American citizens choose when congress gets a raise and they need to have term limits and shouldn't get paid for the rest of their lives, just the time that they spend in office; it's really gotten to be ridiculous the way they spend ""tax payers"" money."
36611754,4308677,Jesse Torres,Feb-21,"There are no winners in any over taxation because the non wealthy taxpayers will be paying for the wealthy taxpayers tax deductions and tax credits. Also, any elite driven, never ending, multi-generational Government to people inter-dependency will lead to overspending so go to a ten percent income tax across the board and get spending under control."
36611754,4308677,Jeffrey Schuth,Feb-21,"It will be like Japan... zero growth in GDP for generations.  Limited jobs, stagnant income, no potential improvement.   That’s the best case scenario.  More likely.... a major crash.  If the world (China, Russia, Saudis and EU) decide that the $ does not work as the global reserve currency....  WWIII"
36611754,4308677,Jason Haynes,Feb-21,Rest easy people. We never plan on getting out of debt. Just keep printing the money until it is worthless then start a war over some made up bull 💩. 😂
36611754,4308677,Julie Jewels,Feb-22,The left wants to bankrupt us for their reset!
36611754,4308677,CindyTom Rose,Feb-22,"This is ridiculous.  These people...the ones we ELECT should be vetted for financial ""smarts"" before they're allowed to run for office.  They are selling us to the highest bidder.  I say we shut them ALL down, appoint a new government of people who understand how money and the economy works.  2 year term.....fix this broken system."
36611754,4308677,Andrew Hopmeier,Feb-22,They don't care - they only care about them and their buddies getting elected.  It doesn't matter to them about the long term consequences because they will be out of office - it will be someone else's problem.
36611754,4308677,Joh No,Feb-22,The spending is way more out of control at this point that it was during President Trump‘s administration! Way to go sleepy Joe Biden and your miscreants. “We the people” need to stop this administration and their ludicrous ideas! 
36611754,4308677,Georgia Bryan Neefe,Feb-22,Rand Paul was the only politician I ever knew to have an actual plan to balance the budget and reign in federal spending.

31929855,60764120,Chris Lee,"Apr 15, 2020","PM Lee, Sir, you're very nice. You are the best person to lead in Singapore. I believe you can take some measures. Since January, the COVID-19 epidemic has broken out and spread in China. In April, the global situation is very serious. Especially in July, we must be careful to control the epidemic to prevent more serious things from happening. So these few months must be handled well! This situation is similar to smallpox 300 years ago and the black death 100 years ago. Viruses in the environment are difficult to control, and it is necessary to find vaccines to prevent prevention. Action to study R&D vaccines is imperative to development. I hope to make some contribution to this society!"
31929855,60764120,Elliot Jhuen Weng Goon,"Apr 14, 2020","Dear PM Lee, thank you for all your efforts to protect our country in this current crisis. This circuit breaker period is certainly difficult for people and businesses but we all realise how vital it is for us to follow the law now. Most of us certainly obey it's requirements but I understand that there are people still flaunting the current law either through ignorance or by intentional means. In my humble opinion, we should follow the example of UK's government and come up with a simple message directed at the people. The UK's one is: Stay Home. Protect the NHS. Save Lives. For us in Singapore, we could use the following phrase instead: Stay Home. Save Lives. Protect Our Loved Ones. This message should be repeated to everyone by your cabinet at the end of every public announcement through every form of media outlets and social media. By constantly driving home this message, Singaporeans will come to understand the vital importance of this circuit breaker period so that each of us will willingly do our part to follow the rules. As always, thank you for your leadership and commitment to steering us through such times and I wish you good health and safety."

I think this is not a proper measure for the company to do so. They are exposing more people to the risk as well as the family members staying with them.

I moved to HK 2 years ago and feel that apart from WFH, the fact that everyone wears a surgical mask when stepping out of their homes is part of the reason the spread is so low. It is better to tell people to wear masks when they step out rather than specify markets, buses etc. It needs to be part of everyone’s “fashion accessory” for these difficult times. Wishing Singapore the best in handling this crisis."

31852462,8204730,Dawn Teow,"Apr 11, 2020","Why are schools still open to children even in primary schools? I have just heard that some pupils whose parents have been identified as workers of essential services have been allowed to go to school everyday. However, this constant contact of the teachers in rotation and these children puts even more people at risk of infections! Not just the children but the teachers who have families would be at risk as well. I understand that the teachers are rotated to ensure contact tracing is possible, but contact tracing does not mean no infections. There must be an end to this.  You would argue that it is necessary for us to support the families of those who are in essential services but yet we don't do the same accommodations during month long or week long school breaks which just goes to show that these children do have other caretaking arrangements that are possible! Not to mention, the criteria for these children to qualify is extremely low, only one of the parents need to be in essential services to qualify for their child to continue physical attendance at school.   While we worry about our nurses and doctors, I worry about the teachers who are still expected to go back to work at this time when changes can be and must be made. CLOSE THE SCHOOLS COMPLETELY!"

31852462,8204730,Banjo Zhu,"Apr 11, 2020","Dear Mr Prime Minister,  I call your attention to the rapidly rising price of essential foodstuff such as rice, which had risen by 11% since March this year. (From . $625/metric ton to $699/metric ton, source: indexmundi.com)  As an island with neither land nor natural resources, it is a worrying trend that our sources of basic necessities are not as secure as we might think, when countries where we import our usual essentials such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia are reeling just as badly from this plague.   As much as handing out financial aids might assist poor families, it is all pointless if the price of essentials raise to the point where no amount of money can afford. Hyperinflation is a real threat, and there is no sign in the weeks to come that the issue can just be wished away. Also, unlike the 2007-8 hyperinflation, the price of commodities this time is driven by an existential crisis - it is not artificial debt that is driving the price up, but the existence of a reliable supply.  I believe we should call attention to our pressing needs at this moment and consider food and fuel rationing. Put a clean stop to food/water/electric wastage, and issue food stamps. I can only pray that my gloomy predictions are unfounded, but in these days of crisis, the only thing that one can trust is oneself - unless there are sufficient reasons for otherwise. Past performance is never a guarantee for future, after all. "

People with asthma or OSA, for instance, may have difficulty breathing through a mask. If they need to go out for essential services like buying food and groceries, what can they do?  The guideline on wearing mask when going out is too restrictive and does not consider the welfare of these people. I hope the government quickly address this issue what other ways of covering up are acceptable, for example, wearing a scarf around the face, or face shields. And ensure that no overzealous social distancing ambassadors or law enforcers issue fine for such practices. It only distresses the public and create more unnecessary work for public servants.  https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/all-commuters-have-wear-masks-public-transport-even-after-circuit-breaker-period-khaw"

31852462,8204730,心灵蓝海,"Apr 11, 2020",我认为要充分阻止病毒蔓延，应该加强下面几个措施：一是每家只允许一个人出去采购必须物品，现在出去购物的太多，有许多一大家人去的；二是每家一星期只可领取两张“外出卡”，如星期一与星期四，等，不要让大家每天出去买东西；三是有“外出卡”的人，只要外出，就必须戴上口罩，不管在什么地方（除非在自己的私家车内）；四是鼓励国人在家里做运动，不允许在这段时间外出运动

For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience. ...  Good Friday everyone... Respect what is taught to us thru words of the Bible. AMEN."

31821590,58513440,Low Suang Leng,"Apr 10, 2020","it's time to rein in on the virus. CB, safe distancing and whatever you have will be wasted if you do not efficiently search out the virus carriers, isolate and contain them. Please do not rely on PHPC as they can only wait 5 days to decide if to get patient to hospital for testing. Some patients even push their luck and ask for 5 more days.  During SARs time SG had 993 and very effectively rounded up all carriers as the disease had high fatality rate. This round if government don't quickly identify the carriers and allow 5 or 10 days to spread, SG will have a hard time solving this COVID problem. A suggestion though is to set up a group of transporters such as grab hirers/taxis (with subsidy by government for each trip)fully geared with PPE and windows wind down for picking up COVID patients. PHPC is then not allowed to provide 5days medical leaves for patient with COVID symptoms. An emergency number should be dedicated for suspect patients / PHPC to call, and trained transporter to be dispatched to pickup patients at subsidized rate. After swab test patient should be sent back by same transporter and asked to self isolate and quarantine. Once COVID patients are identified, ambulance or trained transporter should be again activated by hospital to bring patient to hospital or designated area for treatment. While there could be a sharp spike of new cases during the first 2 weeks, the cases could eventually taper down quickly once it crosses the peak. The dormitories issue should be treated separately as their isolation and safe distancing are different. Government must quickly provide safe distancing for FWs, identify the sick ones and get them treated  Please help get this done so that SG will not be wasting resources after putting in so much to carry out Circuit  breaker. Please help"

31821590,58513440,Prakash Kumaraswami,"Apr 10, 2020","Sir,  Here are my views/  recommendations for more effective #circuitbreaker and #safedistancing  1. Taxis - Not more than 2 passengers  2. Private cars - Not more than 3  3. ERP increase to operate near 24/7 with 2x -3x rates on all gantries. This would discourage travel. Essential services registered business and professional supporting essential services apply for a  refund/ rebate  4. Lesser frequencies of Bus with alternate seating only. No standing.  5. Trains to allow only seating in alternate seats no standing. Reduced frequencies  6. Travelling beyond 1Km from residence should be registered (to launch a mobile app to facilitate registration). Max 3 trips of 2hrs max per week per address  7. Tracetogether app must be kept ON while travelling outside residence. Failure to do so would attract penalties   8. Those staying beyond 2 km from address on IC to declare else eligible for being penalized for moving around  9. Visitor car and motorcycle to charge from first minute island wide. No free parking for visitors at HDB and public car parks. Carpark charges to double temporarily.  10. Stricter implementation of social distancing in entering MRT, waiting for bus, etc."

31646019,83602480,Khushboo Lohiya Baheti,"Apr 4, 2020","Singapore - then and now Things changed, we didn’t notice how!  The story rolls 60+ years  back- A person named “Lee Kuan Yew”entered the team to screw up as a jack! The game changer, well said “The Father of Singapore”, Changed the “sands to lands” and far much more. Its from here came his dream of making this a “Garden city” Today the nation as a whole comes together  To fulfil as their first responsibility. Cleanliness seen like never before, The “litter free” singapore is yet the core. The laws like “no chewing gum” which today are rare to find, Are the basics of this city that leave everyone else behind! That iconic “Marina Bay Skyline”, That love for “Singapore sling”,music and wine, Those lush green gardens spread everywhere, That master stroke “Jewel” - crafted so fine!! That perfect blend of beauty and science at a glance; Its here to mention the “Rains” of this city That will fill your heart with a new romance!  From active weekday mornings To beautiful “clark quay” evenings From the traditional food court culture calls To those N number of shopping malls From the Universal Studios thrilling fun To the Sentosa’s soothing “Swim in the Sun” Its all so unique Something beyond that my words can speak!  Amidst the current covid -19 chaos that scares Applause for the sense of responsibility that every citizen shares Those amazing efforts of the grassroots volunteers  Are some more things that deserve a big  “cheers!!  Thats why i say  From The Fullerton to The Merlion From The Orchard to the Raffles From buildings to the gardens From sands to the lands More cleaner, More greener Thats our Singapore Rising from a swamp to a skyscraper!!!

It can protect   itself & also others. As noticed that some sick peoples they won,t put on masks, also this virus is cunny....so the best is set rule that everyone must wear mask, just like Taiwan did. 2. Noticed that Singapore is shortage of masks supply. May I know is it possible that Singapore can produce masks ourselves, just like what Taiwan did. I,m a local Singaporean, born here, grow up here. I love my country very much...but really feel that Singapore still need impovements in fighting this Covid- 19."

In that case what's our healthcare systems capacity and what's our testing capability when compared to other nations with similar gdp per capita? Are we doing better or worse than Germany?

And only allow 1 member of the family to go out if its urgent n wearing mask is a must  4th then implement social distancing.

May I take the opportunity to highlight the panic buying at the supermarkets now - management should be held responsible for not enforcing social distancing measures in their shops or premise. This afternoon I made 2 trips to Sheng Siong Supermarket @ 323 Ang Mo Kio. It was crowded during my first trip so I decided to come again later. On my 2nd trip, it was terrible, jam packed in that small premise! I left immediately & very 😡! You & the medical personnel & others working so hard to control the spread & these businesses just let their guards down & may potentially give birth to another cluster! We can not afford this to happen! Please take them to task! Check their CCTV... evidence of fire hazard & virus spread!"

It's not been easy to manage a country that reacts and our anxious behaviours show up in panic buying. There are some of us who are nonchalant, rebels and compliant. I just want to say thank you to also putting yourselves at risk daily to meet each other and discuss the measures to be put in place to slow down the spread and now to really flatten the curve. Compared to some countries, we may have been slow to react in some ways and faster in others. There is no perfection but, we keep trying and being resilient as a nation. Thank you and everyone in Singapore  for doing their part."
31639558,13667100,Soh Eric,"Apr 3, 2020","Dear PM. Just a little suggestion. Singapore is isolated by sea. With this situation, we need to control to town level or even neighborhood. sceen through one by one in 14 days. Even school should stop for at least 14-21 days to ensure safe.  I am in Myanmar. now Myanmar doing the same but coubtry too big. But i think singapore can.make it."

31639558,13667100,Toby Kay,"Apr 3, 2020","Fact is: The numbers show SG is on a different trajectory than before. As a result different measures necessary.  Given this it’s astonishing to see what’s happening in the malls and supermarkets. Crowd control? Social distancing? People have shown they do not (or cannot) stick to the advice. Government will need to enforce (enforcing is not the same as punishing after sth happened - it means prevention). It’s better for everyone. This panic shopping is counterproductive. (Effectively mass gatherings).  Other countries are in lockdown and everything is fine. Grocery shopping, doctor visits etc are possible (even better than before in panic/rumour mode).  It’s impressive to see how Hong Kong and Taiwan managed it without lockdown (also Korea with mass and rapid testing after the initial fallout). In Hong Kong most impressive since the government is a joke and barely governing. It’s the ppl who handled it themselves.  Singapore has managed the situation extremely well so far in their own way and I think they will do the right thing. But I believe there will be measures we have seen elsewhere already."

31639558,13667100,Beng Hoon Tan,"Apr 3, 2020",It is high time we relook at our public toilets. The dustbin placed in each cubicle is not suitable - especially for the squatting toilet bowl. - it prevents one from squatting “efficiently” to ensure the urine doesn’t flow out of the toilet bowl.  Cos wet floor is always dirtier than dry floor. The dustbins used in the cubicle are always filled up or get stuck at the flap- this causes the sanitary pads to be exposed.  Perhaps can consider - getting users to throw at the dustbin outside the cubicle by providing sanitary paper bags?

The picture shows a couple with young kid and an elderly man on a picnic outing, with total disregard for social distancing. This family obviously doesn't understand the devastation wreaked by the virus around the world.

From the last 1 day hbl .. my children are only given online assignments. One of them is having PSLE and one is having streaming in sec 2. If this hbl is only based on online assignments.. the children will be deeply affected on how much they are learning to prepare for the year end exam and Psle. The current hbl is not effective if there is no online learning and no clarification can be done if there is any doubts. There should be online teaching lesson so that it does not disrupt the process of learning ."

This is due to small work station that does not allow social distance among them. Suspension to dine in is to ensure consumers are protected but these staff are not being protected. I suggest social distance ambassadors in independent food chains, larger super/hypermarts. Not all cashiers will remind one to stand 1 metre apart. Some are still not practicing social distance in queues so it may defeat effort others are putting in. If more new cases I'm guessing additional business will be suspended, perhaps wet markets. I want to think I'm wrong about this as economy and some profession, industries are already struggling"

This will hinder shoppers from coming at anytime they feel like it, and this will help staff of supermarkets too.  Today when my husband went to SHengsiong, the cashier told my husband that she is very very tired and my husband apologised to her.  He was there to get 1 thing and then suddenly he saw loads of people arriving to shop for groceries. People had heard rumours and received texts that PM Lee was going to address us, and they rush out of their homes to panic buy, again. So please people, let supermarkets staff have their rest.

No matter how many times you tell the public there is enough - it's a herd mentality to hoard and rush to the supermarkets.  A suggestion to have supermarkets impose a limited number of shoppers entering the stores. It is close to impossible to enforce safe distancing because it's just too crowded.  So it makes more sense to control the number of people entering at a time. Hopefully when people realise they need to Q to get in, some may give up because what they wanted to buy wasn't urgent in the first place."

To my horror n 1st time witnessing it, the supermarket was packed. Asked a staff wat happened n she, looking exhausted, replied 他们怕没的吃。  I'm only buying fish n tofu for tonite's soup dinner😲 It looked like ppl were desperate, grabbed anything as partner queued.  Q to pay snaked thru shelves. Some not even 1 metre apart n staff only shouted to remind. Even bahu (meat floss bottles) were emptying! Eggs were popular.

Close all non essential services except for healthcare, transport, food, manufacturing & financial services. The no of death, no of elderly people get infected are rising. More clusters are emerging and unlinked cases are escalating. This should not be the norm, this is very worrying.   We know Lockdown will not eradicate the virus. But, if we lockdown for 30 days and still apply all the current measures after that, we can break the chain and slow down the spread.  The multi-ministerial task force has been doing a fantastic job so far. However, swift decision is now needed and if we go a bit further I am confident that we can contain the virus effectively and swiftly.   We are all together in this SG UNITED!"

The numbers show how effective your leadership has been, but if there is one area for improvement, it is on the limited access to testing. My story: This morning I was denied a Covid-19 test at a government polyclinic. I went to the polyclinic because I had a sore throat and thought I should do the right thing for my community, and for the peace of mind of my family, and get tested. I requested a test, but was told my symptoms do not justify being tested. I asked 5 times, but was denied 5 times. Instead I was issued with an SHN. So my symptoms were sufficient to justify an SHN, but not sufficient to justify testing. When i asked the doctor why I was refused testing he replied ""If we test everyone it will create panic"". I disagreed with him and said ""what will create panic is uncertainty, and refusing to test people creates uncertainty and is a guaranteed way to spread panic."" I also pointed out to him that by issuing SHNs while denying testing, it creates a disincentive for people to seek medical support. Instead people will wait until they are sicker, and more contagious, before seeking help. I have written to the Ministry of Health about this issue, but I strongly urge you to follow the excellent results seen in South Korea where they have made testing highly accessible, and not denied a test to anyone. For the record, I am not complaining about the issuance of SHNs - great policy! - I am complaining about the denial of testing. PS. I'm PR and have lived here for 24 years - best government in the world!!"

31639558,13667100,Gavin Khoo,"Apr 3, 2020","Dear PM Lee,  ""The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks. This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important role—you’ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others."" - George Gao, director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/not-wearing-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-big-mistake-top-chinese-scientist-says  Singapore Government must change its policy and guideline on face masks fast, before 1,000 cases soon becomes 10,000.  Need to have the flexibility and humility to do so.  Sg sent 20,000 test kits and 3 PCR testing machines to China in Jan/Feb as assistance (CNA report).  Sg could easily ask for and get several tens of  millions of surgical face masks from China in return. Easy production for a country of 1.4bn people, the factory of the world.  Pls do so, and tell the public to wear facemasks at all times when outside home."
31639558,13667100,Karen Lee Huey Shyan,"Apr 3, 2020","Dear Fellow Singaporeans,  We are now into our 17th day of MCO in Malaysia.  Initially, it was full of anxiety and anticipation. Five days into the MCO, we only managed to get 70% to comply. Then, the army had to be called in. We managed to achieve 95% compliance but it wasn't enough. So tougher measures were put in. Road blocks everywhere. No using of highways. Need letters to move around. Only one person per car. Travelling within 10km radius etc.  Though we managed to flatten the curve a bit, we will have to wait till 10/4/2020 to see if further implementation of the MCO is needed.   This is like Malaysia, where other than the urban areas, we have many uncontrollable out of town areas. Some villages in full lockdown. One condominium in full lockdown etc. We have many illegal immigrants. Porous borders.  Fellow Singaporeans, you are much better disciplined than us. You have gone through NS. You can do it. Fret not.  In this period of MCO, you can help your community. Ensure those living in isolation but need help, help them.  Frontliners might need PPE, see how you can help prepare face shields, sew gowns etc.  Most importantly, help each other as neighbours and fellow countrymen.  If can deliver online veggies, fruits and groceries, better. Less contact at stores.  Some of us have community Facebook groups to help connect each other if we need services. If your community hasn't got one, see how you can help start one.  All the best.."
31639558,13667100,Marife Cruz Yap,"Apr 4, 2020","Dear Mr Lee, Thank you for implementing much stricter measures to fight the spread of the Covid-19 virus. However, on top of all these measures, there must be one more that must be put in place: that everyone MUST wear a mask when they leave their homes for whatever purpose. This was proposed by Dr Johan Sharma, a family doctor, in his Youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKNxyzCzHrg).  Dr Sharma said that we need to focus on stopping the virus from being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers. And since it is next to impossible to find out who has the virus if they are asymptomatic, we must presume that EVERYONE has the virus, and take steps to prevent the virus from getting out. So EVERYONE must wear a mask, not to protect ourselves from getting the virus, but to prevent the virus from escaping from people who have it.   This mask does not have to be a surgical mask – it can be any mask, made of clothes, towels, handkerchiefs, scarves, etc. We just need something that can prevent the droplets from getting out. If the people are told this, they will not panic. Instructions on how to make one’s own mask can be conveyed to the people through whatsapp, Facebook and other social media.   Making it mandatory to wear some kind of mask when one leaves one’s home (especially when taking public transportation) will also solve the problem of irresponsible sick people (coughing, having a runny nose) who insist on going out and not wearing masks when they do.  Our government should adopt the policy “NO MASK, NO ENTRY” to all malls, shops, banks, markets, workplaces that are still operating, and any place that’s still open to the public, as well as all public transportation (drivers must also wear masks, of course).  On top of this, I’d like to suggest that the shops, especially supermarkets, that are still open should provide hand sanitisers at their points of entry, and ensure that customers sanitize their hands BEFORE entering the premises, since everyone (including asymptomatic carriers) will be touching a lot of things there. (I saw this being done at a sports shop at one of the malls.)  If we add these measures to the existing ones, Singapore’s “circuit breaker” will be even more effective.   I hope that our government will seriously consider making the wearing of masks in public mandatory, and to implement it immediately.   Thank you."

31639558,13667100,Low Suang Leng,"Apr 3, 2020","Mr Lee, to be honest our response to COVID is weak and reactive. I believe we were more careful during SARs time. At least we got no. 993 dedicated to SARs and there was closure of schools. While COVID is different from SARs, I would like to suggest the following: 1. Only ambulance or trained transporters with proper geared PPE are allowed to bring sick COVID patients to hospital. 2. To set up a team (as many Singaporeans as possible taxi drivers grab hirers) to help deliver essential or necessary supplies to households. These team must also be trained to put on mask. 3. Essential services like mrt, buses water supply electrical supply to continue to operate and employees / users must equip with the necessary protection  4. Non essential services to work from home or only with clear social distancing and all necessary protection are in place to allow them to be at their work location 5. Essential supplies shop like ntuc, supermarket. hypermart etc to only serve genuine customers who needed the daily necessities but cannot do online purchases. 6. PHPC clinics to continue to operate working closely with MOH but the nurses should be strict with themselves and the patients. Nurses should not wear mask on their chin or forehead. I was in one of the PHPC clinic yesterday, the doctor was so strict and was  telling me all sorts of rules that I must adhere to but once outside at the nurse counter I saw a nos. of nurses wearing mask not covering the nose and only on half the mouth. 7. Please set up more emergency teams getting police and army to help if possible to seriously defeat the virus once and for all 8. Encourage local manufacturers to make masks or medical supplies. Hope you would be successful within a month so that you can lift SG flag high, PAP flag high and all Singaporeans  will be proud of you. You are saving lives."

I told a Grab driver today on my way home that during such times, the only place I really want to fall ill in is Singapore. That's because the healthcare system is reliable, accessible. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else for treatment. As a teacher, we have been working very hard to roll out HBL for our students, so that life can be as normal as possible. The work has been tiring, but defintely rewarding when the students appreciate what we do for them. I'm even more grateful to all the ministers working so hard for the country. I think we are in good hands...this is the 4G leaders' baptism by fire. We will all get through this together. This is HOME TRULY, where I know I must be. Stay safe, PM Lee. "

Kids that age are completely unsuited to take online lessons. You would realize that if you have actually sat beside an average kid to attend their lessons. Besides there being too much distractions and confusion, online connections are never guaranteed, meaning that it is pretty much a wasted effort on the part of the teachers. This might work for some higher level Secondary students who should be more capable of self-learning, but not for the juniors. "

Frankly, online interactive class sessions are more helpful than home based learning. At least, teachers can teach the kids online and then they do the work together. With HBL, it is more stressful to us working parents to cope with the office and the children. Teachers give too much homework online without sufficient guidance. "

However, it is also known that the virus transmits through droplets into any openings of your body (nose, eyes, mouth etc). Masks, although not an iron clad defense against the virus, are effective at capturing those droplets which are the main transmission route.  With my observation of Singapore currently, I feel the government should be encouraging citizens to all be wearing masks with our high human density and public transport confined spaces during peak hour.  Although the government have been encouraging citizens to be socially responsible and stay at home when showing symptoms or are unwell, there will be anomalies in society where people do not listen and where masks are the best way we can protect ourselves.   While having social order is crucial, ensuring the virus is contained is as important and I hope with the increased stocks and production of masks in China, more people will start wearing masks to go about with their every day life.  Thank you."

Thus perhaps it would be a good idea to suggest to the public to give these people more physical space, more than the 1 meter minimum, 2 meters at least. I do not wish to create a stigma, but perhaps to self identify, perhaps the government can issue pin on buttons which a person could wear so that others will be aware to keep a greater physical distance. Another suggestion, each MRT train could allocate one car for this vulnerable population."

But if really necessary, such as work, school or even purchasing daily necessities, keep the distance.   If you have the means, wearing a mask can help further (although gov say no need). Imagine this, if we are queing 1 meter apart, and both are putting on mask, wouldnt it better than not putting on one? Of course we understand that it can land on our hands hence washing our hands with water and soap is equally important.

Now as local clusters keep emerging, we should go to PLAN B which is a nation-wide imposition of wearing of mask regardless whether you are sick or not. Since many youngster will not show any sign or symptom of COVID 19 and this will also increase their viral load till it reaches a critical and becomes highly infections to others or starts to affect the youngsters. Both surgical or cotton mask would be fine. In fact we can add another protective layer to both mask by smearing a bar of soap on its outer surface. Since COVID like any other coronaviruses have weak lipid (fat) protective shell. Soap with its hydrophillic and hydrophobic properties will tear the COVID shell apart. So when you apply an layer of soap on the mask (whether surgical or cotton) it will not only reduce the micron holes sizes but importantly to kill any residual viruses sitting on the outer mask. Your outgoing breath in the inner mask will also ensure that the soap hydrophillic properties will be turned outwards ready to pry into the viruses shell should any rest on the mask surface."

Currently not every hawker centers are crowded even on weekend, especially those in Central area, like our premises... equally as a dead town. During weekdays totally quiet, even weekends crowds are low... That's right ! Customer can always eat their favourite foods with safe sits distancing...otherwise most hawkers in those area will be facing a very tough time in surviving.. No doubt the current free rental for stalls may help temporary, but less earning or at a loss may create worst situation for such business... Government can't always give the support, that's just a temporary solution... We are not afraid of hardwork, using our barehand to make a living. The main idea is whether how to encourage the customers to patronise our stall in certain time, with safe distancing and at the same time, need to practice staying safe at home...eat and go, or pack and go. Government now do their part with engaging  ambassadors to improve the situation. Hope with safe precaution measure, people are also encouraged to step up and out of their home in Singapore..."

I have repeatedly asked my tenant and friends to wear masks. However they refused because they said no advisory is released.   Pls check the statistics of Czech Republic. The Czech Republic is one of the few in Europe that has significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. The main difference is that everyone who has to leave their house has to wear a mask.  Mask is available in the market at $30+ a box . This is NOT expensive by today's market rate in other cities such as China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Seoul, Japan etc. In fact , Kuala Lumpur has seen higher price. We have to understand the raw materials price has shot up. We have to bite the bullet and purchase them because life is more than $30. Please enforce mandatory facial mask."

I would like to  share my unpleasant experience these past 2 days. I am dependant on bus and train for my travel to work. These past 2 days - Monday (30/3) & Tuesday (31/3) has been a real nightmare for me.  I was on the bus 70 opposite Kong Hwa School at noon and was happy to note that the bus enough seats to distance myself. However, as I  walked  to the back of the bus to get my seat, this guy (in his 30's)  gave out a loud cough and his droplets landed on my arm. Can you imagine my dismay? He  continued coughing right to the time he alighted  at Paya Lebar MRT station. From where I was seated,  I could see big droplets flying in the air. When I got to my seat  I quickly grabbed my wipes and cleaned my arm. On Tuesday, in the afternoon, I took the bus again to PLQ. This time I took the escalator at Paya Lebar MRT to take the link to PlQ. Whilst on the escalator, there was a guy (early 40's) who was 2 steps behind me  and he gave a loud sneeze without covering his nose. This is the 2nd time in 2 days I felt droplets on me ( this time on the back of my neck) It would be good if people could take simple instructions and wear a mask if they are unwell or unable to contain their coughing or sneezing. I feel it poses as a danger to the person at the receiving end. I might add that the reason I am highlighting this is because I am 65 and taking medication for my chronic diseases and more vulnerable to infection.   I sincerely hope people will be more mindful and practise good hygiene for the benefit of all of us.  Thank you."

31589233,94170340,Mei Lim,"Apr 1, 2020","Sir customers are not always cooperative...  I know families can sit together but with a group as large as the one I had to handle, it would have meant shutting down a lot of tables to accommodate that distance from the group.   I have no idea if they ever stayed to eat. But I am sure I just pissed the lady off when I said a max of 4 at that table.  28th march 2020 Saturday . A plea to everyone. Please excuse any voice typing errors that I missed.  They have very clear markers at the drinks stall where we should stand. An old man walked past me and pushed his way to share my box.  I was horrified and stepped back. Then I realized why. He had obviously had a stroke. He could not move his left hand and very likely could not control the way he walked. In the end he gave up and went back to his meal. I asked the  stall operator to find out what he wanted and bought his drink for him. I do not earn a lot but a few cents to help will not hurt.  I'm asking the general public for the sake of people like him, to please be mindful about cooperating with food places so that they can remain operating. If a food place has too many customers not cooperating at this current climate we stand a risk of being shut down.  People like that old man who obviously depend on eating out might suffer. We do not know his history and background. It could be that he has no family to look after him.   Please if the stall or store tells you to stand outside, sit here or do something you don't want  to... please cooperate. I do not know who it was but it got to my ears that one of my colleagues had a hard time with a lady who was told to wait outside. She ended up criticizing our service.  Daily we deal with such people. Daily I deal with rubbish left behind by customers. Fair enough if a food place does not have a return tray station. But at places that do it would help a lot if you returned your tray and packed your used tissues into something disposable, so that staff like myself can dispose of it with a minimum of risk.  We potentially face  abuse from customers who refuse to cooperate. Many even drag the seats all over the place.   It's not going to hurt to mind your public hygiene for good.  Please we also have to protect ourselves and our livelihood is at risk.  Mei."

I am very grateful to what our MPs have done for us. Working day and night on this Covid 19. However, as the no. of cases grow. It's extremely stressful for working parents. We need to worry about work, our employer's business, our family and friends health. We have to monitor the groceries level in our neighborhood. We follow instructions never stock up. Rice & toilet paper. But sir, everyday/ every hours live we live in fear. It's possible to share you sop with us. If there's a lockdown in Singapore when our no. Hit 1200 or after 5, 6 deaths? It's much easier for us to plan and react. I tried practicing placing orders online 3 weeks ago till today. All three supermarket systems show delivery not available! This week my company allow workers to go home earlier,. This is to avoid peak hour crowd.To my surprise, I saw many students wandering at malls and playground!? In groups! Can you look into this? This is going to be a long fight. Is it possible for MPs to speed up our measures? I don't see more people wearing mask could be running out or don't bother. But because of this don't care group. Our family have to wear masks. It's a big sum of money! Will you consider all must wear mask when they take public transport like MRT and buses?  For people who follow rules, have been doing our very best to stay away from crowd for months. The young and old are getting impatient and really frustrated at home. Please discuss freely with citizens and shared your SOP.  真的长痛不如短痛。Citizens soon starts to blame MPs for anything and everything  if  situation doesn't improve."

I hope you can read this. The 2 articles on The Straits Times today about the death of the 70-year-old man and the experience in ICU of the 50-year-old IT manager are really alarming bells. Until now, they are unable to tell the reason from where they got infected. The man commuted to work everyday by mrt, same as me, amd the risk is there. It can be anyone of us. It comes to my question that how many more cases and death of innocent people have to be happened then the government will apply stricter measure, such as mrt closure, compulsory work from home order for all applicable business? With my deepest condolence for the man, I hope the government really think about it as it can be any of us!"

The local transmission is greater in number than the imported cases. These ‘brakes’ do not work as we have seen from across the world. You need a hard lockdown.

We are small but we are brave and tough, we stand up against discrimination and falsehood, Singaporeans are proud of you.  Just like what you mentioned this pandemic may bring the world to their knee, if everybody are selfish and individualistic, we need to work together to overcome and win this battle as one united world  Last but not least, sir, please try to help Iran/N.Korea, USA sanctions will be destroying them, I am not supportive of them for their nuclear programs, but nevertheless they are part of the earth community, thanks."

But what’s most important is for the younger and new generations to fully understand the history, so that they fit in well to better themselves as being innovative to insulate themselves from pandemics and predictably cyber warfare of the future.   The recent success in containing Covid-19 with Singapore amongst the fewest of countries in the world still doing business as normal without a lockdown is living testimony of a well-governed nation with the brightest of chance in overcoming and succeeding in the future.   Someday, in the near future, Singaporeans would get to share your experiences with the world and hopefully by then, through reputation and world recognition, Singapore is more than ready to play host to realizing the ”One World One Dream” community.   It's all predictably possible coming from SG United and I wish Malaysians would do some catching up with UI in power to share the vision and mission.   Cheers!!!🙏"

31545443,77941580,Jeremy Jeree,"Apr 1, 2020",Dear sir   I know I am writing into thin air  Can #comfortdelgro #transcab #grab #gojek for once come together for once and don’t see each other as a competition to agree to have a fix rate for fix distance travel fare and keep it within reasonable price like $6-$8-$10-$15 max and remove the evening surcharge as well for taxis since ERP is showing it’s support  I believe many Singaporean will support to commute at this period if the price is really fixed and good.   This way it’s not only allows drivers to earn a income rather than waiting for nothing  Also it benefits “social distancing” and “contact tracing”   #lta

Healthcare need to do it's job,  other sector also doing their part by remaining open for business. Sick stay home/see doctor/wear mask. Not sick go out work/play/eat.  SHN and LOA should also be phased off.   It is not practical.  We must be ""hybrid"", strong robust healthcare, yet free open economy business.  Tackle only what's on hand, so if you're really not sick, please carry on with your daily lives/mingle/work/fun/play..  Stop all the social distancing, it is disrupting for people and business, and it is just introducing more fear.  If one feel unsafe or feel need to social distance oneself, then wear a mask.    People on the ground are frustrated with their daily lives, things need to improve and be better and normal.   We can also test our internal sustainability, and the reason why we need population growth to 10m eventually..     Actions will tell the people that we need to be ready, be brave, be bold and be decisive that we want our normal lives back no matter what.  Rather go out to have a good fright than stay home to hide the fight..     Let the election come, kick start it, show the whole world that we can make it.. 😁"

31545443,77941580,Ghee Phua,"Mar 30, 2020","Receiving international recognition is always note worthy especially for a small country like Singapore.  However I would like to point out what is reported on Straits Times, MAR 21, 2020, 8:09 PM SGT, total COVID-19 cases in Singapore, 432 cases.  And again, Straits times, MAR 29, 2020, 8:12 PM SGT, 844 cases.  Extrapolating from these numbers, in a little more than a week, there have been more than a 90% increase in the total number of cases.  While the overall number is still low in respect to the overall size of the population, the increase in number is still quite alarming.  And as you are fully aware, every  infection can lead to more infections.  Will contact tracing continue to be an effective method when the numbers continue to grow?    At which point do you think it is prudent to require Singaporeans to shelter-in-place?  And ban outgoing travel at least for the next 30 days unless it is absolutely necessary?  Is the Singapore government ready for mass testing when required as a means to contain the spread?"

31545443,77941580,Li-Yin Moonstone,"Mar 30, 2020","Dear PM Lee  Thank you and Team for the great efforts and initiatives to lower infection spread and keep Singapore safe. 🙏🙏🙏  There have been jokes circulating around on 'virus don't have EZ-Link card' to highlight the weakest link of covid19 related measures on public transport. Despite the recommended WFH, Staggering Work Hours and other measures, some companies may still require physical attendance and some public may still require to take public transport, the safe distancing just abruptly fails at public transport sector.  Understand that we do not want to create panic buy of already-in-short-supply masks needed for healthcare workers, plus that wearing mask is not a guarantee that you won't get sick.... Wondering if use of some basic masks (even those reusable cloth ones or simple mouth coverings) could be encouraged for all needing to use public transport just to capture possible droplet dispersion to reduce the chance to pass on diseases and protect others. The proposal is more from the angle of protecting others, and in return, be protected from unnecessary spread thru' asymptomatic carriers who may not be aware.  There is no concrete evidence it may work. Given that respiratory droplets is the main transmission route of coronavirus, any possible ways to reduce that should cut the chance for the disease to pass on.    Just thinking... and wishing for a quicker recovery, Singapore.  #Staysafe #staysane"

There is a need of dramatic change. Taxi driver and etc no customer be temp delivery for ntuc sheng siong and restaurant.

I do agree there is no need to wear mask if one is not in such situation so as not to place undue demand for masks which are seriously in short supply. However, still many Singaporeans couldn't care less as if they are totally immuned, not wearing the masks where they should. That's the reason why we are getting increasing numbers of local transmissions the last few days. Personally, I think our leaders should wear masks themselves when they go on their rounds in public."

It has helped Singapore. CNN and ZAKARIA are using images of Koreans in their CNN trailers . The reporter tried using misleading questions about USA and China. He did not mention that Presidents Trump  and Xi had a long telecommunication. Both are helping other countries too. CNN has always been anti Trump. PM Mr.Lee is an intelligent person and he knows who this guy is. They work for the CNN boss who was caught. Singapore dont want FAKERS and FAKE NEWS.God bless Singapore"
31521392,78182090,Bert Fern,"Mar 30, 2020",The PM and the taskforce has done a good job of containing the Covid19.  However what the PM said is true. It is true no 9ne can say this is a success  story. If it is the numbers will not increase and deaths will not be upgraded. This reporter is from.the CNN an Anti Trump media. His line of questioning is to mislead. The Trump ADMINISTRATION is still leading in helping other countries. Check out other sources.Check if the medical equipments sent by China were faulty. CNN you got to do better. Zakaria be honest.

31504655,18349460,Tan Kok Tim,"Mar 29, 2020","COVID-19... Are the world leaders' at their wit's end?  Can they see the bigger picture and the purpose of this virus crisis?  Do they see the impasse, dead end and deadlocks if humans continue to ignore the messages on the walls, and that a worldwide emergency has been declared for earth, and all mankind?  ========  S$7.2 trillion for the fight by the G20..  Did the G20 leaders [via teleconferencing] discuss the importance of getting the UN and WHO to take the lead in assembling the best experts, researchers, and resources under one location or roof to research for a medical cure and vaccine?  Time is the essence.  This is a fight for the sake of all mankind.  It is not a time for games of gamesmanship.    This is the time for unity of purpose putting aside selfish, self-centred, egocentric and arrogant desires as the world is in dire need to get the cure and vaccine fast.     It is not the time for world leaders of the G20 to split hairs over trivial things or nomenclature.    They are not children.  They are world leaders and are adults.  The time to play games are over for them.  This crisis is to show humankind how tired this planet earth has become as she needs a break and rest by bringing humans' activities and pollution to a stop.  This virus crisis is not a bad thing.    It is to open up the eyes of human beings especially their leaders to their follies, and self-centred and selfish nationalistic interests, which must stop, and must be put to an end."

31435124,69044770,Rainz Rainz,"Mar 25, 2020","I know lockdown will affect our economy but if we dont lockdown now, with everyone travelling/moving around, the unlinked cases will rise.. i hope you can consider lockdown soon. If we can contain the situation when its still measurable, we can still put through it and economy will get better later..."
31435124,69044770,Jason Ong,"Mar 26, 2020","Dear Sir, i think it is time to lockdown the country. Preschools are now affected and probably could get to many other schools in near future. Children are our future and we should not ignore this fact to protect them as much as we can. Economy may collaspe as a result of a lockdown but life of a child, sorrows of a possible loss in a family means much more. Have a heart and think what if one of your loved ones is lying in the ICU...should the economy falls we can always work hard again to get it back where we are today, but we couldnt say the same for the loss of a loved ones."
31435124,69044770,Eshwar Eshwar,"Mar 25, 2020",Thanks to the leaders and government employees for having their best.. Thank you sir.
31435124,69044770,Sathish Kumar,"Mar 26, 2020",Yes at this difficult circumstance.... Singapore government taking a very cautious approach at the same time not panicking about it... they knew what they were doing and how to do it... as Singapore residents we have to abide and practice good hygiene and social isolation to prevent community outbreaks in clusters... hope we can do it together ( by staying away from each other) ... 
31435124,69044770,Tizzy Chap,"Mar 26, 2020","Hi PM, I am not proposing Hawker Centres close down as it will impact livelihoods and social stability. But Hawker Centres are just waiting for a cluster to happen. Could you or the relevant ministry check with NEA if Hawker Centre can start social distancing and start taking necessary precautions? 1-All hawkers handlers are to wear mask and hand glove. 2-All seating is designed to have social distancing OR consumers are encouraged to take away to their office and home. 3-Control consumers inflow including hawkers themselves to check their temperature and using the disinfectant. 4-The checkpoint is to limit overcrowding in the hawker centre. One in one out."
31435124,69044770,Tan Estee,"Mar 26, 2020",I have a question in mind...if all Singaporeans are told to stay home as much as they can. Why are FDW allowed to go out during their off days (even employer requested them to stay home but they refused); this will not only create more risk of spreading the COVID-19 outside and also bringing them home to the employer with children and seniors taken care by them. MOM should pass a rules to stop all their gatherings too....is a weekly event for them.....just think of how this could spread the virus further.
31435124,69044770,Mercy Tan,"Mar 25, 2020",Appreciate Mr Lawrence Wong and the planning team. Singapore is bless to have good government and as Singaporean we must stand together for such a time like these. Those who purposefully violate instruction should be seriously dealt with.

31435124,69044770,Jennifer Chan,"Mar 27, 2020","I have been very supportive of the government but there is always a first time. I think that the social distancing measures in coffee shops and eating places are impractical. Are families supposed to sit and eat separately? After all they don't distance themselves once at home. So it doesn't make any difference.  A safe distance between tables is more reasonable as we should keep a safe distance from strangers rather than family members. If one member gets the virus, the probability of infecting the other family members staying under one roof is high anyway.  Another matter that I like to bring up is we should advise the public not to talk loudly and aggressively in crowded areas or over people's food. Because some people talk with their saliva flying all over the place when they walk pass you while you are eating. In this case, eating at a safe distance from another is no longer safe... still have to watch out for people talking over your head while waiting for your table.  If the purpose of these measures is to discourage eating out, then perhaps everyone should self-quarantine indefinitely. I hope people can exercise discretion, be considerate and be self-disciplined, so that we don't have to implement harsh measures."

I tried cancelling all the airlines ( other national airlines) no issue , no questions asked , full refund even when the fare conditions are non - refundable. But our own national airlines, do not entertain us , always can’t get through their lines and only does email replies saying they don’t allow refund and only do free change . I find this confusing and contradicting to what our government are doing. With all your financial aids to the airlines, shouldn’t  they pass these down to the consumers who are affected as well.

31435124,69044770,Viv Wee,"Mar 29, 2020","Thanks for all the timely measures introduced for Singapore, dear PM Lee. No doubt social distancing is a good measure and by limiting the number of people in the malls, supermarkets etc. does help in decreasing the crowds, can we also look into letting the vulnerable group enter the malls or supermarkets on priority queue at all times?  I understand there are already 'priority shopping hours' for the elderly and the pregnant group either 7am or 8am at ntuc, cold storage etc, but not everyone can make it during those hours.  At 29 weeks pregnant, it is an absolute physical challenge to have to queue for as long as an hour just to get into a mall before I can get to the supermarket for my weekly fresh produce for a healthy expectant mum's diet. How is this queuing to get into the malls, suoermarkets help the 'less crowding' situation? And it does not help the vulnerable group either if they have no choice but to join the queue to get their essential goods.  When the announcement was made on the new policy, demand instantly shot up on online shopping platforms and delivery slots are all snapped up throughout all the online supermarts. I wish to opt for delivery, but with no more slots I can't and I'm forced to go out and join the queues. Won't that be counterproductive?  I hope this suggestion can be considered and improved measures can be introduced soon to take into account having priority queues for the elderly and pregnant group to enter the malls and supermarkets at any hour. Thanks once again, for every efforts the government has made so far in a unique situation like this. #sgunited"

As you can see, Singapore features at the bottom of the list for social distancing measures, where most countries have brought their numbers down significantly, except Singapore. Could you take 3-5 minutes to digest the chart & data, and brainstorm the reasons why this might be the case, and rank them according to priority, then come up with multi-pronged solutions. Thanks for the help. "
31435124,69044770,Mei Lim,"Mar 26, 2020","24th March 2020 Tuesday I wish everyone would do their part and avoid going out into crowds  or travelling  unnecessarily.   It bothers me a lot that I have to clear possibly contaminated waste left behind by customers. However it is part of the job and I don't have a choice but to grit my teeth and do it.  It bothers me a lot they leave medical waste behind, without thinking it might cause issues for those people cleaning up. It's not just picking up your mask and throwing it away because you don't want to, it means sanitizing the area bagging the trash and sanitizing the dustbin. If you throw up,  make sure you inform the staff. We have a right to take precautions as we approach the cleanup.  People often pee in public behind our building and there's a toilet at the guard post damnit.  In these difficult times this is not the sort of behaviour above I would encourage. My income would be affected because I cannot afford to go on quarantine. My guess is that eventually we can learn to co-exist with the disease once it dies down a bit. Like any other strain of flu for example many will develop an immunity. it may take a year or so but it will happen.  You go traveling god knows what you will bring back. I can understand traveling for work, but if you get sick those of us in close contact would have to be quarantined too.   A big shout out to people who are working in the front line. People working at food places to see that you get fed and get your home delivery... People who dispose of trash, the janitors that keep places clean. People in the medical line even the receptionist, first responders etc, the police and whoever else that is forced to work in these difficult circumstances. Thank you so much.  God bless you.

I was puzzled why the media emphasize more towards imported cases rather than local transmission cases in everyday reporting. Local transmission put a greater risk to all the people. The trains and buses are still packing with commuters, social distancing simply impractical in public transportation. A lockdown which has implemented across many countries not only could fight against Covid-19 but also a opportunity to give the country a rest from ever bustling days.

31406604,12663310,Michael Kim,"Mar 24, 2020","The government says our stockpile is sufficient. Full stop.  Not to stir panic buying but I hope more info could be provided on that because we are almost 100% dependent on other countries especially Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, Thailand and China for our poultry, meat, diary and vegetable supplies and these countries are in a state of lockdown. In fact almost the entire world is.  Do state at least the duration of sufficiency.  Because it’s not very assuring to just say everything eg masks are sufficient but in reality, masks are rarer than plutonium here.  "
31406604,12663310,Ellie K Ezhilarasi,"Mar 24, 2020",Yes working from home should be in place to at least test it. Who knows if what other viruses worse than Corona comes along
31406604,12663310,杰克,"Mar 25, 2020",Do you really care about us?  try taking mrt during peak hours! try getting your lunch in hawker during lunch hours and go back home to your family thinking everyday if you have contracted covid19 and you may spread to them! i bet most of us feel this way even we wear mask and wash our hands. If social distancing is important dont you think a lock down would be even more efficient. the virus is 2 steps ahead of you and soon you will be on bended knees. lives are more important than our economy right now. we need to prepare for the worst and there is no contest when it comes to economy vs public health... i dont think my fellow singaporean would say get the economy going at the cost of human lives! SG jia you!

31406604,12663310,杰克,"Mar 24, 2020",what are you waiting for? we need you to be decisive and shut down everything! we can build back the economy again with the rest of the world... you shut down night spots and cinemas only now and yet casino remain open? if you really care about us just shut down everything except supermarkets and pharmacist... we rather stay home 1 month rather in isolation with covid19 and probably die without saying good bye to our love ones or worst spread and kill our love ones.

It doesn’t solve the issue, just shifting different work group.  Those start at 7am, cannot choose to leave home at 10am. So what is this ‘avoid’ peak hours? 😅 "

31406604,12663310,Ee Leng Tan,"Mar 28, 2020","Mr Prime Minister, thank you for your leadership and your tireless work and that of all our leaders. I am grateful. Today there is advisory for us to not go the malls except for food and essentials and to order groceries online. What does this mean for retailers like me? Should we all close our shops. Rental is a huge part of our overheads. With this advisory will there even be the odd customer that comes by? As it is sales has been down to almost nothing. What do we do about our staff? The advisory also ask us to order groceries online. Have you tried? I have tried for the last 3 weeks  going into the website every day  but I was unable to get a delivery slot. They are inundated and unable to cope with deliveries. We are so strict on safe distancing at eateries and stores but we are packing them in in the buses and training. 1 metre apart in the buses? Only alternate seats? There is a great inconsistency. If we are going to charge people for keeping alternate seats vacant  we will have to implement that in the buses too. What is the answer?"
31406604,12663310,Desmond Tang Lian Tong,"Apr 4, 2020","Virus won't die, it can't be killed. The only way is understand how they evolved and work around the problems to tame them. It is everyone's duty and responsibility to be vigilant and take good care of the body God had given us.  As for now eating fresh pineapple fruit might be a good way to keep your body in good shape and health. This fruit do more then just providing you with nutrients. It could be your shield and armour against the viral outbreak.  This is my views and opinions. Myself and others who had worked in dusty polluted environment like in carpentry and recycling jobs, we ate pineapples to cleanse and detox our body once in a while."

To get through this fast, i guess it is time for all the great leaders in the world to meet and co-ordinate a global lockdown together.  There is no use if individual countries impose lockdown but others are not following; just like the case with China, local cases 0 but there are still imported cases that may continue to infect the country.  Rather than slowly bleeding to death, why dont take a bold approach to do a global shutdown together.  This is the time when mankind meets together to fight against ""armageddon""."

31329264,36770040,Ho Kee Hang,"Mar 21, 2020","Dear PM Lee, our HCW are world class and dedicated but we must be mindful of the physical and mental stress they are under. It is therefore extremely important that our policies must be directed at containing community transmission of the virus.  The message to the people must be that social distancing is very important. Unfortunately, the new rule limiting maximum persons at any gathering to 250 is sending the wrong message. People are not staying home as much as possible. They feel it is fine to go out to public areas with friends and family.  Taking the SAFRA cluster transmission rate as a guide, another cluster arising from a gathering of 250 persons will lead to another 60 persons being infected.  I therefore appeal to you to ban any gathering of more than 20 persons before it is too late.  Dr "

ECDA was able to retrieve all info required from CPFB and IRAS. Is personal travel info privacy more important than the safety of other kids?   Cc Ong Ye Kung"

31329264,36770040,Eunice Chua,"Mar 21, 2020","Dear Sir, be strong, courageous, wise and quick in making decisions.   The healthcare system is already overloaded. To avoid the situation where we run out of ICU space or medical ventilators, or where medical staff gets infected due to lack of sleep or we have to implement triage system. Please.   1. Tighten border controls, with strict enforcement of no outboard travels. This border  tightening is only temporary.  2. Strict enforcement of no gatherings, religious or otherwise.  3. Put health above economics. We do have reserves for rainy day. Other countries are also closing their borders on us. Closure is only temporary.  4. While we appreciate lead time before travel restrictions set in, people are gaming the system by travelling before the timeline.  Desperate times call for desperate measures. The populace is behind the Government even if draconian measures are taken; we are an educated people who understand the Government's decisions.  Thank you for considering."

But Sir...Sorry for being oblivion, but I’m a little confused about this: “As we get more COVID-19 cases, more patients will need ICU care, and we must brace ourselves for more losses”  Does it mean, 1)we have not enough to  to care for the too critical in ICU as we brace for more cases? Thus to be prepared for more  deaths? 2)Are we giving up hope already on the “extremely critical”?  3)No sufficient health care facilities/staff?

As long as we do not travel in and out, Singapore overall is in high good conditions if we continue with personal hygiene, sick see doctor and stay home, check out family members status and avoid crowded places. Time to do some training to upgrade ourself via small classes with distancing, online etc. Spend time with families when we are so busy before and increase family and friend bonding via over whatapps, video call etc. Take care and be strong!"

My suggestion is to implement temperature checks at all MRT and bus terminal where we have many commuters taking public transportation every single day.  Education has to proceed and continue but people have to be socially responsible which means more to be done to educate our children and corporate companies to take precautionary measures .The same apply for weekly tuition centres such as Mendaki & Sinda. I don’t see why this weekly tuition is put on hold?Maybe we can be more sensible to implement measures at right place and time.

31329264,36770040,Phoebe Feehily,"Mar 21, 2020","Understand that the government has been taking measures to curb the spread of this virus by implementing laws / bans and advisory but can further be done particularly towards working adults and specifically the private sector where smaller companies tend to be in the shadow in light of these new measures? Our company has been implementing temperature checks but that is the extent of what has been done so far. I am getting worried with the returning travelers coming back to work following the school holiday and especially on the case of taking crowded public transports to commute to and fro from work / home.  With the school reopening on Monday, I will be sharing the trains and buses with people who may or may not be taking extra precautions - especially since the 14 days LOA is not mandatory for working adults returning from their holidays. Additionally, is there a way to enforce rules on companies such as my own to force the management to actually implement BCP ie alternate work days / teams? We have broken down the company into 2 teams as part of BCP to adhere to government advise but no action has been taken to actually make this effective; which in other terms is totally useless in this fight against the virus. Would appreciate if these issues can be addressed."

Can we not make all these people put up a security bond for the amount required to treat a Covid-19 patient?  I'm sure we can estimate the cost of treating a confirmed case including hospitalization, medication, and all other related cost.  This is necessary because these irresponsible people have the mindsets that they will not get the Covid-19 and if they did, our govt will take care of them with the taxpayers money.  Implementing the security bond will make them realise whether they can afford the treatment cost should they be infected.  And if they are not infected, then we can return them their security bonds, less the testing costs."

The discussion are from various perspectives, such as education system protection, kids safety, public transport risks etc.   I would like to contribute my two cents from another perspective - INNOVATION. No one can deny, e-learning is next hot topic. China and US companies have invested tremendous efforts and resources to grow this. This is much more complicated than just online video conference. This is to move class room f2f teaching system to online. One of the fundamental factors that make Singapore standing out of other countries is innovation.   This might be a great opportunity to incubate home-grown companies into the business. Next Amazon, Alibaba could be here in Singapore, and by singaporeans."

I appreciate the efforts of the Teachers to call each parent to confirm if they have been to other countries (including Malaysia) for the past week, however as a parent I need a 100% assurance that the data the schools gathered are 100% accurate. Our government should seriously consider suspending classes for the meantime, given the increase in numbers of cases and the lesser no. Of patients being discharged daily. I just don’t want us to regret when the numbers are already overwhelming and that no matter how best is our healthcare system, it can still fail. Because our front-liners: our Doctors, Nurses and all other healthcare practitioners are all humans, they get tired and fall sick too, they are not robots. Furthermore, I observed that majority of the students need to travel by trains or buses to go to school, so how do we implement social distancing while taking these public transportations? As a parent no matter how we take care of our children at home but there’s no assurance of their safety outside, there will always be fear in our hearts. Whenever I watched the videos of those patients who are suffering, I can’t help but to worry for our children. Honestly, there are a lot of “what if’s” in my mind now."

Public transport is usually packed. Unless child wears mask everyday to school or else social distancing is hard to establish on public transport.

Our rate is growing and safe distancing is quite impossible. How do you expect safe distancing when people goes to work in public transport Everyday. Have you been in a MRT recently to witness it? No! So please take action and don’t say it will effect the economy if SG is locked down. We don’t have to show off to other nation.

31329264,36770040,Xuan En Xuan En,"Mar 21, 2020","Yes , my heart is with the families of the deceased too .   Dear Honourable PM Lee ,  sharing my humble thought with Mdm Ho earlier as follows :   “Preventive for the next wave of outbreak as we watch the virus progression and exponential statistics.   My thoughts :  A stitch in time saves nine . We may yet trace the root cause of the virus but we may be able to do more . It’s not to late to have the medical expertise and task force look into how we can have measure set aside looking at what happens 🌎 world wide . The conclusive of the death were those like elderly , those with chronic diseases like cardiovascular and diabetes complication . With the records we have from our medical CMIS , we should be able to keep a lookout for these group of people ( citizens ) and ensure they are taken care in the way of same measures to stay at home when unwell , to have corporate and companies support remote off site working ( social distancing) and notice to such to avoid certain places and activities . In that way , we may even have combat readiness to prevent the huge wave of outbreak that may come along . This is just my humble thought that I always believe such would contain the resources we have at hospitals and clinics and material time and manpower resources including medical expertise like test kits etc . It’s good to kiasu on such to have a better win win to battle to world wide outbreak . Every life counts Thus we must remember  the word “ scarcity “ from Economic which we witnessed from ITALY 🇮🇹 and that it means - essence of time  , the limited means 🆚 the unlimited wants .  I am someone with the personality of INTJ but I think 🤔 to be front loading and think far and deep is of importance to read in read out of the causation to the virus 🦠 and to handle from all perspective and prevention is the equivalent quotient to combat readiness . Pardon my daring to speak up on this through your post ; it’s your kindness and duty of care for such that emboldened me to share my two sense worth of thought. Thank you 🙏 a very good morning and 万福金安. “ - you n Team have done well and let’s keep going to do better . "
31329264,36770040,Ng Kl,"Mar 21, 2020","Sir maybe we should consider to do a lockdown. If the sand dusts keep flying in, without closing the windows, we will never be able to finish the sweeping."

31329264,36770040,Muran Wang,"Mar 22, 2020","I would seriously urge the government to consider closing school for two weeks. We could treat these two weeks as school holidays by shortening the June holidays by two weeks. For the following reasons:  1. Based on the global situation, it is highly unlikely the problem will be resolved by June, it makes no major difference by shortening the holidays in June by two weeks.  2. However, by extending the March school holidays, we can be safer. As there are a few untraceable cases of local spreads on a daily basis, there is a likelihood that some of our 60k teachers/school staff and 600k pri/sec/jc students have been infected locally without realising it, or perhaps their family members have been infected without realising it. One such case may potentially result in a two-digit cases of infection, among our teenagers.   2. The student may be infected by the parents if he/she stays at home. However, this will still happen as long as the student still goes home after school. By going to school, it only increases chance of community spread in school campus and on public transport.  3. And our public transport is not safe obviously during peak hours. I suspect most of the untraceable cases currently were infected in such crowd. Majority of the students who have to travel at least twice a day are exposed to this risk.  4. I understand MOH is concerning about doctors and nurse taking child care leave if the holidays are extended. However, even if they don't take it now they will still take it in June if we don't shorten the holidays there. Also, in a crisis as such, government should cease the child care leave approval for medical sectors, and compensate in other ways.  5. Lastly from a teacher's point of view: we are exhausted. (A) Some of our colleagues are on LOA due to oversea travels, we will have an increasing workload when school reopens. (B) Due to a significant number of students on LOA, we have to craft two weeks of e-learning materials in addition to normal teaching load. (C) Some of the schools are old. The classrooms, staff rooms and canteens are not large enough to support the 1-metre distance guide. We don't feel very safe in working in such environment."

I have raise it in 2008. Leaders around the world must realise that the present economic theories/functionality cannot sustain or withstand crossover of viruses now into our financial world. We need to come up with new innovative ways /formula to rewind, reboot and restore our financial system. I propose ""Mark's T equation""- (a +/- plus-minus equation and a T-score (%adjustment)-to tally up the whole world's financial accounting -needed all countries/governments involvment and participation to support and acting as a balancing equilibrium to cushion the impact now facing CONVID-19.

31115984,48902840,Lee PL,"Mar 12, 2020","Truly noble. Thank you and highly appreciate. Together, we stand united to overcome Covid-19.  ******  12 March 2020  ONGOING SUSPENSION OF MASSES  My dear People of God  It was with much sadness that I had to order the suspension of Masses on 14th February, particularly because the celebration of the Eucharist is the Summit of our faith.   More than anyone, as the Archbishop, it is my desire to make the Eucharist available to everyone.   However, as the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Singapore, I have to act responsibly not just for the sake of our Catholics but the community at large.  To this end, we have been working hard to put in place the precautionary measures in our parishes so that we can resume the Masses.    When I made the announcement to lift the suspension last Thursday, it was in the context of a stabilised situation.  However, the situation has become so serious that WHO has just declared COVID-19 a pandemic.  The worsening regional threat and recent big cluster arising from SAFRA Jurong have caused much anxiety among the community at large.  There is a rising number of infections.   Outbreak control measures are in full swing.  The authorities are putting up more stringent measures to include social distancing and assembly of crowds.  All social activities involving seniors by government agencies have been suspended. We are not helping the situation if we resume Masses at this time, simply because of the sheer numbers of Catholics packing in each service, and their fluidity in moving from one parish to another, and attending different services.  Furthermore, a large percentage of our parishioners belong to a vulnerable group-seniors with lower immunity. As responsible Catholics, we should be mindful that we do not do anything that might further burden the already strained healthcare system. Hence, to protect the larger population, I have decided to rescind the order to resume Masses until the situation is much improved and more stabilised.    I know many of you who desire to participate in the Mass and receive the Eucharist will be greatly disappointed.  There are as many who are for the ongoing suspension as there are those for its resumption.   After weighing all the views and bringing them to prayer, I have discerned that we should not proceed at this point in time.   Our Catholic Medical Guild (CMG), which is helping us monitor the situation on the ground and is constantly in consultation with the government, will do the necessary reviews. The CMG will make its recommendations to me when it is time to resume Masses.   I know it is a decision that will not please all, but as the Head of the Catholic Church in Singapore, I have to decide for the common good.  Should anything untoward happen, it would be too late to regret.  We should not insist on having the Eucharist at the expense of the safety of the larger community.   Hence, I appeal to all Catholics to be magnanimous, charitable and generous, especially during this season of Lent, for the greater good of our people in Singapore.   When others see us as being socially responsible, they will appreciate our faith even more because they see us putting Christian charity into action.  This is how we show ourselves to be good Catholics.   I invite you to make the greatest sacrifice of all, which is to deprive ourselves of the celebration of the Sacrifice of the Mass.  Instead, you will use this time to yearn for our Lord in the Eucharist even more through participation in the on-line Masses, prayer services and praying the scriptures.   It is an occasion for us to be conscious that we should never take the freedom to practise our faith or the Eucharist for granted. We must not think that just because we are without the Eucharist for the time being, our faith would be compromised.  The early Christians and those Christians still under persecution in some countries today also did not have the privilege of the Eucharist to accompany them in their faith journey. But they were still able to keep their faith alive, and grow from strength to strength by reading, praying and sharing the Word of God. Instead of lamenting the prohibition of the use of traditional ways to provide our people their spiritual needs, we must see this crisis as a grace of God to challenge the Church to rethink how we can continue to sustain the faith and evangelise our people by leveraging modern technology and other resources available to us.   Parishes can be more proactive and creative by offering on-line Masses, on-line catechesis, on-line Spiritual reflections and talks, and encourage the formation of small bible-sharing groups.  We encourage our Catechists and children to continue to nurture their faith through on-line catechesis. This would be a great opportunity to strengthen our neighbourhood communities and church organisations.    Thank you for your understanding and for putting the interests of the larger community before our own.  Let us support each other in our faith and continue to pray for the elimination of this virus from the world.  Please keep me and our priests in your prayers as well. Your devoted Shepherd,  Most Rev. William Goh Archbishop of Singapore"

Once a person is infected by the new Coronavirus pneumonia, even if it is cured, the sequelae will be a drag on your later life! This plague is more serious than SARS 17 years ago, and the side effect of using the medicine is even greater. If a special effect medicine comes out, it can only save lives. That's all!

Avoid going out if possible, this is a battle, not a casual game. Do not be ignorant or blind to all the going-on, put aside self-confidence or luck factor as well as that attitude of can’t care less as it is none of my business.

You are absolutely right on the social role that each individual in SG should play. May I humbly suggest that government should enforce that sick people should NOT go to school or work, let alone other social activities? With this effort, our society can keep running and at the same time we can slow down the virus transition."

Meat I do not dare to think.. but perhaps our vegetable and fish, surely enough for the 2 month.  Just 2 months sir. Can?  I'm sure those 2 month, we are free from the evil mutated and the stupid virus.   Thereafter, we will maybe resume importation by temporary banning those Malaysia truck to release the vegetable or livestock in the Singapore custom and our trader will collect from the border and delivery to respective area.

It is to my understanding that MP Murali is  also present. Kindly get back to me as I am highly unpleased that vulnerable senior citizens are exposed when the govt is advocating minimising social gatherings. Don't advocate and tell ppl to avoid gatherings when your people are not following and our parents are given the wrong impression that it is safe. It is highly ironic.

30997691,76752430,Syed Ali,"Mar 7, 2020",That’s nice 😊 to see ... Small recognition here... Dr Vasoo is a great n cool multi cultural inspired MP when he was in leading our Henderson>>Tiong Bahru then. He was also the brain behind requesting the formation of the self help Indian group for our elders /needy/ students in the late 80>>> I believe he could be a good role model esp for my fellow Indian community leaders too. It had motivated me to do my small bit as a GRL thereafter n to date >>  Good luck to the team under his able leadership. 👍🙌

Our Advertising platforms through TV channels getting Dr Leong Hoe Nam to endorse important steps how to take care of personal hygiene , TV and radio platform to reinforce the importance of personal hygiene and social responsibility are very impactful .

One such is MRT station public toilet, like Downtown line. It made rub hands with soap very difficult to wash off as 1 hand is use to press and hold the tap to wash the other. Once you release, water stop immediately. The authority need urgently to change them to motion sensor type."
30974202,80320650,Kai Cheong,"Mar 6, 2020",Beyond hygiene and cleanliness I believe part of our success lies in the detection and contact tracing capabilities. Of these I feel that detection can still be improved as a first line of defence.

Hope this kind of big data can help to trace confirm cases easier and we can reach out to suspect cases faster.  Let’s continue to stay unite as one 🇸🇬 and win the control of this virus.  Last but not least, thanks for all the heroes’ hard work in all curbing & curing actions! "

Uncle ‘B’ coughing non stop on his hawker table without covering his mouth as he’s busy on using his mobile phone. 😆 "

30974202,80320650,Amy Tan,"Mar 6, 2020","Dear Minister, Perhaps there is no better time than now to step up educating the public to return their used crockery and cutlery after their meals so that cleaning staff can focus on cleaning. It is about time that cleaning staff at food courts and cooked food centres be issued proper sanitising cleansers to wipe down tables instead of using old rags that look and smell like they’ve been picked up from dirty drains. "
30974202,80320650,Chris Tay,"Mar 6, 2020",Make sure the faucets and basins in public spaces are clean. The standards in the hawker centre is quite appalling

30974202,80320650,Simon Lee Boon Liat,"Mar 7, 2020",Honestly speaking through observation & experience this is slack in the government agency who was supposedly responsible for public eatery and toilet hygiene. Japan is one good country in hygiene we must adopt of course not too true in Tokyo but most if not all the public toilet is very well maintain and spotlessly clean (odourless too). Wake up and we do not need COVID 19 to remind us.

Their counter staffs will serve those items together with their order. This way its more hygienic. As these are left there unattended."

With more and more new strains of bacteria and virus evolving and needed time to get anti-biotic and vaccine out, newer laws have to be made to get people to be hygienic. The business people must also allocate the proper facilities with good cleaning and maintenance for people to use.  We will now be on the long haul with newer types of diseases evolving and we have to ensure it will not be spread easily. Our government especially the NEA must now start to get out their best plans, regulations and get all public facilities with proper space, designs and good regular maintenance to keep up with the threats of sicknesses. Look at this Covid-19 which needed to spend $billions. Not one single coffeeshops have proper toilet and washing facilities and this must be changed fast."

Technically, can regulatory agency, subject to legal warrant, interrogate the population mobile phone GPS data (i.e. Google and Apple have been tracking us anyway) to perform matching of time, place and duration of others who could have been in close proximity with the identified Covid-19 cases?  Not suggesting these cases were identified that way; but the graph in this article suggests a logical data process could possibly be leveraged on.  Those who could have been exposed to the identified cases, but unaware of it may value that piece of information (i.e. an SMS from the regulatory agency) to inform them (a) to quarantine themselves, and (b) report to authorised testing centre to get tested."

ALL frontliner warriors MUST ensure that they have at least have 7-8 hours of sleep daily so that in case the Covid-19 enters their bodies, their bodies would have already produced enough Cytokines for the day to fight it. Cytokines is a protein naturally produced during sleep by our immune system to fight viruses, bacterias and infections. Round-the-clock Vitamin C and once-a-day Vitamin D3 (e.g. from the sun), Zinc and Selenium (e.g. from eggs) are also important for our immune system to use to fight."

We've become too lazy to clean up after ourselves or keep our surroundings clean hence cleaners exist, EVERYWHERE. They give us a conducive n hygienic environment to work, eat, study and play in. But parents still threaten their children with ""if u don't study you'll end up being a cleaner/Rd sweeper etc etc bla bla bla."" Being a cleaner is a job that, sadly, doesn't pay enough WHEN IT SHOULD! Def one of the toughest yet least paying jobs in the world."

If 10/100 are not responsible or are simply asymptomatic, then the remaining 90 will be suffering. More stringent measures need to be taken before it gets worse. We still have time to not get into the situation of Italy. They had two whole months to prepare but wasted 60 days laughing at China. Plz. The slower the measures are enforced, the more lives will be sacrificed. For thw whole week, we got much more new cases than discharged ones, a very bad sign.

If the tags were to be found damages upon completion of the term, it’s to be treated as attempt to remove and violate the order.

Any more ideas in rewarding them  besides Performance and Sacrifice Bonuses?  NATO = No Action Talk Only   I saw on YouTube PM said If you don't tell me your problems  How do I know you got problems  But did PM know that he's being surrounded by layers of Modern eunuchs?  Eunuchs are the ones feeding all the info  they want the PM to know e.g. no problems  Everything under control ...  Are your parents your modern eunuchs (mostly good ones who wants the best for you)?

Being ignorant or arrogant will get you no where. The many problems you see today are all caused by evil, and the lost might also be the one playing heroes. The real solution is from Heavenly Father. You try to escape from one after another troubles, but can you escape the lake of fire? If Jesus is gonna come back, who shall he find having faith?

30601762,84045050,Quinn Wong,"Mar 3, 2020","Europe or US definitely won't take same strict measures of lock down coz to them so called freedom (or economy) is very important. With only few imported cases and existing lessons of China you c wats the situation in Europe now. Btw Japan Italy US etc in all these countries it is not so easy for even those with travel exposure n with fever to get tested so the reported number is way underestimated. Sg cant ban everyone. Just hope authorities can release some regulations asking those back from Europe Iran Japan Korea etc self quarantine at home for 14 days. MNCs can ask their staff back from those places work from home for two weeks. We need to decide asap. Else with the central aircon we will just have more and more new clueless clusters. If rest of the world don't make an effort to contain the virus and if covid-19 infects as many as or even more than H1N1, then we really can only rely on luck loh. Coz 80% of the infected are with mild symptoms. 20% serious condition and 3-4% fatality rate.. While this fatality rate is provided that medical resources are not stretched.  Luckily got Tropical weather"

You are PM so you will be protected and taken care by best healthcare system but citizen not. Be realistic and be Donald Trump rather than Obama. I think if Donald Trump in your situation, he will wear a mask, he will be honest with his citizen. Btw, just my opinion. Wish you and Singapore all the best and soon overcome the covid-19 disaster."

30483062,25232060,Guoqiang Chen,"Feb 14, 2020","Dear PM Lee, I have a suggestion to make the surgical mask more effective and reusable. It is a practically viable one which I hope it can be passed down to fellow citizens.  You may first refer to this publication for the fundamentals behind the suggestion.  https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956  A summary of the suggestion leveraging on this work is as follows:  Spray sodium chloride (salt) solution on the exterior side of the mask. High concentration is better. It will dry and form a crystallized layer. When the virus from cough or sneezing lands on the mask, the salt it contacts will dissolve, then quickly dries and form crystals again, killing the virus. This can make a mask resuable, not only stop virus from passing through but also killing it. A single mask can be used for a long time by spraying and frying it at the end of the day.  The saline can be self made or purchased from the shelf as those used for contact lens.  For your consideration. Thank you. "

They need to go polyclinic, hospital for regular checkup, dialysis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.  I hope government could support in this matter. Thank you very much!"

I note that once the data is published, everyone starts to fear, creating too much distractions and discussions. This affect daily lives tremendously, not that anyone can do anything about it other than practicing self-hygiene. Of course fake news must be discredited immediately. Also daily reminder of personal hygiene remains crucial  Thank you"

I hope u all are prepared and thinking how to deal with worst case scenario instead of taking a “wait and see” approach. Please show us and the world how sg is well-prepared. Thank you"

30337212,76690550,Jus Bella,"Feb 8, 2020","Dear PM, Ever since DORSC raised to orange, there is public fear and panic. Supermarkets sold out on bottles of dettol, alcohol wet wipes and now progressing to daily essentials like food such as rice. There is definitely heightened sense of insecurity which is worrying over the past 24 hours. Was it really necessary to raise it to orange I wonder. The well intended warning from the government and caution has unintentionally resulted in fear and panic in people here and with social media/ videos circulating is not helpful. Please also see to using the power of social media, tv etc to ally fears and panic. Kudos on addressing self hygiene and contact awareness in public. Hopefully the panic and anxiety will reduce over the weekend. We shouldn’t need to feel like we are in a war zone. Do take care of yourself too PM 🍊🍊"

30337212,76690550,Edmund Lam,"Feb 8, 2020","Dear Intelligent Singaporeans, But let us including the Govt cool down and think awhile. Can you explain why people are not afraid of the seasonal flu that killed at least 10,000 Americans yearly and many thousands more in other countries but so scared of this Wuhan virus that killed 600 plus people so far. What’s the rationale for this human behaviour. Also I think the mortality rate is very low (China doesn’t have the correct figure because many people were not tested), probably 0.2 outside of China. So should we spent so much effort on this? Probably and likely it is some sort of a very bad flu. Trust me. If you are not the elderly or got chronic medical problems you should be alright."
30337212,76690550,Shalom Grace,"Feb 8, 2020","Blessed Chap Goh Mei! It's a time for family gathering. While we will stand with the govt in fighting this virus and do our best to prevent the virus from spreading within our means... I hope our govt do have concrete plans ahead to ensure the well being of the nation.   plans of reducing the risk and exposure of commuters daily travelling on MRT to the virus is perhaps a major concern to address earlier than later. If I am not wrong, China govt has suspended their similar city train services in their major cities. Given there is shortage of masks a reality, how confidence by having so many passengers travelling daily in the mass transit vehicle without wearing masks while the nCoV has a incubation period which a patient may not show any symptoms, but is already able to spread the virus to people nearby? Besides this, will government be providing guidelines to companies wrt the segregation of work force on what is the major consideration from the perspective of an individual worker exposure and risk to the virus from their transportation to offices ? Clearly, my company has not consider this at all and has segregation of duties on no basis of such consideration... Staff with same roles and functions were split between working from home and reporting to workplace. staff staying near workplaces and walk to workplace daily and  staff driving to work place from home are allowed to work from home, while staff who need to commute in crowded MRT and buses needs to report to offices daily. If the precaution measures were taken with the principle of putting staff well being as top priority, I doubt the arrangement would be as such."

I approached the RC this morning while collecting the mask, the officer in charge asked me to call the hotline. The hot line officer asked me to buy from the GP where my son visited. I then went to the GP. The GP assistant straight away told me one box $36 you want or not. I was quite angry with her attitude n also  the price. I told her your clinic shouldn't raise the price according to what the government has warned. The assistant then called someone to check. After the call, she told me the clinic has no enough stock  to sell to me. Can the government  provide 2nd plan for the sick patients because we can't buy mask from any where in Singapore? Please help!"

This also prevent people congregate together in a common place increasing the risk of virus passing to each other in time like this. Thank you for taking time to consider this approach."

30195210,4777250,Andy Chua,"Feb 2, 2020","Dear PM Lee Sir, I my humble opinion, to really prevent and reduce the risk of any possible virus spread, I will strongly suggest to enforce that everyone in singapore to wear mask for 2 weeks to 1 month instead. This can allow those who been infected with the virus but have yet to show symptoms to not spread the virus, since the virus incubation period is about 2weeks. This will allow all those infected and develop symptoms within the incubation period to be safety identified and seek professional treatment safety and greatly reduces the risk of spreading to others, while the rest of the community are also protected with the mask protection."

I also saw many Chinese from China and HK buying cartons of masks at Takayama too on 27-28Jan. I mean cartons, NOT pure small boxes of 50-60masks.  Understand that the Chinese in China are really in need of masks but there must be a better way of handling this. Not that we do not want to help our fellow Chinese in China but how can we be sure that these masks will end up at the right place right person?  How is our govt going to ensure sufficient masks and not ended up in mask war zone?"

If WHO is right in this notice : No wear mask for heahlty people are well,  why the people in China, HK and other countries snapped up more face masks and use them anytime to prevent this coronavirus disaster.  Never listen to the Politikus or WHO tells what, listen to Trust Yourself is priority.

30194835,44780990,Kum Weng Lai,"Feb 2, 2020","Dear Prime Minister, how come the masks were not mailed out to every HDB mailbox by Singpost, or have our SAF personnel put them into all the mailboxes? That way, residents can simply go down stairs at their own convenience, open their locked mailboxes and get the package. Instead, its become so bureaucratic and inefficient. Must go to a RC or CC designated to your block, must line up don't know for how long, must go within such and such hours, must show IC, etc. We are trying to avoid being the public as much as possible, but this is forcing us to expose ourselves in the line ups. Also, the poor volunteers in the RC and CC are seeing thousands of people coming in, and they are also getting exposed to potential carriers of the virus. "

This can allow those who been infected with the virus but have yet to show symptoms to not spread the virus, since the virus incubation period is about 2weeks. This will allow all those infected and develop symptoms within the incubation period to be safety identified and seek professional treatment safety and greatly reduces the risk of spreading to others, while the rest of the community are also protected with the mask protection."

30161580,65113540,Cj Leo,"Feb 1, 2020","Mask gives one a sense of security in an infectious outbreak. Whether it is real sense of security or false sense of security is debatable. Me think it is a real sense of security for mask not only minimized those infected from discharging contagious droplets but also provides protection to some extent to those not infected from the contagious droplets in the environment. A false sense of security will only sets in when the wearer becomes careless n complacent in other aspect of personal hygiene. This is unlikely as in a disease outbreak, the need for security is so high that the margin into complacency territory is wide. Discouraging the wearing of mask also has the negative side effects on some that the situation is not so dire n thus they can drop their guards. A sense of security leads to a peaceful mind. A calm mind strengthens the body immune system."

Next day since blockade till today we still have sufficient food & drinkable water. No mers outbreaks. The population in Qatar smaller than Singapore too. Please stop marketing your self as I do not want to follow u. Freaking FB ads algorithm!😤  By the way, Singaporeans living overseas r buying masks n sanitizer for those in need n shipping it over.

30161580,65113540,Tianshu Ge,"Feb 1, 2020","Dear Mr Lee, Happy CNY! I'm a new Singapore citizen, who just accompanied my relatives to ICA in the hope of extending their short term visit pass this morning. My aunt and uncle, who are both over 60 years old, arrived in Singapore from Harbin on Jan 7th and didn't go anywhere outside of Singapore after their arrival. Their daughter, my cousin, and her husband are both PR but they aren't qualified to apply LTVP for my aunt and uncle. But when they visit yearly, they sometimes make use of the normal one-time, one-month extension to spend a time longer than one month with family. Yesterday, their extension application was rejected. We also saw on CNA that extension to short term visa is suspended. We went to ICA very early this morning to try to find out if any kind of appeal was possible, and the answer was no. Even though Scoot airline had already canceled their original flight that was scheduled for Feb 6th, the officers told us we have to book them tickets from other airlines for them to go back before the one month visa expires. Outside ICA Level 4 waiting area and around the information counter, the whole area was filled with Chinese families, and what looked like two hundred people, all having the same hope of not having the option of extension cut off. After all, these family members arrived early enough in January and didn't go to China again. But there was no exception. Some officers said they sympathize that people's family members have to go back to China at a risky time even though they don't pose threat in Singapore, and that they couldn't get an extension all in a sudden, the officers had no choice but following the new instructions. I would like to tell you how saddening it is for us to send our families back to China right now, when just two days ago we felt lucky that they arrived early enough, they could still use the extension of 30 days to avoid the risk of catching the virus back in China. I'm trying my best to get in touch with Singapore officials who might be able to consider a more appropriate action at this time. Do you think this action alone by ICA is absolutely necessary? Thank you and best regards, Tianshu"

Guess they are complacent as they have beaten sars and thinking they should be able to handle this virus. This is a different virus and it's asymptomatic and more contagious than sars. The 11k plus diagnosed cases are just the tip of the iceberg, many undetected and unknown cases will soon surface. Not handled properly and not implementing very strict and stringent corrective and preventive measures such as total isolation, no meeting no mingling until virus die down, the province will soon be in a sad state and there is possibility of a portion of the people been wiped out. Hope Singapore will learn from their weaknesses and not be complacent and kind to the virus. We have to be harsh and not let the virus any chance of slipping in"

Would just like to highlight that there is an increasing number of unscruptulous merchants who hike the price of masks - for example, the Valu $ chain who has increased the price of surgical masks by 100% in just a day (from 9.9 to 19.9). Due to the zero availability in major pharmacies, many people in need are forced to pay these high prices. Really pity the less privileged who may not be able to afford these masks...please look into this. 😕"

30155973,61836280,Tianshu Ge,"Jan 31, 2020","Dear Mr Lee, Happy CNY! I'm a new Singapore citizen, who just accompanied my relatives to ICA in the hope of extending their short term visit pass this morning. My aunt and uncle, who are both over 60 years old, arrived in Singapore from Harbin on Jan 7th and didn't go anywhere outside of Singapore after their arrival. Their daughter, my cousin, and her husband are both PR but they aren't qualified to apply LTVP for my aunt and uncle. But when they visit yearly, they sometimes make use of the normal one-time, one-month extension to spend a time longer than one month with family. Yesterday, their extension application was rejected. We also saw on CNA that extension to short term visa is suspended. We went to ICA very early this morning to try to find out if any kind of appeal was possible, and the answer was no. Even though Scoot airline had already canceled their original flight that was scheduled for Feb 6th, the officers told us we have to book them tickets from other airlines for them to go back before the one month visa expires. Outside ICA Level 4 waiting area and around the information counter, the whole area was filled with Chinese families, and what looked like two hundred people, all having the same hope of not having the option of extension cut off. After all, these family members arrived early enough in January and didn't go to China again. But there was no exception. Some officers said they sympathize that people's family members have to go back to China at a risky time even though they don't pose threat in Singapore, and that they couldn't get an extension all in a sudden, the officers had no choice but following the new instructions. I would like to tell you how saddening it is for us to send our families back to China right now, when just two days ago we felt lucky that they arrived early enough, they could still use the extension of 30 days to avoid the risk of catching the virus back in China. I'm trying my best to get in touch with Singapore officials who might be able to consider a more appropriate action at this time. Do you think this action alone by ICA is absolutely necessary? Thank you and best regards, Tianshu"
30155973,61836280,Tan Jicong,"Jan 31, 2020","Dear PM Lee, refering to the latest announcement from MOH https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/extension-of-precautionary-measures-to-minimise-risk-of-community-spread-in-singapore. Just few days ago, 4G leader Ong Ye Kung said ""己不欲勿施于人"" when being asked whether Singapore should consider a total travel ban from China. Now, with this announcement, it is a sheer slap in his own face. Some more, this new measure is not only targeting travellers from mainland China, but also affect all PRC passport holders from the rest of the world. Can you imagine a PRC passport holder who stayed in Australia or Japan wants to travel or transit in Singapore and banned from doing so?  Can you help to clarify why this measure has to target nationalities or specific passport holders?"

I am running a small F&B stall in a Food Court and masks are issued daily to enforce workers to use it even they are well. In public places when serving so many customers no chances should be taken because you never know our exposure so better to be safe than sorry. I and my staffs are all confused now."

Indeed in times like this we need to find courage to keep ourselves in fighting spirit against the 2019-nCov virus. But is there any possibility that we can have all incoming Chinese flights being quarantine just for this temporary period only? Screening of temperature at airports is insufficient & unable to identify those ""walkers"" with the virus hidden in them. This will help to allay some of our fears of possible community outbreaks. I'm not suggesting that we have to follow British Airways to stop all Chinese flights.

30130827,78754400,Unconventional Thinker,"Feb 1, 2020","Sir, Just my humble opinion. I am worried.  Because i think It is a not a good idea for the distribution of masks to all residents in Singapore, to be done by getting people to come to the RC centres and community centres because,  1) The chances of getting virus infection will be increased thousands of times as crowds of millions of people, including the old and the handicapped , line up , and infect each other with viruses , which defeat the very purpose of having masks ,and 2) it is so unproductive for people to take leave , just to go collect those masks and 3) Its a waste of time of so many volunteers to help in the distribution exercise and 4) A smart idea would be to just get the post office delivery men , to open up the back of the mail boxes at bottom of each block of HDB flats and then slot in all the masks into all the letter boxes, and this could be done within a few seconds for each block of flat. Imagine the huge time savings ,and getting the task done so quickly and efficiently , compared to getting millions of people to spend hours going to RC centres and community centres to Q up ,and having hundreds of thousands people infecting each other with viruses .  Please do consider my humble opinion, to do the distribution of masks, through mail box.  Thank you"

30130827,78754400,Annie Lee,"Jan 30, 2020",We appreciate the gesture and efforts .. however won’t it be more effective if these masks were be mailed out to individual households instead of having someone to collect ?   Firstly the mobilisation of manpower and logistics be massive and expensive considering the suddenness of the demand ...!  Secondly large crowd would descend to the collection centres and this is definitely not a good idea for people to crowd around waiting to collect ...!!!   The cost would be negligible considering the light weight and compactness of the masks.   And conveniences of receiving the masks by post would certainly also prevent mass hysteria should certain popular centres run out the masks ...not to mention the inconveniences of a family member having to make time just to collect 4 masks ..!!!!
30130827,78754400,Caroline Chiw,"Jan 31, 2020","Dear Mr Lee, we appreciate the gesture of allocating 4 masks per household. However, the govt should also consider during these times to mandate that GPs give out at least one mask to patients who are genuinely unwell. We visited a reputed medical chain yesterday as a family member was down with cough and cold. We asked for one mask as we did not have any and were unable to get any. However, we were told that the clinic does not supply ANY mask. We were not asking to buy a whole box, just ONE mask for the sick patient. And our request was denied. I find this practice highly illogical especially in such times given that patients who are unwell should be wearing masks and yet the clinic in question is not able to provide. And meanwhile, the sick patient is spreading the virus around because there are no masks available! BTW, this is not an isolated experience at just one clinic!"

30130827,78754400,Ben Puah,"Jan 31, 2020","Dear PM, I do agree the purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent spreading the virus if one is sick.  BUT to avoid getting the virus from the sick who is not wearing mask, it’s still safer better for us to wear mask if one understand well the whole picture.  In Singapore, even in this sensitive time, it is still common to see people with coughs and running nose not wearing mask because most of us don’t have the habit of wearing mask when they having flu cough running nose.  And on this Wuhan virus, seriously we don’t know who is having the early symptoms of the virus when you are in the public.  This issue of masks to Singaporean and PR in the Community Centres can be worrying too if it create a contained crowd, cos I feel it is better to avoid crowd places.  4 masks for each household is seriously barely enough in this risky time. Be safer than sorry.  Just sharing my opinion and hope it can help the government to do more better for the people 🙏 ❤️Peace and Love to ALL❤️ "

30130827,78754400,Tan Aggy,"Jan 30, 2020",Thank you Mr Lee for the efforts but again why only limit 4 surgical masks per household? Given the fact that majority of our pioneer population is illiterate isn't it better to place these masks into the letterbox hence easier for them ( no need these old folks to bring Nric in order to claim eligibility for the masks since its limited to 4 pieces per household) Out of good will should be made easier & hassle free for them 😄 instead ( my humble suggestions ) 😅
30130827,78754400,Eng Lee,"Feb 1, 2020",Collected  our  masks today  from  Lorong  Lew  Lian  .  No  Q  and  the  process  was  very  organized and  orderly  as  the  times  were  well  spaced  out  for  different  blocks.  👍🏼👍🏼

These few day I saw many people go NTUC store to buy mask and NTUC staff just sold out the stock to the same person  without asking or records down any details of the person. Not fair to old people or other needy people because they can’t go there every time to search . Better request NTUC , giant or big store should record down every buyer person name and details so that can prevent some people stored up . Fair to all people."

Can a campaign to help the sick get mask eg. (self-paid) with one box/30 pcs of mask at clinics after consultation to ensure they get it? During this period, can a law/practice of compulsory masking for those who are sick be implemented (else penalized) so tt the rest of community can be at ease without using mask and to deter both unnecessary shortage of masks and tightly control possible spreading when the entire community goes about day to day.

30130827,78754400,David Lewnes,"Jan 30, 2020","I'm not convinced this is a good idea at all. During SARS we learned that these masks get damp due to the water vapour in exhaled breath and the damp cloth provides a surface for the virus to attach, thus actually increasing the risk of infection. Hence the best advice is that only those with an infection should wear them. I guess the government has a short memory."

30130827,78754400,长宁,"Jan 30, 2020","I do not quite agree that only people feeling unwell need to wear masks. I read from a doctor in China only today that infected people rarely show symptoms like nose block and running nose. That basically makes it difficult for others to differentiate them from healthy people. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the virus can spread so fast in Wuhan. I can understand that the current stock of surgical masks is inadequate to meet demand. However, whoever has the mask now should be advised to wear it especially when in crowded places. This will effectively minimize the prospect of a widespread outbreak of the Wuhan virus in our communities. We never can tell whether there are healthy carriers walking around at the moment especially among people who have just returned from China. So ideally, we should have everyone wearing mask in public as soon as supply is adequate to enable us to do so. 小心驶得万年船。"

That way, any incubation period will be set from that lockdown date.  We are now experiencing newer cases who have been in Singapore for longer Jan 18/ Jan 20 etc. They have escaped the travel lockdown  It only makes sense to align our travel lockdown with that of the major provinces and cities in China.  Surely our national interests for all 5+M of us citizens are more important than the tourism dollars in the next 14-21 days?!!!???  Golden weeks in May and Oct are long time aways yet.

The supply of masks is also not readily available, even places like liang court guardian also sold out, shouldnt there be some measures done about this?  As for advices regarding how healthy people shouldnt wear masks, isnt it sending wrong signal? There are cases whereby no symptoms shown but the person is still infected. And all it takes is one infected person to cough into the face of a healthy person not wearing a mask, its still a high risk no? Maybe govt shod ensure singaporeans, both healthy or not, have ample supply of masks first?"

Why can't we take a bold step to be proactive to ban all flights and entries from China immediately. Also masks are sold out everywhere. Can Community Centres/Clubs and NTUC outlets be Organised to distribute masks to the population. Or dispatch masks to all resident addresses in Singapore. "

Today, we have 7 confirmed cases. We should do the same and be more proactive, rather than waiting to see how the virus plays out. We need to limit the transmission until we know how the virus is transmitted. Japan and Germany have the 1st confirmed patients who did not travel to Wuhan. They got infected by people who were in Wuhan previously. We have many Singapore residents who are from Wuhan and has relatives visiting them from Wuhan.  How are we managing this?    I am a concerned parent who has a child attending a primary school with probably 1600 students, including  teachers, teaching staffs, canteen, contract workers, plus parents dropping off kids.

If we are more prepared, wouldn't the govt stop immediate influx of China tourists on 15 Jan instead of waiting till tomorrow dateline of 29 Jan?

In SARS case, the infected doctor from Guangzhou was staying in the same hotel as our 3 Singaporeans who came back without knowing they became carriers of the virus and infecting so many.

How many days have passed after the 1st case was detected here? People from Hubei may have travelled to other parts of China, and then people from other parts of China flew here. Its tough for u to detect nor quarantine these travellers."

May I suggest that for those who fell ill and need to see Dr, suggest that free ambulance with easy access to be given to transfer them to medical center or designated hospital. Although the results may be negative, it be better than Sorry. This will prevent the sick persons from using public transport. Pls consider as it helps to isolate the ills. Public is hesitated to call ambulance because it costs $!  But for the sake of the healthier ones, this public ambulance would save much."

While I thank the government for giving out the masks, I’d appreciate if more efficient methods can be used to distribute the masks instead of getting people to queue (crowded and exposed) to get the masks. For example, we can utilise SingPost to distribute the masks to our home letter boxes. In this way, those elderlys and thise vulnerable (including myself who has difficulties walking) who have difficulties going to CCs to collect can still get it from their letter boxes. Appreciate your consideration"

The best and only solution to lower the possibility of this widespread of Virus here in Sg is to PREVENT them from entering. Some of these Wuhan residents are in fact diagnosed with the infection almost immediately or upon a day of arrival In Sg. Questionable if they themselves had already experienced symptoms without Fever and decided to embark on a trip here to receive our world class medical treatment. Crucial first line of defence indeed!

30087330,82522710,Nicky Loh,"Jan 29, 2020","I REALLY would like to see the government put more emphasis and promotional materials on hand hygiene adopted by the hospitals to educate and INGRAIN the public to understand why washing your hands properly and not touching your face can be more effective than wearing a surgical mask. This might potentially alleviate the mass hysteria problem of everyone buying masks.   There is one point though which I disagree... “Masks are only for unwell people and you do not need it if you are well” I can’t control if people sneeze or cough at me, at least I can control/minimise the droplets from getting into my mouth and nose... I would say that’s darn important... even it’s a 5percent increased chance of avoiding the virus. I’ll take it.  I’ma chemo patient and my immunity is weak! A simple cough can causes me a serious infection and pneumonia is instant death. I could use that 5 percent.  So even without the Wuhan virus or not, I hope education on this subject matter gets around more to the people of Singapore.   We simply need to wash our hands as often as we can and avoid touching our faces so much. Wear a mask if you are sick but also wear a mask if you’re more prone to sickness too.  I love SIngapore. I believe if everyone made an effort to work together on getting this hygiene habit out. We should be all right for now! Fear and paranoia makes people do crazy things, but our mindset should not be one of fear but of responsibility, perseverance and strength!   Stay safe everyone and thanks for finally banning all Hubei people coming in!"

Singapore is a small City country and densely packed with many different countries of people working and living here. We needed more stricter control of people coming into Singapore especially from the whole of China and must be put on strict Quarantine.

Don't wait for this to happen else any lock down will be too late.  People are still not wearing the mask correctly... Pls educate  I also notice some food stall foreign workers coughing and are not wear mask !  MOH should advice all people visiting clinics or hospital should wear mask to prevent transmission of diseases.  These are all good hygiene practices be it this Wuhan virus or not.

And months later after the haze was over, I received free masks from the government. AFTER THE HAZE CLEARED! Since then I have never counted on government to be timely in emergency response. I kept some masks even if they past expiry and had to be thrown away , I will just stock  new ones again .  If government is sincerely looking to resolve and prevent spreading in the community, and since we have ample stocks (or do u intend to keep the masks to grow mould ?) , start giving away masks at mrt and bus interchanges. The sooner we start wearing masks, the better we can prevent this virus from spreading locally. Stop saying the 7 cases are imported cases, all 7 of them used local transport to reach local destinations and interacted with locals. We have no idea who were so lucky to have catch their virus. If we wait till there are local infections, they would have passed it on to their families and friends and colleagues, second and third tier infection and virus mutations will probably have begun. We should be looking to keep it out, and not welcome it by saying that we are prepared to receive it. It's simple logic . Makes sense ?"

At  least  you  dont  accuse  your  people  of  being  xenophobic  when  this  is  a  real  concern  for  all  of  us.    KIndly correct  your  ministers  for  their  baseless  remarks  where  this  is  concerned.  They  need to  govern  and  listen with  a  heart.  Glad  to  know  more  solid  steps  are  being  taken  compared  to  the  initial  half-baked  ones.  I  hope  the  government  will  do  contact  tracing  and  get  hold  of  those  who  entered  our  shores  once  the  news  of  the  virus  broke out  and  quarantine  them  or  get  them  to  go  back.    They  are  so  many  and  it’s  important  to  trace  who  are  the  ones  from  Hubei  (not  just  recent)  and  to  follow  through.  As for the government’s advice re wearing of masks. Since you all dont take mrt trains and buses, you dont understand that there are many coughing and sneezing in the carriages without covering their mouths or wearing a mask.  We  face  that  every  time  we  take  the  train.  So the advice that there is no need to wear a mask if generally well, is not the right advice because we may be well but there  are  others who have no qualms spreading their germs.  Appreciate if  you take  this  advice  and  not ask  the public not  to  wear  a  mask  if  they  are  well."

After the 3rd confirmed case and that the patient is all from Wuhan, why didn’t the authority take preventive action to forced quarantine them for 14days.   Isn’t it more proactive to ensure this high risk group do not get into the community.  2. When not well, they then went to the various clinics in shopping mall. Isn’t this putting the rest of us at risk. Shouldn’t there be the few designated hospitals make known to all visitors coming in.  3. Because of point 1&2, thus we are wasting lots of manpower resources to do medical test on suspected ones and also contacts tracing. Not forgetting those in close contacts have to be self quarantine.  4. Lastly, why is there no immediate control on sale of masks and hand santizer.  Have we really learned from SARS???"

There is an added risk of spreading the virus to the community at the polyclinic/clinic/GP and on public transport when these patients are travelling there. To minimise this risk, can I propose having a hotline (in different languages) for individuals suspected of being contracted with the virus to call in.  A trained operator can assist the caller with basic questions like those answered by the polyclinic hotline to help us determine whether to visit a polyclinic. This new Wuhan Virus hotline will allow individuals to determine if one’s chance of being a suspected case is high.  If the result is affirmative, the trained operator can advise the caller to stay where he/she is or moved to a less crowded place and send a special transportation to transport the individual to a designated location for further testing before determining if quarantine measures are required.  Note: The suspected case will then be able to avoid taking public transportation or going to a clinic in the shopping mall where there is high human traffic like the previous two cases."

And btw, can I know whether anyone actually considered the fact that china alrdy said that the virus can be spread without showing symptoms??? That means you can spread without even knowing you yourself is the carrier. You wear a mask only when you're unwell? By the time you're unwell, everyone else is alrdy infected.  Maybe some of you guys dont go around the neighbourhoods or take public transport that's why you dont understand how theres tons of irresponsible people out there coughing at peoples face. Irresponsible aside, theres also those who dont see the seriousness in this, the older generation especially. Pretty sure they will only start wearing if the government tells them to and emphasize the severity of the situation.   Sorry to be rude but please wake up. If you want to convince us that its not a severe case yet for us all to be wearing mask, then show us some scientific proof that we're safe without doing so.

This statement is very wrong for this Wuhan Virus as it spreads before it shows symptoms.   By not wearing mask is encouraging the virus to spread faster. Those in public services including transportation services should be make to wear mask since they meet general public by the hundreds each day.  Covering up and protecting oneself is the best prevention unless Singapore does not have the ready stock for everyone to last couple of months.

These 2 cities are not locked down and the China government most likely will not lock down these 2 cities . We have many travellers coming in from Beijing and Shanghai daily and they may also carry the virus . Checking their temperature upon arrival is almost useless as the incubation period is between 1 to 14 days . So we should deny entry to all travellers coming in from China .  We should not wait until the situation get out of control . We need to act fast ."

We know your addressed the general  masses as 'fellow Singaporeans' but CCS called us idiots. Is he saying this on a personal capacity  or is he representing the government to air his displeasure.   He further reiterated the reason/rational of telling Singaporeans to wear a mask only if you are sick it seems there is a hidden agenda; there is not enough masks to go around as opposed to other MP saying there is ample in the stockpile. Please address this pertinent query, as a Singaporean i am entitled to know. His derogatory mannerism is beyond tolerance. So far, we have not heard you as a Head of the country coming out to clarify his behaviour. I am utterly dismay at his command of the English language, it sets me wondering what has happened to our bilingualism policy.  Moreover, he admitted adopting different behaviour in public and in closed door concept. This is a very concerning point as our Minister. Care to address this. Thanks."

30087330,82522710,Valerie Lee,"Jan 28, 2020","Dear PM Lee,  first I really appreciate the measures that our country has taken including setting up quarantine facilities ; providing free masks and many others.  You, your leaders and many are working very hard to help manage and contain the situation.  But at the same time,  I am feeling very frustrated and worried with the climbing number of cases in SG.  All the cases are Chinese nationals who arrived SG on 19th Jan and after.  At that time, we already knew about the Virus, its source City Wuhan, and that it is highly infectious, spreading and taking lives .  So why did we still allow them to enter Singapore and freely move about. This is a burning question. Why we seemed slow to act towards this? As a result, SG though a very small country is now ranked top 3 behind China and Thailand.   Can we act fast and step up more effective measures before it is too late.  As the saying goes... you got to nip it at the bud.  We got to stop people from the high risk Country ( and not just Wuhan city) from coming into our land . Or at least they should be quarantined upfront for 2 weeks upon arrival before joining our civilization.  The schools and companies are already stepping up measures and asking those who have been to China or been in close contact with such ;  to stay away from their premises .  But their efforts alone are not going to be enough.  We need our Country to do the same and stop them on our shores.   Second,  those from Wuhan who are still amongst us, can we trace and quarantine-  so that we don’t have new cases each day and they have already made contact with many others by then.  I seek your consideration and hope to hear your responses.  We continue to look to your leadership , vigilance and courage to protect our country, our home, our people.  Let’s unite and stand up for Singapore.  Respectfully yours ...."

30087330,82522710,Jimmy Beany,"Jan 28, 2020","That's not enough because the virus has already spread beyond residents of Hubei province to people in major cities in China like Beijing and Shanghai. Add to the fact that China has always not been forthcoming with their infection rates medical data, there is a real risk that anyone from China coming into Singapore now can be carriers, do not display fever symptoms and go on to then infect people in Singapore.   Philippines and North.Korea has already closed their borders to China.   The fact that the government has not closed borders with China is a major reason why people are panicking and stockpiling face masks.  https://sg.news.yahoo.com/wuhan-virus-petitions-in-singapore-calling-to-ban-travellers-from-china-making-rounds-101950658.html"

30087330,82522710,Michael Yee,"Jan 30, 2020",Your office temperature and humidity is conducive for virus growth like SARS or Wuhan viruses. Scientists have found that dried SARS CoV can retain its viability for 5 days in temperature between 22 and 25 degree celsius. At higher temperature of 38 degree and humidity >95% its viability is rapidly lost.  So we should  not create an ambient environment for these viruses to grow. I guess our National Infectious Disease Centre or SGH temperature and humidity level is currently most conducive for the Wuhan viruses to retain its virility.
30087330,82522710,Chrys Lewis,"Jan 28, 2020","Dear PM Lee, Govt will no longer release its stockpile to retailers - doesn't this move exacerbate the shortage situation? I have been going around day and night to look for blue surgical masks, even happy if I could get 10, yet there is none. I doubt the hoarders buy by one box each at a retailer. So holding back stockpile does not solve the situation of many. OK, so now we have a precious commodity of 4. Time to salute the govt :D Sure healthy ones- dont need to wear a mask. But almost every time I am commuting, I  get ""sneezed at"" at least once. Dear Govt people, please take a train or bus or wait in a line for transport.. to understand the ""risk"" the hoi polloi commuters are exposed to.. i.e. haaaa chooo, cough cough cough.."

30087330,82522710,Rachel Rox,"Jan 28, 2020",I arrived in Changi Airport from Indonesia yesterday. There was no screening for us. Also saw alot of China people arriving in the airport and many are not wearing masks. These people may not care about hygiene or rules. Why are we risking our lives and health because of these people who do not care about rules or health of other people?
30087330,82522710,Karen Fu,"Jan 28, 2020","So this is now finally officially declared urgent case. We need to play our part to protect our community.  There is still a lack of face masks around. But I think to wear it all day long outdoors is almost impossible as it is both uncomfortable to start off with apart from the fact you need to take it off at some point. Cleanliness and strict hygiene helps but the  critical point is still, I   think would be that of a temporary ban of travellers from China. It would be appropriate to safeguard our health interests due to the very nature of the coronavirus. 1 month ban would do.  Apart from this, I would like to suggest home based learning and working instead of travelling out for the time being. We should make use of technology to get us through this period.  Perhaps ordering food and groceries could be made via online too. Get professionals to deliever them to the door instead of people travelling out. This way it cuts down the risk of contacting the virus."

30087330,82522710,Cecilia Lee,"Jan 28, 2020","Hi Mr PM Lee, can you kindly give parents the free will or free choice to decide whether we allow our children to go to school tomorrow or stay at home for 14 days?  Fyi, there are some parents who prefer their children to stay at home for 14 days to prevent further outbreak of the Coronavirus. We believe prevention is better than cure and sometimes it is good to be a bit kiasu. So even if there is an outbreak of the virus within schools, this group of parents will not blame MOE. Fyi, some people including my family can't buy a single piece of mask as everywhere is out of stock. We don't wish to put our kids at risk as they need to travel to and fro school by public transport.  For those parents who are comfortable to let their children to go to school tomorrow, they can go ahead to do so. No one is stopping them.   Of course, it will be even better if MOE can announce closing of schools for 14 days. Just like the previous SARS situation.  I seriously and sincerely hope you can consider and approve our requests.  Thank you."

30087330,82522710,长宁,"Jan 28, 2020","Looking at the statistics so far released and noticing their patterns, it is true that the virus spreads very fast. But its fatality rate is not so alarming. So far about 25 deaths are added today while about 1800 new cases are confirmed. The day before it was 24 deaths for the day and about 700 new cases. From these numbers, we see that while the number of deaths remains somewhat stable, the spreading rate doubles. The same pattern was observed on earlier days. If this is anything to go by, the death figure for tomorrow will be between 140 and 150. But the number of confirmed cases may reach 9000 cases going by the pattern. At this spreading rate, it's going to overwhelm the medical team and logistical arrangements in Wuhan. I am sure our government is aware of it. A very important point to note is that recovery rate from the disease is very low too. Coupled with low death rate and rapid increase in new cases, the resultant demand for more hospital wards and beds is going to be alarming. This must be taken into account in formulating our contingency plan. As it is believed that the virus is potent even during the incubation period, which stretches from 2 days to 14 days, there's no way of telling if we already have carriers walking around without showing any symptoms. So the best safeguard for Singaporeans now is to wash hands regularly, avoid crowded places and wear mask in those places. I hope by now free masks are available."

30087330,82522710,Bhavin Vora,"Jan 28, 2020","Dear PM  I write this message as a Singaporean who is gravely concerned for the well being of all Singapore citizens and residents, and who is worried at the style and speed with which your government is acting.  1. First Observation - within a matter of days, Singapore has run out of face masks. None of the pharmacies I visited today have a single piece of mask left. Why is this so? Is it because our supply chain is not robust? Is it because we allowed visitors to buy an indiscriminate number of masks? Are these visitors exporting masks? Are businesses being held accountable or are they diverting the masks to the next most profitable client / country? Is the government doing anything to investigate / verify / and place measures to counteract the above-mentioned points via solid actions? I strongly recommend that the government work to Ensure a strong supply of masks. A suggestion - Restrict Tourists to purchase only 1 piece per passport per day and reserve at least X pieces of mask per Singapore residing household per day, depending on the number of family members. You have all the data. Please Ensure that you remember a fundamental principle: Singaporeans should be entitled to a safe environment and it is your duty to deliver on that entitlement.  2. Second observation - Only today was it released that Hubei residents will be restricted from entering Singapore. 3 questions come to mind - Why only Hubei and not Whole of China? n-COV is more contagious than SARS. Why only today and not within 48 hours of the crisis? Why did we allow approx 2000 China visitors to roam the streets freely? I am sure you and your team of able Ministers had consulted very able and talented Doctors, Professors, International agencies. It is public news days ago that this virus is more virulent and contagious than SARS. Should stronger measures not have been put into place within 24-48H of the virus becoming international news? Have you questioned the speed, efficiency and confidence with which you and your fellow ministers have put in place measures?  Minister, do remember that the health & safety of all Singaporeans is your responsibility.  And it seems to many Singaporeans at this juncture, that this responsibility is not being carried out well. Prove us wrong. Just ask yourself if we want Singaporean deaths and infections arising from this. Many families will suffer the consequences.  Please also activate our defence force . The army ambulances should be activated to cope, non-sensitive camps should be used as a “fever centre” to ease the load on Hospitals and GPs.   Please, implement with speed. Take a strong stand, and take risks, that would pay off for the well being of Singaporeans.   Thank you."

30087330,82522710,Shi Yee Ong,"Jan 28, 2020","I follow the Wuhan virus news closely like most ordinary folks out there, especially when I have the vulnerable young and elderly.  I believe this Wuhan virus is not causing huge panic here in Singapore, but more of frustration.  The latest frustration would be the lack of face masks, despite the assurances from the government that face masks are readily available. Showing photos of warehouse stock full of face masks only add to our frustration as many people were trying to just get hold of some for themselves and their family. I believe most of us are civic-minded and will not buy in bulk so that everyone has the chance to get their hands on the masks.  I can say I am responsible, taking care of personal hygiene, covering up when sneezing or coughing and go out less often. Likewise for my family. But you just need one irresponsible person to sneeze and cough in public without covering and people surrounding this person would be affected (especially now where most of us could not even get any masks - how to protect oneself then?).  As such, masks should be available to all households during this critical period. If this is still not deem as critical period, then what is? Till a community breakout? We should always “Hope for the Best but Prepare for the Worst”.  I feel that RCs come in particularly handy during this period. Instead of organizing tours and distributing free fruits to residents, RCs can be the  designated point for each household to pick up their masks.   The RC can be open for residents at their estate to pick up the masks during weekends (Sat and Sun).  Each person should get 7 masks to tide over one week. One person in each household will go collect on behalf of all, taking photo of the NRIC/birth cert of the person staying in the household. This is to verify how many people are staying in the house by verifying the address. I know some will say “privacy” issue, but we are not talking about joining contests or whatsoever. We are talking about critical period where masks have been flying off the shelves and leaving many with none. This will allow control and the government can stock-take their masks and not cause any further frustration.  The same exercise will happen again one week later so that no one will stock so many masks at home unnecessarily.  Some might point out that this is a logistic nightmare. But what is logistic nightmare when this Wuhan virus is already causing deaths in China and we now know it can be transmitted human-to-human? I believe such distribution can surely be done.   In addition, restricting Wuhan people from arriving to Singapore is definitely a late, but welcome move; but many have already escaped the “loophole” of the lockdown period. As CNY ends soon, many would be coming back to Singapore to work. Serving LOA is not going to deter them from going out; it serves not much purpose actually, if that individual is a selfish and irresponsible being. The best way would be to ferry them to Pulau Ubin (as Outward Bound is reported to be a quarantine facility) the moment they arrive in Singapore and quarantine these people for two weeks to ensure they are “all-clear” before stepping foot into our densely populated country.  I believe if the government is swifter in their decision, people would be less frustrated. We as Singaporeans will stand united to fight this Wuhan virus together, so as our pledge says   “We, the CITIZENS of Singapore. Pledge ourselves as one UNITED people”  人民一心，打到病菌"

30087330,82522710,Michael Kim,"Jan 28, 2020","“29 Jan, 7.30pm JUST IN: There are 10 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore as of 2pm today. All of them are Chinese nationals, with 9 Wuhan residents.”  It started with 2 cases and increased to 10 within a very short period of time. While many Asian countries had already stopped Chinese visitors onto their shores, Singapore just only stopped Chinese nationals with Hubei passports to enter. A most effective way to contain the current situation in my opinion but only came way too late; with the slightest consolation is that it’s better late than never.   Please DO NOT just look at the absolute numbers.  Even so, with 10 confirmed cases thus far, it isn’t even reflecting good anyway.   Geographical and population size wise, Singapore is the smallest of all the countries that have confirmed cases of the Coronavirus. Put that into percentage against geographic and/or population size, we are undoubtedly ranked No.1 in terms of confirmed cases as of this moment.  Singapore strives to be No.1 in the world in many aspects but certain No.1’s isn’t worth it.   I strongly believe this number or percentage could have been better contained or stopped from rising had our government implement the temporary ban on Chinese nationals (at least those holding onto Hubei passports) much earlier. This approach came late because the government have over estimated their abilities to contain the situation at the earlier stage.  Please do not put fellow Singaporeans and our medical personnel into further risks by reacting slower.   There is not much use by telling people to practise good hand hygiene, wear masks, stay calm and vigilant etc if we keep allowing the risks to come in.  Do something more timely and practical please, monitor and react/implement the most effective ways to combat the situation.   Just like when SPF wasn’t capable to stop the Little India Riot, and while alcohol is a catalyst but not the root cause, the government took to banning alcohol almost immediately after the incident, islandwide after certain hours.  Then why can’t we refuse the entry of Chinese nationals or at least people from Wuhan way earlier then?   And though it’s nothing wrong to do some good deeds in times like this where we have donated 120,000 masks to Wuhan but why are our people needing to wait long in queues to buy masks, and some shops even jack up the prices and nothing is done to improve the situation here? Eg., if we can send masks to Wuhan, it is also much appreciated if the MOH could send out masks at places where there’ll be crowds like MRT stations too rather than just telling people to stay vigilant. Surely we have more than enough in our surplus to give out masks to the public especially in times like this and the reason couldn’t have been more valid."

Do hope that there is a cure soonest and that there is no need for pulau ubin to be used as quarantine area for this virus.  Below stated is what has been shared and posted by someone claimed from medical facility.   Thanks to the sender  Good News re: CORONA Virus  1st good News: China has developed a testing kit for CoronaVirus & will have it distributed nationwide. It can accurately confirm the presence of coronavirus on any suspect who has fever within 2-3hours. (Don’t know if this will soon be available in our country).  2nd good news: The new coronavirus can’t stand high-temperature environments.  -CoronaVirus will die in 56’C environment for 30mins.  -Utensils should be regularly sterilised /disinfected or boiled in 100’C water to totally eliminate all viruses. -eat cooked foods; don’t eat raw foods for the time being.  3rd good news: New coronavirus is easily eradicated by medical grade alcohol. -75%alcohol or  Chlorine disinfectant can effectively eliminate the coronavirus.  (Tip: bring alcohol in your bag to regularly disinfect your hands esp while outdoors; use alcohol to sanitize doorknobs in your home if someone develops flu-like symptoms; keep those who get sick inside their bedroom or bring to a doctor immediately).   According to a research professor’s advice: this winter; those with heating system in the house should keep the indoor temperature above 20’C. Don’t worry about wastage of electricity. -Coronavirus can’t survive long in a warm environment. Thus all households should keep the house heating & ventilation system on during this period. (Praying that our warmer climate is enough deterrant to its spread here.)  Thank you."

I doubt we can find another government which can match this level of efficiency. May I just suggest that instead of mass collection which could increase the risk of potential infection. How about Using postal delivery to send out the masks? This would cut unnecessary queuing and gathering of large groups during this period.

30087330,82522710,Hwee Kuan Tan,"Jan 28, 2020",Good morning!everybody I have some very heartwarming  n rather important views regarding the Wuhan virus which i wanna share w everybody.yes.no doubt bcos of this infectious n scary virus it has indeed caused much fears  n scaring every Sporean .not just only us Sporeans but the whole world is very worried n frankly speaking very alarmed.however i personally feel that we cannot just bcos of one fatality n 106 cases bcos of this serious virus therfore ban those Hubei or china people from travelling to n fro from Singapore.My most respected n highly esteemed  ministers  of Singapore.please kindly listen to an honest  yet sincere citizen of Spore.firstly as i have read through certain comments on this very sensitive issue regarding this Wuhan virus yes.of course it is indeed a very deadly n infectious virus.however we cannot  ban these businessmen from travelling to n fro from china to Spore n vice versa.firstly this ban if really put into implementation will indeed cause a lot of disharmony n inconvenience between China n our  country.the mutual well maintained closeness n friendship between China n Spore will be greatly affected diplomatically.Rather than banning Hubei chinaman from visiting Singapore why can't we sit down togethet n think of ways n methods on how to improve our own personal hygiene n cleanliness.i believe many sicknesses are the cause due to lack of personal hygiene.many occasions i personally see little children dropping sweets n these kids simply just picked up those sweets n popped them into their mouths again when their parents were not observing them.i understand that  very young children are not aware of personal hygiene.perhaps good hygiene habits ought to start from the home Such as teaching a child the proper n correct way of handwashing N the precautions one ought to take at this crucial moment like this.monitering a child's temperature when the child is down a fever.seeking help from a doc immediately if the fever is above 38.perhaps our Spore govt could implement some rather good n quick ways of checking up n making sure before these China man make a trip to Spore. Maybe a thorough medical report of their state of health within the past few weeks.a  full certified report to be presented before they can take the flight to Spore I personally believe in this saying When there is a will there is a way Let me ask the parliament one very honest n straightforward yet very direct question.if supposing one Sporean suddenly contracted a weird kind of deadly virus n he or she brings  this fatal n deadly vieus over to China how will these China  population react to this matter.sometime things might looked very  very complicated ncertain issues are indeed very sensitive but frankly speaking for me as a very good n honest Spore citizen i feel we ought not n must not bcos of one person who brings in this Wuhan virus then feel that it is the whole China who is at fault.rather than being so worried n scared what the govt needs to do now is to think of a way of .to solve this edgy issue.prevention is better than cure.the parents are the one who can teach n train a child very well good hygiene habits.maybe we ought to consider the pros n cons  N sit down  n hopefully a new vaccine might be found to save our lives from this virus.perhaps at the customs there ought to be more stands for some kinds of medical check upd.perhaps those coming to n fro from Hubei need to provide a full  cerified report of their medical n health condition for the past few werks before they bard the plane headed 4  Spore.thank u.Sir.for your listening ears.i  have to rush to work.thank u have a great day

While those wanting to go on with their lives and work SHOULD be wearing the mask as the virus only show symptoms after a few days of infection. So you might be standing next to an infected person without any protection and not know it. Would you take that chance?

29994636,6782990,Sandeep Sander,"Jan 26, 2020","Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong, Your analysis is excellent and Singapore is a great country. If I may, I will challenge the strategy of Singapore as a nation. I think it is time to ""rethink"" the future competitive advantages of your great nation. In my view the new key-word could be ""co"" - i.e. Cooperating, Co-branding, Co-developing and so on. In addition to working with US/China, maybe there is an important potential related to the European Union (EU) including (other) small nations like Denmark. I am happy to elaborate and/or connect you ans your team to relevant persons. Wishing Singapore and you all the best.  (Lived in Singapore 2013-16)"
