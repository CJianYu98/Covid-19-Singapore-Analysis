40028555,73110450,A Devaraj,Jan-24,"A timely and most important  advice, dear Prime Minister. I am very very proud of your dynamic and devoted leadership qualities. I am not a Singaporean, but an Indian. I thankfully appreciate the care and concern you had shown for the people of Singapore. May God bless you and all the people of the great nation i.e. Singapore."
40028555,73110450,Ben Alphons,Jan-23,Well said Mr. Lee we have really succeeded all because of our efforts had worked. Imagine our neighbours we should be proud of our team and citizens who have done a great job.
40028555,73110450,Granny Oskar,Jan-23,Thank you PM Lee for your concern for our Singaporeans. We are very blessed to have you as our PM.

40028555,73110450,Kyris Koh,Jan-23,"Thank you PM Lee, its a long fight ahead and we should not be complacent.  Just a suggestion, maybe can consider rolling out the swab testing and  making it compulsory instead of optional to all the retailers and their employees so as to pick up any cases since many people are going out to shop.thank you."
40028555,73110450,Jessie Lee,Jan-23,"Thank you to our PM Lee Hsien Loong.. & all his personals, we r so proud of you all..everyone Jia u💪💪💪"

40028555,73110450,Chua Swee Hua,Jan-23,Good afternoon Mr PM Lee Hsien Loong .

40028555,73110450,Maimie Mg Mg,Jan-24,Prevention is better than cure Covid is not going to wrap up anytime soon! Cases are surging by the day. People  need to be more vigilant than ever!  Staying in  touch  with mandatory directives is crucial.   Protecting oneself is critical.  You are like father to the people and soooo caring limiting  their  movement during this Merry Time.  People listen to you because they love you too.  Otherwise Covid is sure to limit your lifespan!
40028555,73110450,Sim Tieng Tieng,Jan-23,"Indeed cny 2021 will b very different. Hang on everyone, together we will brave this tough storm ahead..."
40028555,73110450,Sunny Kun,Jan-23,Very strong and strict law. Useful for the pandemic n. In my country this rule is impossible never ever happen. Proud of Singapore
40028555,73110450,Ramsey,Jan-23,Yes We have come so far  Cannot ruin everything by being complacent.  We are hosting the WEF in May which will be a massive boost to us We can show the whole world how it's done  Hope by then a large part of the community is vaccinated
40028555,73110450,J SP Filmer,Jan-23,"Somehow Mr. Lee, I fear that many will not necessarily follow these simple and sensible requirements. The gov has provided a safe space for us all, too safe, so much so, too many take it all for granted. We cannot and must not go the way of our neighbors and our friends even in Korea that had it all under control. Somewhere and somehow, the gov needs to address these folks that think the gov is to blame for allowing limited travel to Singapore. I understand why we need it and the reasonable risks we need to take, but I think many do not, or don't want to hear anything else, unless it aligns with what they think is the best way. We have done well. I hope and pray we will continue to do well. Stay the course and we will prevail..."
40028555,73110450,Jessie SH Chhan,Jan-24,"One problem is smoking corner.  Smokers obviously have to remove their masks and stand close together to smoke coz it’s usually crowded.  And sometimes passing around lighters. Another that makes me cringe is folks who remove their masks to eat and drink while walking, chatting. Are they allowed to do that?"
40028555,73110450,Winnie Ip,Jan-23,"I don’t even mind to be in lockdown again, if it is what it takes to control the spread.  Thanks Mr. PM , for making the right decisions. "
40028555,73110450,Liu Huaiwen,Jan-23,"Fatigue is setting in. Citing major upcoming events and positive case(s) detected in this group of visitors, please consider keeping meeting attendees at the Expo Hotel and meeting venue whilst piloting MICE events again. Also all entering and transferring thru Singapore should present a vaccination cert or a negative test result from approved overseas institutions. They should still be subjected to prevailing measures at all entry points. The more safeguards in place the better we can manage and protect the interests of the population."
40028555,73110450,Krysan Permana,Jan-24,"If traceability is the reason, then have a portal for people to register household visits during that periode. Afterwards, host can put out the permit for neighbors to see. This will help SPF by reducing multiple complaint calls, also stronger contract to abide to when protocol breach occur."
40028555,73110450,Esther Mei,Jan-23,Well said. Better keep safe than sorry later. Let's have a quiet peaceful Lunar New Year2021🎋
40028555,73110450,Terry Prairie,Jan-23,Thanks PM Lee for the remind and concern . Have a great 2021 ahead
40028555,73110450,Joshim Chongtm,Jan-23,It's a marathon... not yet finish. ..hopefully we are already halfway... i think we are at the right pace.. We just need to reserve energy to finish this pandemic race. 🏁 All the best Singapore 🇸🇬 ❤ 👍  加油!
40028555,73110450,Ong Yong Peng,Jan-24,"I agree that additional measures over the Chinese New Year period is necessary to prevent further outbreaks in the community. We have seen that the new COVID19 variants from three different continents has complicated the situation in several countries a little more.  It is great that Singapore is staying on top of the pandemic with the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine, and adjusting public health measures to keep new community cases low. It is great to know that the vaccine is being provided to frontline workers and the elderly as priority. Hopefully, the vaccine is also effective against the new variants, otherwise the time, money and resources committed may be wasted."
40028555,73110450,Zaw Win,Jan-23,We love Singapore.
40028555,73110450,Renggamal Manokaran,Jan-23,"PM Lee, the president of Uganda gave a very good speech on the pandemic Wonder if you read that speech by  Yoweri Museveni"
40028555,73110450,Chua Swee Hua,Jan-23,Haha be Safe while still can enjoy doing the CNY preparation
40028555,73110450,Raymond Lee,Jan-23,Shldn't we tightened on the number of imported cases 1st instead of pushing the blame and restricting the local community. We have visitors who do not even need to be quarantine and there are already cases that are negatives when 1st tested and later tested positive. They could be the one that spreads it to our community.
40028555,73110450,Khim Lee,Jan-24,Please take steps as well to review condition in Mrt as there are many close contacts due to crowded trains.
40028555,73110450,Shawnking Lai,Jan-23,"Plugging the loop holes from imports  is very important and urgent  It is proven 14 days quarantine for imports may not be enough , we should increase to 21 days or more . And insist  weekly swab test for 4 weeks minimum !   Tightening community safe distancing measure may not be hitting the nail on the head !😊"
40028555,73110450,Kelvin Low,Jan-23,"We will overcome, tomorrow will be better"
40028555,73110450,Neeti Agarwal,Jan-23,How come cases increased in Singapore again.....😌😑 We were following masks and social distancing so well
40028555,73110450,Peggy Oin,Jan-23,My family and I was planning this arrangement or might even be tighter like Hari Raya. During Hari Raya last year the Muslim arrangement was much tighter than current CNY so we should also try to be like during then too
40028555,73110450,Chia Tat Tee,Jan-23,What I can say is singapore still the best!👍
40028555,73110450,William Siong,Jan-23,People should learn to shut up their mouth when commuting via bus or rail. There's not enough posters reminding people about this and it can also empower others to tell people to shut up for safety reason.
40028555,73110450,Gan Pak Lim,Jan-23,Technology can help: Just 2 suggestions  We can record the auspicious words and playback on Bluetooth speakers on restaurant tables.  Or record a sound clip in our phones and play them in unison during the tossing.  Please consider. 
40028555,73110450,Anastasia Wun,Jan-23,"Thanks Premier Lee & team for the vigilant watch & new measures. Lately, most people hv become quite complacent and lax & seem to be flouting rules openly. While SG has managed to sort of control the situation, neighbouring country has shot way up the C-19 tally table. Hope our people will continue to be vigilant & take cautionary measures at all times to prevent any rise in new cases during the festive period 🙏"
40028555,73110450,蔡美真,Jan-23,U are asking ppl to abide the new rules but by opening the airport .. u are just bringing in more cases then wats the point of us being so guai ...
40028555,73110450,Simon Yong,Jan-23,"Well,  why don't we tossing yusheng with our mask on & play our own pre-recorded auspicious phrases out from our mobile phone to replace we  shout out on the spot..isn't it better & have CNY mood ?  More meaningful for  the event !"
40028555,73110450,Neo Kok Wei Emmanuel,Jan-23,Ownself allow imported cases to come in freely and cause spike in community cases... In the end Singaporeans suffer cos of it
40028555,73110450,Laremie Tan,Jan-23,All the rules are fine but 10 should be the limit for house visitation during CNY!
40028555,73110450,Gerald  Ng,Jan-23,"Agree.. If really sincere, there are 365 days can visit. No need wait till CNY."
40028555,73110450,Ah Kum Chow,Jan-25,"Good afternoon sir but a funny thing happened at Changi airport last night, we arrived from Sydney on 24jan 7.30pm but we were not tested although we have already paid for co.19 tests at Sg airlines counter over in Aust. even though we have bought tickets home, policy was no payment no boarding pass! Arrived at Changi we kept on asking about tests, was given bracelets packs at immigration, told to go home quarantine and wait for few days later for information to go and get tests, go online get refund because tests are free. Dangerous situation as well as confusion. 20 passengers arrive on Sg airlines, some transfer to other airlines, you never know who got co.19 but not showing symptoms. We will stay home for at least 2weeks ourselves be responsible persons. Wish you and family have a happy reunion dinner and happy Chinese New Year holidays."
40028555,73110450,Robert Polich,Jan-23,"Wash your hands often, social distance, wear a mask.  ...Video visit.  Wishing everyone in Singapore a Happy and healthy holiday.  "
40028555,73110450,Kannan Srinivasan,Jan-23,Thanks sir for the update and concern. All should follow rules to save each other.
40028555,73110450,Dorcas Ho Lee Koon,Jan-26,Unfortunately it's an advice not a rule for visiting family members only... I know many people already planning to hold food and drinking gatherings for different groups of 8 friends on different days....
40028555,73110450,Anthony Teo,Jan-24,"A very good way to stop home visitation is to mandate majority Chinese armed forces units like Air Force and Armour to mobilize during the CNY period. With one less family member at home, people are less likely to go out and visit."
40028555,73110450,Harjit Bhatia,Jan-25,"Very wise and timely move , indeed ! Covid is still very much lurking around the globe . We should not let our guards down and avoid pitfalls experienced by some of the other nations ."
40028555,73110450,Ong Ah Heng,Jan-23,We all have been enjoying this pandemic. No addition effort nor sacrifice. The pandemic has made life better 
40028555,73110450,Jimmy Lam,Jan-25,"If we do not take this pandemic seriously, I really worry that we may see an uncontrollable spike-up in infections after CNY, much like what Ireland experienced in January when they became complacent during the Christmas holidays.  We can ill-afford another costly budget should the situation become bad again. Setting quota on the number of visits and visitors is a good start but the risks of complacency still linger. Hopefully, we all will bear in mind the severity of the consequences and watch what we do during CNY. Wear a mask when visiting except when eating or drinking; do not dig into food or snacks directly with your chopsticks or bare hands, practise social distancing when there are guests; avoid coughing, shouting or singing karaoke at home, and practise  good hygiene to keep everyone safe. I hope brochures can be handed to every household and be posted in the house to remind everyone of such measures during CNY."
40028555,73110450,Amy Chai,Jan-27,"Dearest PM Lee, I guess it's okay to enjoy ourselves as long as we don't disturb the peace of others...the bible says eat, drink and be merry! So let's carry on our CNY celebrations and all other celebrations year after year!"

40028555,73110450,Peter Shi,Jan-25,Thanks Mr Lee. We have had too many imported cases which will cause community cases eventually.
40028555,73110450,Carrine Cheong,Feb-09,"Good day everyone. Just want to confirm ,cny eve should also be done with family members only and not to include friends."
40028555,73110450,Wei Teck,Jan-24,"btw how many will actually follow the new rules next Tues 🙄  sure have some ignored it and happily celebrate and then wait for cases to spike both in community or imported ones...  maybe they will regret their decisions after CNY but the rest of us whom follow will suffer for their actions...   enforcement actions going to be difficult since there are quite many places with limited nos. of Enforcement Officers, and SG Clean and Safe Distancing Ambassadors"

40028555,73110450,Chin Chee Hong,Jan-25,Sir . Can i clarify on the point of visiting family members only? Would it be fine for someone to visit only one household during CNY period and that household only receive up to 8 distinct visitor per day. This clarification is important given the high number of Our foreign friend in Singapore who might only have friends in Singapore and not family members. We want to make them feel the warmth and welcome in this difficult time. Appreciate your clarification on this Sir. Thank You in advance and Happy Chinese New Year .

I cannot for the life of me understand how we can continue to allow short term visits from some of the most afflicted countries in the region - does the committee/MOH really have confidence in the veracity of the tests dun in places where things can b ""bought""?  It is also shocking that the committee did not make it a requirement for all the visitors to b financially able shld they need medical attention here - such as the purchase of insurance. Is $30k enuff ? - until recently.  Who foots the bill for folks who can't pay up???  Both quarantine at hotel as well as hospital stay??  Truly amazing these things cld b overlooked!

A day that we would gather with our family & relatives to strenghten the bond.  Despite the restriction, we still embrace Hari Raya with open heart & mind & celebrate within the capacity of the situation.   We baked/ bought Hari Raya goodies & cakes & cooked/ ordered Hari Raya dishes. We spring-cleaned our homes, decorate it to be raya-ready. We even put on our Baju Kurung, Baju Melayu, Baju Muslimah etc, regardless new or recycled. We still get ready, dressed up and give our best. We posed & take pictures.   Unlike previous years, we sat at our family sofa or any area in the comfort of our own home & meet our family, relatives & friends via Zoom, Google Meet or any other video-conferencing app.   We made this huge sacrifice to ensure we stay safe & able to see one another again.   Kudos to us! Amin. Syukur Alhamdullilah."

And one more thing I want to tell you, every expatriate in my country who works in Singapore, millions of people are praying for you, and I think you will be a model for all the prime ministers of the world for the rest of your life.  And they need to learn from those who do not establish human rights by sitting on their knees, oppressing people and oppressing them, they only benefit themselves.  People for people, let's all stand by the helpless people and speak out against injustice.  Sir, in the end I will say that you continue your great good deeds, may Allah have mercy on you inshaAllah."

32931024,34085770,Rithvekaa Amma,"May 24, 2020","*GRATITUDE*   As we prepare for and continue onwards into the lockdown, let’s say a little prayer of thanks.  I’m thankful that I have a house to lock myself in.  I’m thankful that I have food, medicines, water to drink, water to bathe in.   I’m thankful that I’m comfortable and staying in my own home, surrounded by my comforts and the people I love.  I’m thankful for electricity and WiFi, for my books and music. I’m grateful I can entertain myself.   I’m grateful I have the means to support my part time help, driver, etc., (as and where relevant) as they quarantine themselves too.  I’m thankful for the time and mental capacity to connect with my family members wherever.  I’m thankful that my family, friends and I are safe and healthy.  I pray that the daily wage labourer and anyone whose livelihood depends on daily work are supported and receive the aid they deserve.  I pray that all those away from their families and homes are well and safe.  I extend my prayers and thanks to the doctors, nurses, health practitioners, government officials, scientists and everyone else working tirelessly and at the risk to their own health to trace and treat every possible case and to do all they can to find a cure, curb the spread and eradicate the threat.  I pray that all those infected by the virus find the strength to fight and overcome it.   I pray for the atma of all those whose bodies have succumbed to the attack.  I pray that a solution is found soon and the virus disappears.   I pray we all come out of this, stronger and may we recognise, appreciate and respect everyday life.  I pray I am able to contribute in some way whatsoever, in whatever small or large way, other than following official instructions, to alleviate the sufferings of others and in supporting the efforts in any which way possible or called-upon to, to get a grip on the situation and defeat the looming threat to mankind.  May healing light of *Mother Nature* surround us all! 🙏🙏"

MOST EFFECTIVE AND SAFE DRUG TO CURE COVID 19 IN JUST THREE (3) DAYS MAY 24, 2020 PLEASE MANUFACTURE THE INGREDIENTS OR COMPONENTS OF FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION OR F.A.I. IN YOUR COUNTRY OF SINGAPORE  AND USE THIS DRUG TO CURE COVID 19 IN JUST THREE (3) DAYS!!! NOBODY WILL DIE IN SINGAPORE DUE TO COVID 19 IF SINGAPORE WILL USE FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION (FAI) TO CURE PEOPLE WITH COVID 19. THE COMPONENTS OR INGREDIENTS OF THIS F.A.I. DRUG ARE WRITTEN AND INDICATED IN THESE THREE (3) WEBSITES AND SINGAPORE CAN MANUFACTURE THE INGREDIENTS OR COMPONENTS OF THIS DRUG FOR COVID 19: 1. https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Aj85f-XIISPoJ%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Flibres.uncg.edu%2Fir%2Funcg%2Ff%2FElbourakadi_uncg_0154D_10788.pdf+&cd=2&hl=fil&ct=clnk&gl=ph 2. https://patents.google.com/patent/US6172053B1/en 3. https://patents.google.com/patent/US5492901A/en We must NOT stop at just testing if a person is positive for Covid 19 or not. We must provide all people the fastest and cheapest way to get rid, totally and completely, of the viruses inside his/her body in just three (3) days. Dr. El Bourakadi conducted this study about Fabunan Antiviral Injection (FAI) under the direction of the so-called ""Rock Star and Grandfather of All Drug Designers in the World"" - Dr. Ethan Will Taylor. This Fabunan Anti-viral Injection is the only true drug for Covid 19. In this study, which used the most advanced facilities, equipment, methods and techniques of the University of North Carolina in Greensboro or UNCG (""the drug research and development capital of the world""), it has been established that FAI not only inhibits the growth of virus-infected cells but KILLS virus-infected cells through ""Apoptosis."" It has likewise been established in this study that only FAI can KILL the drug-resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus. According to the Nobel-prize winning scientist who discovered and identified the HIV AIDS virus, Dr. Luc Montagnier,the Covid 19 virus is very similar to the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus. (Interviewed on the CNews channel in France, Montagnier asserted that the Covid 19 virus had been designed by molecular biologists, stating that it contains genetic elements of HIV, and that its characteristics could not have arisen naturally. Montagnier said that ""he didn’t know who had done it, or why, ""but suggested that possibly the goal had been to make an AIDS vaccine."") This is why no drug and no vaccine on earth can deal effectively with the Covid 19 virus just as no drug and no vaccine on earth can deal effectively with the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus EXCEPT FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION ONLY. As per the study of the UNCG on Fabunan Anti-viral Injection or F.A.I., only F.A.I. can KILL (not just inhibit the growth of) the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus. Therefore, if the Covid 19 virus is very similar to the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus, and only F.A.I. can kill, through Apoptosis, these drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus (as per UNCG study), then only F.A.I. can kill the thousands upon thousands of strains of the Covid 19 virus. This study of the UNC in Greensboro or UNCG (""the drug research and development capital of the world"") also shows without a doubt that Fabunan Anti-Viral Injection or F.A.I. attacks and KILLS only virus-infected cells and does NOT attack nor kill the GOOD cells of the body, through a mechanism called by scientists as ""selective toxicity"" or ""seltox."" This means that F.A.I. is safe for use even in INFANTS with Covid 19 as F.A.I. has indeed already been used to treat (in just 3 days) the Dengue of a nine months old patient without any side effect to the baby (see Note A hereunder)! What has the ""Rock Star and Grandfather of All Drug Designers in the World"" - Dr. Ethan Will Taylor - has to say about Fabunan Anti-viral Injection? Dr. Ethan Will Taylor, PhD, Principal HIV/AIDS investigator at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, stated “currently there is only one drug combination in the universe that we are aware of that possesses this rare pharmacologic activity and Fil-Am Tech., Inc. holds the patent on that combination.” ELBOURAKADI, NAJOUA, Ph.D. A Novel Method For The Selective Elimination Of HIV Infected Cells: Dexamethasone And Procaine As A C ELBOURAKADI, NAJOUA, Ph.D. A Novel Method For The Selective Elimination ... Note A -- Case Number 2; Dengue Fever K. P., nine months old, a female, infant child, from San Marcelino, Zambales, Philippines was accompanied by her mother for consultation at the Fabunan Medical Clinic on Sep. 22, 1996 due to intermittent fever (T=38° C.), with skin rashes, itchiness, and loss of appetite. Tourniquet test was positive with presence of petechial hemorrhage indicative of dengue fever. The patient was treated with intramuscular injections containing 15 mg procaine hydrochloride (0.75 ml of a 20 mg per ml solution) combined with 1 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (0.25 ml of a 4 mg per ml solution) (Denguevir-Fabunan Injection, child dosage) to make a total volume of 1 ml of injectable solution administered twice daily at more than a two hour interval for three days and coupled with supplemental oral rehydration solution. The patient had an improved appetite, all other signs and symptoms gradually disappeared and on the third day as an outpatient, the patient was discharged from the clinic fully recovered. Before going to the websites below, please first download and read from cover to cover the scientific study of the University of North Carolina in Greensboro (UNCG) about Fabunan Anti-viral Injection (FAI) in which Dr. Fabunan did not spend a single centavo because it is the UNCG which took care of ALL the expenses in the said scientific study conducted by the UNCG using UNCG's top-of-the-line facilities, equipment, methods, techniques, and the best scientists that UNCG has in its roster of drug researchers and developers. It is important to note that if you are a drug company and want your drug to be studied at the UNCG, you have to pay millions, if not billions, of US dollars before UNCG will accept your request. But for FAI of Dr. Fabunan, the UNCG took care of ALL the expenses.

32489257,35170110,Clara San,"May 8, 2020","Happy Vesak Day! 🌈Vesak Day is a significant day in the local Buddhist calendar.  🙏Let’s commemorate Vesak Day today by reaffirming our vow as Buddhists to strive for the peace and happiness in our world, our lives and that of others just before his passing, Shakyamuni Buddha urged his disciples to regard his teachings as their teacher because only the truth,the Law of life, is eternal . 💁‍♀️  He stressed that the way to pay homage to him was not merely by offering flowers, incense, and lights, but by truly and sincerely striving to follow his teachings. 🙏  The Essence of Shakyamuni’s teachings is contained in his highest teaching, the Lotus Sutra, which states that Buddhahood , a condition of absolute happiness and freedom from all fear and illusions, is inherent in all life, and is eternal.  👉This means that “ the Buddha” is nothing other than an ordinary person who is aware of this state in his or her life. The development of this inner life state can enable all people to overcome their problem and live a fulfilled and active life, engaging fully with others and society. ✨After Shakyamuni’s death, Buddhism spread in two main forms, the Theravada and the Mahayana. The sutras were translated into different languages and teachings were adopted and merged into different cultures in Asia- the origin of the great variety and diversity of the Buddhist teachings that exist today. 🙏  Great Buddhist Teachers like. T’ien-t’ai and Chang-an confirmed the Lotus Sutra as the greatest of the Buddha’s teachings, because of its teaching that everyone can manifest the Buddha state in their lives. Buddhism later reached Japan in many different schools. 🙏  Nichiren Daishonin after years of research, because convinced that the key to transforming people’s suffering and enabling society to flourish lay in the Lotus Sutra, and particularly its title,  Myoho Renge kyo. He declared that the correct Buddhist practice in this age is to chant Nam Myoho Renge kyo, which enables everyone to manifest one’s innate Buddhahood, gaining life force and wisdom to challenge any adverse circumstances, attaining enlightenment and true happiness throughout their lives.  🇷🇴 💙💛❤️The spirit is expressed in the objective of the SGI, as explained by President Ikeda states: “ Our goals is become happy not only ourselves, but to enable others to become happy as well. It is to bring harmony to local communities and to help our nations flourish and bring peace to the whole world. The lives of those who pray and work to achieve these goals pulse with faith dedicated to realising kosenrufu .”  🇷🇴As we commemorate Vesak Day today, let us reaffirm this spirit and the conviction that the practical philosophy of Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism teaches individual empowerment and inner transformation, which at the same time contribute to global peace."

Trump is out on his own.   Sad, the UN and the WHO have no ability to unite humankind to bring the best scientific brains under one roof to find a medical cure, vaccine and a reliable and efficient COVID-19 test kit soon.   Time is the essence.   The world will lose even more when many companies, economy, and countries go bust.   Hundreds and thousands of billions would be wiped off compared to the US$8b.   Peanuts."
