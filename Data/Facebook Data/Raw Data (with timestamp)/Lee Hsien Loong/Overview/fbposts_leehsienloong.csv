It is an outsiderâ€™s perspective on what SDAs do, and their important role keeping Singapore safe. Ensuring that safety measures are observed is a difficult job. Many SDAs have experienced unpleasant encounters with members of the public while doing their work. But by and large Singaporeans have cooperated and complied, and that has kept all of us safe.

The number of daily cases in the community has come down considerably. More patients have now recovered and been discharged, than are still receiving care. But COVID-19 is far from defeated.

I know many of you are looking forward to seeing your friends in school again, or visiting parents and grandparents. But we must remain cautious and vigilant.

Please keep your guard up. Maintain safe distancing, wear masks when outdoors and at work, watch your personal hygiene and wash hands frequently. Avoid crowds and gatherings. If we all do this, then life can go on more or less normally after the circuit breaker. We donâ€™t want COVID-19 cases to spike up again, and be forced to tighten up once more.

Dealing with COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. Even after a vaccine is found, everything will not simply go back to the way it was before. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable our way of life is. But it has also given us the opportunity to prove our mettle, and come back stronger.

As we end this circuit breaker, I thank everyone again for playing your part, so that we can now reopen safely. We must all keep at it together. Do not allow the sacrifices of our healthcare workers and others who have kept Singapore running to be in vain. â€“ LHL

However, we canâ€™t revert to status quo ante. The circuit breaker has worked, and our situation is improving. But the battle against COVID-19 is far from over. That is why we are reopening in gradual phases, with F&B dine-ins only allowed after we are confident that community transmission will stay low. We have seen other countries that have opened up experiencing a resurgence of cases. All it takes is a single infected person to create a new cluster.

We cannot stay closed forever, so we have to get used to a new normal, adjusting our routines to live and work safely despite this global pandemic. Let us continue working together to keep COVID-19 at bay. We will emerge stronger from this experience. â€“ LHL

We are working to break the chain of transmission in the dorms, to reduce the number of new cases. It will take some time to show results, so we must expect to see more dorm cases for a while longer. But we are building up our healthcare and isolation facilities to handle the load.

In the broader community, there are a few early signs that the circuit breaker is bringing cases down. But we are still worried about hidden cases circulating in our population, which are keeping the outbreak going.

#DoNotWasteOur5bn

We are implementing the 28-day circuit breaker to suppress the spread of COVID-19. It is inconvenient and costly. To ease the pain for all of us â€“ households, workers and firms â€“ the government is spending $5bn in the Solidarity Budget, including money from our Reserves.

All we need to do is to Stay Home! I know many of us are staying home. But our Enforcement Officers are still finding people, young and old, gathering in groups day and night on the 2nd day of our circuit breaker. Exercise groups are still meeting in the parks. A good number still do not observe safe distancing when queueing, especially in the markets. These are where clusters of infections can be born.

Our Enforcement Officers have been tirelessly walking the ground. They issued 3,000 advisories today. Fewer than yesterday, but only because the groups dispersed when advised. The point is that there are still many gatherings in public places. This is very worrying.

I ask everyone to take the circuit breaker with the utmost seriousness. We have published the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, to authorise Enforcement Officers to act. From tomorrow if Enforcement Officers come across persons gathered in public, they will issue them written warnings immediately, BEFORE dispersing them. Subsequent infringements will incur a fine or prosecution in court.

We need to work together:
Let's all Stay Home
Go out only for essentials
Wear a mask when you go out

If we do all these, we can hope to see infections decrease over the next few weeks, and to go out more again after the circuit breaker ends.

Today we saw a record 142 new cases. Almost all were local ones. We are already 2 days into the circuit breaker! If we continue like this, all our sacrifices will be in vain, and so too the $5bn Solidarity Budget.

I'm sure we have the resolve to Stay Home. 26 days left. Let's show the world that we can!

1,3.18E+15,"The full suite of â€œcircuit breakerâ€ measures kicked in today. Cabinet still had to meet, but we separated into two locations, connected via teleconferencing. We also spaced out to maintain safe distancing, and wore masks to keep our droplets to ourselves.

The â€œcircuit breakerâ€ is essential to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. As we expected, daily numbers of new cases are still going up, and faster than before. We must bring the numbers down, and the only way is for all of us to observe the circuit breaker measures strictly.

Stay at home, except when you have to go out to do essential work or buy food. If you need to go to the market, stagger your timing too. Avoid being part of the crowd. This is not a month long holiday, when we can go out for jalan jalan or to meet up with friends.

The health of us all depends on the actions of each of us. Please do your part. â€“ LHL

1,3.18E+15,"Today is the first day of COVID-19 circuit breaking measures. It is timely that we also rounded up the debate on the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets.

Glad that all Members of Parliament supported the measures. They raised useful ideas to improve the policies to support businesses, workers and households through this crisis.

While we deal with immediate challenges, we must keep an eye on the future too. The MPs raised a relevant question: we do need to use the reserves now, but are we being fiscally prudent enough? Will we still have enough reserves to do more later, if the situation calls for it?

When this is over, the past will not come back. Hence DPM Heng Swee Keat set up two initiatives to think ahead â€” a taskforce on Emerging Stronger to cover the economy, as well as a new emphasis on social resilience under the Singapore Together Movement.

Beyond the Budget measures, it will be our own determination and discipline that will see us through, and keep us safe for the future. â€“ LHL

1,3.18E+15,"Today is World Health Day â€“ a global health campaign organised by the World Health Organization (WHO). This yearâ€™s theme celebrates the work of nurses and midwives â€” a fitting one to salute the healthcare professionals working selflessly and tirelessly to care for patients in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I was cheered by this video of â€œHomeâ€ sung by around 70 of our healthcare workers, and dedicated to all Singaporeans and fellow healthcare workers. Glad to see them positive and in good spirits during these tough times. My deepest thanks to all of you for your dedication and commitment to save lives and bring comfort to the ill and infirm.

1,3.17E+15,"We are all fighting COVID-19 together. The circuit breaker measures take effect tomorrow. They will affect us all.

DPM Heng Swee Keat announced a â€œSolidarity Budgetâ€ today in Parliament, to help see Singaporeans through the circuit breaker period. This is on top of the earlier Unity Budget and Resilience Budget. There will be more protection for jobs and livelihoods, more support for workers and firms, and more help for all Singaporeans. Some schemes will be enhanced, others will be brought forward so help can reach you sooner. You can find out more in the link below.

But all these measures will be in vain, unless we all comply strictly with the measures. Everyone needs to be serious about staying at home, and not go about unless absolutely necessary. If you have to go out, practise safe distancing.

If you see the elderly out and about, please gently remind them to stay home. They are the ones most at risk from COVID-19. Be responsible and protect your family, friends, and fellow Singaporeans. â€“ LHL

2,4.07E+15,"As DPM Heng Swee Keat announced in his Budget speech today, the FY2020 budget deficit was 13.9% of GDP, the largest ever. This was what we needed, to keep Singaporeans safe and protect their livelihoods during COVID-19.

This year, we will continue to help Singaporeans and businesses through the $11 billion COVID-19 Resilience Package. Although we are again running a deficit, it is much smaller â€“ only 2.2% of GDP. Things are gradually returning to normal.

While grappling with the pandemic, we must not neglect the future. Hence the Budget has many items that build our capabilities and competitiveness. When the sun shines again, we must be ready to seize the new opportunities.

This â€œcan doâ€ spirit helped us overcome the last financial crisis. With the resilience that our people have shown this time, I am confident that we can do it again.

Businesses, workers and households have all taken a serious hit from COVID-19. The road to recovery will be tough. We also face a challenging fiscal position, having committed close to $100 billion to support our people and businesses.

Even as we continue to spend prudently as we further re-open safely in the coming months, we must pave the way for the next 5 to 10 years of economic growth. We plan to remake Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise, foster inclusive growth, and invest in economic resilience and sustainability.

2,3.66E+15,"Presented Low Yen Ling, Denise Phua Lay Peng, Desmond Choo æœ±å€åº†, Alex Yam and Fahmi Aliman with their Certificates of Appointment and Mayoral Badges at the Mayorsâ€™ swearing-in ceremony today. Alex and Fahmi take over from Teo Ho Pin and Dr Maliki Osman, who are stepping down after many years of leadership and contributions.

Our Mayors are chairpersons of the Community Development Councils (CDCs) for the five respective districts. The CDCs play an important role in our social support system. They not only implement government programmes, but also serve as eyes and ears on the ground. They connect with communities, and identify emerging needs and gaps in social support. CDCs deliver services with a human touch, in a way that government agencies that operate on a national scale find harder to do.

CDCs work quietly to fulfil their mission, but in times of crisis, their contributions are vital. Since COVID-19, the CDCs have rolled out more than 70 initiatives. The CDC Vouchers Scheme is a good example. The five CDCs launched this community scheme to help 400,000 households defray the cost of living, while supporting local businesses through the COVID-19 period.

Congratulations to all five Mayors on their appointments. I wish them every success in their new term!

Nadia A. Samdin gave a heartfelt speech about helping the â€œsandwiched classâ€ and vulnerable families, as well as how individuals of different generations should find common ground.

Gan Thiam Poh too, touched on how to better support the â€œsandwiched classâ€, through social assistance schemes and changes to public housing policy.

Darryl David shared passionately about how our education system should focus less on exams and more on coursework.

Ng Ling Ling é»„çŽ²çŽ² proposed redesigning jobs and employment practices to help our maturing workforce.

Four very different speeches in style and subject matter, but bound by a common conviction to improve the lives of Singaporeans.

Our immediate priority is the COVID-19 situation. But as Nadia said, â€œIn times of hardship such as this, we need to sow seeds of hope for when the rain passes, and a strong vision for the future.â€

The government will continue to help those affected by the pandemic, but we must not neglect our long term plans to ensure a good future for all Singaporeans. After rain, we want to emerge stronger to a more hopeful and forward-looking Singapore.

In his round-up speech, DPM Heng Swee Keat addressed MPsâ€™ questions in three broad topics â€“ supporting jobs, livelihoods and our future economy; maintaining a strong fiscal position; and drawing on our deep reserves of social capital.

The four Budgets add up to $193 billion. This includes drawing an unprecedented $52 billion from our reserves. The measures protect jobs, livelihoods and businesses, and will enable Singaporeans to adapt themselves and emerge stronger in the post-COVID world.

Today is Day 4 of our safe re-opening. The road to recovery will be long and difficult, and our fight against COVID-19 is far from over. In this new and uncertain phase, all of us must do our best so that we can continue to thrive and flourish.

2,3.30E+15,"Barely two years after independence, Singapore ran into a crisis. The British forces here had supported our economy and defence. Suddenly, the British decided to pull out. Facing an uncertain future, our founding fathers were determined to secure the lives and livelihoods of our people.

We must have that same conviction today, as we deal with the crisis of our generation. The Ministry of Trade & Industry forecasts that our economy will shrink by between 4 and 7 per cent this year â€” our worst recession since independence.

Amidst this, we are grateful for the Pioneer Generationâ€™s sacrifices and stewardship, building up our reserves and giving us the means to support our people. The fiscal prudence and discipline of successive governments have put us in a strong position to overcome this crisis, and emerge stronger after the pandemic.

DPM Heng Swee Keat announced the fourth round of support measures in Parliament today. The Fortitude Budget, together with the previous Unity, Resilience, and Solidarity Budgets will help us tide through COVID-19 with a total of almost $100 billion of support measures.

Saving and creating jobs will be our priority. We will help businesses adapt and transform, create new jobs, and provide more training opportunities to workers. We will also support frontline agencies, households and communities, and help the needy and vulnerable. No one will be left behind.

In less than a week, we will start reopening after the circuit breaker. I have been inspired by the stories of people stepping forward to help others and the sacrifices of many frontline workers keeping us all safe.

Today, dining out is out, the playground is closed, and masking tape is everywhere for social-distancing measures.

It is a challenging time as we cope with the new norms that would likely persist beyond the circuit breaker. Most of us are staying at home. Working and learning form home and coping with it in our ways: cooking, music, art, yoga, writing or plenty of Studio Ghibli films. Some are going beyond by volunteering, promoting social awareness, raising charity funds to help the less fortunate, the migrant workers, and the elderly.

Behind the scenes, there is a whole system and team of people working to keep Singapore running so that we could stay at home, taking care of our loved ones and working with peace of mind: deliverymen who could bring a little comfort like mee chiang kueh from Ghim Moh or bubble tea. Supermarket workers who stock the shelves with pasta sauces or vegetables. On the front lines, medical personnel, the SAF and first-responders and volunteers are keeping our daily situation in check as the pandemic continues to develop globally.

His baby son was born last month while he was in ICU. I wish him a smooth recovery, and hope he will be reunited with his family soon.

Thanks to all the doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers for their selfless dedication to saving lives. I am grateful for all their hard work caring for their patients. They have been working under great pressure, and are doing a first-class job.

On Tuesday, Minister Josephine Teo explained our three-pronged strategy to tackle the problem: Actively contain the spread of the disease, stop new clusters from forming, and separate out the workers in essential services.

We have deployed FAST teams (Forward Assurance Support Teams) in all the dorms to support the operation. We are deploying medical teams too, to look after the health and welfare of the workers.

Many ministries are working closely together to ensure the well-being of the workers, and help the sick ones to recover.

Foreign workers have helped us to build HDB towns, MRT lines, airports and ports. Some man midnight shifts in our factories. Others take care of our sick and elderly in hospitals and nursing homes. Hundreds of thousands of Singapore households depend on domestic workers from neighbouring countries.

We are grateful for their contributions, and for their understanding and cooperation as we tackle COVID-19. We will work with them, especially those living in the dorms, to see through this difficult period. â€“ LHL

THREE-PRONGED STRATEGY TO MANAGE COVID-19 SPREAD AT THE DORMITORIES

With the number of cases at the dormitories continuing to rise, our immediate priority for the workers in the dormitories is to help them stay healthy and minimise the number that gets infected.

Itâ€™s a huge responsibility, and we are mobilising resources across the whole of government to make it happen. Thatâ€™s why we have set up a Joint Interagency Taskforce to look at this.

What are we doing now to contain the spread?

We take a three-pronged strategy.

First, in the dormitories that have clusters, we will actively contain the spread. It means locking down these dormitories â€“ no more going in and out. Workers have to stay in their room as much as possible, minimise interactions with other workers. Meals are provided to avoid communal cooking. Those with communal toilets have scheduled, staggered shower times. We are also testing the workers, to identify and isolate the infected ones, and closely monitoring the health of the other workers.

Second, it is useful to note that not all the dormitories have clusters. Here, we aim to prevent clusters from forming. All those tested positive and their close contacts would already have been isolated separately. While these dormitories are not gazetted as isolation areas, we aim to apply the same measures for these dormitories â€“ so they are effectively on lockdown. Likewise, workers have to stay in the dormitories. Within the dormitories, we enforce strict safe distancing measures, which means no more cooking and freely mixing with friends from other housing units.

Third, across all 43 purpose-built dormitories, we have moved or separated out workers in essential services who are still needed by their employers for work; this is now about 7,000 of them. We put them in separate facilities so that they do not have to enter and leave the dormitories daily, or interact with the dormitory residents. To provide a higher level of assurance, medical screening was conducted to ensure that the workers did not have symptoms before moving into the alternative accommodation. In the meantime, while at the workplace, or travelling to work, they are required to also implement strict safe distancing. This includes wearing a mask at all times, not interacting with other workers at work, and eating meals alone. Like all Singaporeans, they will be required to remain in their residences after work. We hold the employers of these essential workers responsible to do their utmost to keep their workers safe, even as they go about their duties. We will do the same for essential service workers in factory-converted dormitories â€“ move them out, monitor them and screen them all. The moving out of workers from all the dormitories will help create more space for isolation facilities within the dormitories, so that we can house separately the workers who are unwell or are waiting for the results of their swab tests.

To implement this strategy effectively, there are three key enablers.

For all 43 purpose-built dormitories, we have deployed FAST teams that work round-the-clock to implement safe distancing measures on the ground. I visited some of the dormitories. The FAST teams â€“ comprising Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force and Singapore Ministry of Manpower officers â€“ understand their mission to take care of the workersâ€™ well-being. They sort out issues with food and cleanliness, keep in close touch with the workers and attend to their feedback. They are a great help to the dormitory operators. We will soon deploy roving FAST teams to also support employers or dorm operators at factory-converted dormitories.

The medical support at dormitories are also being stepped up progressively. These are supported by the Regional Healthcare Systems which deploy teams of doctors, nurses and technicians to the dorm. They tend to workers who are unwell, swab those who have ARI, manage the cases that need to be sent to other facilities, and assess if the workers are well enough to return back to their rooms. Their presence gives the workers great confidence. The medical teams will also work with the FAST teams to set up on-site isolation facilities. We now have medical posts set up at the gazetted dormitories, and aim to have medical touchpoints at all 43 purpose-built dormitories. Most Factory-converted dormitories are well supported by the national network of Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) so the workers can also get timely medical attention.

The third key enabler is the dorm operators and employers. The more the dorm operators can handle the food and hygiene matters, the more the FAST teams can focus on effective safe distancing and tackle other issues. For example, expanding the isolation facilities on-site and helping workers remit money home. A big part of the workersâ€™ sense of well-being is to be able to continue to receive their salaries. This is where the employers have a duty to ensure that this is done in a timely manner.

For the strategy to be effective, there will be a lot of adjustments required of our workers living in the dormitories. They cannot go to work or meet their friends. We would have to help them adjust, to keep them safe and healthy.

Our foreign workers has contributed to the building of our country and economy. In these difficult times, we have a responsibility toward them and we will do everything we can to take care of them.

My message explains what we are doing to contain the spread in the dorms, and protect the health and welfare of the foreign workers. We will do our utmost to take care of them.

The number of cases outside the dorms also continues to rise. This is precisely why we needed the circuit breaker. We need everyone to take it very seriously â€” stay home and stop socialising with others. If we do not observe this strictly, all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will all be in vain.

In the video I also appeal to older Singaporeans to stay at home, for your own safety.

3,3.17E+15,"Today, there is a large jump in the number of new cases, many of them linked to two foreign workersâ€™ dormitories. The two dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas and additional control measures have been implemented to reduce further transmission, to ensure the well-being of our foreign workers.

We are also continuing to see a rise in local transmitted cases. It is sobering news, but we had expected this possibility. It was one reason we decided to do the circuit breaker from Tuesday. With people staying away from workplaces, students on full home-based learning, and everyone following tighter safe distancing rules, the new cases should gradually slow down, and we should get into a better position.

But for the circuit breaker to be effective, everyone has to cooperate and comply with the restrictions. Please stay home. If you must go out, please practise safe distancing. And remember to maintain good personal hygiene. The health of us all depends on the actions of each of us. â€“ LHL

Countries have experienced second and third waves of infection, and new variants of the virus are emerging.

Weâ€™ve had to change and adapt to new norms such as social distancing, temperature taking, mask wearing, and using TraceTogether. But I am heartened that Singaporeans, young and old, have stepped up to the challenge. Not just to reinvent themselves, but also to help others less fortunate and vulnerable. In previous crises, each time we were tested we survived, and actually came back stronger. So I am confident that this time too we will emerge stronger, and more resilient and united.

Now, 11 months on, I had a good (virtual) chat with Mr Micklethwait for the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. The inevitable question followed: how has COVID-19 changed the way we look at the world?

My answer was simple: COVID-19 is a powerful reminder that while Man proposes, God disposes. Immediately, governments worldwide were forced to change gears, put aside their plans, and make COVID-19 their top priority. It was a stark lesson that no matter how carefully one plans ahead, being able to deal with the unexpected is equally important.

COVID-19 is the most severe crisis for humanity in a very long time. Every Singaporean has been affected by the pandemic. My Government has spared no effort to support workers, businesses and households. We have done our best to minimise the effects, but the crisis is far from over.

Some of you have lost jobs, and many more have seen your incomes fall significantly. We are all worried by what lies ahead. We need the most capable team in charge, and a Government which has your strong mandate. Whoever leads Singapore during this crisis must have the full support of its people to make the difficult decisions needed for recovery. I ask you to entrust this responsibility once again to the Peopleâ€™s Action Party.

My team and I will work with you to overcome this crisis of a generation. Our manifesto sets out our plans to get through this crisis safely, and then to recover strongly. Our first priority is to save jobs, and help you get back to work if youâ€™ve lost your job. All who need extra help will get it â€” be it for housing, healthcare, education or retirement. We will continue to invest in Singapore so that your children and grandchildren can look forward to a brighter future.

I will devote all my energy to this effort, as I have done for 15 years as PM. But I cannot do this alone â€“ I need your full support, and an able team of Ministers and MPs to help me. Now, more than ever, Singapore needs a capable Government, trusted to make the right decisions for all of us. Please vote for me and my PAP team. Together, we will secure our lives, our jobs, our future. â€“ LHL

This morning, the Peopleâ€™s Action Party launched our GE 2020 Manifesto â€” Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future.

This is not a normal election because we are not living in normal times. The central focus of this Manifesto is how we will work together to overcome the crisis of a generation.

- How to keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe and prevent COVID-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system.

- How to restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers

- How to provide one another care and support, so that together we can keep ourselves safe amidst the uncertainties ahead

Beyond COVID-19, this Manifesto also sets out the PAPâ€™s longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, beyond the next 5-year term of government â€” 10, 20 years down the road.

Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government. What the PAP promises, it delivers.

We need a strong and capable leadership team, with the full support of all Singaporeans, to put our Manifesto into action. That is the way to secure our lives, our jobs, and the Future of Singapore.

An important part of opening up is keeping trade and supply lines open. Many countries have imposed export restrictions, particularly for critical supplies like drugs and medical equipment, even face masks. Others have shut down logistics nodes like ports.

Inisiatif Buka Puasa #SGUnited telah disambut baik dan sedang berjalan lancar dengan sokongan kuat daripada para sukarelawan kita dan peniaga Melayu/Islam. Lebih daripada 15,000 paket makanan telah diagihkan kepada golongan susah dan pekerja barisan hadapan termasuk pegawai jagaan kesihatan, SCDF dan Polis di hospital dan 20 kelab masyarakat di merata Singapura semenjak dua hari lalu. Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) juga menghantar 10,200 juadah berbuka puasa ke 4,000 rumah penerima zakat setiap hari.

Ramai yang telah menderma secara ikhlas untuk menampung kos inisiatif mulia ini. Namun, dana yang diperolehi masih belum mencukupi kerana kini lebih ramai yang tampil meminta bantuan. Walaupun Muis telah menghulurkan $1 juta, Yayasan Rahmatan Lil' Alamin (RLAF) memerlukan dana sebanyak $2 juta lagi bagi menampung kos inisiatif ini. Sejauh ini, hampir $400,000 telah terkumpul.

Saya menyeru agar masyarakat kita menghulurkan dana bagi menyokong inisiatif ini. Anda boleh menderma di tinyurl.com/bukapuasasg. Marilah kita teruskan amal jariah dan meraih barakah dalam bulan yang suci ini.

The #SGUnited Buka Puasa initiative is off to a good start with strong support from volunteers and our Malay/Muslim SMEs. We have distributed more than 15,000 meals to the needy, the frontline healthcare workers, and their families at the community clubs over the past 2 days. Muis also delivers 10,200 break fast meals to 4,000 homes of zakat recipients daily.

Many have contributed to this good cause but we still need more funds as many have asked for support in the provision of meals for breaking of fast. I urge the community to continue donating to this meaningful cause, and together, let's make it a rewarding Ramadan for all.

With many more COVID-19 cases, mostly mild, we urgently needed a solution to house the large numbers, and not let our hospitals get swamped.

This TODAY article shows a timelapse of how two halls in Singapore Expo were converted into a temporary isolation facility for 950 patients in just three days. We now have four halls completed and occupied, and six more soon to come.

Other locations being repurposed include the Changi Exhibition Centre (http://cna.asia/2x8BlUy) for 2,800 people, and Tanjong Pagar Terminal (https://str.sg/JMnZ) for 15,000.

These community facilities allow our hospitals to focus on the more serious cases. Many people worked very hard to make this happen.

As glum as things seem now, COVID-19 will eventually pass. But the wicked problem of climate change will still be with us, and it will be even harder to tackle. It is sobering to think that if we fail to slow down climate change, these virtual tours may be all future generations have to remind them of what was lost because we did not take action sooner.

Singapore cannot stop climate change by ourselves. It needs a global effort. But we will do our bit. Each of us must do our bit too, through small and sustainable steps, for example by wasting less food, choosing more energy efficient options, and recycling more.

We were ahead of the curved seam since February. That was when we started wearing masks. Thanks to my mother who took up my suggestion to drop her patchwork blanket and tote bag sewing to go full swing into making cloth masks, we have not been caught unawares. For the last two months, I have received weird stares and sarcastic remarks from those who think I am stupid for wearing a mask, along with compliments from strangers who expressed admiration for the eye-catching masks made out of 100% Japanese cotton. Well then, sometimes, trust your own guts and judgment. Believe in yourself and have the confidence to do what you feel is right, even if the majority tells you that you are wrong. It came as a surprise when infectious disease specialist, Dr Leong Hoe Nam of Rophi Clinic, endorsed my motherâ€™s masks on Kiss 92FM last week. Thereâ€™s a limit to the number my mother can make and these masks are NOT FOR SALE. Itâ€™s her hard work and I am very proud of my mother for contributing to fighting this virus in her own way. So, Iâ€™ve asked Sheila Khoo to share her ""recipe"" for these cup-shaped cloth masks. Go to https://str.sg/JgME
Thanks to the talented Huppy Hup, who turned my motherâ€™s hand drawn sewing pattern into an actual-sized template that can be downloaded, printed and cut out if you are keen to try sewing.

It has been a difficult time for people of faith, including Christians here and elsewhere in the world. They have been unable to hold their usual services because of COVID-19 measures. However, these measures are essential to protect all of us, Christians and non-Christians alike.

The strict measures we have taken â€” border controls, restricting travel, safe distancing, suspending religious services, and closing of entertainment outlets and tuition centres â€” are meant to curb the spread of the disease, to flatten the curve, and slow down the infection rate.

Around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen. We too expect to see more cases, as more overseas Singaporeans return home. It is crucial for these returnees to comply strictly with their Stay Home Notices. You must protect your families and everyone else, in case you turn out to be infected, which unfortunately some returnees will be. Glad that many are behaving responsibly by staying home, but some are not. Please comply â€” it is irresponsible to gallivant off to eat local food you miss, or to go partying with friends, when you are supposed to stay at home and isolate yourself. You will also be breaking the law.

Lawrence Wong spoke for us all when he gave heartfelt thanks to our healthcare workers, public officers, volunteers, and many unsung heroes who are fighting hard against COVID-19.

Greg asked me about a variety of issues, not only the current COVID-19 situation, but also China-US relations, the CPTPP, and climate change.

It was a pity we could not meet in person. But I am glad for the opportunity to remind our Australian friends that life still goes on, and we will adjust to the new norm.

In view of this development, we are taking additional steps to protect vulnerable groups, young children, the elderly and students. We will also step up environmental cleaning.

4,3.01E+15,"I have received many messages from you expressing concerns about the Wuhan coronavirus. I fully understand your feelings. We are all worried for ourselves and our loved ones, here and overseas.

The situation is developing rapidly. We have activated our contingency plans, and all our agencies are working together. Our hospitals and healthcare workers are well prepared. We have been preparing for something like this ever since SARS in 2003.

Meanwhile, scientists and medical professionals across the world are working around the clock to understand the virus and develop a vaccine. Experts think the Wuhan virus may be less lethal than SARS, but more infectious. Patients who are infected may possibly be contagious before symptoms show. If true, this will make it harder to screen and detect new cases, and to stop the spread.

So far, all seven confirmed cases in Singapore are Chinese nationals from Hubei. We have not had local transmission or community spread yet, but that can happen, and we must be prepared for it. Meanwhile, we have suspended entry into or transit through Singapore for people who have recently travelled to Hubei, and those with PRC passports issued in Hubei. We will quarantine Singapore residents and those holding long term passes who are returning here, who have recently visited Hubei.

We will continue to monitor the situation closely and do more if necessary. Meanwhile, we should all remain calm. All of us can do our part to limit transmission of germs by practising good hygiene. Wash your hands regularly, and seek medical advice early and wear a mask if you feel unwell. But in general, there is no need to wear a mask if you are not ill.

Also please do not listen to or spread rumours and untrue reports â€” alas there is a lot of that circulating around, on WhatsApp and social media. Sharing news responsibly is an important way we can protect ourselves.

If tossing yusheng, please keep your masks on and donâ€™t shout out the auspicious phrases â€“ say them in your hearts instead.

These stricter measures will surely disappoint all of us looking forward to celebrating CNY. But we must psychologically prepare ourselves to celebrate CNY differently this year. Just look at the countries near and far experiencing repeated surges in cases, and you will see why we need to stay vigilant.

The Central Executive Committee held its elections today too. My team will continue to do our best to lead Singapore through this critical time, to unite us all so that we can emerge stronger.

Every Peopleâ€™s Action Party member should be deeply conscious of the heavy responsibility that Singaporeans have placed on us. We will be judged not only by what we have done in the past, but by what we will be doing this term and what we can continue to do for them.

Tomorrow is the first day of Syawal, which marks the end of Ramadan. Just as Ramadan was observed differently amid COVID-19, so too we have had to adjust Hari Raya celebrations.

Normally, Muslim families would be visiting the mosque tomorrow morning followed by the traditional Hari Raya visits. Instead, this year, they will join the â€˜liveâ€™ takbir on radio and online, and listen to the Hari Raya khutbah by the Mufti from their homes. Virtual visits will replace actual ones. The jalan raya will be missed; still, with creativity and technology, families have found ways to connect with loved ones and friends, and celebrate together while physically apart.

Besides the annual Hari Raya eve variety show on Mediacorp Suria tonight, Mediacorp Channel 5 also showed a special programme, so that all Singaporeans could join in to celebrate with our Muslim friends.
