With both the TraceTogether and SafeEntry programmes, the authorities now take 1\xbd days or less to identify and quarantine close contacts of Covid-19 patients, down from the previous average of four days, said Dr Balakrishnan. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ther-programme",26/2/21,108,Tracetogether,117,4,-12.6052336,18,5,1,1.021033577,0,0,1

Second, the Bluetooth data collected is stored locally in the user\x92s App/Token in an encrypted form. The data is not accessible unless uploaded. Any data shared with the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be used for contact tracing persons possibly exposed to COVID-19. Only authorised public officers will be able to use the data. Third, user personal information, including their unique identification number and mobile number, is not revealed to other TraceTogether users. They are substituted by a random permanent ID. This information is stored in a secured server. As an added layer of protection, TraceTogether also creates temporary IDs that change regularly. Only these temporary IDs are exchanged between phones. These measures protect users from malicious actors who may seek to eavesdrop and track interactions over time. Lastly, once contact tracing ceases, we will prompt users to disable TraceTogether's functionality. Your privacy is important to us.

Both Cases 60191 and 60192 do not use the TraceTogether App, and while they both have TraceTogether tokens, they did not carry their tokens with them. Individuals are reminded to turn on their TraceTogether App or carry their TraceTogether token at all times so that we can quickly identify and isolate the close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and limit further infections. Case 60191 Case 60191 is a 33 year-old male Singaporean who is the son of Cases 60138[1]*and 60192, and is currently unemployed. As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 60138, he was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 10 February.

Maybe it helps to think tt doesn't stop covid, but applies a brake to slow down the transmission.

So if my next few paragraphs becomes something unreasonable or too biased for you to reply, please don't. What is the point of tracking? Let's say 100% compliance for TT.  Just for argument sake.  Everyone has a TT.  Now.  Today, let's say I am diagnosed with covid-19.  I surrender my token.  In it, there is data on 1000 people I have met in the last 14 days.  What happens then? The 1000 people get informed to watch for symptoms, correct?  Let's say 1 has symptoms.  He reports it. In his token, there is 1000 other people he met over the past 14 days.  So, now another 1000 people are informed.  And let's say 1 in the 1000 develops symptoms etc....Very soon, you have to mass quarantine or lockdown.  The reason why it hasn't happened yet is either because the virus is not spreading among the community, there is asymptomatic spread OR there are symptomatic people who are not seeking medical help.  All these cannot be solved with a TT. Of cos I leave out the obvious that maybe very few are actually using the TT.  But I am arguing on 100% take up rate cos that is the goal (I know its 70% but it's definitely hoped for 100%). A TT might be more useful in a lockdown where contact with people is very minimal or on places where human population density is low.  Otherwise, if the TT works as planned and it catches a spread, you are headed to a lockdown.  Imagine the foreign dormitories now with its routine check on a national scale.  Once you catch one, you quarantine some. So imagine randomly a company shuts, a school shuts etc.  All at random. So in short, without a lockdown and our human density and the fact that TT does not show a person infectious level in real time, it has no benefit in preventing the spread of infection but could potentially lead to another lockdown. that is what they wanna do. Alert people if kana. If situation blows up, then bobian lockdown",26/10/20,355,Tracetogether,375,4,-10.97041665,81,14,13,0.752859521,0,0,1

Poomer wrote: Scenario 1: Let's say if government install a bluetooth device at Tampines Mall entrance and record every single device it pairs with and how long. Isn't that also collecting location data via bluetooth means? You can tell me that is not doable? Our government comments on the TT initiative. Quote: The TraceTogether App does not collect or use physical location data (e.g. GPS, WiFi fingerprinting, cell ID). It only records proximity via Bluetooth. So if they have a bluetooth device installed at entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth? Proximity to entrance so they can track your location. To pinpoint a person's location you just need 3 fixed bluetooth transponders to triangulate your exact location. Then you have it, how to get a person's location based on proximity data. Can be done anot? A university professor also mentioned the same thing: Quote: Dr Michael Veale, a digital rights expert at University College London, warns of the potential for mission creep. He gives an example in which a government struggling against Covid-19 might want to enforce quarantine control. It could do so, he says, by fitting Bluetooth sensors to public spaces to identify dongle users who are out and about when they should be self-isolating at home. ""All you have to do is install physical infrastructure in the world and the data that is collecting can be mapped back to Singapore ID numbers,"" he explains.

I must admit that I'm not an expert on this particular chipset and I've not scrutinized the entire datahsheet yet. I'm also by no means an electrical engineer, but I can guarantee that the jammer mentioned in the medium article works especially since not every TT device has an output power of 20dBm. I doubt that TX power of these tokens go anywhere near 8dBm since all they need is a proximity of 10m. They're more likely to have a transmit power of 0dBm or less.

But as the old saying goes, it's better then nothing. For the token, the flaws are pretty layman knowledge and comes as no surprise. But the idea that Government can use it to track people's movement for no reason whatsoever is all conspiracy theories that have no credibility whatsoever. The idea of privacy is moot too. If government really want to track your movements for whatever reason they don't need this TT to do it. Nowadays cameras are everywhere, from HDB lift landings to MRT stations and lamp posts etc. If they want they can start tracking you the moment you step out of your house. The main point is that this TT token requires the public to corporate with goodwill. Anyone that seeks to undermine the functionality of the TT token could be deemed malicious and should be prosecuted. Anyway once it's made mandatory to be used in public spaces let's see how many people will really put the tokens in faraday pouches or whatever mods ""discussed"" here.

Again I'm still waiting for someone to disprove me that the jammer doesn't work. I got this http://www.green-antenna.com/web/sit...3416BL02_S.pdf by looking at the label on the TT token as well. It's in the breakdown. As for the transmitter I've already stated my case earlier on Quote: Welp if you insist, I manage to dig up this datasheet by looking at a teardown and the chip label https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/bluenrg-2.pdf it has a max transmit power of 8dBm. I must admit that I'm not an expert on this particular chipset and I've not scrutinized the entire datahsheet yet. I'm also by no means an electrical engineer, but I can guarantee that the jammer mentioned in the medium article works especially since not every TT device has an output power of 20dBm. I doubt that TX power of these tokens go anywhere near 8dBm since all they need is a proximity of 10m. They're more likely to have a transmit power of 0dBm or less. I'm just here to discuss and provide the tools for people to protect their own privacy. I've not heard of anyone offering a good solution for mitigation against BLE replay attacks or BLE jamming yet.

Exactly, as I pointed out and rightly so. the current tracking system has it's limitations. That's where TT comes in. Just because police able to track 1-2 person or 100 person a day. Doesnt mean they have the capabilities to track 1 million at a go. So that's why I dont get the oh SPF can track us anyway ior our smartphone/laptop is already being tracked so we should let the government use TT to track us instead argument. I use those same arguments they offer back at them, since they claim government/companies already can track us, then use current solutions, no need TT then. Oh suddenly, the current solutions got limitations. Exactly lo, now you know why they need a more invasive programme to track us. And when I mean track us is not tha I'm claiming they track us for some dubious reason right off the bat. But let's be very honest here, nobody can promise we wont get there eventually. We have to look at the entire situation from a holistic point of view, it is not 1 person or 10 person's privacy being trodden. But an entire nation of 3 million+++ people. MikeDirnt78 wrote: SPF is quite efficient in solving most of the crimes. They certainly don't need the help of a token. Does that put your claim to rest? TLDR: All the simplistic argument about they already can track us through our laptop smartphone so TT is nothing. Simple answer. Then can explain why they dont use those to track?

I guarantee plus chop nobody can give a satisfactory answer that explain if the government already has all that data at their fingertips, why do they even need to implement TT.

Another myth-busting fact is that cell towers can't track you with that degree of accuracy as well, especially since you do not have to be that close to a cell tower and any form of interference (from buildings or people walking) would cause significant changes to the signal strength.

There's a reason why BLE was picked instead of using cell towers or CCTVs to track, BLE does have a higher degree of accuracy in location tracking.

Faster and efficient tracing only translate to minimal improvement in containment. based on moh track record, they are only able to track cases on avg weeks after onset of symptoms. there is no protection for anyone between getting the virus and before moh tracks them with tt, neither does it stop the infected from spreading during this duration. so lemme ask u what protection they talking about. and never mind hor, still say we should allow gov to intrude into everyones privacy for this sort of minimal protection. unbelievable.",11/4/20,330,Tracetogether,334,4,-11.47906037,71,12,14,0.599111284,0,1,1

Tracking IMEI is pretty pointless IMO, but I guess it's good deterrent against the general users. https://www.gadgetcouncil.com/free-a...umber-changer/ I would have no issues if they were tracking you while you have to stay home for SHN cause you'll know it'll just be for 14 days.",11/5/20,232,Tracetogether,240,4,-12.15817169,58,10,7,0.647157106,0,0,1

Let's try not to kid ourselves. Just google around. Contract tracing is mission critical in any outbreak as discussed by many medical and research scientists.

Knowing the govt, they will use any means and not disclose. A little surprised that they admitted in parliament though. A pap MP asked the question that caused Desmond to reply leh. And if somebody wants to track your location, why don't they use handphone towers? Isn't that better than TT data that supposedly expires after a few weeks. A lot of people, if not all adults, are already aware that phones can be tracked. If even movie criminals know they need to turn off phone, remove battery or don't carry phone, obviously real criminals would know as much if not better. With TT, since they need to have it to enter buildings and other places, it offers another possible channel of tracking. So the persons would either need to have a shielded box to keep their TT when needed, or conduct their activity in isolated location. In which case other methods of tracking becomes more effective. Also of importance is the proximity information, reasonable case can be established that two persons were in close contact, i.e. X cannot say he was simply passing by Y if TT information showed they were within 1m proximity for more than a minute. Lastly, TT is likely more useful for unplanned crimes like a spur of the moment robbery or rape than pre-mediated crimes like drug trafficking.",1/4/21,234,Tracetogether,239,4,-11.2784245,48,11,2,0.739002027,0,0,1

Already pointed out the potential for misuse from day 1 and till today you still cant concile with this fact even when government admitted they are doing so? And the underlying concern that has still not been addressed by you or anyone here is how effective is the TT programme, taking into consideration that an infected person is usually only detected 7-14 days after infection, by then, it would have spread, so how effective is contact tracing actually in curbing the spread? Nobody has come out with any figures showing it's effectiveness, community cases still continue to appear even with 78% of Singaporeans onboard. Really brings the purpose of TT into question doesnt it? Especially in light of how the government mismanages the data, quietly providing it to SPF for investigations(contrary to what they promised) and which was only informed to Singaporeans only when someone asked in parliament. And your dont use smart phone argument is moot. The smartphone and appmakers have access to the data, but the government cant access it one. They have to request for access and the companies can choose not to give to protect your data. Did MOH even make a sound when they hand your data to SPF? Why dont you try to think further for once.

Proximity data only wad,2/7/21 12:54,"My concern - While TT does not collect location info, it basically works by registering when 2 users are in close proximity to each other at a given time (correct me if I am wrong). My worry is mainly to do with ""in the wrong place, at the wrong time"", especially considering that TT does not provide tangible/visible information that gives more straightforward evidence like CCTV or dashcam footage. It simply shows that you were near someone at a certain time. Using the Punggol murder as example, if I were waiting for a bus or walking past the bus stop at the time that the murder took place: 1. Wouldn't I then become one of the suspects because I was in the immediate vicinity of the victim at the time of the murder? 2. Besides the above point, might I not be forced by the law to give my statement as a witness, even if I want nothing to do with the matter as an unrelated passer-by? Considering that miscarriages of justice are not unheard of and a very real possibility, and serious crimes may be associated with violent criminals, gangs, or criminal syndicates, am I not being unfairly put at risk of a destroyed future or even loss of life and limb from possible retaliation since the criminals already expect I can be summoned up as a witness because of TT? Or at the very least, I might have to go through the hassle of having to assist in investigations at the cost of my own time (and travel expenses) with no compensation based on some presumed ""lead"" from the TT data? i know i sound paranoid, but as a DP student and practitioner, these are scenarios that we have explored case studies from around the world in class and could actually happen. e.g. An 18 year old man in China was convicted and executed of a rape-murder that he discovered and reported, simply because he was the only one at the scene and it was late night so no one else saw anything - i.e. ""blind"" evidence much like TT proximity data.

If i use token, i assume i can no longer check this on the app right? yeah cannot check already. the app is buggy in terms of bluetooth error but it still works most of the time..",27/12/20,108,Tracetogether,108,4,-11.39703899,26,3,5,3.166462491,0,0,1

Am using the token now and disabled Bluetooth on the phone till they sort this out. Works well with the safe entry singpass app, which is better designed. For the TT app, the favourites are not sorted according to proximity unlike the singpass app. Makes it difficult to find the right entry.

TraceTogether Bluetooth issues?,2/6/21 22:50,I am facing the same Bluetooth glitch from TT app as well only when I am out in the public and crowd. I noticed the app starts disabling and enabling the Bluetooth intermittently.

TraceTogether Bluetooth issues?,2/6/21 22:50,"I have been wondering why there was an intermittent bluetooth disconnection between my iPhone and the car audio system. My phone either couldnt connect to the audio automatically or drop my Spotify playback. Have to off/on the bluetooth on my phone and after a while, it got disconnected again. Finally able to establish the cause of it after I chanced upon this thread. Otherwise, I would have sent the audio system back and the phone to agent and Apple service centre respectively for troubleshooting.",2/5/21,85,Tracetogether,85,3,-11.23052971,14,5,5,2.371827102,0,0,0
