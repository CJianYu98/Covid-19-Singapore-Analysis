0,0,75,86,Compilation of the no of days since arrival in SG to be considered community/import case,3/6/21 23:41,"Let's take a look at some findings on what determines an import or a community case. Confirmed on 12th Jan Quote: b) Cases residing in dormitories: 1 There is 1 case residing in a dormitory who is currently unlinked. Case 59243 is a Work Permit holder who arrived from India on 11 December 2020, and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 25 December. His swab done on 21 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19. He resides at Seatown Dormitory and started work in the construction sector on 6 January 2021. He tested negative again for COVID-19 on 27 December. However a subsequent test taken on 12 January as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) came back positive for COVID-19 infection. His serological test result is positive . No of days from arrival till tested positive (11/12/2020 - 12/1/2021): 33 days (Community) Confirmed on 5th Jan Quote: Case 59034 Case 59034 is a 31 year-old male Filipino who arrived from the Philippines on 4 December, and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 18 December. His pre-departure test taken in the Philippines on 1 December was negative for COVID-19 infection, and his test on 14 December during SHN came back negative as well. He is a Work Permit holder who is employed by Singapore General Hospital (SGH), but has not started work yet. As part of his pre-employment health screening, he was tested for COVID-19 on 5 January even though he is asymptomatic, and his test came back positive. He was subsequently conveyed to SGH in an ambulance. His serological test result has come back positive, which indicates a likely past infection. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them No of days from arrival till tested positive (4/12/2020 - 5/1/2021): 33 days (Community) Confirmed on 4th Jan Quote: Case 58981 Case 58981, a 49 year-old male Indian national, is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who is here to visit his Singaporean spouse.

Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Her Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and her serology test result has also come back positive . Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported based on her travel history. She is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.

We have classified this case as locally transmitted while her serology test result is pending. Should her serology test come back positive, and epidemiological investigations assess that this is a past infection, we will reclassify this as an imported case. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including her family members, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them. Update on Case 59935: The serology test result for Case 59935, who was reported as a local unlinked case yesterday, has come back positive , indicating a likely past infection. Given her serology status and recent travel history to India from 30 November 2020 to 6 January 2021, we have re-classified this case as imported.

No of days from arrival to Singapore till tested positive (20/01 - 9/3) - 49 Days (Community) Confirmed on 11th Mar Quote: Case 60831 is a 36 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Pass holder. He arrived from India on 16 January and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 30 January. His test taken on 29 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19. He works as an IT Engineer at Deutsche Bank but has been working from home since his arrival in Singapore. He developed a runny nose on 1 March and sought medical treatment at a General Practitioner clinic on the same day.

No of days from arrival till tested positive (16/1/2021 - 11/3/2021): 55 days (Community) So we have a case that 55 days is considered community but also up to 78 days is considered as import (despite having been in the community for 64 days after SHN has ended). All their serology test came back positive (regardless of community or imported) which indicates a likely past infection but we can see that high CT Value also indicates low viral load which determines it to be a past infection . However that was only tested on the day when they tested positive. Just curious, what were their CT Values if they were detected earlier say after SHN has ended instead of several days/months later on their pre-departure test. And how many days in Singapore till tested positive will they still consider it as import case if they have high CT value. 2-3 months?

If vaccinated with the dead virus version, you also will kena positive test? No idea, this compilation is meant to see how MOH determines what is community or imported. Earlier they classify those who have been out in the community after their SHN is over as community cases even after their serological test came back positive indicating past infection, but slowly changed them all to import case from 24th Jan onwards which is why we see 50-69 days in SG still considered imported. Oddly they classified the Bangla as community even though he haven't started work and have been in the dorms ever since his SHN ended with the reason that the time he tested positive and travelled is very long (55 days). But again you have today a new case where the PR has been in SG for 69 days and they still classify it as imported (even though he has really been in the community after SHN).",2/7/21 0:53,194,Stay Home Notice,199,4,-11.189724316123721,39,15,4,1.3247270816086256,0,0,1.0

130,130,3137,3593,'Strong suggestion' that foreign student who breached SHN killed himself for fear of consequences,16/2/21 22:11,"An incoming Singapore Management University (SMU) student from Sri Lanka who was serving his 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) at Hotel Grand Pacific repeatedly breached his quarantine by leaving his room. On multiple occasions last August, Mr Nishad Manilka De Fonseka, 20, unlawfully left his room on the 13th storey of the Victoria Street hotel to visit a female friend who was also serving her SHN on the same floor. He was finally caught on Aug 10 last year when a security officer found his room empty with the door left ajar. In an inquiry into Mr De Fonseka's death on Tuesday (Feb 16), investigation officer Victoria Yee told the court that the youth was found motionless, hanging in his room two days later. Inspector Yee added that it is ""strongly suggested"" that Mr De Fonseka had killed himself and that he had been worried about the implications of his breached SHN. She also told State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam that the student was pronounced dead at the scene and there was no reason to suspect foul play. The court heard that the Sri Lankan arrived in Singapore on Aug 1 last year and was served with an SHN. Closed-circuit television footage taken from the corridor outside his room was played in court on Tuesday. In it, he could be seen leaving his room on Aug 10 last year before visiting his friend next door. The court heard that the pair had watched movies on Netflix together. A security officer went by soon after and saw that Mr De Fonseka's room was empty, with the door left ajar. The man alerted his colleagues and the door was closed. Mr De Fonseka left his friend's room at 11.22pm that evening and found that he could not enter his own room. This was because he had not been given an access card to enter it again. In the video footage, he could be seen pacing up and down the hotel corridor. His friend later alerted the hotel and staff allowed Mr De Fonseka back into his own room. SMU was alerted and its senior assistant director of student conduct, Mr Raymond Singh, sent Mr De Fonseka an e-mail to find out more about the situation. Mr Singh testified on Tuesday and told the court that he had also asked Mr De Fonseka for a written explanation on the matter. On Aug 12 last year, Mr De Fonseka's friend alerted the hotel after she failed to contact him. Mr Dickson Teo, who was the hotel's duty manager at the time, arrived outside Mr De Fonseka's room at around 1pm and found that the ""do not disturb"" light was on. Mr Teo testified that he knocked on the door and rang the bell but received no answer. He alerted his colleagues and when they opened the door, they found Mr De Fonseka motionless. They alerted the authorities and he was later pronounced dead. The state coroner will give her findings at a later date. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ed-himself-for",16/2/21 19:49,481,Stay Home Notice,499,4,-11.348270988704206,94,22,0,0.3336393504862887,0,0,1.0

136,136,3198,3665,(Breaking)Widespread sanctions on Myanmar would cause ordinary people to suffer: Vivian Balakrishnan,16/2/21 17:31,"Widespread sanctions on Myanmar would cause ordinary people to suffer: Vivian Balakrishnan SINGAPORE: Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan urged against the imposition of ""widespread sanctions"" on Myanmar, noting such actions would hurt ordinary people there the most. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 16), Dr Balakrishnan pointed to World Bank estimates that about a quarter of Myanmar's population lives below the poverty line, and that this had been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""And so in all my discussions, my phone calls, I have said that we should not embark on widespread, generalised indiscriminate sanctions, because the people who will suffer most would be the ordinary people in Myanmar,"" he said. Dr Balakrishnan's comments come after the military seized power in Myanmar earlier this month, detaining leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party, which had won the country's election last year. Last week the United States announced it was imposing sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders, calling on them to relinquish power. Dr Balakrishan said Singapore hoped for ""peaceful resolution and national reconciliation"" in Myanmar. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...shnan-14207986",16/2/21 17:04,172,Stay Home Notice,177,4,-11.624505038638683,29,2,3,0.8857693118572143,0,1,0.0

Wearing mask is just giving people a false sense of security. Add : If the infected rate is high, the chances of catching the virus in crowded places would be high even if everyone wears mask. The main reason why so many people in Singapore are still crowding around in hawker centers and shopping malls (including Chinatown during CNY) is the infected rate in the population is very low (thanks to the various government measures). The testing, isolation and SHN of travelers coming into Singapore are also greatly reducing the possibility of the virus spreading from outside the country to the community.  So, contrary to the concerns of some people, the number of import cases is actually not a concern at current levels (<50 each day). Based on the number of new community cases each day, the infected rate in the population might be 1 in 2 million each day. When the infected rate is so low, the chances that someone in a crowd of a few hundreds has the virus is extremely low.  Add to this, the chances of an infected person spreads the virus to the surrounding is reduced when he/she wears a mask. This is why we have not seen any explosion of the number of new cases despite so many people crowding in hawker centers, supermarkets, shopping malls and public transport everyday. Therefore, as long as the infected rate in the population remains this low, crowds of a few hundreds or even a few thousands is, contrary to some people's thinking, not a major concern.

Case 60051 Case 60051 is a 49 year-old male Singaporean who works as a bus driver employed by Cobb & Coach Services Pte Ltd. His job includes transporting individuals placed on SHN from Changi Airport to dedicated SHN facilities. His bus is disinfected after every trip. He developed a runny nose on 31 January but did not seek medical attention. He was subsequently detected when he was tested on 5 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 6 February, and an individual test was done later that night at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His earlier tests from RRT \x96 the last being on 23 January \x96 were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Case 60052 Case 60052 is a 30 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Pass holder, and works as an engineer at Station Satcom Pte Ltd. As part of his job, he boards ships to install communications and IT equipment. He had earlier been identified as a close contact of Case 59208[1], and was placed on quarantine from 13 January to 24 January. His swabs taken during quarantine on 13 January and 21 January were negative for COVID-19. Subsequent tests done as part of RRT \x96 the last being on 29 January \x96 were also negative for COVID-19. He developed fatigue on 4 February, and a fever the next day but did not seek medical attention. On 5 February, he was tested for COVID-19 as part of RRT. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. While his serological test taken on 7 February has come back positive, this is assessed to be a recent infection as he is symptomatic, and the Ct value for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was low. Case 60052 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 27 January, which accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.

Upon return, BTP travellers will undergo an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in lieu of the SHN and are required to be isolated in a single location until they obtain a negative result for their OAT. In addition, travellers are required to use TraceTogether, avoid all forms of public transport within 14 days of return, comply with safe management measures at their workplace and abide by all other prevailing measures applicable to local residents.* 10.* *As an added precautionary measure, travellers on this scheme are now required to undergo COVID-19 PCR Tests on*Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14*of their return. An additional serology test will also be required on Day 3. These enhanced testing requirements serve to minimise the risk of potential incubating cases leaking into the community. Travellers are also to avoid events with more than 8 attendees within 14 days of returning to Singapore. 11.* *As compliance to the border measures in this scheme is crucial to safeguarding public health and helping to curb potential transmission of COVID-19 to the community, BTP holders must comply with the border measures in this scheme or risk having their BTPs revoked. 12.* *We will continue to carefully monitor the global situation and the public health outcomes from this scheme in order to strike a calibrated balance between the safety of the local community and resuming business travel in support of our overall economic recovery.",2/9/21 20:17,270,Stay Home Notice,283,4,-11.86789946905188,47,10,1,0.4988983041639056,0,0,1.0

She travelled to India from 30 November 2020 and returned to Singapore on 6 January 2021. Her pre-departure test taken in India on 4 January before her flight was negative for COVID-19. Upon her return, she served SHN at a dedicated facility until 20 January. Her swab done on 17 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19. She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 2 February in preparation for another trip to India. Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to KK Women\x92s and Children\x92s Hospital in an ambulance. We have classified this case as locally transmitted while her serology test result is pending. Should her serology test come back positive, and epidemiological investigations assess that this is a past infection, we will reclassify this as an imported case.
