SK Gov't finds no correlation between deaths and COVID-19 vaccine,3/9/21 8:07,"The health authorities said Monday that they had found no correlation between the COVID-19 vaccine and a number of recent deaths following the administration of AstraZeneca vaccinations. As of Sunday, 11 people with pre-existing health conditions have died after receiving the first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to the KDCA. The authorities said they are conducting investigations into the additional deaths while closely monitoring people for severe adverse reactions. Meanwhile, the family of a man who died four days after receiving a shot urged the government to conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of his death in an online petition on the Cheong Wa Dae website posted Saturday. The petitioner, claiming to be a family member of the deceased man in his 60s who was vaccinated Feb. 27 at a nursing home in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, wrote, ""My father began to show symptoms of a high fever and muscle pain in the evening, and was moved to a higher-level hospital two days later.""

JUST IN: Covid-19 vaccination for those aged 60-69 in Singapore will be brought forwa,3/9/21 6:42,"SINGAPORE - Singapore's vaccination drive has been brought forward for all seniors, and will also be extended to more high risk groups and essential workers including teachers, postmen and migrant workers. This is possible because more supplies of the vaccine have arrived, said the Health Ministry (MOH) of Monday (March 8). As or March 7, more than 596,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered. In total, about 379,000 individuals in Singapore have received at least the first dose; of whom more than 217,000 have received their second dose, MOH said. The Ministry had earlier announced that seniors aged 60 to 69 would get their first dose around the end of March. However, it said on Monday that all seniors in this age group will now get their invitation letters within the next few days. Each letter will have a weblink which can be used to register for vaccination, after which an SMS with a unique booking link will be sent to the senior's mobile phone for them to book a vaccination appointment. Seniors can also book their appointments for vaccination at any community centre or community club. So far, over 55,000 seniors aged 70 and up have received their first dose of the vaccine, while another 96,000 seniors have made appointments to receive their first dose in the next few weeks. MOH also said that the vaccine programme will continue to be extended to other higher risk groups, as well as essential frontline workers of critical importance to Singapore, including those who could pose risks to vulnerable populations and the community at large if they are infected.",3/8/21,256,Vaccination,274,4,-11.11889917,45,12,0,0.484835899,0,0,1

Contrary to the fake news TS is percolating the Pfizer vaccine is very effective but has a higher rate of allergic reactions than the flu vaccine. This means it will be off-limits for some people with allergic tendencies especially some seniors with pre-existing conditions who may not be able to manage it. A less powerful vaccine may be a benefit for some groups that might not otherwise be able to be vaccinated at all. Far be it from me to say positive things about China's response to Covid, but it is good for the world to have a wider range of vaccine options to deal with this disease. If I have a choice, I'll go for Moderna, since I'm somewhat concerned about proper handling of the Pfizer vaccine. Plus, the reports seem to play up a role against asymptomatic transmission with Moderna, which I think is key to ending this thing.",18/1/21,278,Vaccination,286,4,-11.19078954,47,7,4,0.361541375,0,0,1

A less powerful vaccine may be a benefit for some groups that might not otherwise be able to be vaccinated at all. Far be it from me to say positive things about China's response to Covid, but it is good for the world to have a wider range of vaccine options to deal with this disease. If I have a choice, I'll go for Moderna, since I'm somewhat concerned about proper handling of the Pfizer vaccine. Plus, the reports seem to play up a role against asymptomatic transmission with Moderna, which I think is key to ending this thing.

More doses of the mainland-produced Sinovac vaccine will arrive within the month, Hong Kong\u2019s health minister said on Saturday.

Hong Kong\u2019s second batch of Sinovac vaccines will arrive within the month, the city\u2019s health minister has said, while a source on Saturday revealed a chronically ill woman who had received the Covid-19 drug died days later after developing stroke symptoms. The insider said it remained unclear if the fatality was related to the vaccine, adding that an expert panel \u2013 which concluded earlier that the death of another Sinovac recipient was not linked to the jab \u2013 would hold a meeting on Monday to study the incident. Hong Kong was on Saturday facing fewer than 10 coronavirus cases, according to another source. On a morning radio show, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Shiu-chee had sought to allay concerns over the first death, following a drop in daily bookings for the city\u2019s inoculation drive. Chan noted the reduction in vaccination appointments after the February 28 death of a Sinovac recipient, saying it was understandable that residents would like to think thoroughly about the decision or consult their doctors. The expert panel had determined the death of the chronically ill man, 63, who had received the jab at Kwun Chung Sports Centre in Jordan, was not directly linked to the mainland-produced vaccine. The source said the other person who died \u2013 a 55-year-old woman with multiple chronic illnesses \u2013 received the vaccination on March 2 at the same centre and felt unwell on March 5, exhibiting stroke-like symptoms.

Hong Kong\x92s second batch of Sinovac vaccines will arrive within the month, the city\x92s health minister has said, while a source on Saturday revealed a chronically ill woman who had received the Covid-19 drug died days later after developing stroke symptoms. The insider said it remained unclear if the fatality was related to the vaccine, adding that an expert panel \x96 which concluded earlier that the death of another Sinovac recipient was not linked to the jab \x96 would hold a meeting on Monday to study the incident. Hong Kong was on Saturday facing fewer than 10 coronavirus cases, according to another source. On a morning radio show, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Shiu-chee had sought to allay concerns over the first death, following a drop in daily bookings for the city\x92s inoculation drive. Chan noted the reduction in vaccination appointments after the February 28 death of a Sinovac recipient, saying it was understandable that residents would like to think thoroughly about the decision or consult their doctors. The expert panel had determined the death of the chronically ill man, 63, who had received the jab at Kwun Chung Sports Centre in Jordan, was not directly linked to the mainland-produced vaccine. The source said the other person who died \x96 a 55-year-old woman with multiple chronic illnesses \x96 received the vaccination on March 2 at the same centre and felt unwell on March 5, exhibiting stroke-like symptoms.

Hongkong reports death of man who died 2 days after vaccinated with Sinovac,3/6/21 22:02,"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/...th-chronically Hong Kong health authorities on Tuesday night revealed that they were investigating the death of a chronically ill man two days after he received China\x92s Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine, but cautioned that no connection had been ascertained yet. The Department of Health said the 63-year-old man had received the shot on February 26 at Kwun Chung Sports Centre in Jordan, one of the government\x92s designated vaccination sites. He was sent to Queen Elizabeth Hospital on February 28 after suffering shortness of breath. A source said the man had suffered a cardiac arrest soon after he was admitted, and died on the same day after failed resuscitation attempts. \x93At the moment, the causal relationship with the vaccination cannot be ascertained,\x94 the department said in a late-night statement, adding that it was seeking more information from the Hospital Authority. The source said that when the man was admitted to hospital, clinicians were notified that he had been vaccinated with the Sinovac jab, but at that time they thought the conditions were unrelated, as the patient suffered from chronic illnesses. The department, meanwhile, said it would also pass the case details to a new expert committee for assessing clinical events to establish the causal links and publish a report in due course. A hospital spokesman said the man, who also had a record of respiratory tract diseases, was admitted at about 1.30am on Sunday. He was transferred to a medical ward at about 3am but his condition deteriorated rapidly and he died at around 6am. The Coroner\x92s Court would follow up on the death, the spokesman said. In a press briefing at about 12.30am on Wednesday, hospital deputy chief executive Dr Johnny Chan Wai-man said the patient told emergency unit staff he had received a jab, but personnel in the medical ward were not aware of the vaccination as they focused on his rapidly deteriorating condition. Chan said no signs of allergic reactions were detected during resuscitation attempts and staff believed from clinical judgments the patient had chronic bronchitis, for which he was treated. None of the patient\x92s conditions that day could be associated with inoculation, he said. The hospital alerted the health department the following day after reviewing his record and realising he had been vaccinated. Dr Ronald Lam Man-kin, controller of the Centre for Health Protection, stressed that it was too early to conclude there was a causal relationship and the expert committee would examine the incident. The vaccine was still recommended as the benefits outweighed the risks, he said, adding that the department\x92s monitoring mechanism was in line with international standards. \x93A vaccination programme cannot be arbitrarily stopped before a causal relationship is established,\x94 Lam said. Chan, however, admitted that communications could be improved. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory medicine expert at Chinese University and a government adviser on the pandemic, said whether the man\x92s death was related to the vaccination had yet to be concluded by a postmortem examination. He said the man had suffered from four risk factors of a coronary artery disease, including his smoking habit, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia and high blood glucose levels, which could pose threats to his health even without the vaccine. The diabetic man had been seeking treatment from a government outpatient clinic and was taking two kinds of medicine. His blood glucose levels were normal when he was admitted to the hospital emergency unit. \x93If the [diabetes] is well controlled, there is no problem in getting the vaccine,\x94 Hui said. Experts had said adverse reactions reported by several people after receiving shots of the mainland-made Sinovac vaccine were unlikely to be linked to the jab. Some 40,000 people have received the jab so far. Meanwhile, bookings for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was jointly developed by German and US firms, will open on Wednesday at 9am. With 140,000 slots available for priority residents, the jabs will be offered from March 10 to 30 at seven vaccination centres operated by the Hospital Authority. With another vaccine option available, Hui said earlier, one of the factors in choosing which jab to go for would be the recipient\x92s travel habits. He said people who needed to travel overseas frequently could benefit from the potentially greater protection offered by the BioNTech vaccine. Sinovac shots, he added, would be adequate for those who usually stayed in Hong Kong or only travelled to the mainland, where mutated strains of the virus were not yet prevalent. \x93The BioNTech vaccine could neutralise the mutated strains that emerged in Britain and South Africa,\x94 Hui said. \x93The coverage of protection could be wider.\x94 At least seven people had been sent to hospital after they developed complications \x96 such as a rapid heartbeat, dizziness and high blood pressure \x96 following Sinovac shots over the past few days. The University of Hong Kong\x92s Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai, co-convenor of the expert committee on adverse reactions to vaccines, said the conditions reported by the patients were also common in other situations. \x93Dizziness is a common response among some people who get injected for vaccinations or blood-drawing. Many people also have palpitations,\x94 he said, referring to the condition of a fast-beating or fluttering heart. He said the committee would meet on Wednesday to look into the adverse events. Hui also said those reactions were likely to have been caused by unconscious responses in the nervous system, such as rising heart rates due to a fear of needles or blood. \x93If you are afraid of needles, maybe don\x92t look at the needle,\x94 he told a radio programme. \x93There\x92s no need to worry, the needle is there to help you develop immunity.\x94 For the administration of the BioNTech shots, which must be kept long-term at minus 70 degrees Celsius and thawed and diluted before injection, each inoculation centre will be equipped with two pharmaceutical fridges to store the vials at temperatures between 2 and 8 degrees for no more than five days. To prevent spoilage, the jabs would be prepared in batches throughout the day, depending on the booking demand, said Angela Liu Hor-ki from the Hospital Authority\x92s Hong Kong East cluster, which manages the vaccination centre at Sai Wan Ho Sports Centre. \x93We will prepare the vaccines according to the bookings, we won\x92t [dilute] the vaccines all in one go,\x94 she said. Each vial contains five doses, and the shot in each syringe can be kept at room temperature no higher than 30 degrees and must be administered within six hours. With four to six pharmacists allocated at each vaccination centre, a maximum of 200 syringes could be prepared per hour, Liu added. Dr Luk Che-chung, chief executive of the authority\x92s Hong Kong East cluster, said health workers were confident about delivering a smooth vaccination programme even though many technical issues were involved in handling the BioNTech jabs.",3/3/21,1092,Vaccination,1157,4,-11.76608459,224,36,4,-0.73238541,0,0,1

""This programme will give a greater peace of mind for those taking the vaccination,"" MOH added. Those who suffered permanent severe disability or died as a result of the vaccination will be given a single payout of $225,000. Those who experienced serious side effects after the vaccination can also continue to concurrently receive support through applicable healthcare schemes, such as MediShield Life and subsidies at public healthcare institutions.

"VacciNationSG campaign launched to raise awareness of Covid-19 vaccine, combat misinformation",3/3/21 18:51,"SINGAPORE - Singapore has launched a campaign to raise awareness of the national vaccination programme, as part of its push to get residents inoculated against Covid-19. The VacciNationSG campaign will also address misconceptions and debunk misinformation, said Minister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran on Tuesday (March 2). ""The first line of defence in our fight against misinformation is a well-informed citizenry who receive accurate communications, from reliable sources, in a timely manner,"" Mr Iswaran noted during the debate on his ministry's budget. Several MPs, including Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir) and Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), had observed that the Government's communications strategy has had to change in tandem with evolving needs. ""There is a need to ensure that all Singaporeans receive timely and accurate information that is relatable and capable of being understood by everyone with diverse needs,"" Mr Sitoh noted. He asked how the Government considers factors such as age groups and literacy levels when tapping digital means of communication, and stressed that all communication channels - digital or otherwise - should remain two-way in order to garner ground feedback. Responding, Mr Iswaran said the Government's ""foremost communications challenge"" in tackling the virus has been to ensure Singaporeans of all stripes can access trustworthy information. By leveraging both traditional and digital platforms - including Telegram, Instagram and TikTok - it was able to broaden and deepen the reach of official communications, he said. The Gov.sg portal is now available on 10 platforms, with its WhatsApp channel growing from 7,000 subscribers in January last year to 1.2 million subscribers today. At the same time, the People's Association and Silver Generation Office carried out face-to-face outreach programmes for those who were not on social media. ""This was to ensure that all segments of our population were informed of key developments of the pandemic, why certain measures were necessary and how they could play their part to protect the health and safety of all Singaporeans,"" Mr Iswaran said. He added that polls conducted by government feedback unit Reach indicated that more than eight in 10 people felt the Government provided enough information on Covid-19. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...vaccine-combat",3/3/21,338,Vaccination,359,4,-12.05893061,59,10,2,-0.149126859,0,1,1

Will PAP stand up against CCP to not approve Sinovac ??,3/2/21 12:44,"china hawk speaks https://www.facebook.com/bilahari.ka...66118706978872 Bilahari Kausikan Let me draw a parallel which while imperfect, may nevertheless explain things. Since Deng Xiaoping, every Chinese administration has asked the Singapore government to do a project in China, the latest is the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative which is part of Xi Jinping\u2019s signature BRI. It has been some time since China has had anything significant to learn from Singapore\u2019s experience. But one \u2014 certainly not the sole \u2014 reason why these projects are useful to Beijing is that the Singapore government is what could be called a \u2018reference investor\u2019 and its participation is the \u2018good house-keeping seal of approval\u2019, assuring others of the integrity of the project. China has not released any data about the Sinovac vaccine. Data from Brazil and Turkey show wildly differing levels of efficacy. Hence doubts abound, although desperate countries will accept and use it. Singapore has Covid-19 under control and is not desperate. We are known for thoroughness and integrity. If we approve the vaccine, it will do much to calm the doubts of others. But HSA will certainly not approve Sinovac until it is sure that it poses no greater risks than the other already approved vaccines. It is ridiculous to suggest that the health of Singaporeans will be given hostage to diplomacy. If that was indeed China\u2019s intent, than it is yet another example of how Beijing misunderstands Singapore.",28/2/21,226,Vaccination,236,4,-11.88235278,46,9,2,0.289043862,0,0,1

Beijing sent its coronavirus vaccine to the city state before Singapore\u2019s health authorities approved the jab Some health experts questioned China\u2019s intent behind the move, suggesting that it might be \u2018unhappy\u2019 if Singapore is slow in approving the vaccine When the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccines arrived in Singapore in December, the moment was cheered by residents and politicians alike. Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung received the shipment with much fanfare and oversaw its delivery to a cold-chain warehouse, while Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called the arrival of the vaccines a \u201cwelcome present that we\u2019ve all been looking forward to\u201d. It was a similar story two months later, when the city state received its first batch of Moderna shots. Lee said he was \u201cpleased\u201d with the delivery, and reporters were forwarded a series of photographs showing the bulky vaccine boxes with a Singapore Airlines plane in the background. Yet there was no such fanfare to greet the arrival of the China-made Sinovac shots on Tuesday evening. Rather, the seemingly played-down event was only made known a day later by the Chinese embassy. Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health later confirmed that the Sinovac jabs had arrived but stressed that the vaccine has not yet been authorised by regulators and so cannot be used immediately, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna shots. Analysts said the uncertainty surrounding the Sinovac jabs likely contributed to the stark contrast in reactions, while suggesting that there could be unstated diplomatic pressure on Singapore to approve the vaccine. Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases expert, noted it was \u201cunusual\u201d that the vaccines had arrived before authorisation was granted. A vaccine shipment that arrives before authorisation could face a host of challenges, he said, including the risk the vaccines could expire before they are officially approved, although reports said the Sinovac vaccine has a refrigerated shelf life of three years. He questioned why China had sent the jabs, remarking that \u201cIt\u2018s almost like they are begging Singapore to use\u201d them. Singapore had hammered out an advance agreement with Sinovac on the vaccine, although no details about the scheduled delivery date were revealed. Khor Swee Kheng, a Malaysian specialist in health policies, said countries that receive vaccines before regulatory approval face concerns about the possibility of \u201cregulatory limbo\u201d and the risk of political pressure on regulatory authorities to approve the vaccine shipments. He said that countries around the world are struggling to balance the speed of regulatory approvals and expiring agreements with pharmaceutical firms, and suggested that if regulatory approval is too slow in one country, then another country that has already approved a particular vaccine could exercise its \u201ccontractual right\u201d and purchase the vaccines from the former. Singapore\u2018s Ministry of Health said Wednesday that Sinovac has started submitting initial data on the efficacy of the vaccine to the ministry\u2019s Health Sciences Authority. But Leong said there was no time frame for the process, and likened the approval of a vaccine without the needed data to back it up to endorsing the fiscal health of a company with no financial statements. \u201cOnly when all factors are met will the approval go through,\u201d Leong said. Chong Ja Ian, a political scientist and scholar of Chinese foreign policy at the National University of Singapore, said Beijing was eager to see the international adoption of its vaccines as part of its so-called vaccine diplomacy. He said the Tuesday shipment to the city state was part of the campaign. Chong said there was a chance that Beijing could be \u201cunhappy\u201d if Singapore does not \u2013 or is slow \u2013 in approving the Sinovac vaccine, given its eagerness to showcase its capabilities. \u201cHowever, the core consideration during this time of crisis should be [the vaccine\u2019s] safety and effectiveness \u2026 rather than whether particular governments or leaders are happy or not,\u201d he added. \u201cAny focus other than public health at this moment of crisis is irresponsible.\u201d The Chinese embassy in Singapore lauded the vaccine shipment as having added a \u201cnew highlight\u201d to the 30 years of Sino-Singapore ties. It wrote on Facebook that it believed the vaccine would contribute to Singapore\u2019s virus efforts, and that Beijing would continue to work with the city state to \u201cwin the final victory\u201d against the pandemic. Given Singapore\u2019s reputation for standards, Chong said, its authorisation of the Sinovac vaccine would be seen as a seal of approval for all China-developed vaccines. Victor Shih, an associate professor of political economy at the University of California San Diego, concurred that Singapore\u2019s approval would lend credence to the idea that Chinese vaccines are globally accepted, noting that these vaccines have mostly been used in developing countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Singapore is among the few wealthy countries that are considering the use or Chinese vaccines, alongside the United Arab Emirates. Shih said, however, that the main audience for Beijing\u2019s vaccine diplomacy was a domestic one. \u201cWhen China rolls out a mass vaccination campaign domestically, the government wants Chinese citizens to accept the Chinese vaccines, despite their lower efficacy compared to leading Western vaccines,\u201d he said. Trial data shows Sinovac having an efficacy rate of about 50.4 per cent, compared with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine\u2019s 95 per cent and Moderna\u2019s 94 per cent efficacy rates. Shih said that there could be \u201csome pressure applied behind the scenes\u201d for Singapore to approve the Sinovac jab, but added that even if it is approved there would likely be \u201cfew users\u201d in the city state given the supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The Singapore government has not disclosed how many doses of each vaccine it has, and said residents would not get to choose the shots they receive. Authorities said about 250,000 residents had received their first jabs as of last Thursday, and that over 110,000 had been inoculated twice, with vaccinations of elderly residents well under way. Meanwhile, Zha Daojiong, a professor at Peking University\u2019s School of International Studies, stressed that the decision made by the Singapore health regulatory authority on approving the Sinovac vaccine would be one based on scientific rigour \u201crather than diplomatic or political goodwill\u201d. He noted that the Sinovac vaccine has been through rounds of scientific and policy tests in different countries, and that talk of China pushing hard for a country to adopt its vaccine was \u201cdifficult to substantiate\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t see an impact \u2026 in any political and diplomatic sense that comes with an eventual decision by Singapore,\u201d Zha said. \u201cIt would be very unwise for China\u2019s agencies of diplomacy to appear [to be] pressuring any government to make a positive decision about Chinese vaccines and for any government to make a decision on political goodwill.\u201d",28/2/21,1086,Vaccination,1169,4,-12.0160615,200,42,1,-0.650471317,0,1,1

But the effectiveness of Sinovac varies according to the clinical trials in different countries, and ranges from 50.4 per cent to 91.3 per cent. ""So there is a need for a proper assessment of the clinical trial data,"" Prof Teo said. This is what the Health Sciences Authority will be reviewing, before it decides on whether to approve for use. At present, all the data suggests that the vaccine's effectiveness meets the minimum requirement for population roll-out, Prof Teo noted. To put this in perspective, the influenza vaccine, which has been used globally across many countries, has an effective rate of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent, depending on the season and specific population segment, he said.",3/1/21,162,Vaccination,171,4,-11.71609088,25,3,0,0.64621705,0,0,1

We can then either donate it to other willing nations, or return them to China together with the reasons, and the test results. With these in mind, I absolutely agree with Mr. Kausikan, the former senior diplomat to U.N. representing Singapore. We hold ourselves to very high standards, especially those regarding the health and wellbeing of Singaporeans, how would we ever sacrifice those of our own just for diplomatic plus points? I'm sure China will feel the same. So the issue is never about the government standing up to the CCP. It's all about the results of the vaccine's usability. If anyone thinks otherwise, I'm sorry to say your points are not and never will be valid in the Lion City. EDIT: Of course, if the Sinovac vaccine is approved by our MOH, i'll gladly use it.

If gov want people take it so much, make it mandatory lah. They're quite irresponsible and selfish. First the gov make it optional, so if there's any very bad adverse events, the gov scared to be blamed. Secondly, they use fearmongering that you may face discrimination or rice bowl taken away from you if don't take. This is downright blackmailing you to take. It's like say, "" You better go take ah, if not I take away your ricebowl. Oh if you take but something bad happen, don't say I force you to take okay? "" - Totally irresponsible. Not to forget, they won't be responsible for long term side-effects and treatment. They'll only pay your hospitalisation bill. So the gov totally ignoring those who cannot take due to history of allergies or have pre-existing condition which they have no data whether it'll affect them in long term. In the US, you can't sue Pfizer or Moderna even if you have severe vaccine side effects. They already have legal immunity from liability. So will SG government want to assume that legal liability by making vaccination mandatory? Wait long long. Anyway, now ish 158th media coming out with all this. Not SG government coming out directly to mention this. So that if got problem, they can flip and say, you don't kpkb fake news hor, I where got say until like that? Media come out say companies might do this de hor, not limbei ok? Don't anyhow anyhow. Got any minister say don't take vaccine might face limited employment opportunities?

Even the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine isn\u2019t spared but the majority of the smearing effort seems to be directed at Chinese and Russian vaccines. Evidence of this is when articles like this one often mention the lower efficacy rate compared to the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines while ignoring the high incidents of severe adverse reactions and deaths linked to mRNA vaccines. I suspect the American government know a large percentage of people would reject their highly experimental vaccines if they had a choice, so a hush-hush campaign was launched worldwide to cast dispersions on competitors and to deflect attention away from their unsafe vaccines.""

However, if u stay in country, stay home, stay safe with SOP, reduce contact. Vaccine not necessary. Your choice if u want to skip it. You are just same as those not qualified for vaccine.

As the vaccine does not contain live virus, she could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.

In view of her recent travel history, and the possibility that she might have been infected onboard the flight, we have preliminarily classified this case as imported.

His swab taken on 3 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19.* He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested on 21 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day. An individual test was done on 23 February, and he was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 24 February. He was subsequently conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT \x96 the last being on 13 February \x96 were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back positive but we have assessed that this is likely a current infection. Case 60448 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 22 January, and the second dose on 14 February. This accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination. However as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination, he was likely to have been infected before he was conferred protection after vaccination.* https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...ction-25-02-21 https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/e...6472622-2.html",26/2/21,214,Vaccination,232,4,-12.66733099,44,8,1,0.580286008,0,0,0

This is like taking advantage of existing natural-origin dead virus to generate immunity...IMO, this is safer way considering all COVID-19 vaccines are created without long-term testing under current global emergency. The Chinese vaccine has been tested more extensively on Asian subjects while being co-manufactured with other countries. This is a key reason why Indonesia, Brazil, Serbia, Turkey are able to get the Chinese vaccine quicker vs how the EU and US are stuggling to meet the demand, resulting in hoarding by these countries (that's another topic to discuss) Chinese vaccine is more effordable, require common freezer-temp to store and last longer in storage Sinovac vaccine package - Note the ""Inactivated"" coronavirus label. I keep seeing narrations like this that they more extensively tested on asians but no test data from China and china needs Brazil test data. On top of that only Recently china approved sinovac as non emergency rollout no? People trust data here, it\x92s a fact that Singapore has stringent approvals for vaccine and it is telling why sinovac not approved yet, so no need to peddle for something that you cannot take today. Recently the inactivated virus narrative is falling apart because most of the known world (developed countries) use pfizer instead, pleae don\x92t say Brazil indonesia. Key reason those countries want sinovac is because 1) cannot afford more expensive vaccines 2) cannot outmuscle other countries. Please don\x92t say untill they are the wise ones. China also struggling with production concerns. And again how does Brazil, indo. Serbia using it affect your decision? You take the vaccines from those countries? How is point 3 a consideration on storage when you don\x92t need to store them for your own vaccination?

Covid-19 vaccine roll-out will drive border reopening efforts with S'pore: Johor Menteri Besar,23/2/21 21:54,"The Johor state government hopes that Malaysia's Covid-19 Immunisation Programme will help drive efforts to reopen cross-border travel between Malaysia and Singapore. Johor Menteri Besar Hasni Mohammad said that the reopening of the border was vital in spurring the state's economy. ""Once people from both countries have been vaccinated, the movement between our two countries will be easier and safe, "" he said. The border with Singapore has been closed since the movement control order was first implemented in March 18 last year. Currently, only commercial vehicles ferrying goods cross the land border daily. Datuk Hasni added that the state government was ready to carry out the immunisation programme at designated vaccination centres in each district statewide. He added that for a start, he and his state executive councillors would be among the first to take the vaccine when the programme starts in Johor. Malaysia received its first batch of more than 300,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines on Sunday with another batch of 182,520 doses expected to arrive on Wednesday (Feb 24), according to Bernama news agency. Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin, who is also tasked with leading the national Covid-19 immunisation programme, said the vaccination roll-out would be brought forward to Wednesday from Friday. Malaysia recorded 2,192 more Covid-19 infections on Monday, bringing total cases to 285,761, says the Health Ministry. Six more people died due to the coronavirus, pushing Malaysia's Covid-19 death toll to 1,062.

Israel and USA Mayo Clinic both reports show Pfizer-BioNTech Shot curbs transmission by 90%,21/2/21 22:52,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/artic...li-study-shows Quote: The Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE Covid-19 vaccine appeared to stop the vast majority of recipients in Israel becoming infected, providing the first real-world indication that the immunization will curb transmission of the coronavirus. The vaccine, which was rolled out in a national immunization program that began Dec. 20, was 89.4% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed infections , according to a copy of a draft publication that was posted on Twitter and confirmed by a person familiar with the work. The companies and Israel\x92s Health Ministry worked together on the preliminary observational analysis, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. The results, also reported in Der Spiegel, are the latest in a series of positive data to emerge out of Israel, which has given more Covid vaccines per capita than anywhere else in the world. Nearly half of the population has had at least one dose of vaccine. Separately, Israeli authorities on Saturday said the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was 99% effective at preventing deaths from the virus. The early results on lab-confirmed infections are important because they show the vaccine may also prevent asymptomatic carriers from spreading the virus that causes Covid-19, something that hadn\x92t been clear so far. Stopping transmission in this way is a key factor as countries seek to lift contact restrictions and re-open economies. https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/20/h...day/index.html Quote: Health experts have said that data so far has shown that Covid-19 vaccines prevent symptoms of the virus -- but a new study suggests that the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines may also prevent infections. A team at the Mayo Clinic health system looked at more than 31,000 people across four states who had received at least one dose of either vaccine -- and found the vaccines were upward of 80% effective in preventing infection 36 days after the first dose. Vaccine efficacy was 75% 15 days after the first dose , and it appeared to be 83% after a total of 36 days passed . But that number rose to nearly 89% when researchers examined only people who received two doses , according to the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. While the trials that Moderna and Pfizer used to win Food and Drug Administration authorization for their vaccines looked for symptomatic infection, the Mayo researchers said they looked for both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection.",21/2/21,360,Vaccination,382,4,-11.73259859,69,15,0,0.00709228,0,0,1

Editor\x92s note, Feb. 19, 7:05pm: An earlier version of this article reported inaccurately that the 72-year-old man has died after vaccination. The man, who suffered a cardiac arrest two days after vaccination, is now in ICU. The article has been corrected. We sincerely apologise for the error and the stress that it may have caused our readers. A 72-year-old Singaporean man who received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Feb. 16 suffered a cardiac arrest on the same night. The man was vaccinated on Tuesday morning, Feb. 16, and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) after suffering cardiac arrest on the same night, the Ministry of Health announced on Feb. 18. The man, who has a history of cancer, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, had been assessed by trained healthcare personnel to be suitable for Covid-19 vaccination prior to vaccination. Continue monitoring vaccinated patients At a media doorstop on Feb. 19 at Jalan Besar Community Centre, Minister for Health and co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce Gan Kim Yong addressed concerns which might arise from this incident. Gan reiterated that initial assessments showed that man's cardiac arrest was unrelated to the vaccination. However, he assured that steps were being taken to continue monitoring and collecting data on vaccinated patients. This is ensure there are no adverse effects post-vaccination. ""We do want to know about it, so we can collect the data and refine our criteria for vaccinations,"" he said. Gan added that they would monitor data ""not only locally, but internationally"" as well, so that vaccinations remain safe for people. Gan also highlighted the precautions currently in place for patients \x97 every person who takes the vaccination will be required to go through several thorough questionnaires on their wellbeing and a 30-minute post-vaccination observation period. Advice is also given to those who might experience any reaction to the vaccine. Once again, Gan emphasised the severity of such incidents: ""I want to assure Singaporeans that we do take this very seriously, whether they're related to the vaccination or not, we want to know if there are any such incidents so that we can investigate in depth and better understand the situation. And our criteria and processes will continue to be refined to ensure it can remain safe for anyone who wants to be vaccinated."" Making vaccinations available for more people Vaccinations for seniors aged 70 and above in Singapore will start on Feb. 22. Gan added that invitations letters to those aged between 60 and 69 would be sent out by the middle of March. Following this, vaccination slots will be opened to more groups of people, and the general public might be able to get their shots ""probably some time after April"". https://mothership.sg/2021/02/monito...-gan-kim-yong/",19/2/21,467,Vaccination,490,4,-11.84219022,96,17,6,-0.068593347,0,0,1

Rich nations stockpiling a billion more Covid-19 shots than needed: Report,19/2/21 11:58,"LONDON (REUTERS) - Rich countries are on course to have over a billion more doses of Covid-19 vaccines than they need, leaving poorer nations scrambling for leftover supplies as the world seeks to curb the coronavirus pandemic, a report by anti-poverty campaigners found on Friday (Feb 19). In an analysis of current supply deals for Covid-19 vaccines, the ONE Campaign said wealthy countries, such as the United States and Britain, should share the excess doses to ""supercharge"" a fully global response to the pandemic. The advocacy group, which campaigns against poverty and preventable diseases, said a failure to do so would deny billions of people essential protection from the Covid-19-causing virus and likely prolong the pandemic. The report looked specifically at contracts with the five leading Covid-19 vaccine makers - Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax. It found that to date, the United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan have already secured more than 3 billion doses - over a billion more than the 2.06 billion needed to give their entire populations two doses. ""This huge excess is the embodiment of vaccine nationalism,"" said Jenny Ottenhoff, ONE Campaign's senior director for policy. ""Rich countries understandably hedged their bets on vaccines early in the pandemic but with these bets paying off in spades, a massive course correction is needed if we are going to protect billions of people around the world,"" she added. The analysis found that, along with other Covid-19 vaccine supplies procured by the global Covax vaccine-sharing plan and in bilateral deals, the excess rich-country doses would go a long way to protecting vulnerable people in poorer countries. This would significantly reduce the risk of deaths from Covid-19, it said, as well as limiting the chances of new virus variants emerging and accelerating an end to the pandemic. The World Health Organisation on Thursday urged nations with vaccines not to share them unilaterally, but to donate them to the global Covax scheme to ensure fairness. https://www.straitstimes.com/world/e...-needed-report",19/2/21,319,Vaccination,331,4,-11.90610717,44,9,1,0.043724193,0,1,1

We will continue to monitor our supplies closely, to meet our target of vaccinating all Singaporeans and long-term residents by the end of this year. \U0001f4f7: MCI https://www.facebook.com/10004426465...6805801471573/",17/2/21,84,Vaccination,88,3,-12.20212101,12,2,4,1.252905273,0,0,1

People that take ineffective vaccines will believe they are safe could just be a placebo and engage in more risky behavior by having fun. They can be barred from taking another better vaccine because they have already been injected if they get reinfected. Right now there's not enough transparency with Sinovac.

It is another step forward in the Republic's bid to control the Covid-19 outbreak. Sources told The Straits Times that the vaccine was ferried by a Singapore Airlines plane that took off from Brussels in Belgium and transited at Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. The plane was expected to touch down at Changi Airport at about 2.15pm but arrived ahead of schedule. The Ministry of Health initially said on Feb 3 that the first shipment of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine would arrive around March, provided there were no disruptions to the shipment schedule. The vaccine is the second Covid-19 vaccine to be approved for use in Singapore after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was approved in mid-December. The Health Sciences Authority said on Feb 3 that its review of the available clinical data found that the Moderna vaccine demonstrated a high efficacy of 94 per cent, with the benefits outweighing the risks. This means that there is a 94 per cent reduction of symptomatic Covid-19 disease in a vaccinated group of people, compared with a similarly sized group of unvaccinated people, it said.",17/2/21,193,Vaccination,203,4,-11.91622871,32,2,0,0.427492349,0,0,1

South Africa has asked the Serum Institute of India to take back the one million COVID-19 vaccine do,17/2/21 10:14,"South Africa asks Serum Institute to take back 1 million vaccine doses - report BENGALURU (Reuters) - South Africa has asked the Serum Institute of India to take back the one million COVID-19 vaccine doses the company had sent in early February, The Economic Times reported on Tuesday, a week after the country said it will put on hold use of AstraZeneca's shot in its vaccination program. Serum Institute of India, which is producing AstraZeneca's shot, has emerged as a key vaccine supplier. One million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine landed in South Africa last week and another 500,000 were due to arrive in the next few weeks. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. South Africa's health minister has said the government may sell doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, after the country paused its rollout following a small clinical trial that showed it offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the 501Y.V2 coronavirus variant dominant in the country. AstraZeneca has said its vaccine appeared to offer only limited protection against mild disease caused by the South African variant, based on data from a study by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand and Oxford University. The African country, which is yet to launch its COVID-19 vaccination program, has decided to start vaccinating health workers with Johnson & Johnson's vaccine in the form of an ""implementation study"" with researchers. The Economic Times report also comes as the World Health Organization on Monday listed the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use.

"Ang Mo granny rest at observation area after vaccine jab, then uplorry.",14/2/21 16:58,"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news...being-n1257885 A 78-year-old woman died shortly after being inoculated at a mass vaccination site in Los Angeles County, health officials announced Saturday. The patient's family said she had a history of heart illness, said Dr. Michael E. Morris, director of Kaiser Permanente Southern California\x92s vaccination program, in a statement. The woman ""passed away unexpectedly"" Friday after receiving Pfizer's version of the Covid-19 vaccine about noon at the Kaiser-run site at Cal Poly Pomona, 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, the doctor said. ""While seated in the observation area after the injection, the patient complained of feeling discomfort and while being evaluated by medical personnel, she lost consciousness,"" he said. ""Paramedics on scene began CPR almost immediately and continued, but she ultimately could not be revived."" Her cause of death was yet to be determined, but the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said by email that there were no signs of allergic or anaphylactic reactions. ""Her death does not appear to be related to the vaccine,"" it said. The woman's husband of 57 years was also vaccinated Friday. ""Despite this tragedy, he is still urging that the COVID-19 vaccination effort continue, and said he intends to receive his second dose of vaccine in a few weeks,"" Morris said.",14/2/21,202,Vaccination,210,4,-11.52571808,39,11,0,0.228388244,0,0,1

[HOLY CRAP] NATIONAL EYE CENTRE INJECTS ONE STAFF WITH 5 DOSES OF VACCINE,14/2/21 1:36,"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...vid-19-vaccine PAP lumber 1! SINGAPORE - A staff member at the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) has been erroneously administered the equivalent of five doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. This occurred during a vaccination exercise on Jan 14, said the SNEC on Saturday (Feb 6). The error was discovered within minutes of the vaccination, when the staff member was resting in a designated area. ""Senior doctors were alerted immediately and the staff (member) was assessed and found to be well, with no adverse reaction or side effects,"" said SNEC. The staff member was warded at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for further observation, before being discharged two days later. The SNEC said it has been following up closely with the worker, who remains well. As a safety measure, the vaccination exercise at the SNEC was stopped immediately upon detection of the error. The rest of the SNEC staff were vaccinated at SGH. ""Our investigations showed that it was human error resulting from a lapse in communication among the vaccination team, who had been preparing and administering the injections at that time,"" said the centre. It said the worker in charge of diluting the vaccine had been called away to attend to other matters during the preparation of the vaccine. A second staff member had mistaken the undiluted dose in the vial to be ready for administering. The SNEC has apologised to the affected staff member and the worker's family, said Professor Wong Tien Yin, who is medical director of the centre. ""SNEC takes a very serious view of this incident. The safety of those receiving the vaccination during our staff vaccination exercise is of our utmost priority,"" he added. He added that the centre has done a thorough review of its internal processes and taken steps to tighten them so that such lapses do not occur again. SNEC is not involved in the vaccination exercise for other groups. As at Tuesday, more than 175,000 people have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. About 6,000 people have also taken their second dose of the vaccine and completed the full vaccination regimen.",2/6/21,344,Vaccination,354,4,-11.32617178,70,8,1,0.257823644,0,0,1

File photo of a healthcare worker preparing a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Singapore. (File photo: Jeremy Long) SINGAPORE: Receiving more than the recommended dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to be harmful, said Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Feb 6), citing clinical trial data from the two pharmaceutical companies. This comes after an employee from the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) was wrongly administered the equivalent of five doses of the vaccine due to a human error. The recommended schedule for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is two doses, 21 days apart. \x93Clinical trial data from Pfizer-BioNTech has indicated that receiving more than the recommended dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to be harmful,\x94 said MOH in response to CNA\x92s queries. \x93The affected staff is well, and did not have any adverse reaction or side effects.\x94 MOH said the incident at SNEC is an isolated one due to a human error by a staff member administering the vaccine, adding that it has not been notified of any similar incidents at other vaccination sites. The error happened on Jan 14 during a vaccination exercise conducted at SNEC for its staff members. According to SNEC in an earlier media release, investigations showed that the error resulted from a lapse in communication among the vaccination team at the time. \x93The staff in charge of diluting the vaccine had been called away to attend to other matters during the preparation of the vaccine, and a second staff member had mistaken the undiluted dose in the vial to be ready for administering,\x94 said SNEC. The error was discovered within minutes of the vaccination when the affected employee was resting in a designated area after the jab. As a precaution, the affected employee was warded at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for observation as was discharged two days later. AFFECTED STAFF SCHEDULED FOR SECOND DOSAGE PENDING TEST RESULTS In response to CNA's queries, the eye centre said the affected employee remains well and is scheduled for the second dosage of the vaccine, pending the blood serology test results. ""We will continue to monitor the staff\x92s health closely and provide the necessary support to the staff and family. The staff is currently well and back to work,"" it said. On why it made the error public more than three weeks after the incident, SNEC said: ""Our immediate priority is the well-being of the affected staff. We were focused on ensuring that the staff remains well, with no adverse reaction or side effects. We also wanted to respect the privacy of the staff and the staff\x92s family members."" It added that after the vaccination exercise at SNEC was immediately suspended, it focused on investigations and putting in place measures to ensure that such lapses do not happen again. ""In the meantime, we kept the Ministry of Health informed on the health of the staff and on our investigation,"" said SNEC. The employee responsible for administering the erroneous injection has been counselled, it added. MOH said there are \x93robust medical protocols in place\x94 at all COVID-19 vaccination sites to ensure the safety of people who received the jab. \x93These include protocols for vaccination processes on dose preparation, dilution and vaccine administration, including the need for clear indication to differentiate diluted and undiluted vaccine vials,\x94 said the ministry. \x93Following the incident, we have reminded vaccination providers to adhere strictly to the protocols,\x94 it added. \x93The safety and health of those receiving the vaccine are our top priority. MOH will continue to work with vaccination providers to ensure the utmost safety in the vaccination process.\x94 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...7236?cid=FBcna",2/6/21,624,Vaccination,654,4,-11.83399082,115,15,5,-0.122380141,0,0,1

First SIA flights with crew fully vaccinated against Covid-19 depart Singapore,2/11/21 13:13,"SIA's SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am, carrying a crew of 12.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG SIA's vaccinated crew before their flight to Jakarta.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG SINGAPORE - The first Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight staffed by pilots and cabin crew vaccinated against the coronavirus left Changi Airport on Thursday (Feb 11), marking a significant milestone for the battered national carrier. Flight SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am carrying a crew of 12, and is the first of three departing SIA Group flights with crew who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Scoot flight TR606 to Bangkok also left Changi at 9.30am with a set of 11 vaccinated crew members, while SilkAir's first vaccinated flight MI608 will leave for Phnom Penh at 4.30pm with a crew of eight. The crew members are among more than 52,000 personnel in the transport sector who have received their first dose of the vaccine as at Feb 10. The Ministry of Transport said more than 39,000 workers in the aviation and maritime sectors have gotten their first jab - over 90 per cent of the 43,000 front-liners in both sectors. More than 14,000 land transport workers have also received the first dose of the vaccine, with the remaining 66,000 scheduled to get their jabs in the coming months. In a statement, SIA Group, which has suffered billions in losses because of the ongoing pandemic, said it is among the first airlines in the world to operate flights with fully vaccinated crews. Noting that the Government has prioritised the aviation sector in the national drive to vaccinate Singaporeans and other long-term residents, SIA said this reflected the sector's importance and the national carrier's crucial role in Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against Covid-19. SIA chief executive Goh Choon Phong said: ""Vaccinations will be key to the reopening of borders and to enhancing travel confidence, in tandem with robust testing regimes and the wide-ranging safe management measures that are in place on the ground and in the air."" He added: ""They offer greater protection for our people and provide an added layer of assurance to our customers."" Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, who spoke to crew members operating SQ956 on Thursday morning, said the vaccination drive has been ""proceeding like clockwork"". He told reporters he is confident that a substantial number of workers from the aviation and maritime sectors will be fully vaccinated by the end of the month. Singapore's biggest vulnerability is its border, he said, given that the virus is under control here with very few community cases. ""If the border staff that come into contact with the outside world are all vaccinated, I think we would have really taken a very big step in securing our border and keeping Singaporeans safe,"" he added. Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung speaking to SIA\x92s vaccinated crew members on Feb 11, 2021. ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG Passenger traffic at Changi Airport, which has been decimated by Covid-19, fell by 82.8 per cent last year. Front-line workers in the aviation and maritime sectors started getting jabs on Jan 13 as part of an operational trial, before the mass exercise began in earnest on Jan 18. Bus and train workers started getting jabs from Jan 25. SIA said its operating crew members have responded very positively to the exercise, with more than 90 per cent of cabin crew and pilots signing up for the vaccine to date. Its milestone comes days after a 41-year-old cabin crew member on a turnaround flight to the United Arab Emirates tested positive for the coronavirus. The Singaporean woman was the fifth person on the flight to test positive, with preliminary test results showing that all five had contracted the more infectious B117 strain of the virus. The air stewardess had departed Singapore for Dubai on Jan 30 and returned on Jan 31 without disembarking from the aircraft. She then received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Feb 2. She lost her sense of smell two days later but did not seek medical attention. Her case was eventually picked up during routine testing as required by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. The Health Ministry reiterated on Tuesday that it takes a few weeks for individuals to build up immunity against Covid-19 after completing vaccination, and it is possible to get infected just before or after inoculation. Other airlines have also begun vaccinating their crew. Mr Ong said last month that SIA could be the first vaccinated international airline of the world. On Wednesday, Etihad Airways staked its claim as the first airline in the world to have inoculated all its operating pilots and cabin crew. The United Arab Emirates airline said in a statement that more than three-quarters of its workforce have already received at least one dose of the vaccine. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ource=facebook",2/11/21,759,Vaccination,817,4,-11.83839896,124,21,4,-0.445774467,0,0,1

Flight SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am carrying a crew of 12, and is the first of three departing SIA Group flights with crew who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Scoot flight TR606 to Bangkok also left Changi at 9.30am with a set of 11 vaccinated crew members, while SilkAir's first vaccinated flight MI608 will leave for Phnom Penh at 4.30pm with a crew of eight. The crew members are among more than 52,000 personnel in the transport sector who have received their first dose of the vaccine as at Feb 10. The Ministry of Transport said more than 39,000 workers in the aviation and maritime sectors have gotten their first jab - over 90 per cent of the 43,000 front-liners in both sectors. More than 14,000 land transport workers have also received the first dose of the vaccine, with the remaining 66,000 scheduled to get their jabs in the coming months. In a statement, SIA Group, which has suffered billions in losses because of the ongoing pandemic, said it is among the first airlines in the world to operate flights with fully vaccinated crews. Noting that the Government has prioritised the aviation sector in the national drive to vaccinate Singaporeans and other long-term residents, SIA said this reflected the sector's importance and the national carrier's crucial role in Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against Covid-19. SIA chief executive Goh Choon Phong said: ""Vaccinations will be key to the reopening of borders and to enhancing travel confidence, in tandem with robust testing regimes and the wide-ranging safe management measures that are in place on the ground and in the air."" He added: ""They offer greater protection for our people and provide an added layer of assurance to our customers."" Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, who spoke to crew members operating SQ956 on Thursday morning, said the vaccination drive has been ""proceeding like clockwork"". He told reporters he is confident that a substantial number of workers from the aviation and maritime sectors will be fully vaccinated by the end of the month. Singapore's biggest vulnerability is its border, he said, given that the virus is under control here with very few community cases. ""If the border staff that come into contact with the outside world are all vaccinated, I think we would have really taken a very big step in securing our border and keeping Singaporeans safe,"" he added. Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung speaking to SIA\x92s vaccinated crew members on Feb 11, 2021. ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG Passenger traffic at Changi Airport, which has been decimated by Covid-19, fell by 82.8 per cent last year. Front-line workers in the aviation and maritime sectors started getting jabs on Jan 13 as part of an operational trial, before the mass exercise began in earnest on Jan 18. Bus and train workers started getting jabs from Jan 25. SIA said its operating crew members have responded very positively to the exercise, with more than 90 per cent of cabin crew and pilots signing up for the vaccine to date. Its milestone comes days after a 41-year-old cabin crew member on a turnaround flight to the United Arab Emirates tested positive for the coronavirus. The Singaporean woman was the fifth person on the flight to test positive, with preliminary test results showing that all five had contracted the more infectious B117 strain of the virus. The air stewardess had departed Singapore for Dubai on Jan 30 and returned on Jan 31 without disembarking from the aircraft. She then received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Feb 2. She lost her sense of smell two days later but did not seek medical attention. Her case was eventually picked up during routine testing as required by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. The Health Ministry reiterated on Tuesday that it takes a few weeks for individuals to build up immunity against Covid-19 after completing vaccination, and it is possible to get infected just before or after inoculation. Other airlines have also begun vaccinating their crew. Mr Ong said last month that SIA could be the first vaccinated international airline of the world. On Wednesday, Etihad Airways staked its claim as the first airline in the world to have inoculated all its operating pilots and cabin crew. The United Arab Emirates airline said in a statement that more than three-quarters of its workforce have already received at least one dose of the vaccine. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ource=facebook",2/11/21,766,Vaccination,826,4,-11.8847492,126,21,4,-0.457818914,0,0,1

The work pass holder is an engineer at Station Satcom and boards ships to install communications and IT equipment as part of his job. He was identified as a close contact of a previous case and was placed on quarantine between Jan 13 and 24. His swabs taken during quarantine and as part of rostered routine testing (RRT) - the last being on Jan 29 - were all negative for the virus. He developed fatigue on Feb 4 and a fever the next day, but did not seek medical attention, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). He was tested on Feb 5 as part of RRT and his test result came back positive the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). ""While his serological test taken on Feb 7 has come back positive, this is assessed to be a recent infection as he is symptomatic, and the Ct value for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was low,"" said MOH. It added that the patient's first dose of vaccine on Jan 27 accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination. ""As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been infected due to vaccination,"" said MOH, ""It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination."" The other unlinked community case is a 49-year-old bus driver who transports individuals placed on stay-home notice (SHN) from Changi Airport to dedicated facilities. His bus is disinfected after every trip, added MOH. The bus driver, who works at Cobb & Coach Services, developed a runny nose on Jan 31 but did not seek medical attention. He was detected when he was tested on Feb 5 as part of RRT. MOH added that his earlier tests from RRT - the last being on Jan 23 - were negative for Covid-19 infection and his serology test is also negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.",2/9/21,399,Vaccination,431,4,-12.24459395,75,15,0,-0.028956622,0,0,1

Oxford/AstraZenca unless & Moderna significantly less effective vs the South African 501Y.V2 variant,2/7/21 23:23,"https://www.ft.com/content/e9bbd4fe-...3-be64140a3f36 Oxford/AstraZeneca jab fails to prevent mild and moderate Covid from S African strain, study shows Impact on hospitalisations and deaths caused by variant not yet determined, according to preliminary findings The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine does not appear to offer protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the viral variant first identified in South Africa, according to a study. Although none of the more than 2,000 mainly healthy and young patients in the study died or was hospitalised, the findings, which have not yet been peer reviewed, could*complicate the race to roll out vaccines as new strains emerge. In both the human trials and tests on the blood of those vaccinated, the jab showed significantly reduced efficacy against the 501Y.V2 viral variant, which is dominant in South Africa, according to the randomised, double-blind study seen by the Financial Times. \x93A two-dose regimen of [the vaccine] did not show protection against mild-moderate Covid-19 due to [the South African variant]\x94, the study says, adding that efficacy against severe Covid-19, hospitalisations and deaths was not yet determined. While all Covid-19 vaccines so far have largely held up against the B.1.1.7 variant that emerged in the UK, the strain that originated in South Africa has been more worrying. Both Johnson & Johnson and Novavax have said their vaccines were less effective against the strain in clinical trials conducted in South Africa. In trials, both vaccines offered complete protection against severe disease and death in relation to Covid-19. Moderna has said it will test a booster shot and a reformulated vaccine to target the South African variant, after studies showed its vaccine was significantly less effective. BioNTech/Pfizer said their vaccine was slightly less effective in a lab study using a pseudovirus with some mutations from the 501Y.V2 variant, but have not published results of tests against the variant itself. There are caveats to the Oxford/AstraZeneca study, as the sample sizes were relatively small. The study, led by South Africa\x92s University of the Witwatersrand and Oxford university, enrolled 2,026 HIV negative individuals, with a median age of 31. Half the group was given at least one dose of placebo, with the other half receiving at least one dose of vaccine.",2/7/21,359,Vaccination,377,4,-12.05396473,64,13,0,0.301581794,0,0,1

After six months of experiments, results showed that compounds from coconut oil and VCO decreased coronavirus count by 60 percent to 90 percent at low viral load.

Singapore National Eye Centre staff received 5 doses of COVID-19 vaccine due to human error,2/7/21 11:13,"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...error-14126784 SINGAPORE: An employee at the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) was wrongly administered the equivalent of five doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine due to a human error, the public healthcare institution said on Saturday (Feb 6). The error happened on Jan 14 during a vaccination exercise conducted at SNEC for its staff members. \x93The error was discovered within minutes of the vaccination when the staff was resting in a designated area after vaccination,\x94 said SNEC in a press release. \x93Senior doctors were alerted immediately and the staff was assessed and found to be well, with no adverse reaction or side effects.\x94 READ: Getting more than recommended dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine unlikely to be harmful: MOH As a precaution, the affected employee was warded at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for observation. ""The staff\x92s condition remained stable throughout and the staff was discharged two days later. We have been following up closely with the staff, who remains well,"" said SNEC. The vaccination exercise at the eye centre was stopped immediately and the rest of its employees were vaccinated at SGH. \x93SNEC is not involved in Singapore\x92s vaccination exercise for any other groups,\x94 it said. READ: 4 out of 155,000 people vaccinated had severe allergic reactions, all have recovered According to SNEC, investigations showed that it was a human error resulting from a lapse in communication among the vaccination team at the time. \x93The staff in charge of diluting the vaccine had been called away to attend to other matters during the preparation of the vaccine, and a second staff member had mistaken the undiluted dose in the vial to be ready for administering,\x94 said SNEC. READ: Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine authorised for use in Singapore, first shipment expected around March The eye centre has done a \x93thorough review\x94 of its internal processes and has taken steps to ensure that such lapses do not happen again, said SNEC\x92s medical director Professor Wong Tien Yin, apologising for the incident. \x93SNEC takes a very serious view of this incident. The safety of those receiving the vaccination during our staff vaccination exercise is of our utmost priority. We are extremely sorry that this incident happened,\x94 he said. \x93We have apologised to the staff concerned and the staff\x92s family. We will continue to monitor the staff\x92s health closely and provide the necessary support.\x94 In response to CNA's queries, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said clinical trial data from Pfizer-BioNTech has indicated that receiving more than the recommended dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to be harmful. MOH added that the incident at SNEC is an isolated one, and that it has not been notified of any similar incidents at other vaccination sites. SNEC told CNA that the affected employee remains well and is scheduled for the second dosage of the vaccine, pending the blood serology test results.
