I am wearing high grade surgical mask which is real surgical standard brought way  before all these random mass production surgical masks on the market How to make surgical mask feels better on you ears..... Loosen the elastic tension on the ear loop... Holding the 2 connecting points (elastic loop and mask) using your thumb and index finger, stretch the elastic loop a few times. This makes the elastic band lose and won't strap to your ear too tightly. Also for mask in the current market, they are mess produced at normal open air factories and not inside Clean Room Environment..... And not certified to medical standards. So it justify the $2.90 for 50 masks catergory. Usual pricing pre Covid-19 is $8~$10 for medical practices purchase. (Dental or clinic).",2021-09-03 11:29:00,146

All their serology test came back positive (regardless of community or imported) which indicates a likely past infection but we can see that high CT Value also indicates low viral load which determines it to be a past infection . However that was only tested on the day when they tested positive. Just curious, what were their CT Values if they were detected earlier say after SHN has ended instead of several days/months later on their pre-departure test. And how many days in Singapore till tested positive will they still consider it as import case if they have high CT value. 2-3 months? Half a year?",2021-07-02 00:38:00,2831

Earlier they classify those who have been out in the community after their SHN is over as community cases even after their serological test came back positive indicating past infection, but slowly changed them all to import case from 24th Jan onwards which is why we see 50-69 days in SG still considered imported. Oddly they classified the Bangla as community even though he haven't started work and have been in the dorms ever since his SHN ended with the reason that the time he tested positive and travelled is very long (55 days). But again you have today a new case where the PR has been in SG for 69 days and they still classify it as imported (even though he has really been in the community after SHN).",2021-07-02 00:53:00,194

493,563,'We are not returning to a pre-Covid world': Chan Chun Sing on building S'pore economy,2021-03-03 11:35:00,"Quote: Minister for Trade and Industry (MTI) Chan Chun Sing gave his Committee of Supply (COS) debate speech on the afternoon of Mar. 2, 2021. In response to discussions on how to use the reserves and how to do more for various groups in the society, Chan said that we shouldn't lose sight on how we ""need to earn our keep"" as we are still trying to get out of ""the most serious economic recession since independence"". Not returning to pre-Covid world ""We are not returning to a pre-Covid world,"" he said. He added that even if Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) returns to pre-Covid levels quantitatively, the economy will be qualitatively different by then. This includes the share of sectors and industries, the types of products and services we manufacture and trade with the world, and the types of skills we need to earn. Singapore has to start building a new economy now, Chan said. Turning challenges into opportunities However, there are many challenges including: Concerning geopolitical tensions Accelerating technological disruptions The mutating Covid-19 virus and the uneven pace of vaccine rollouts Global supply chains are being reordered and reconfigured, not always for economic reasons The rules-based global trading order, underpinned by the proper functioning of the World Trade Organisation To remain competitive and relevant despite these challenges, Chan suggested to turn them into opportunities by: Being a safe harbour for capital, talent and ideas in an uncertain world. Being a connected, trusted and resilient node in order to serve different markets in a bifurcating and fragmenting world. Embracing new technologies to be the disruptor rather than to be disrupted. Mastering digitalisation to transcend the constraints of Singapore's size and geographical location. Leveraging Singapore's small size to pivot faster and more nimbly than competitors. He also shared three broad strategies which Singapore has to execute: 1) Strengthen Singapore's position as a global hub for business and technology In 2020, Singapore has attracted investment commitments of about S$17.2 billion in Fixed Asset Investments and S$6.8 billion in Total Business Expenditure. These, according to Chan, are votes of confidence and faith in Singapore. To distinguish Singapore in a global class of the few high-quality and high-trust business hubs, he suggested: Clear, transparent, consistent and coherent legal and policy frameworks to do business Progressive rules to enable new business models to thrive Superior networks that will give Singapore denser and more secure connections with the world, allowing global businesses to operate out of Singapore A mix of local and global talent to serve global markets Entrenching critical parts of the research and development value chains so businesses will include Singapore as part of their global innovation networks, even in times of crisis 2) Entrench ourselves as a critical node in global value chains that would make Singapore hard to displace Singapore will need to pursue critical capabilities needed to anchor ourselves in every industry that we choose to compete in, Chan said. In a globalised world, it is easy to be dis-intermediated and displaced by cheaper competitors or digital platforms. He added that Singapore has to become the exchange that adds value through ways like the provision of complementary services. 3) Deepening corporate capabilities and workers' skills Singapore will spare no effort to help the enterprise and workers acquire new and better capabilities to compete, said Chan. He said there are different schemes to help companies of various sizes because their needs are different. The goal for large enterprises is to help them compete globally by providing access to superior trade networks, research and development and talent networks. Such support would see Singapore help by providing growth capital and support for the commercialisation of research and development. The goal for medium-sized enterprises, on the other hand, is to have more of them and bulk them up to compete in niche areas. Recounting the initiatives, Chan singled out programmes like Scale-up SG and Enterprise Leadership Transformation that will help to build deep capabilities for them to compete on a global scale. For small and micro-enterprises, he said it is important to provide them with shared and digital platforms to improve their productivity and efficiencies by accessing shared capabilities. https://mothership.sg/2021/03/chan-c...0Qd4rhEEbdU48E",2021-02-03 14:52:00,674

The crisis is being paradoxically and indefinitely extended because of the rush to get back to normal, and the continued openness of our borders is the main reason we're not at 0 cases after so long. The economy is also messed up because of the continued need to prop up failing businesses and paying an excessive number of workers in an infrastructure that can no longer accommodate them, especially foreigners who travelled a lot previously. The government is making no attempt to adapt in any form towards this new normal, essential things like producing our own food and other essential items not being considered at all. We are still focusing on dead things like air travel, tourism, businesses, keep on bringing people in from overseas because we need them. No, we don't.

These levers will allow the Government to obtain the necessary information to investigate hostile information campaigns to determine if they are of foreign provenance or artificial , said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo on Monday (Mar 1). In the 1970s, Singapore was the target of two interference operations involving newspapers The Eastern Sun and the Singapore Herald, she noted. These newspapers received funding from foreign sources and in return, ran articles that \x93sought to undermine our nascent nation-building efforts\x94. When Singapore was facing bilateral issues with \x93our immediate neighbour\x94 in 2018 and 2019, there was a \x93curious spike\x94 in online comments critical of Singapore, she said. \x93Many of these comments came from anonymous accounts, which sought to give an artificial impression to Singaporeans that there were significant and fundamental objections to Singapore's position,\x94 she said https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...e-teo-14307640 I seriously suspect that there is CCP IBs in edmw.

Several hotels in Singapore have been designated as SDFs. \x93We are constantly reviewing our systems and studying ways to provide travellers more options to meet their preferences and budgets, without compromising the safety of travellers, operational staff, and the community,\x94 Mr Tan added. In general, travellers who are issued with a 14-day stay-home notice are required to complete their isolation at an SDF, to prevent COVID-19 transmission in the community. Around 190,000 travellers have stayed at these facilities, Mr Tan said. Currently, travellers cannot select their accommodation and are assigned to the facility when they arrive at Singapore\x92s checkpoints to \x93minimise operational complexity\x94. A standard fee is charged regardless of where they are sent to. For travellers who have specific needs such as requiring elderly or disability-friendly amenities, officials will consider appeals \x93on a case-by-case basis, based on the travellers\x92 financial or personal circumstances\x94, he said. In response, Ms Foo said she hopes the Government will think of a \x93more economical option\x94, particularly for families who are bringing in foreign domestic workers. Mr Tan replied that they will look at such situations on a \x93case-by-case basis\x94, and there are existing cheaper options for employers to choose from. \x93There\x92s the economy tier catered to many of the profile archetypes that the member talked about - workers from the construction (and) marine process industries as well as foreign domestic workers,\x94 he said. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...id-19-14278596",2021-02-25 19:24:00,294

He had been identified as a close contact of Case 60102 and was placed on quarantine on 9 February. His swab taken on 9 February was negative for COVID-19. He developed anosmia on 15 February during quarantine but did not report his symptom. On 20 February, he developed a fever and self-medicated, again without informing MOH of his symptoms. The next day, he was tested for COVID-19 as part of our protocol to test individuals during quarantine. His test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. He has been tested for the B117 strain, and the result is pending. Individuals on quarantine or SHN are required to declare any symptoms promptly, and to report their health status to MOH every day. They are provided with a list of COVID-19 symptoms to look out for, as well as reporting instructions, at the start of their isolation period.

Case 60389 is a 43 year-old male Singaporean who is the spouse of Case 60102[1]. He works as an event planner but has not been at work since 1 February. He had been identified as a close contact of Case 60102 and was placed on quarantine on 9 February. His swab taken on 9 February was negative for COVID-19. He developed anosmia on 15 February during quarantine but did not report his symptom. On 20 February, he developed a fever and self-medicated, again without informing MOH of his symptoms. The next day, he was tested for COVID-19 as part of our protocol to test individuals during quarantine. His test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. He has been tested for the B117 strain, and the result is pending. Individuals on quarantine or SHN are required to declare any symptoms promptly, and to report their health status to MOH every day. They are provided with a list of COVID-19 symptoms to look out for, as well as reporting instructions, at the start of their isolation period. We remind these individuals to be socially responsible and to report their symptoms promptly, even if these are early/mild. [1]*Case 60102 is a 41 year-old female Singaporean who works as a cabin crew with Singapore Airlines. She was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 9 February.",2021-02-23 00:00:00,269

1646,1849,BOEING AGAIN. United Airlines Boeing 777 lands safely in Denver after engine failure,2021-02-21 22:19:00,"United Airlines Boeing 777 lands safely in Denver after engine failure WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A United Airlines flight landed safely at Denver International Airport on Saturday after its right engine failed, the Federal Aviation Administration said, with dramatic images showing debris from the plane scattered on the ground. The Boeing 777-200 plane, with 231 passengers and 10 crew on board, was heading to Honolulu when it suffered an engine failure soon after takeoff, the airline said. There were no reports of injuries, either on the plane or the ground. Images posted by police in Broomfield, Colorado showed significant plane debris on the ground, including an engine cowling scattered outside a home and what appeared to be other parts in a field. Police tape was used to cordon off the debris. One video taken from what appeared to be inside the United plane showed an engine on fire. Another video on social media showed a cloud of black smoke being left by a plane. ""Something blew up,"" a man on the video can be heard saying. In an audio recording, a United pilot could be heard making a mayday call to air traffic control. ""Mayday, aircraft just experienced engine failure, need to turn immediately,"" according to audio from the monitoring website liveatc.net which was reviewed by Reuters. The FAA said it and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will investigate. The NTSB said it had opened an investigation. ""If you find debris PLEASE don't touch it or move it. The @NTSB wants all debris to remain in place for investigation,"" the Broomfield police department said on Twitter. The 26-year-old 777 was powered by two Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines. Investigators will focus on what caused the accident and will look at whether a fan blade failed. Boeing said its technical advisers would assist the NTSB with its investigation, while United pledged to ""work with federal agencies investigating this incident."" United said most of the passengers on Flight 328 took off on a new flight to Honululu late Saturday. Engine failures are rare but are potentially dangerous whenever rotating parts pierce the outer casing - an event known as an uncontained engine failure. In February 2018, an older Boeing 777 operated by United and bound for Honolulu suffered an engine failure when a cowling fell off about 30 minutes before the plane landed safely. The NTSB determined that incident was the result of a full-length fan blade fracture. Because of the United fan blade separation incident, Pratt & Whitney, which is unit of Raytheon, reviewed inspection records for all previously inspected PW4000 fan blades, the NTSB said. The FAA in March 2019 issued a directive requiring initial and recurring inspections of the fan blades on the PW4000 engines.

They probably all subscribe to the same newswire which originated from CNBC. If the source was erroneous, all subsequent reporting will similarly be inaccurate, no matter how many news agencies report it. The days when news agencies fact-check their own reporting are long gone. Also, before anyone ask why CNBC never fact-check. It's because it was an interview. Statements made during interviews are first considered opinions, not facts. So CNBC probably posted the interview first, while waiting to verify the statements. Usually, when the representative of ANY government make a statement, the corresponding agency or ministry will follow up with a press release.

All the PAP ministers do is talk. The PAP government embarked on disastrous labour and immigration policies to keep labour costs down. These policies provided no incentives to businesses to innovate and move up the value chain. Rather, it encouraged our businesses to compete with other low-cost countries. For all of Lee Kuan Yew's boasts that PAP leaders have the helicopter view and are far-sighted, the PAP has been remarkably short-sighted in the last 2 decades and has increasingly resorted to short term measures to cure our economic ills.

2009,2243,Thomson Plaza Starbucks staff allegedly sprayed disinfectant at customer's face after he coughed,2021-02-21 19:35:00,"A Lianhe Wanbao article reported that Chen Jianchun, who works as a nurse, was visiting the Thomson Plaza Starbucks outlet on Feb. 17. While waiting for his drinks order to be completed, he said he ""lightly coughed twice"" as his throat had been feeling irritated. Chen claimed that a Starbucks staff in her 20s immediately sprayed disinfectant in his direction upon hearing him cough. She allegedly sprayed the disinfectant at his face four times, which he said caused his eyes so much pain that he teared up and could not open his eyes. He rushed to the nearest washroom to wash them out. According to Chen, the staff also sprayed disinfectant in the direction of a bag containing his drinks. When he told her that there's ""no need"" for that, he claimed that she told him she could do whatever she wanted as ""this is her store"". Chen told Lianhe Wanbao that he understands that people might be more wary of others' coughing during this period. However, he added that he had been wearing a mask at that time, and felt that the staff had been overreacting to his cough.

2118,2369,"Over 8,600 fines, totalling over $2.5m, issued for breach of Covid-19 safety measures",2021-02-21 17:02:00,"From April to December last year, over 8,600 fines - totalling more than $2.5 million - were meted out to people who did not follow safe distancing and safe management measures and who did not wear masks. From April to December last year,  more than 6,900 fines were meted out to individuals who did not follow safe distancing and safe management measures. During this same period, more than 1,700 fines were imposed on those who did not wear masks, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) told The Sunday Times. First-time offenders who breach safe distancing measures are fined $300, and second-time wrongdoers $1,000. Offenders may also face prosecution in court for egregious cases and higher fines if convicted. The figures mean that fines for failing to follow safe distancing and safe management measures amounted to more than $2 million. Fines for not wearing masks totalled more than $510,000. MSE added that gathering in groups larger than the permitted size was one of the most common infringements of the Covid-19 safety measures. Another common offence was intermingling at food and beverage outlets, game courts in Housing Board estates as well as parks and beaches. The MSE said: ""Covid-19 remains a serious threat and we must not become complacent, including during festive periods, when there will be an increase in social interactions."" On Friday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, cautioned against easing measures introduced to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Since Jan 26, households can have a maximum of eight unique visitors per day. This additional measure comes on top of those already in place, such as the wearing of masks outside one's home which was mandated from April 14 last year. Under phase three of Singapore's reopening which began on Dec 28, groups of up to eight people can gather socially, up from five previously. MSE urged the public to observe the tightened measures announced by the multi-ministry task force. It said: ""All of us must comply with these measures to avoid a resurgence in community cases, which could have devastating impacts on lives and livelihoods. ""Agencies will continue to step up enforcement inspections on F&B premises, malls, parks and beaches, where needed."" In response to queries from The Sunday Times, the police said it supports other agencies to enforce safe management measures at known hot spots. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) conducts inspections of workplaces to ensure that companies abide by safe management measures. Close to 140 firms were told to cease on-site operations after serious violations of workplace safe management measures, which were introduced in March last year. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...afety-measures",2021-02-21 16:07:00,419

The analysis used data from the first month of vaccinations, between Dec. 14 and Jan. 13., when there were more than 13.7 million doses administered. The agency said there were 6,994 reports of so-called adverse events after vaccination, including 6,354 that were classified as \u201cnon-serious\u201d and 640 as \u201cserious,\u201d which included 113 deaths. The most common side effects after getting the vaccines were headache, fatigue and dizziness, followed by chills and nausea. The CDC said people also reported muscle aches, fever, joint pain and pain at the injection site. For the Pfizer vaccine, reactions were more frequent after the second dose than the first, according to the v-safe data. The CDC said the reported rate of fever and chills was more than four times higher after the second dose than after the first. Most frequently reported side effects (VAERS) Headache Fatigue Dizziness Chills Nausea There were 46 reports of anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, from those who received Pfizer\u2019s vaccine and 16 cases for those who received Moderna\u2019s, according to the CDC. The agency said the occurrence of the reaction is in the range of those reported for the influenza vaccine.

She has been working from home since March last year, and all the people identified as her close contacts, including family members, have been isolated and put under quarantine, said MOH. She had an itchy throat on Feb 4 and went to a general practitioner's clinic, where she was given five days of medical leave and told to return for a follow-up consultation and a Covid-19 test if she failed to recover after three days. She informed her doctor on Feb 6 that she felt better, but subsequently developed a fever, chills, nausea and gastric pain on Feb 15.

2658,3023,Great Eastern see a ??significant increase?? in demand for its investment-linked plans during Covid-19,2021-02-18 18:16:00,"Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, life insurers have seen higher demand for some of their insurance products as people rethink their health and financial plans. These include policies that cover critical illnesses, have lower premiums or shorter terms, as well as investment-linked plans, they told CNA. \x93COVID-19 has generally led Singaporeans to become more aware of protecting themselves and their loved ones \x85 which is why in the past year we have observed Singaporeans becoming more proactive in seeking insurance solutions for their own peace of mind,\x94 said AIA Singapore\x92s chief customer and digital officer Melita Teo. For instance, the insurer has sold more single-premium investment-linked plans last year. Given the dour economic climate and market downturn, people have taken to these plans that are now available at \x93a lower unit price\x94 in the hope of potential gains when a recovery comes round, said Ms Teo. Great Eastern similarly observed a \x93significant increase\x94 in the demand for its investment-linked plans. With the pandemic fueling uncertainties about jobs, such plans, which combine both insurance and investment elements, have appealed to those who want to be able to adjust their coverage or investments according to their protection needs or wealth accumulation goals at different life stages, said the insurer\x92s head of propositions and portfolio management Eddy Lim. Health insurance is another area where Great Eastern has seen greater interest. \x93The pandemic has resulted in more people placing more importance on protecting themselves and their loved ones against unforeseen events such as death, and they appreciate if COVID-19-related claims are included in such health plans too,\x94 added Mr Lim. Aviva Singapore noted higher interest for term and whole life protection insurance plans, as well as critical illness policies with early and multiple-claim designs. For the latter, the take-up rate grew more than 20 per cent year-on-year, said director of product and marketing Daniel Lum. Other insurers observed an increased demand for policies with shorter terms and lower premiums. \x93While the uncertain economic environment may be the reason for many to hold back from making long-term financial commitments, we have seen a surge in demand for shorter-term plans that are able to offer good returns as customers seek alternatives to increase their savings amidst the low interest environment,\x94 said NTUC Income\x92s general manager for consumer business Fabian Ng. At Prudential Singapore, products that are \x93bite-sized with lower entry-level premiums\x94 have been popular. These are typically plans with affordable premiums \x96 from as low as S$5 for a 12-month plan that covers up to S$10,000 against prostate cancer \x96 and are accessible and easy to purchase. \x93Given the current uncertain economic outlook, these products are well received by customers who are looking for more affordable insurance coverage,\x94 said Mr Stanley Ng, its head of product management. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...icies-14201350",2021-02-18 18:14:00,441

2669,3037,"AirAsia food delivery will be coming to ""Singapore with a roar"", zero-commission model",2021-02-18 16:18:00,"AirAsia food, budget carrier AirAsia's delivery service, is looking to spread its wings and start operations in Singapore. AirAsia's chief executive Tony Fernandes said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday (Feb 17) that his company's latest venture will be coming to ""Singapore with a roar"", although he did not specify when. The food delivery service started almost a year ago and was reportedly gearing up for operations in major Malaysian cities. Coming to Singapore would be its first overseas foray. ""As a disruptive leader, we're ready to take on the new challenge in Singapore, providing value, simplicity and inclusivity for everyone,"" he said. Mr Fernandes also mentioned that parties interested in becoming a merchant with AirAsia food could already sign up with the company via e-mail. AirAsia food officially began operations in May 2020. According to the carrier, it had served 500 restaurants and delivered close to 15,000 orders within three months of its operation. Miss Sabrina Khaw, head of AirAsia food, said that the company pivoted towards food delivery after considering that food delivery platforms in Malaysia were charging ""exorbitant commission rates"", averaging between 20 per cent and 35 per cent. She added that there was very little control given to merchants over their own store when it came to food deliveries. ""AirAsia food runs on a zero-commission model. Merchants are able to choose from flat-rate plans powering payment and delivery,"" she said. The budget carrier has been heavily affected by the Covid-19 pandemic's disruptions to air travel. Last July, its auditors filed a report with the stock exchange in Kuala Lumpur saying the airline may not survive. Three months later, it was reported that its long-haul arm was out of money and needed to raise up to RM500 million ($164 million) to restart. AirAsia is not the only airline forced to provide other services to survive after being battered by travel restrictions due to Covid-19. Singapore Airlines has started restaurant services in its airplanes, and conducted behind-the-scenes tours at its training facility. Other airlines around the world have launched sightseeing ""flights to nowhere"" and started selling themed merchandise. AirAsia food now aims to cut itself a slice of the lucrative food delivery pie here. According to research firm Statista, online food delivery was a US$464 million (S$616 million) business in Singapore last year. Foodpanda, Deliveroo and GrabFood - which entered the market in 2012, 2015 and 2018 respectively - remain the major players in food delivery here, with several new platforms such as WhyQ, Chope On and Pickupp having leapt onto the food-delivery bandwagon. Mr Fernandes said that he was sure AirAsia food will do well in Singapore despite the crowded food delivery space. ""It took me seven years to get approval to fly to Singapore but better late than never. So I'd say, we're way ahead of schedule on food. I'm sure we (are) going to get a great welcome,"" he said.

2879,3283,"In the midst of Covid-19, with her son taking PSLE, she made the leap to join a different industry",2021-02-17 21:13:00,"SINGAPORE \x97 Faced with the realisation that her career prospects were limited while working on sales at a small construction firm, Ms Lim Hwee Ling made a leap in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic to join the offshore marine industry.Despite her initial concerns about making the switch the same year that her son was having his Primary School Leaving Examination, the 44-year-old found the job under government agency Workforce Singapore\x92s Professional Conversion Programme (PCP), which equipped her with the know-how and skills needed to perform her new role.\x93If I don\x92t take this opportunity now, then when would I? So I asked myself what I am looking for and decided to make this switch. And so far, I have no regrets,\x94 she told TODAY.As the economy recovers slowly from the pandemic and industries transform, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday (Feb 16) called on Singaporeans to arm themselves with the skills and the agility to move between jobs.An extra S$5.4 billion will be pumped into the SG United Jobs and Skills Package to help Singaporean workers pick up new knowledge and skills to bounce back from the economic fallout.* Of this sum, S$5.2 billion will be set aside for the Jobs Growth Incentive, which has been extended by seven months to September this year.*The scheme provides companies with up to one year of salary support from the Government, from the month each new Singapore resident was hired since September last year.Ms Lim left her sales job in September last year for a mostly backend role as an assistant manager of commercial operations at Posh Semco, a Kuok Singapore Group subsidiary that provides vessels for offshore energy operations.Where she was once collating all the data she had into spreadsheets, she is now using advanced data visualisation and analytics software to track the performances of the company\x92s vessels.\x93When I\x92m equipped with this sort of knowledge to handle digital tools, it\x92s a (means of) growth for me and I will not be stagnant,\x94 she said.*She added that while her job transition was challenging, her colleagues at Posh Semco have been very helpful.* Her employer even encouraged her to take leave to coach her son through his national examination but she declined.As part of her transition, Ms Lim has been receiving on-the-job training to help her adapt to the new sector.*Later this year, she will be attending formal classroom lessons as part of the PCP for sea transport professionals, which is organised by the Singapore Polytechnic and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.The course, held over six months, will teach her industry-specific lessons covering insurance and contractual considerations.Ms Lim hopes that other mid-career workers mulling over a career switch will consider their long-term goals instead of focusing on the immediate challenges.\x93It\x92s not going to be easy (making the switch) because many things are different. The jargon is different. You\x92ll take a long while to understand the acronyms,\x94 she said. Read more at https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...joined-another",2021-02-17 20:48:00,478

2947,3370,World Economic Forum attendees will not need to serve SHN: MOH,2021-02-17 13:53:00,"Attendees at the World Economic Forum\x92s (WEF) special annual meeting in August will not be required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN), said the Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary on Tuesday (16 February). Instead, both local and foreign attendees will be subject to ""rigorous testing arrangements"", as well as safe management measures (SMM) such as mask-wearing, safe distancing and the compulsory use of TraceTogether (TT) technology. Dr Puthucheary was responding to Sengkang Member of Parliament He Ting Ru's parliamentary query on whether WEF attendees will be subject to an SHN and what other SMM measures will be implemented, in order to prevent the WEF meeting from turning into a super spreader event. He added that there will also be physical segregation of event attendees from the local community. ""This will reduce the risk of infections spreading from event attendees to the local community at large, and vice versa."" In the coming months, MOH will continue to assess the COVID-19 situation locally and globally, and adjust the public health measures for the event as necessary. The WEF and the Singapore government had previously announced that the summit in Singapore will be postponed to August from May, in light of global travel restrictions and the international challenges in combating the virus. https://sg.news.yahoo.com/world-econ...062508204.html",2021-02-17 12:53:00,208

Instead, both local and foreign attendees will be subject to ""rigorous testing arrangements"", as well as safe management measures (SMM) such as mask-wearing, safe distancing and the compulsory use of TraceTogether (TT) technology. Dr Puthucheary was responding to Sengkang Member of Parliament He Ting Ru's parliamentary query on whether WEF attendees will be subject to an SHN and what other SMM measures will be implemented, in order to prevent the WEF meeting from turning into a super spreader event. He added that there will also be physical segregation of event attendees from the local community. ""This will reduce the risk of infections spreading from event attendees to the local community at large, and vice versa."" In the coming months, MOH will continue to assess the COVID-19 situation locally and globally, and adjust the public health measures for the event as necessary. The WEF and the Singapore government had previously announced that the summit in Singapore will be postponed to August from May, in light of global travel restrictions and the international challenges in combating the virus. https://sg.yahoo.com/news/world-econ...062508204.html",2021-02-17 10:19:00,210

3137,3593,'Strong suggestion' that foreign student who breached SHN killed himself for fear of consequences,2021-02-16 22:11:00,"An incoming Singapore Management University (SMU) student from Sri Lanka who was serving his 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) at Hotel Grand Pacific repeatedly breached his quarantine by leaving his room. On multiple occasions last August, Mr Nishad Manilka De Fonseka, 20, unlawfully left his room on the 13th storey of the Victoria Street hotel to visit a female friend who was also serving her SHN on the same floor. He was finally caught on Aug 10 last year when a security officer found his room empty with the door left ajar. In an inquiry into Mr De Fonseka's death on Tuesday (Feb 16), investigation officer Victoria Yee told the court that the youth was found motionless, hanging in his room two days later. Inspector Yee added that it is ""strongly suggested"" that Mr De Fonseka had killed himself and that he had been worried about the implications of his breached SHN. She also told State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam that the student was pronounced dead at the scene and there was no reason to suspect foul play. The court heard that the Sri Lankan arrived in Singapore on Aug 1 last year and was served with an SHN. Closed-circuit television footage taken from the corridor outside his room was played in court on Tuesday. In it, he could be seen leaving his room on Aug 10 last year before visiting his friend next door. The court heard that the pair had watched movies on Netflix together. A security officer went by soon after and saw that Mr De Fonseka's room was empty, with the door left ajar. The man alerted his colleagues and the door was closed. Mr De Fonseka left his friend's room at 11.22pm that evening and found that he could not enter his own room. This was because he had not been given an access card to enter it again. In the video footage, he could be seen pacing up and down the hotel corridor. His friend later alerted the hotel and staff allowed Mr De Fonseka back into his own room. SMU was alerted and its senior assistant director of student conduct, Mr Raymond Singh, sent Mr De Fonseka an e-mail to find out more about the situation. Mr Singh testified on Tuesday and told the court that he had also asked Mr De Fonseka for a written explanation on the matter. On Aug 12 last year, Mr De Fonseka's friend alerted the hotel after she failed to contact him. Mr Dickson Teo, who was the hotel's duty manager at the time, arrived outside Mr De Fonseka's room at around 1pm and found that the ""do not disturb"" light was on. Mr Teo testified that he knocked on the door and rang the bell but received no answer. He alerted his colleagues and when they opened the door, they found Mr De Fonseka motionless. They alerted the authorities and he was later pronounced dead. The state coroner will give her findings at a later date. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ed-himself-for",2021-02-16 19:49:00,481

3198,3665,(Breaking)Widespread sanctions on Myanmar would cause ordinary people to suffer: Vivian Balakrishnan,2021-02-16 17:31:00,"Widespread sanctions on Myanmar would cause ordinary people to suffer: Vivian Balakrishnan SINGAPORE: Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan urged against the imposition of ""widespread sanctions"" on Myanmar, noting such actions would hurt ordinary people there the most. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 16), Dr Balakrishnan pointed to World Bank estimates that about a quarter of Myanmar's population lives below the poverty line, and that this had been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""And so in all my discussions, my phone calls, I have said that we should not embark on widespread, generalised indiscriminate sanctions, because the people who will suffer most would be the ordinary people in Myanmar,"" he said. Dr Balakrishnan's comments come after the military seized power in Myanmar earlier this month, detaining leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party, which had won the country's election last year. Last week the United States announced it was imposing sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders, calling on them to relinquish power. Dr Balakrishan said Singapore hoped for ""peaceful resolution and national reconciliation"" in Myanmar. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...shnan-14207986",2021-02-16 17:04:00,172

If we close our borders to them, many Singaporeans will not be getting the keys to their homes, many households will have their FDWs delayed and will need to find alternative care arrangements for their loved ones, our economy will slow down and the lives and livelihoods of many will be impacted,\x94 he said. He added that some of the travellers were Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, or their close relatives here to visit them. \x93Therefore, we need to adopt a risk management approach to the inflow of these travellers rather than to close the borders to them entirely,\x94 Dr Koh said. He added that the migrant workers and visitors were subject to a set of stringent precautionary measures to keep the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the community as low as possible. These include pre-departure and on-arrival tests and a 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities with another test before the end of the notice period. In addition, all newly arrived work permit and S Pass workers in the construction, marine and process sectors are subject to an additional seven-day isolation and testing regime at a designated facility following their 14-day stay-home notice. Along with other foreign workers such as those who in dormitories and in the aviation industry, these workers also have to undergo rostered routine testing at least every 14 days. \x93As the global situation evolves, the Multi-Ministry Task Force will continue to review our border control measures to strike a balance between public health considerations and the needs of our society and economy,\x94 Dr Koh said. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...itive-14208154",2021-02-16 17:00:00,297

3223,3693,"Significant progress made against Covid-19, but challenges ahead no less daunting: Chan Chun Sing",2021-02-16 09:29:00,"Quote: SINGAPORE - Singaporeans should not let their guard down even though the country has achieved much in the fight against the disease in the past months, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said on Sunday (Feb 14). Singapore has put in tremendous effort to combat the pandemic but the challenges ahead are no less daunting, he said at a virtual Chinese New Year celebration event. Much work remains to be done, such as the need to strengthen the Republic's position in the global value chain, and helping companies and workers stay resilient and competitive. Singapore is working with like-minded partners to forge ahead in areas such as new trade rules, and will press on with efforts to create an innovation-led and sustainable economy, he added. He was speaking during Spring Reception 2021, an annual event jointly organised by the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre (SCCC) and the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations (SFCCA). The event brings together representatives from the local Chinese community and various ethnic groups to exchange well-wishes and aspirations for the new year. It also aims to present a platform to encourage greater appreciation of Chinese values and culture. About 250 people, including other political leaders such as Health Minister Gan Kim Yong  and Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling, attended the event which took place on Zoom. Mr Chan said this year's Chinese New Year celebrations were certainly different but no less significant. Referring to the fight against Covid-19, he said: ""We are at a critical stage of the battle and we cannot let our guard down."" The progress that Singapore has made is in no small part due to the resilience and cohesion of its people, he said. ""Our forefathers displayed grit and hard work and responded to challenging situations with an enterprising spirit and a never-say-die attitude to leave us what we have. We should do so similarly for our future generations. ""I have faith that our community will continue to embody this spirit as we progress on this long road to recovery."" Mr Chan disclosed that a foreign reporter had asked him about Singapore's ""secret formula"" in fighting Covid-19. He responded by sharing the country's approach to testing, tracking and tracing, quarantine, social habits and personal hygiene. He said the reporter was surprised that the minister did not share anything startling. Mr Chan said: ""In the end, he observed correctly that what we did was nothing secret. But what was special was our ability to do the simple things consistently, in a disciplined and cohesive manner, that distinguished us from many others."" This cohesion, he said, was a reflection of the high trust among people, communities, and between people and government. Community organisations such as the SFCCA and clan associations have, and will, continue to play a key role in this, he added. He noted that the SFCCA has led efforts to rally member associations to donate essential items to those who need help, while volunteers from the SFCCA's youth committee also prepared care packs and distributed them to front-liners. ""Thanks to you, we have been able to respond well to the crisis, and we are confident of emerging stronger from this,"" said Mr Chan. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ting-chan-chun",2021-02-16 09:28:00,525

3253,3729,"There were already 13 different strains of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China in December 2019",2021-02-15 21:31:00,"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-wh...466d-adf0-df7f There were 13 different strains of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China in December 2019, World Health Organization scientist Peter Ben Embarek told CNN in an exclusive interview. Why it matters: Data gathered during the WHO scientists' first trip to investigate the origins of COVID-19 could point to an outbreak that was more widespread than previously understood. Some virologists believe that multiple strains in Wuhan as early as December could suggest that the virus had previously spread undetected. Embarek, a lead investigator for WHO's mission to Wuhan, declined to draw conclusions on this in his CNN interview.",2021-02-15 21:01:00,93
3254,3730,"There were already 13 different strains of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China in December 2019",2021-02-15 21:31:00,"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/14/h...ntl/index.html Quote: Ben Embarek said the mission -- which comprised 17 WHO scientists and 17 Chinese -- had broadened the type of virus genetic material they examined from early coronavirus cases that first December. This allowed them to look at partial genetic samples, rather than just complete ones, he said. As a result, they were able to gather for the first time 13 different genetic sequences of the SARS-COV-2 virus from December 2019. The sequences, if examined with wider patient data in China across 2019, could provide valuable clues about the geography and timing of the outbreak before December. Variants pose larger questions Changes in a virus's genetic makeup are common and normally harmless, occurring over time as the disease moves between and reproduces among people or animals. Ben Embarek declined to draw conclusions about what the 13 strains could have meant for the disease's history before December. But the discovery of so many different possible variants of the virus could suggest it had been circulating for longer than just that month, as some virologists have previously suggested. This genetic material is likely the first physical evidence to emerge internationally to bolster such a theory. Prof. Edward Holmes, a virologist at the University of Sydney, in Australia, said: ""As there was already genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2 sequences sampled from Wuhan in December 2019, it is likely that the virus was circulating for a while longer than that month alone."" Holmes, who has studied the virus' emergence at length, said these 13 sequences might indicate the virus spread for some time undetected before the December outbreak in Wuhan. ""These data fit with other analyses that the virus emerged in the human population earlier than December 2019 and that there was a period of cryptic transmission before it was first detected in the Huanan market."" The WHO team gave a three-hour press conference alongside their Chinese counterparts in Wuhan to present their findings this past week. Since then, more details have slowly emerged as to the precise data they did -- and at times did not -- have access to. Ben Embarek said the mission was given analysis by Chinese scientists of 92 suspected Covid-19 cases from October and November 2019 --patients who had Covid-like symptoms and were severely ill. The WHO team asked these 92 be tested in January this year for antibodies. Of these, 67 agreed to be tested and all proved negative, Ben Embarek said. He added that further tests were needed as it remains unclear if antibodies remain in former Covid-19 patients as long as a year later. no wonder they are reluctant to be forthcoming with the patient data for the 174 cases as this would begat deeper probe into transmission chain and expose even more cases outside of Hubei",2021-02-15 21:11:00,438

Drawing parallels between the pandemic and World War II, he said the pandemic can be a defining moment in Singapore's history, where Singaporeans were tested but overcame the ""toughest of circumstances"" with resilience and resolve. The country's pioneers, who endured the hardships of war, were a generation who got things done, served with honour, and helped built Singapore, said Mr Wong, who also co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic. ""They have taught us that there is no trouble we cannot endure; no calamity we cannot overcome as a people."" While the Japanese Occupation of Singapore lasted more than three years, said Mr Wong, it is unclear how long the pandemic will last, although ""at some point, it will be over"". ""At that time, I hope we can look back and say that this has been a defining moment in our history. We have been tested in this crucible, but we have overcome the toughest of circumstances together with resilience and resolve, and we have prevailed and forged a stronger sense of solidarity and unity. ""Ultimately, that's the best homage we can pay to our forefathers and our pioneers, to uphold their conviction and values of our nation, to take on the responsibility that they shouldered, and to commit to building a better Singapore together,"" he added. The minister was speaking at the 54th War Memorial Service to commemorate the civilian victims of the Japanese Occupation, as well as Total Defence Day, which marks the day Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942. The event - organised by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and Nexus, the department responsible for Total Defence and National Education in the Ministry of Defence - is held annually at the War Memorial Park in Beach Road. Mr Wong said Singapore has had to impose certain necessary, but also painful and difficult, measures to cope with the pandemic, which he added was perhaps the biggest challenge for the world since WWII. ""And we're very glad to see Singaporeans taking these measures in their stride, cooperating with them, and embodying the spirit of Total Defence during this time, sacrificing for the common good, pulling together with tremendous resilience and fortitude."" For instance, front-line workers were on duty round the clock, businesses adapted to find new ways to pursue their livelihoods, neighbours reached out to help the vulnerable, and Singaporeans adhered to safe distancing measures and passed on factual and accurate information. ""I'm hopeful and optimistic that Singapore can emerge stronger from this crisis, just as we did after the Japanese Occupation,"" said Mr Wong. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-lawrence-wong",2021-02-15 18:59:00,464

Quote: Thank you, fast food joints for not taking the chance to increase prices during this period. It has been eye rolling seeing F&B outlet owners and their children pleading for help during CB and not giving back to the society when times are good for them. Don\x92t forget consumers helped you pull through that difficult period when it was difficult for us ourselves. We need to make a living for ourselves, as much as they need to make up for whatever excuses they give for increasing prices. Their staff didn\x92t go back to their hometowns this CNY and rental definitely wouldn\x92t increase this year. The coffee powder and electricity didn\x92t increase during this period either. Is the increase in staff pay not an act to reward your own staff working hard for you? Come on, do you pay your staff that much more considered to the extra you make with the surcharge? When business is bad, they do not reduce the prices. When business is good, they increase the prices. After doing so, they act like they are the victims of circumstances and as if their profit margin is so thin. Chiu all agree bo ?",2021-02-14 17:50:00,223

Happy CYN Now that Joe Biden has taken over as US President, the cat is finally out of the bag: The coronavirus IS a biological weapon developed by USA when Trump was President. And they conveniently passed the blame to China and got the tycoon-controlled US media to flog it so, everyday. The truth eventually prevails. (Source of Covid-19 - USA Trump is over! Many acts of injustice will kill themselves, and the sky has the eyes and does not avoid it! Heaven has reincarnation, Who did God let go? Shocking! Today the poisoning killer was finally found, and it really was the United States! The truth is creepy, the new crown virus is man-made and originated from the P3 virus laboratory in North Carolina, USA ! Greg Rubini, a well-known American intelligence expert, officially revealed the secrets of this day in an interview with the First News Network television channel. According to Greg, the new crown virus was genetically engineered as a biological weapon. It originated from the BSL-3 laboratory in North Carolina and was developed by Professor Ralph Barrick.  He also stated that the virus was spread from North Carolina to China, Italy and the entire United States by the ""dark government"". Greg once tweeted and questioned Trump : Why didn't you tell the American people that the virus was made by the United States?  Why not make it clear that the new coronavirus itself is a biological weapon? Coincidentally, Professor  Montagnier, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of HIV , recently revealed to French reporters that the new coronavirus is not naturally occurring, but is carefully developed by biomolecular scientists . Montagnier also said: Obviously, professionals have added HIV sequences to this virus from bats. This is undoubtedly the biggest and worst poisoning case ever . Since the outbreak of the epidemic, rumors about ""the new crown virus is a synthetic biological weapon "" have been heated up, and scientists from various countries have been working hard to trace the source of the virus. As early as February, Indian scientists discovered the HIV virus insert in the new coronavirus , which proved that the virus was artificially designed and synthesized . In mid-March, scientists discovered that the new coronavirus extracted from a patient in Washington state had an evolutionary cycle of more than half a year.  With the deepening of research, many countries in the world have turned their skepticism toward the United States. Japan, Italy, Australia and other countries all have early confirmed cases originating from the United States. Subsequently, Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, admitted that many of the deaths of the ""flu"" that broke out in the United States in September 2019 were caused by the new crown virus .  In this regard, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country also questioned the United States on Twitter. After the arduous efforts of a team of reporters in Virginia, USA, it was finally traced back to patient zero . This Covin-19 patient zero is indeed an American soldier who participated in the Wuhan Military Games in October last year. Her name is Maatje Benassi .  This American female officer has a very special background. She has a great connection with the P4 Biochemical Laboratory in Fort Detrick of the United States . Many people in her family have been diagnosed. One of them was the first confirmed case in the Netherlands and had been there before the diagnosis.  The Lombardy region of Italy led to a major outbreak in the region. At this point, the chain of evidence that the United States is the birthplace of the new crown virus is complete and interlocking. The five special soldiers picked up by the special plane after the Wuhan Military Games finally had a substantial connection with the closed biochemical laboratory in the United States. According to the logic of Trump and others, we can rightly call the new crown virus North Carolina virus, or American virus. Just when all the evidence points to the United States, the top US officials openly admitted that the coronavirus is not a plague, but a weapon. Its shamelessness shocked the world, and this has further increased the suspicion of the United States of poisoning. The facts of the case have now come to light, but Trump and others are still desperately dumping the pot. The new crown virus has caused immense damage and losses to countries around the world. This pot is too big to be shaken out. There is another doubt that needs to be explained: What is the origin of Ralph Barrick, who is responsible for the development of the North Carolina virus, mentioned by Greg in the revelation? Barrick is from the University of North Carolina. He is the chief virologist who modified the new sars coronavirus through gene editing in 2015 and is also the leader in the development of the virus. What is even more surprising is that he is also the head of the clinical development of the magic drug ""Radixivir"". Is this the kind of legend that the poisoner will prepare the antidote in advance? In subsequent clinical trials, Ridesivir quickly fell to the altar because experts questioned its effectiveness and safety. With the spread of the virus, the United States has become the ""epicenter"" of the epidemic. In the early stages of the epidemic, US President Trump did not take it into consideration at all, but regarded it as a heavier influenza. Until the death of his friend, New York real estate tycoon Stanley Chela, who was infected with the new crown, it attracted his attention. But it is too late!  ... The sky does not give birth to China, and the ages are like a long night. Now that the murderers of drug production and poisoning have been exposed, what is waiting for them? We will wait and see! When the new crown virus broke out in Wuhan, China, Trump said that the United States had special medicines to save, but they never expected that the virus had mutated when the virus spread in the United States. The so-called special medicines that were prepared in advance to make a fortune in the world become a waste product, this is really the United States, which has eyes and done all bad things, is the bitter fruit of self-feeding!",2021-09-02 10:05:00,1055

Happy CYN Now that Joe Biden has taken over as US President, the cat is finally out of the bag: The coronavirus IS a biological weapon developed by USA when Trump was President. And they conveniently passed the blame to China and got the tycoon-controlled US media to flog it so, everyday. The truth eventually prevails. (Source of Covid-19 - USA Trump is over! Many acts of injustice will kill themselves, and the sky has the eyes and does not avoid it! Heaven has reincarnation, Who did God let go? Shocking! Today the poisoning killer was finally found, and it really was the United States! The truth is creepy, the new crown virus is man-made and originated from the P3 virus laboratory in North Carolina, USA ! Greg Rubini, a well-known American intelligence expert, officially revealed the secrets of this day in an interview with the First News Network television channel. According to Greg, the new crown virus was genetically engineered as a biological weapon. It originated from the BSL-3 laboratory in North Carolina and was developed by Professor Ralph Barrick.  He also stated that the virus was spread from North Carolina to China, Italy and the entire United States by the ""dark government"". Greg once tweeted and questioned Trump : Why didn't you tell the American people that the virus was made by the United States?  Why not make it clear that the new coronavirus itself is a biological weapon? Coincidentally, Professor  Montagnier, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of HIV , recently revealed to French reporters that the new coronavirus is not naturally occurring, but is carefully developed by biomolecular scientists . Montagnier also said: Obviously, professionals have added HIV sequences to this virus from bats. This is undoubtedly the biggest and worst poisoning case ever . Since the outbreak of the epidemic, rumors about ""the new crown virus is a synthetic biological weapon "" have been heated up, and scientists from various countries have been working hard to trace the source of the virus. As early as February, Indian scientists discovered the HIV virus insert in the new coronavirus , which proved that the virus was artificially designed and synthesized . In mid-March, scientists discovered that the new coronavirus extracted from a patient in Washington state had an evolutionary cycle of more than half a year.  With the deepening of research, many countries in the world have turned their skepticism toward the United States. Japan, Italy, Australia and other countries all have early confirmed cases originating from the United States. Subsequently, Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, admitted that many of the deaths of the ""flu"" that broke out in the United States in September 2019 were caused by the new crown virus .  In this regard, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country also questioned the United States on Twitter. After the arduous efforts of a team of reporters in Virginia, USA, it was finally traced back to patient zero . This Covin-19 patient zero is indeed an American soldier who participated in the Wuhan Military Games in October last year. Her name is Maatje Benassi .  This American female officer has a very special background. She has a great connection with the P4 Biochemical Laboratory in Fort Detrick of the United States . Many people in her family have been diagnosed. One of them was the first confirmed case in the Netherlands and had been there before the diagnosis.  The Lombardy region of Italy led to a major outbreak in the region. At this point, the chain of evidence that the United States is the birthplace of the new crown virus is complete and interlocking. The five special soldiers picked up by the special plane after the Wuhan Military Games finally had a substantial connection with the closed biochemical laboratory in the United States. According to the logic of Trump and others, we can rightly call the new crown virus North Carolina virus, or American virus. Just when all the evidence points to the United States, the top US officials openly admitted that the coronavirus is not a plague, but a weapon. Its shamelessness shocked the world, and this has further increased the suspicion of the United States of poisoning. The facts of the case have now come to light, but Trump and others are still desperately dumping the pot. The new crown virus has caused immense damage and losses to countries around the world.

They said the virus was \x93extremely unlikely\x94 to have spread as the result of a lab accident."" Look at his crooked face, no need to guess already: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-...id-19/13137984 ""And the conclusion was we did not find evidence of large outbreaks that could be related to cases of COVID-19 prior to December 2019 in Wuhan or elsewhere."" "" The WHO said team members were limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts and would not have any contact with community members, due to health concerns . In announcing the experts' visit last month, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said: ""The tracing of the virus origin will most likely involve multiple countries and localities."" so basically is just wayang... go there sight-seeing~~",2021-10-02 18:02:00,180

3544,4064,"On WHO trip, China refused to hand over important data",2021-02-14 01:21:00,"Chinese scientists refused to share raw data that might bring the world closer to understanding the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, independent investigators for the W.H.O. said on Friday. The investigators, who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to the Chinese city of Wuhan, said disagreements over patient records and other issues were so tense that they sometimes erupted into shouts among the typically mild-mannered scientists on both sides. China\x92s continued resistance to revealing information about the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, the scientists say, makes it difficult for them to uncover important clues that could help stop future outbreaks of such dangerous diseases. \x93If you are data focused, and if you are a professional,\x94 said Thea K\xf8lsen Fischer, a Danish epidemiologist on the team, then obtaining data is \x93like for a clinical doctor looking at the patient and seeing them by your own eyes.\x94 For 27 days in January and February, the team of 14 experts for the World Health Organization led the mission to trace the origins of the pandemic. Several say their Chinese counterparts were frustrated by the team\x92s persistent questioning and demands for data. Chinese officials urged the W.H.O. team to embrace the government\x92s narrative about the source of the virus, including the unproven notion that it might have spread to China from abroad, according to several members of the team. The W.H.O. scientists responded that they would refrain from making judgments without data. \x93It was my take on the entire mission that it was highly geopolitical,\x94 Dr. Fischer said. \x93Everybody knows how much pressure there is on China to be open to an investigation and also how much blame there might be associated with this.\x94 Marion Koopmans, right, and Peter Ben Embarek, center, of the World Health Organization with their counterpart from China, Liang Wannian, at a news conference at the end of their mission last week to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan. In the end, the W.H.O. experts sought compromise, praising the Chinese government\x92s transparency, but pushing for more research about the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019. It remains unclear if the compromise will work. Chinese officials told the team that they did not have enough time to compile detailed patient data and only provided summaries. The W.H.O. scientists said they were continuing to press their counterparts in China for the raw data and other information. The team members considered the trip, which ended this week, as a win mostly because they feel there is enough good will that talks and studies will continue. But they acknowledged there is too little information so far to answer critical questions. And they were criticized already for handing the Chinese side a public relations victory at a closing news conference by endorsing the contentious idea that the virus might have spread by frozen food products. On the crucial question of when the outbreak started, the team said it had not turned up evidence yet that it was earlier than China has reported. But the team was stymied at times by the lack of detailed patient records both from early confirmed cases, and possible ones before that. \x93We asked for that on a number of occasions and they gave us some of that, but not necessarily enough to do the sorts of analyses you would do,\x94 said Dominic Dwyer, an Australian microbiologist on the W.H.O. team, referring to the confirmed cases. The news that Chinese officials did not share raw data with the W.H.O. experts was reported earlier by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Wall Street Journal. The Chinese scientists also acknowledged they had discovered that 92 people were hospitalized in Wuhan as early as October 2019 with symptoms such as fever and coughing. The Chinese experts said they had found no trace of Covid-19 in those people, but the tests were incomplete. The W.H.O. team members said more research was needed. Any indication that the outbreak started earlier than December 2019 would leave China open to more criticism; Chinese officials have been widely criticized for initially trying to cover up the outbreak, and acting too late to stop it from spilling over into the rest of the world. This was never going to be an easy trip. The W.H.O. mission was embroiled in politics even before it began. For months, some officials in China and the United States accused each other, without evidence, of unleashing the virus on the world. China pushed back against pressure from Western countries to allow an independent inquiry into the source of the virus. After months of negotiations, Beijing relented after the W.H.O., which is beholden to member countries like China, agreed to cede control over key parts of the inquiry to Chinese scientists. And the logistics of the trip made already fraught relations even more tense. The W.H.O. team was forced into quarantine for the first two weeks, so meetings were conducted on Zoom. And even when the members emerged, rules to thwart outbreaks in China meant that the team could not gather with their counterparts for meals and informal talks. It has been difficult to get an understanding of how the Chinese side viewed relations; several of the Chinese scientists assisting in the mission did not respond to requests for comment. The W.H.O. team, which is expected to release a full report about its findings in coming weeks, is still pressing Chinese officials to conduct exhaustive checks of blood samples for signs that the virus might have been circulating earlier. The experts are also asking China to more deeply investigate the wildlife trade in Wuhan and the surrounding area for clues about how the virus might have jumped from animals to humans. It is unclear how fully the Chinese government \x97 which remains in firm control of research into the origins of the virus \x97 will cooperate. Security personnel setting up barriers outside the conference center where the World Health Organization team held a news conference in Wuhan.Ng Han Guan/Associated Press When the experts arrived in Wuhan last month, they set out to find the earliest known cases of Covid-19, asking Chinese officials to examine records for patients who had been hospitalized with symptoms such as fever and cough as early as October 2019. Chinese scientists, after a review of 76,000 records at 233 medical institutions in Wuhan, told the W.H.O. team that they had found 92 individuals who fit that description. The government performed antibody tests on two-thirds of those people and reported that they were not positive for Covid-19. (The other third either died or declined to be tested, the Chinese scientists said.) The W.H.O. scientists were frustrated by the Chinese government\x92s reluctance to explain how they had gathered the data, according to interviews with team members. Dr. Fischer said she would have expected to find many more cases of individuals who were hospitalized with such symptoms in a city the size of Wuhan. In heated discussions, Dr. Fischer recounted, the W.H.O. experts urged the Chinese scientists to conduct a more thorough search. The team also expressed concerns about the reliability of antibody tests administered so long after the infections. Testing any original nose or throat swabs would be useful, but Dr. Dwyer said there were none. Chinese officials agreed to look more broadly at samples in Wuhan blood banks in 2019, though they said that they had not yet obtained permission to do so. The W.H.O. experts ultimately concluded that there was no evidence yet that the virus was transmitting on a wide scale in China before December 2019, but that more research definitely was needed. Chinese commentators have seized on that finding to build on the government\x92s mantra that it was possible that China was not the source of the outbreak, and to urge the W.H.O. to look elsewhere. The W.H.O. team said it would look, but that they were skeptical. \x93I think it started in China,\x94 Dr. Dwyer said after the trip. \x93There is some evidence of circulation outside China, but it\x92s actually pretty light.\x94 During the visit, Chinese scientists also urged the W.H.O. team to consider the frozen-food theory that has gained traction in the country. The W.H.O. team ultimately agreed to explore in more detail how the virus might spread through frozen food. But in interviews, team members said the focus for now would be on frozen wildlife products sold in China \x97 not imported food. The idea that the virus might have initially spread to humans from frozen wildlife products is a \x93very unlikely scenario,\x94 said Fabian Leendertz, a German zoonotic disease specialist and a member of the team. He said the team agreed to include the frozen food theory among its hypotheses \x93to respect, a bit, the findings\x94 of the Chinese scientists. Peter Daszak, a member of the W.H.O. team and the president of EcoHealth Alliance in New York, said the trip was emotionally draining, as he and the team came to terms with the trauma of the early days of the pandemic. The team interviewed some of the first people to fall ill with Covid-19 in Wuhan, as well as medical workers. \x93The world doesn\x92t realize, you know, that they were the first to get this thing,\x94 Dr. Daszak said, \x93and they didn\x92t know how bad it was.\x94 https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/world/asia/china-world-health-organization-coronavirus.html?smid=url-share",2021-02-13 18:00:00,1561

In August 2019, Fort Detrick, the U.S. Army's top secret medical research institute for infectious diseases, was closed in Fort Detrick. This was the office of Shiro Ishii 731. In September 2019, there were at least 1,500 unexplained e-cigarette pneumonias, followed by a large-scale ""flu"" that killed more than 37,000 people in the United States. In October 2019, the United States organized the 201-Global Epidemic Exercise with the participation of the CIA to simulate a coronavirus pandemic raging on the planet. In November 2019, at the Wuhan Military Games, most of the U.S. military's main force caught a cold and did not get any gold. In December 2019, China discovered pneumonia of unknown origin. In February 2020, an epidemic broke out in the world. Excellent track record of America In 1918, falsely accused Spain of H1N1 influenza A. In 1981, falsely accused Africa of AIDS spread. In 2009, falsely accused Mexica of swine flu. In 2019, falsely accused China of COVID-19. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), acknowledged before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday that some Americans who appear to have died of the flu were tested positive for the new #coronavirus in a postmortem diagnosis.

As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 60138, he was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 10 February. On 11 February, he was tested for COVID-19 even though he is asymptomatic. His test result came back positive on the same day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His serology test result has come back positive. * Case 60192 Case 60192 is a 62 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of Case 60138[1], and is a homemaker. She was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 10 February when Case 60138 was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. She was tested for COVID-19 on the same day even though she is asymptomatic. Her test came back positive on 11 February, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them. Effective contact tracing is an important enabler to ringfence community transmission. Both Cases 60191 and 60192 do not use the TraceTogether App, and while they both have TraceTogether tokens, they did not carry their tokens with them. Individuals are reminded to turn on their TraceTogether App or carry their TraceTogether token at all times so that we can quickly identify and isolate the close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and limit further infections.

Case 60162 is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Indonesia on 26 November 2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 10 December. His swab done on 6 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 10 February 2021 in preparation for his return to Indonesia. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, although the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load. His serological test result has also come back positive. He reported that before his trip to Singapore, he had interacted with his sibling in Indonesia who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection in October 2020. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others. https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...on_12FebUpdate",2021-12-02 23:30:00,239

He reported that before his trip to Singapore, he had interacted with his sibling in Indonesia who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection in October 2020. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others. https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...on_12FebUpdate 78 days in SG still considered IMPORT case.

As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 60138, he was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 10 February. On 11 February, he was tested for COVID-19 even though he is asymptomatic. His test result came back positive on the same day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His serology test result has come back positive. * Case 60192 Case 60192 is a 62 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of Case 60138[1], and is a homemaker. She was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 10 February when Case 60138 was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. She was tested for COVID-19 on the same day even though she is asymptomatic. Her test came back positive on 11 February, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them. Effective contact tracing is an important enabler to ringfence community transmission. Both Cases 60191 and 60192 do not use the TraceTogether App, and while they both have TraceTogether tokens, they did not carry their tokens with them. Individuals are reminded to turn on their TraceTogether App or carry their TraceTogether token at all times so that we can quickly identify and isolate the close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and limit further infections. [1]*Case 60138 is a 66 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who works as a stall owner of a sundry shop at Chinatown Complex. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 10 February.",2021-12-02 23:26:00,345

They need to focus on the movements of the jobless son during the past 2 weeks. If already got antibodies then he could have caught it ages ago but his body has not cleared the virus yet, 2 weeks probably not long enough given how long some people stay in isolation for. The 2 weeks assumes you are have recently developed symptoms. In Europe they say that you are safe to go about your business after 10 days of the first symptom but there's no evidence to suggest this is true and look at the mess they are in with being too hasty. We also don't know enough about this virus either. Having antibodies doesn't necessarily prevent the presence of the virus, it could just mean preventing symptoms. This is the issue with vaccines, it's likely that even if you are vaccinated you can still ""catch"" the virus, test positive yet be asymptomatic and spread the virus to others regardless of whether the others are vaccinated or not. The vaccine is only intended to prevent symptoms, not prevent infection. So in this case, he could be patient 0, recovered and then recaught the virus given close proximity to high viral load from family members albeit with antibodies now he won't have symptoms. Over the last 1-2 months has he had any kind of symptoms, was he flagged as being somewhere that an infected person visited, there are many questions to ask. Asymptomatic infection of both vaccinated and non vaccinated people will be an issue that becomes more apparent during 2021 causing the pace of reopening to slow down. What the vaccine does is not being fully understood by many.",2021-02-13 00:41:00,311

As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 60138, he was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 10 February. On 11 February, he was tested for COVID-19 even though he is asymptomatic. His test result came back positive on the same day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His serology test result has come back positive. * Case 60192 Case 60192 is a 62 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of Case 60138[1], and is a homemaker. She was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 10 February when Case 60138 was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. She was tested for COVID-19 on the same day even though she is asymptomatic. Her test came back positive on 11 February, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them. Effective contact tracing is an important enabler to ringfence community transmission. Both Cases 60191 and 60192 do not use the TraceTogether App, and while they both have TraceTogether tokens, they did not carry their tokens with them. Individuals are reminded to turn on their TraceTogether App or carry their TraceTogether token at all times so that we can quickly identify and isolate the close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and limit further infections. [1]*Case 60138 is a 66 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who works as a stall owner of a sundry shop at Chinatown Complex. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 10 February.",2021-02-13 04:26:00,358

So folks, do not let your guard down and think by with a covering over your face or other people's faces = superman. In fact, some masks/coverings also vary in effectiveness in source control in preventing infection spread, eg some DIY cloth masks, look pretty nia.   The gaiter/scarf that created a hoo-haa here is a good eg. This is one of the very first experiment/study done ...... with surgical masks so the filter media confirm is ok one.  66.7% infection rate dropped to 16.7% with universal masking both by the infector and the infectee, and do note both parties have very good sealing with little to no gaps in terms of air bypass. https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/...-effectiveness Actually don't even need the scientific studies.....   if face masks work that great by itself, we already won't have all those unlinked cases with universal masking already.  (but dont misunderstand me, it does reduce) ps.  For chin diaper wearers and mouth mask wearers that you so often see nowadays, then all bets are off hor. Bonus Usually for the  masks with more restrictive media (eg surgical masks), it would leak at the nose and sides....that is why it's still breathable.  Try using your hands to cusp the sides and nose, it'd be much more unbreathable. Video shows this very clearly.  It does cut the distance travelled and catches the big ballistic droplets so there is reduction, but the plume is still there, and any slight air movement would move this. Look at the more DIY type pretty pretty cloth masks (not talking about the temasek ones).  Maybe this also applies a bit to the cheaper non-surgical $2.50 for 50pcs MIC ones, coz i did measure significantly lower levels of filtration on my laser particle counter.

In the lead up to Chinese New Year on 8 February and 9 February, we carried out surveillance testing for stallholders, shop owners, persons in the food and beverage industry, as well as food delivery persons operating in and around Chinatown. In all, 1,221 individuals were tested.

Case 60138 Case 60138 is a 66 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who works as a stall owner of a sundry shop at Chinatown Complex (335 Smith Street). He developed a dry cough on 28 January and anosmia on 9 February but did not seek medical attention. He was subsequently detected from our community surveillance testing of stallholders and shop owners in Chinatown on 9 February. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 10 February, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Case 60150 Case 60150 is a 32 year-old male Singaporean who is the son of Case 60138 and works part-time as a waiter at Swensen\x92s located at Changi Airport Terminal 3. He was last at work on 8 February. He developed a runny nose on 8 February after work but did not seek medical treatment. As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 60138, he was contacted by MOH on 10 February and placed on quarantine. He reported his symptoms and was conveyed to NCID where he was tested for COVID-19 on the same day. His test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 11 February. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. We strongly urge everyone to do their part to reduce the risk of transmission. Those who are unwell, including those showing early/mild symptoms, should be socially responsible and seek medical attention immediately and stay at home to prevent the spread of illness to others. Case 60145 Case 60145 is a 20 year-old male Singaporean who is a full-time National Serviceman. He works at the Singapore Armed Forces premises at 200 Airport Road. He does not stay in camp, and his work does not entail interacting with other units. He felt unwell on 3 February, and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic. As he did not have symptoms associated with acute respiratory infection, he was not tested for COVID-19 but was placed on medical leave. He subsequently went back to work on 8 February, and on 9 February, he developed fever and a runny nose.

Both cases were hospitalised. One has since been discharged and the other is in stable condition in hospital. 2 *********** In view of the suspected ongoing transmission, SFA has issued a direction to suspend Hooi Kee Eating House\x92s food business operations with effect from 11 February 2021 until further notice. Members of the public who have consumed food from Hooi Kee Eating House and subsequently develop prolonged fever, should consult their general practitioner immediately and inform the doctor of their food history. 3 *********** All food handlers working in the premises are required to re-attend and pass the Food Safety Course Level 1 and test negative for foodborne pathogens, before they can resume work as food handlers. The appointed Food Hygiene Officer(s) working at the premises are also required to re-attend and pass the WSQ Conduct Food and Beverage Hygiene Audit course before he/she can resume work as a Food Hygiene Officer. The licensee is also required to clean and sanitise the premises, including equipment and utensils. 4 *********** Food safety is a joint responsibility. SFA would like to remind food operators to observe good food and personal hygiene practices at all times. SFA will not hesitate to take firm action against anyone found to be in violation of the Environmental Public Health Act. In the interest of maintaining a high standard of food hygiene at all eating establishments, we would also like to advise members of the public who come across*poor hygiene practices in food establishments not to patronise such outlets but to report to SFA via the online feedback form (http://www.sfa.gov.sg/feedback) with details for our follow-up investigations. * Health Advisory 5 *********** Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella typhi. Food items which could be contaminated by the bacteria include raw or ready-to-eat foods, such as raw (unpasteurised) milk or their products, seafood, and fresh produce including fruits and vegetables. 6 *********** A person with typhoid fever usually has prolonged fever which may be accompanied by other symptoms common to many diseases, such as headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation. Typhoid fever is treatable with antibiotics. 7 *********** The key to prevention of typhoid fever lies in hand hygiene, safe handling, cooking and consumption of food. Individuals can reduce their risk of getting typhoid fever by: Washing and peeling raw fruit or vegetables that can be peeled before consumption;Thoroughly cooking food;Avoiding raw (unpasteurised) milk or foods made from raw milk;Washing hands and kitchen utensils such as knives and cutting boards thoroughly before handling food; andUsing separate sets of knives and cutting board for raw and cooked food.",2021-11-02 22:26:00,472

She developed anosmia on 4 February, but did not seek medical attention. On 7 February, she was tested for COVID-19 as part of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\x92s requirement for air crew to be tested following their return from overseas. Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 8 February, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for an individual swab, and isolated. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Her previous test on 22 January following another turnaround flight was negative for COVID-19. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. She has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further confirmatory tests.* Case 60102 received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2 February. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, she could not have been infected due to vaccination.

4413,5087,"SIA cabin crew member likely infected on flight, 4 CECA passengers tested positive for COVID",2021-11-02 16:51:00,"Peiseh. Wols. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...itive-14147892 SINGAPORE: A Singapore Airlines (SIA) cabin crew member who tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday (Feb 9) might have been infected on board a flight, after four passengers on the same plane were also found to have the disease, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). The SIA crew member, a 41-year-old Singaporean woman, was one of the 11 new imported COVID-19 cases reported in Singapore on Tuesday. She has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain of the coronavirus, and is pending further confirmatory tests. The four passengers who were on the same flight have also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain. ""In view of her recent travel history, and the possibility that she might have been infected on board the flight, we have preliminarily classified this case as imported,"" said MOH. READ: SIA cabin crew member preliminarily positive for B117 strain; case among Singapore's 11 new COVID-19 infections READ: COVID-19: Singapore tightens restrictions for Vietnam travellers; New South Wales visitors to take test on arrival CABIN CREW MEMBER WORKED TURNAROUND FLIGHT TO UAE The Singaporean woman, identified as Case 60102, left Singapore on a turnaround flight to the United Arab Emirates on Jan 30, and returned on Feb 1 without disembarking from the aircraft. Three days later, she developed ""anosmia"", or the loss of smell, but did not seek medical attention, said MOH. On Feb 7, she was tested for COVID-19 as part of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\u2019s requirement for air crew to be tested following their return from overseas. Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day and she was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for an individual swab and isolated. She was confirmed positive for COVID-19 on Feb 9. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection, said MOH. Her previous test on Jan 22 following another turnaround flight was negative for COVID-19. READ: Travellers on Business Travel Pass scheme required to undergo additional COVID-19 tests CABIN CREW MEMBER RECEIVED FIRST DOSE OF VACCINE Case 60102 received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Feb 2, a day after touching down in Singapore and two days before the onset of symptoms. MOH said that she could not have been infected due to vaccination as the vaccine does not contain live virus. ""It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination,"" said MOH. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the woman's identified close contacts, including her family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed in quarantine, said MOH. They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period. Serological tests will also be done for her close contacts to determine if she could have been infected by them.

This is because the modern aircraft cabin has its air changed many times, more frequently than offices or shops, said Dr Powell. Such air goes through air filtration systems known as a high-efficiency particulate air (Hepa) filter, which can remove about 99.97 per cent of airborne microbes, including virus and bacteria. Cabin air is refreshed every two or three minutes with this filter. ""Furthermore, the cabin air system delivers approximately 50 per cent outside air and 50 per cent filtered, recirculated air. This means the supplied air is essentially sterile,"" said Dr Powell.\x94 https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...if-sick-person",2021-11-02 00:00:00,140

If you don't understand, I can simplify. The order simply means that: 1. If the maid is the home owner's domestic worker , she cannot use the facilities. 2.

If I go to the management and tell them that the maid is also my girlfriend and we have an intimate relationship, would they let her use?

You can have special access cards (maid edition), time cards, treadmills with time allocation, sign in sign out, specific arrangement between owner and gym officer on the maid's reserved time slot of say half an hour... so many ways to get things done so that facility usage can be an incentive for good maid work done or for kind families to bless their maids.

First of all, facilities meant for students are not meant for teachers. If there is welfare for teachers, it is separate. Teachers shouldn\x92t abuse power. And only if you yourself is registered formally as a student, just like ownership of the condo, and even if u r formally the student, it is still subjected to the management of the school. There are open spaces versus enclosed spaces where bookings have priorities to whom they should go To put it straight to you, you may see the maid who lives there as your family. That is between you and your maid. You shouldn\x92t impose that on others though. The condo facilities needs to be maintained and the cost is on the others also. It is not wrong for condo to limit the facilities to only the owners and their immediate family. Whether it is your maid that u took as family or your secret mistress that u love dearly, that is between you and them, the management do not need to service them. Whether or not the maid works for you is also immaterial, just like the plumber or tv repairman at your place, and the fact that the maids lives there does not change the fact. First of all, you need to segregate what you feel for the maid and what the facilities are meant for. Second thing is to stop thinking that others are discriminating against the maids. Only after that it is possible to discuss if there can be flexibilities (maid can use if accompanied by owner, assess card can be given temporarily by the owner to the maid if he deem appropriate etc) discussed with and approved by management If the concern is the mental health of the maids and their recreational needs, this is something that they have to deal with it themselves or with their friends or if authorities to be included, their respective embassies and the NGOs from their countries.

After all, if the maid causes any trouble, the employer does need to bear responsibility. it is the maximum.

5276,5983,Double-Masking lai liao,2021-11-02 08:02:00,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released new guidance about the best ways to use masks to help prevent transmission of covid-19. One key recommendation highlights the added benefits of using a more snugly fitting mask or pairing a cloth mask with a surgical mask. Experimental data collected by the agency suggests that either option should greatly reduce the risk of transmission between people. Rochelle Walensky, the newly appointed CDC director, discussed the new recommendations during a White House coronavirus briefing on Wednesday. Walensky first reiterated the current consensus that properly worn masks can help limit the spread of the coronavirus. Some masks are better at protecting the wearer from infection (N95 and KN95 masks in particular), but they all limit the outward transmission of potentially infectious droplets and aerosols to others. New research from the CDC, however, looked at the relative effectiveness of different methods using cloth and surgical masks and how it could be improved. In the study, even cloth masks were more effective than no masks at limiting the spread of aerosol and droplet particles the size of those emitted by people with covid-19. But surgical masks that were more snugly fit or that had a cloth mask worn on top of them were the most effective at protecting the user and others. In an experiment that simulated being exposed to an infectious person breathing nearby, having both parties wear better-fitted or double-layered masks reduced the level of exposure by more than 95 percent, Walensky said, compared to no mask at all. \x93I want to be clear that these new scientific data released today do not change the specific recommendations about who should wear a mask or when they should wear one, but they do provide new information on why wearing a well-fitting mask is so important to protect you and others,\x94 she added. The CDC has now updated its website on improving the effectiveness of masks based on this new data. To make surgical masks better-fitting, for instance, the CDC recommends first knotting the strands of the ear loops and tucking in the outer layer of the mask fabric (there\x92s a helpful guide and visual provided by the CDC if that description isn\x92t clear enough). There are also other products, such as mask fitters and braces or masks with nose bridges, that will make a mask tighter. However it\x92s done, you can tell a mask is snug enough if you can feel warm air come through the front of the mask and the mask moves with every breath you take. As for double-masking, the CDC recommends either wearing a cloth mask with multiple layers or wearing a cloth mask over a surgical mask. However, it doesn\x92t recommend wearing two surgical masks at once, or combining an KN95 mask with any other mask (to be fair, these masks are already very good at protection when worn correctly). In addition to wearing masks in public, people should obviously still practice physical distancing whenever possible, avoid crowded indoor spaces, and wash their hands regularly. https://gizmodo.com/cdc-releases-new...ing-1846242314",2021-11-02 08:02:00,499

5501,6234,Why so many sinkies still think they 100% won't get covid by simply wearing mask?,2021-10-02 16:22:00,"Most people erroneously think that wearing a mask is to prevent catching the virus from another person. The fact is : The COVID-19 virus can be easily caught directly or indirectly through the eyes which is not covered by the mask. This is why many people still suddenly got infected in S. Korea and Japan despite wearing masks The main purpose of mask is to reduce the possibility of an infected person passing the virus onto the surrounding things and people. This is why when the infection rate in the population is low, only the infected need to wear mask and there is no point for a healthy person to wear mask.

Study above posted in detail below..... https://msphere.asm.org/content/5/5/e00637-20#F2 Although the initial particle size exhaled was 5.5\u2009\xb1\u20090.2\u2009\u03bcm in mass median diameter , some of the droplets likely gradually evaporated and changed to aerosols. Quote: When a mannequin exposed to the virus was equipped with various masks (cotton mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask), the uptake of the virus droplets/aerosols was reduced. A cotton mask led to an approximately 20% to 40% reduction in virus uptake compared to no mask (Fig. 2B). The N95 mask had the highest protective efficacy (approximately 80% to 90% reduction) of the various masks examined; however, infectious virus penetration was measurable even when the N95 mask was completely fitted to the face with adhesive tape (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission, whereas the N95 mask showed considerable protective efficacy (Fig. 2C). There was a synergistic effect when both the virus receiver and virus spreader wore masks (cotton masks or surgical masks) to prevent the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols (Fig. 2D and E). However, it remains unknown whether the small amount of virus that was able to pass through the N95 masks would result in illness.",2021-10-02 09:46:00,222

Wearing mask is just giving people a false sense of security. Add : If the infected rate is high, the chances of catching the virus in crowded places would be high even if everyone wears mask. The main reason why so many people in Singapore are still crowding around in hawker centers and shopping malls (including Chinatown during CNY) is the infected rate in the population is very low (thanks to the various government measures). The testing, isolation and SHN of travelers coming into Singapore are also greatly reducing the possibility of the virus spreading from outside the country to the community.  So, contrary to the concerns of some people, the number of import cases is actually not a concern at current levels (<50 each day). Based on the number of new community cases each day, the infected rate in the population might be 1 in 2 million each day. When the infected rate is so low, the chances that someone in a crowd of a few hundreds has the virus is extremely low.  Add to this, the chances of an infected person spreads the virus to the surrounding is reduced when he/she wears a mask. This is why we have not seen any explosion of the number of new cases despite so many people crowding in hawker centers, supermarkets, shopping malls and public transport everyday. Therefore, as long as the infected rate in the population remains this low, crowds of a few hundreds or even a few thousands is, contrary to some people's thinking, not a major concern.

She departed Singapore on 30 January on a turnaround flight to the UAE , and returned on 1 February without disembarking from the aircraft at the overseas destination. She developed anosmia on 4 February, but did not seek medical attention. On 7 February, she was tested for COVID-19 as part of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\x92s requirement for air crew to be tested following their return from overseas. Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 8 February, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for an individual swab, and isolated. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Her previous test on 22 January following another turnaround flight was negative for COVID-19. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. She has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further confirmatory tests.* Case 60102 received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2 February. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, she could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.* Besides Case 60102, 4 passengers on the same flight (Cases 59885, 59893, 59901 and 59902) have tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and are also preliminarily positive for the B117 strain. In view of her recent travel history, and the possibility that she might have been infected onboard the flight, we have preliminarily classified this case as imported.* https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...feb2021-update https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...ction-9feb2021 As of 9 February 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed that there are no new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection. 2.***** There are 11 imported cases, of whom 10 had already been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore. The remaining case is a cabin crew with Singapore Airlines who was on a turnaround flight and had not disembarked from the aircraft at the overseas destination.

She departed Singapore on 30 January on a turnaround flight to the UAE , and returned on 1 February without disembarking from the aircraft at the overseas destination. She developed anosmia on 4 February, but did not seek medical attention. On 7 February, she was tested for COVID-19 as part of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\x92s requirement for air crew to be tested following their return from overseas. Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 8 February, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for an individual swab, and isolated. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Her previous test on 22 January following another turnaround flight was negative for COVID-19. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. She has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further confirmatory tests.* Case 60102 received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2 February. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, she could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.* Besides Case 60102, 4 passengers on the same flight (Cases 59885, 59893, 59901 and 59902) have tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and are also preliminarily positive for the B117 strain. In view of her recent travel history, and the possibility that she might have been infected onboard the flight, we have preliminarily classified this case as imported.* https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...feb2021-update",2021-09-02 22:08:00,272

Somemore below was not B117 variant.... https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/11/20-3299_article Transmission of SARS-CoV 2 During Long-Haul Flight Transmission on flight VN54 was clustered in business class, where seats are already more widely spaced than in economy class, and infection spread much further than the existing 2-row (36) or 2 meters (37) rule recommended for COVID-19 prevention on airplanes and other public transport would have captured. Similar conclusions were reached for SARS-CoV superspreader events on a flight in 2003, in which a high risk for infection was observed for passengers seated farther than 3 rows from the index case (4). This finding also concurs with transmission patterns observed for influenza virus (38) and is generally in line with the mounting evidence that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major yet underrecognized transmission route (39,40). Making mask wearing obligatory and making hand hygiene and cough etiquette standard practice while on board and at airports seems an obvious and relatively simple measure (27). Blocking middle seats, currently recommended by the airline industry (7,35), may in theory prevent some in-flight transmission events but seems to be insufficient to prevent superspreading events. We conclude that the risk for on-board transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during long flights is real and has the potential to cause COVID-19 clusters of substantial size, even in business class\u2013like settings with spacious seating arrangements well beyond the established distance used to define close contact on airplanes.",2021-10-02 02:12:00,223

Only 150 patrons were allowed inside the market.ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN The shoppers at Chong Pang City Wet Market were trying to keep a safe distance from each other.ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN A queue of about 250 people waiting to enter Kovan Market and Food Centre.ST PHOTO: GIN TAY A queue of about 250 people waiting to enter Kovan Market and Food Centre.ST PHOTO: GIN TAY The queue extended from Kovan Market and Food Centre all the way to Kovan MRT station.ST PHOTO: GIN TAY SINGAPORE - Wet markets around Singapore are still seeing huge crowds three days before the start of Chinese New Year. The Straits Times was at the wet markets in Kovan, Chong Pang and Potong Pasir on Tuesday morning (Feb 9) and some customers said they had to queue for more than two hours. Safe distancing measures did not appear to be observed in some queues. When ST visited the Kovan Market and Food Centre at Block 209 Hougang Street 21 at 10am, a queue of about 250 people had formed from the market all the way to Kovan MRT station, about a three-minute's walk away. Customers said they had been queueing for between one and two hours. A customer, who wanted to be known only as Madam S. Koh, 60, had been queueing for about 1\xbd hours and said this was the first time she had seen such a long queue in more than 50 years. She said: ""I'm not surprised, it's quite expected. CNY is coming. I think people are doing last-minute shopping."" Ms Sera Ho, 62, who works in a legal firm, said the queue was not so long when she visited the market last Saturday. Ms Ho, who usually spends about an hour to do her shopping but took three hours today, said: ""The queue is very long because of safe distancing. They're controlling the crowds so there aren't that many people inside."" Customers told ST that officers from the National Environment Agency were managing the crowd inside the market. An employee from the Aljunied Town Council, who was helping out with crowd control, said around 120 people were allowed into the market at a time. A safe distancing ambassador helping to regulate the crowd at Kovan Market and Food Centre on Feb 9, 2021. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY Ms Doris Lau, 58, who lives in Punggol, said she had been queueing for an hour since 9am. She added: ""I wanted to turn back, but I have groceries to top up."" She said some items she wanted to buy, such as fishballs, had sold out. Housewife Theresa Tan, 73, said she might visit the market in Ang Mo Kio instead of Kovan tomorrow to avoid the queue. She said: ""This is the first time I have queued from the MRT station. I don't know why today is so special."" When ST reached Chong Pang City Wet Market at 9.30am, there were about 95 people in the queue. About six crowd controllers were ensuring that customers adhered to safe distancing measures. Customers had to scan SafeEntry QR codes before being allowed to enter the market and were trying to keep a safe distance from one another. The crowd controllers told ST that only 150 patrons were allowed inside the market and that the barriers would be lifted at 11am. Inside, ST saw a safe distancing ambassador patrolling, together with a crowd controller. Crowd controllers were also stationed at each exit, ensuring that members of the public did not jump queue to enter the market. Accounts officer Neo Bee Leng, 46, who waited about an hour with her elderly mother to enter the market, said that in previous years, the market would be packed and people would have to push one another inside the market. She was concerned about the crowds, especially for her elderly mother, but said she would try to ensure they kept a safe distance from one another. Mr Kelvin Yuen, 50, who owns a fruit stall in the market, said that in previous years, the market would be packed at around 10am. But this year, the crowds have reduced by about half. At Block 147 Potong Pasir, Avenue 1, residents flocked to the mini market. When ST visited at 9.30am, customers were seen brushing past one another inside Jackson Market Shop while more than 20 customers queued to pay without observing safe distancing measures. When asked why she was doing her marketing now and not earlier, Ms Rooba Chevi, 27, who works as a student care teacher, said: ""It was hard to buy earlier as I work on weekdays and the weekend (crowd) is worse."" https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ays-before-cny",2021-09-02 23:02:00,759

She departed Singapore on 30 January on a turnaround flight to the UAE , and returned on 1 February without disembarking from the aircraft at the overseas destination. She developed anosmia on 4 February, but did not seek medical attention. On 7 February, she was tested for COVID-19 as part of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\x92s requirement for air crew to be tested following their return from overseas. Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 8 February, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for an individual swab, and isolated. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Her previous test on 22 January following another turnaround flight was negative for COVID-19. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. She has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further confirmatory tests.* Case 60102 received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2 February. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, she could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.* Besides Case 60102, 4 passengers on the same flight (Cases 59885, 59893, 59901 and 59902) have tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and are also preliminarily positive for the B117 strain.

Case 60051 Case 60051 is a 49 year-old male Singaporean who works as a bus driver employed by Cobb & Coach Services Pte Ltd. His job includes transporting individuals placed on SHN from Changi Airport to dedicated SHN facilities. His bus is disinfected after every trip. He developed a runny nose on 31 January but did not seek medical attention. He was subsequently detected when he was tested on 5 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 6 February, and an individual test was done later that night at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His earlier tests from RRT \x96 the last being on 23 January \x96 were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Case 60052 Case 60052 is a 30 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Pass holder, and works as an engineer at Station Satcom Pte Ltd. As part of his job, he boards ships to install communications and IT equipment. He had earlier been identified as a close contact of Case 59208[1], and was placed on quarantine from 13 January to 24 January. His swabs taken during quarantine on 13 January and 21 January were negative for COVID-19. Subsequent tests done as part of RRT \x96 the last being on 29 January \x96 were also negative for COVID-19. He developed fatigue on 4 February, and a fever the next day but did not seek medical attention. On 5 February, he was tested for COVID-19 as part of RRT. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. While his serological test taken on 7 February has come back positive, this is assessed to be a recent infection as he is symptomatic, and the Ct value for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was low. Case 60052 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 27 January, which accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.",2021-08-02 22:40:00,484

Upon return, BTP travellers will undergo an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in lieu of the SHN and are required to be isolated in a single location until they obtain a negative result for their OAT. In addition, travellers are required to use TraceTogether, avoid all forms of public transport within 14 days of return, comply with safe management measures at their workplace and abide by all other prevailing measures applicable to local residents.* 10.* *As an added precautionary measure, travellers on this scheme are now required to undergo COVID-19 PCR Tests on*Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14*of their return. An additional serology test will also be required on Day 3. These enhanced testing requirements serve to minimise the risk of potential incubating cases leaking into the community. Travellers are also to avoid events with more than 8 attendees within 14 days of returning to Singapore. 11.* *As compliance to the border measures in this scheme is crucial to safeguarding public health and helping to curb potential transmission of COVID-19 to the community, BTP holders must comply with the border measures in this scheme or risk having their BTPs revoked. 12.* *We will continue to carefully monitor the global situation and the public health outcomes from this scheme in order to strike a calibrated balance between the safety of the local community and resuming business travel in support of our overall economic recovery.",2021-09-02 20:17:00,270

Case 60051 Case 60051 is a 49 year-old male Singaporean who works as a bus driver employed by Cobb & Coach Services Pte Ltd. His job includes transporting individuals placed on SHN from Changi Airport to dedicated SHN facilities. His bus is disinfected after every trip. He developed a runny nose on 31 January but did not seek medical attention. He was subsequently detected when he was tested on 5 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 6 February, and an individual test was done later that night at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His earlier tests from RRT \x96 the last being on 23 January \x96 were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Case 60052 Case 60052 is a 30 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Pass holder, and works as an engineer at Station Satcom Pte Ltd. As part of his job, he boards ships to install communications and IT equipment. He had earlier been identified as a close contact of Case 59208[1], and was placed on quarantine from 13 January to 24 January. His swabs taken during quarantine on 13 January and 21 January were negative for COVID-19. Subsequent tests done as part of RRT \x96 the last being on 29 January \x96 were also negative for COVID-19. He developed fatigue on 4 February, and a fever the next day but did not seek medical attention. On 5 February, he was tested for COVID-19 as part of RRT. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. While his serological test taken on 7 February has come back positive, this is assessed to be a recent infection as he is symptomatic, and the Ct value for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was low. Case 60052 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 27 January, which accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them. https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...n-8-feb-update",2021-08-02 22:46:00,489

That is also why scarfs/gaiters are useless when worn by the infector pax. Even with good cloth masks, ensure that there is 1m distancing. If can't maintain that, which is understandable sometimes with the current conditions and climate, then it'd boil down to luck liao........ or you can opt to wear the more protective respirator types (not only N95, there are others which are more comfy and don't have a significant drop in overall filtration/leak) that have a seal all round the cheeks/chin, and using good meltblown for middle ply that filters more. I don't think safety glasses are needed currently, but there are some quite stylish ones that can offer decent protection in detected cases do go up, coz you can also be sure that the number of undetected cases floating in the community including asymptomatics also correspondingly go up in the order of several magnitudes.

6084,6901,Man jailed for stealing Budget 2020 grocery vouchers from neighbour's unsecured letterbox,2021-08-02 16:20:00,"A man was jailed for seven days on Monday (Feb 8) for stealing his neighbour's Budget 2020 grocery vouchers after noticing that his letterbox was not closed properly. Zamri Mohamed Ali, 43, pleaded guilty to one charge of stealing 30 vouchers worth S$10 each, which were meant to offset household expenses for needy Singaporeans during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vouchers, announced as part of Budget 2020, are for needy adult Singaporeans living in one- and two-room HDB flats and who do not own more than one property. The court heard that Zamri lived with his 37-year-old girlfriend, co-accused Farahdillah Ibrahim, in a flat in Aljunied Crescent. Farahdillah and Zamri each received their allocated grocery vouchers via Zamri's letterbox sometime before early October last year. At about 7pm on Oct 9 last year, Zamri checked his letterbox at the void deck as he was expecting a delivery, but did not find anything. As he closed the flap to his letterbox, he saw that his neighbour's letterbox was not closed properly. He tapped the letterbox, opening it, and flipped through the letters inside, hoping to find some grocery vouchers as he knew the residents in his block of flats were likely to receive them. He saw two white envelopes with the words ""On Government Service"" and knew that they contained the vouchers as they were similar to his own. Zamri pocketed the two envelopes, which were addressed to two of his neighbours, and noticed that there were serial numbers on the vouchers. Knowing that he would get caught the moment he used the vouchers, Zamri decided to use his own vouchers on household items first. His girlfriend used six of the stolen vouchers at a supermarket on Oct 12, 2020, and closed-circuit television footage showed her returning to Zamri's home. The victim lodged a police report the next day, saying that he had not received his grocery vouchers and found out that they had already been used. When Farahdillah returned to the supermarket and tried to use two more vouchers, they were rejected. She was later nabbed along with Zamri, and 24 vouchers were recovered from Zamri's flat. Zamri is the latest to be jailed over a spate of grocery vouchers released as part of Budget 2020. A man was jailed for four weeks last month for similar crimes - he had used the stolen vouchers to buy groceries and burnt the remainder as offerings to his late wife. A woman admitted last month to using an improvised device made of a pen, a fishing hook and sticky tape to steal such vouchers from letterboxes. She is set to be sentenced later this month. For theft, Zamri could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, or both. CNA has contacted the Attorney-General's Chambers about the status of Farahdillah's case. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...ailed-14137736",2021-08-02 16:20:00,446

His job entails issuing electronic monitoring devices to individuals who will be serving SHN outside of dedicated facilities, and helping them to wear the devices. While on duty, he wears a surgical mask, face shield and gloves. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested on 4 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT \x96 the last being on 22 January \x96 were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.* Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.*",2021-07-02 21:59:00,216

Quote: When a mannequin exposed to the virus was equipped with various masks (cotton mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask), the uptake of the virus droplets/aerosols was reduced. A cotton mask led to an approximately 20% to 40% reduction in virus uptake compared to no mask (Fig. 2B). The N95 mask had the highest protective efficacy (approximately 80% to 90% reduction) of the various masks examined; however, infectious virus penetration was measurable even when the N95 mask was completely fitted to the face with adhesive tape (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission, whereas the N95 mask showed considerable protective efficacy (Fig. 2C). There was a synergistic effect when both the virus receiver and virus spreader wore masks (cotton masks or surgical masks) to prevent the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols (Fig. 2D and E). However, it remains unknown whether the small amount of virus that was able to pass through the N95 masks would result in illness.",2021-08-02 09:45:00,193

Also they wear PAPR, which is yet another layer up. I know for local hospitals, they dont don half masks or full face masks like in overseas......but they jump straight to PAPR.  This is reserved for ICU ward workers tho....... Of coz overseas they also do use PAPRs. But those scenarios are not typically faced in the real world of coz. Why full face mask has a higher PF than half face masks Possibly coz of the double seal for the nose/cheek area?",2021-08-02 10:02:00,160

But both cases we did not even suspect it was chickenpox, until we went to the GP to confirm it was chickenpox.   No fever no nothing.....only a few spots and 1 or 2 on the face near the mouth (so teacher suspected HFMD). In fact for the first case we thought it was HFMD......alerted by the kindergarten teacher.

Full PPE don't mean 100% protection because it relies on form, fit and cooperation from the user wearing it. of course when working with novel viruses such as these, the PPE is still the best form of defense but don't think with full PPE it means 100% protection. there could be leaks, fatigue can set in, ppl get complacent, etc etc.. Yes, can imagine fatigue setting in. Quite taxing on medical workers. Hopefully it would just be a flu for the community cases.

6335,7195,MOH in consultation with expert panel detected 1stcase of likely covid19 reinfection,2021-07-02 23:44:00,"MOH, in consultation with an expert panel, has detected the first case of likely COVID-19 re-infection in Singapore. He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH\x92s surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their post-infection immunity. 7.* * *The case is a 28 year-old male Bangladesh national holding a Work Permit who resides in a dormitory located at 43 Tech Park Crescent. He had been confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 12 April 2020 (Case 2513). He subsequently recovered, and consistently tested negative for COVID-19 infection from June 2020 onwards. On 25 January 2021 however, his test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection, and he was isolated. Numerous repeat tests conducted subsequently were also positive for the virus. 8.* * *He reported that he felt unwell on 22 January and 23 January, but is otherwise asymptomatic. He is currently warded at NCID. All the identified close contacts of the case have been isolated and placed on quarantine. So far, all of them have tested negative for COVID-19. 9.* * *While re-infection is rare, the expert panel, which comprises infectious diseases and microbiology experts from NCID, Singapore General Hospital and the National Public Health Laboratory, has assessed that the clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that this is a likely case of re-infection. In addition to his positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results, there was a corresponding marked increase in antibody titres compared to the period prior to the likely re-infection, suggesting that he was exposed to a new infection which boosted his antibody levels. The virus detected in his samples taken in January 2021 is also genetically distinct from that associated with the dormitories outbreak in 2020, suggesting that this is likely a different and new infection. 10.* * *MOH will continue to closely monitor recovered COVID-19 cases to determine their post-infection immunity. So far, there is no indication that recovered workers in the dormitories have significant loss of post-infection immunity. https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...ion_6_Feb_2021",2021-06-02 23:23:00,297

6393,7263,Culturally tight societies like Singapore fare better in Covid-19 fight: Study,2021-07-02 23:26:00,"Countries with greater social cohesion such as Singapore have performed far better in the Covid-19 pandemic, with only a fifth the number of infections seen in nations with high levels of ""cultural looseness"". The difference in performance is more stark in terms of deaths per million population, as countries with cultural looseness had almost nine times the number of deaths. These comparisons from an article in The Lancet Planetary Health journal, published on Jan 29, are based on data from 57 countries, from the start of the pandemic till Oct 16 last year. The study team of primarily psychologists, with Professor Michele J. Gelfand from the Department of Psychology at the University of Maryland as the lead author, said that till now, it has not been possible to compare performance and results across cultures. Psychologists have long believed that ""tight groups coordinate much faster and have higher survival rates than loose groups"". The article said: ""The Covid-19 pandemic provides a natural context to test whether differences in cultural tightness-looseness are related to collective outcomes during a global threat."" Countries that are culturally tight have populations that generally abide by many social norms, with expectations for how people should act in most situations. Tight cultures tend to face natural disasters, disease prevalence, resource scarcity and invasions. It said: ""Tighter cultures such as China, Singapore, and South Korea have stricter rules and punishments for deviance, whereas looser cultures such as Brazil, Spain, and the US have weaker norms and are much more permissive. ""Tight cultures have a lot of order - that is, less crime and more coordination and self-control; loose cultures have less order and coordination, but have more openness - that is, more tolerance and creativity."" It found that more people in culturally tight societies feared Covid-19 - 70 per cent against 49 per cent in countries with looser cultures. Based on performance and results from the pandemic, it said: ""Tightening social norms might confer an evolutionary advantage in times of collective threat."" Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, found the piece interesting, as it ""formalises what I, and I'm sure others, had thought of as a fundamental explanation of why countries like Singapore could keep the pandemic mostly under control while others like the US could not"". He added the research suggests that in countries with greater looseness, rules may have to be stricter to make up for the lower adherence. But Prof Teo Yik Ying, dean of the school, disagreed with the conclusions drawn by the authors. ""I don't only see it as a matter of cultural looseness or tightness,"" he said. ""It's too easy to say it's mostly cultural, and that Westernised societies are more liberal and democratic, and thus the poorer ability to get the community to act responsibly and for the greater good."" But how would that then account for the high level of success against Covid-19 in places like New Zealand and Australia, he asked. ""Culturally, they would be more similar to Western countries with a more democratic outlook,"" he said, but they have ""performed extremely well in managing the outbreaks"". https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...19-fight-study",2021-07-02 19:57:00,513

It is not too late at this stage for Singapore and we definitely can overcome this as a population. Cheers. In before PAP IBs reply The circumstances did not change. Can easily prove that Singapore public health policy was based on fake news that the PAP Ministers and MOH spread. 1) When evidence has been published, the PAP Ministers and MOH Chief Scientist cannot pretend to be blind and say no evidence was seen. Did MOH Chief Scientist spread fake news when he claimed he saw no evidence of community spread on 27 Feb? Yes or no. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...t-is-over-says Professor Tan Chorh Chuan told The Straits Times: ""Singapore's approach of actively looking for new cases and quarantining close contacts has been effective in ring-fencing clusters of infection so far, and we have not seen evidence of community spread. Here is the definition of community spread from USA CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html What is community spread? Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. As of Feb 27, MOH reported a total of 96 cases. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...-case-12475870 Based on MOH report on 28 February, there were a total of 32 unlinked cases out of 96 confirmed cases = 33% unlinked cases. 33% of confirmed cases were unlinked according to MOH report on 28 Feb, so on what basis did MOH Chief Scientist claim that he did not see any evidence of community spread? https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...ion-confirmed/ Unlinked cases 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10 11,12,14,15,16,17,18 22,23,29 32,35,37 43,45,46 64 76,78 83,85,87,89 92 Linked cases 8,9 13,19 20,21,24,25,26,27,28 30,31,33,34,36,38,39 40,41,42,44,47,48,49 50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59 60,61,62,63,65,66,67,68,69 70,71,72,73,74,75,77,79 80,81,82,84,86,88 90,91,93,94,95,96 2) Science is based on peer review. Did MOH spread fake news when they said no evidence of aerosol transmission on 10 Feb? Yes or no. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...n-moh-12418446 ""Based on evidence available in China, an expert from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said that there is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through aerosol,"" said MOH. On what basis did MOH claim there was no evidence, just by citing only 1 single publication from China? Did MOH suspect that China publication was fake news propaganda? Remember Dr. Li Wenliang already whistleblew how China tried to coverup the Wuhan virus spread in Dec 2019. He was arrested for fake news. He died on Feb 6 2020 due to the virus. https://www.theguardian.com/world/20...om-coronavirus Did MOH review the confirmed case of the Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship [Diamond Princess] and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator? Did MOH not review the possibility that if MERS-CoV can be spread by aerosol transmission, why did they rule out Covid-19 being spread by droplets as well? http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-persp...ction-covid-19 Droplet or aerosol infection spread? Surgical mask or respirator? Asymptomatic transmission or symptomatic only? These are the defining questions surrounding the person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 that have yet to be answered\x97or answered sufficiently\x97for US experts monitoring the disease. And the answers hold the key to infection control policies that will become necessary as the disease continues to infect tens of thousands in China and hundreds more across the globe. Yesterday the media reported that a Japanese doctor who was monitoring cruise ship passengers quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess in the port of Yokohama contracted the virus despite wearing gloves and a surgical mask. He joins the more than 500 healthcare workers in Wuhan, China, who have also reportedly contracted the disease\x97just by the middle of January. These infections put into question how effective infection control policies are at preventing transmission. Masks vs respirators\x97key differences In its newly published infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of N95 respirators in a healthcare setting with the suspected novel coronavirus, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended surgical masks for general patient care and respirators for aerosol-generating procedures only. Face masks have become ubiquitous in China, sold on the street, and worn by almost everyone in public. A new survey, the Premise Coronavirus Awareness Survey, showed that in Taiwan 79.9% of people questioned said they were wearing masks in an effort to protect themselves from COVID-19. A similar percentage was noted in the Philippines. Bruce Ribner, MD, medical director of the Serious Communicable Diseases Unit at Emory University Hospital, said the two masks serve very different functions. A surgical mask, or procedural mask, is meant to protect the environment from the wearer. ""It's meant to keep the surgeon's respiratory issues away from a patient,"" Ribner explained. A surgical mask does a good job of trapping large droplets, and some aerosol transmission, he said. Many of the masks being worn in China, though, are not designed for medical use or to any standards and so their effectiveness in trapping droplets is unknown. A respirator, such as an N95, fits tighter to the face and is meant to help protect the wearer from inhaling infectious droplets in the environment. ""We don't really know how the coronavirus is being transmitted from person to person, because no one has done the NIOSH studies that simulate the cough big droplets that land 3 to 6 feet away from a person or the little droplets that can travel long distances and in air handling system,"" Ribner said. ""So we have to use what we know about other coronaviruses and influenza when it comes to this disease."" What we know, Ribner said, is that multiple modes of transmission are likely at play, including large droplets, small droplets (or aerosols), and contaminated hands. At Emory, Ribner is responsible for the care of patients treated for Ebola, Lassa fever, and other serious pathogen diseases. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which publishes CIDRAP News, says, ""The very unsettling data regarding the number of infected healthcare workers in the Wuhan area and the infection of a Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator\x97should be a real wake-up call to all of us about how do we really protect against this critical occupational risk."" How the virus travels in the air Donald Milton, MD, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, helped prove via the use of his Gesundheit machine that influenza could be spread via aerosol transmission. He said he is in contact with colleagues in Singapore who are attempting to study the transmission of the COVID-19 viruses, which are often called nCoV, for novel coronavirus. Though Chinese officials said earlier this week that they believe the coronavirus is transmitted only via droplets, implying they do not believe airborne or contact transmission plays a role, Milton said that statement is likely rooted in fear, not science. ""To me this sounds like someone trying to deal with panic, because people panic when they hear airborne transmission and long-distance transmission,"" he said. He said there has been scientific evidence of aerosol transmission of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), so it is likely possible for this novel coronavirus, as well. Milton cautions that the difference between aerosol and droplet transmission is largely in name only. Respiratory droplets, emitted with a sneeze or a cough, are commonly thought to land within 6 feet of patients and are too large to be buoyant on air currents. Respiratory aerosols are droplets too, Milton said, but smaller and light enough to travel farther. ""You cannot tell the difference epidemiologically between something aerosol transmitted by weak sources and large droplet spray,"" said Milton. ""They behave so similar, it's very hard to pick up the difference."" He said he suspects the capability of long-distance transmission with COVID-19 will be connected to source strength, or how symptomatic a person is. Protection may depend on resources For Ribner, the issue of correct mask use will linger until the exact route of transmission is documented, and it is established if an asymptomatic person (one having no symptoms) can shed the virus before becoming sick. ""If we have a person who is shedding nCoV in the environment, the best way to stop transmission is to stick a surgical procedure mask on them,"" Ribner said. ""In the best of all worlds, anyone coming into the room with an nCoV patient would wear a respirator."" But if a respirator is not available, because of cost or manufacturing, the next best option is a surgical mask, Ribner said. He said that likely contributes to the WHO's surgical mask recommendation. ""The WHO is sensitive to the fact that not every part of the world has the resources of the US and Western Europe,"" he said. Keeping health workers from becoming patients But Osterholm counters, ""Frankly, the WHO recommendation that surgical masks provide adequate protection for healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients is not consistent with data we have from similar transmission dynamics we see with influenza virus."" In an op-ed today in the Washington Post, Osterholm and coauthor Mark Olshaker stressed, ""In a very real sense, what happens to our health-care workers will be the metric of how we respond to this unfolding crisis. If we don't do all we can to protect them, they will quickly transition from providers to patients, further stressing already overburdened facilities."" They add, ""Governments must support private-sector manufacturers in providing N95s and other equipment to front-line health-care providers and other essential workers. In terms of minimizing illness and death, this will be more important than any border closing, airport screening, or quarantine.""",2020-05-04 11:10:00,1700

They are doing the right thing now, let\x92s not harp on it anymore. It is true that both WHO and CDC has dished out only the sick should wear masks once day one, with the main reason being the conservation of masks for the healthcare workers. What was not right is that our leaders shouldn\x92t have followed those advice when it is clear by early February asymptomatic persons could also be spreading the virus. They could have got this info from the China CDC easily, which they probably did but doubted the integrity of the info, which I do not understand why until today. In such cases, it would have been better to be safe than sorry. Maybe they were complacent and thought they could contain this pandemic easily with or without masks. Nevertheless, it is admirable that they are finally doing the right thing despite loss of face. Let\x92s not harp on it anymore and move on. It is not too late at this stage for Singapore and we definitely can overcome this as a population. Cheers.

HK didn't give free masks. Its only in late February..bcos TW and Korea has massive local manufacturing base..they were able to start replenish mask supply.. last heard Taiwan was 3 masks pax a week..right? Y didn't singspore manufacture mask? Because due to limited land we prioritise on higher value stream manufacturing like semicon..off shore low end to Malaysia.. remember? So can we blame govt for masks shortage when other countries start to ban export? No Can we blame govt for not having local manufacturing..partially yes.. They shd review critical needs and build some local manufacturing capability..but then again we also know raw materials are scarce since other countries like China ban export of raw materials too needed for makss and ventilators Ban China tourists? Its not the tourist dollar..but the diplomatic sensitivity..see how Korea and Japan quarrel bcos one ban the other first?

Quote: WHO Interim guidance 29 January 2020 General Advice Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including 2019-nCoV, in affected areas. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. If masks are to be used, this measure must be combined with hand hygiene and other IPC measures to prevent the human-tohuman transmission of 2019-nCov. sunsetbay wrote: Haha~ I already know they were not telling the truth cos WHO was pretty complacence on the Corona virus as there was mere few cases in Europe & US back then~ Also when LW said they heard from the experts advice, he didn't quote it was from WHO, he also didn't explain who are this ""experts"" were~ then in Feb the four local doctors came out their own health 2M advisory, wear mask & stop mingling~ MOH chief was quick to rebut them, he didn't quote WHO as well~ when CCS audio leak came out, he said he took a gamble to give out 4 masks to make sinkies shiok shiok~ if it was WHO advise, then there wasn't a need to give fake advise~ Worst thing is people like Calvin Cheng and his readers are defending hard for the ministers u-turn advisory~ unbelievable~",2020-08-04 11:50:00,398

In a closed door meeting with SCCI members, PAP Minister Chan Chun Sing said that supply of masks is not enough if everyone rush to buy. The public only knew about this because someone recorded the meeting and leaked it online, which spread viral before finally picked up by MSM and reported as news. 2) MOH Chief Scientist spread fake news that he saw no evidence of community spread on 27 Feb. Why is Singapore public health policy based on fake news? In MOH report on 28 Feb, 32 out of 96 cases were unlinked. That meant 33% of cases were unlinked. On what basis did MOH Chief Scientist claim he saw no evidence of community spread? 3) MOH spread fake news no evidence of aerosol transmission on 10 Feb. Why is Singapore health policy based on fake news? On what basis did MOH claim there was no evidence, just by citing only 1 single publication from China? [Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ] Did MOH suspect that China publication was fake news propaganda? Remember Dr. Li Wenliang already whistleblew how China tried to coverup the Wuhan virus spread in Dec 2019. He was arrested for fake news. He died on Feb 6 2020 due to the virus. Did MOH review the confirmed case of the Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship [Diamond Princess] and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator? Did MOH not review the possibility that if MERS-CoV can be spread by aerosol transmission, why did they rule out Covid-19 being spread by droplets as well? 4) The fact is Singapore public health policy is based on fake news spread by PAP Ministers and MOH Chief Scientist. If PAP Ministers dont step down or harakiri after spreading fake news and implement it for public health policy, then I worry. Bro, no one from the Covid task force stepped down yet wor...means vat huh??",2021-01-21 20:58:00,348

So the 1 Feb visit to Sun Plaza is by ghost? Or was it Case 59935? Time line all match zhun zhun. If that is so does it mean imported case going around community and now there is a risk caused by this Ceca? This is a 35 year-old female Indian national who is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder. She travelled to India from 30 November 2020 and returned to Singapore on 6 January 2021. Her pre-departure test taken in India on 4 January before her flight was negative for COVID-19. Upon her return, she served SHN at a dedicated facility until 20 January. Her swab done on 17 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19. She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 2 February in preparation for another trip to India. Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to KK Women\x92s and Children\x92s Hospital in an ambulance. We have classified this case as locally transmitted while her serology test result is pending. Should her serology test come back positive, and epidemiological investigations assess that this is a past infection, we will reclassify this as an imported case. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including her family members, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.",2021-04-02 23:21:00,265

6963,7889,Chan Chun Sing: confident to turn the pandemic into opportunity for Singapore to Huat big big,2021-07-02 16:26:00,"AS Covid-19 accelerates shifts in global supply chains, Singapore must aim to be at the critical nodes when attracting investments, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing at the EDB Society's 30th anniversary commemoration on Wednesday night. Even amid the pandemic, the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) managed to secure S$13 billion of fixed asset investment commitments in the first four months of 2020, said Mr Chan. The shift in global supply chains was one of three future-shaping factors that he highlighted, alongside inequalities in growth, and threats to global cooperation. First, even before Covid-19, technological change and geopolitical tensions were reshaping supply chains. The progress of development in different economies will also continue to change global production, supply chains and consumption patterns. Singapore must carefully examine the new emerging global value chains to understand where it stands in relation to other countries, said Mr Chan. ""We will need more in-depth analysis on where to position ourselves, especially in emerging sectors ranging from fintech, agri-tech, to others,"" he noted. While land, natural resources, and people still matter, what will matter even more is the ability ""to create trusted environments and systems to attract capital and talent; generate and protect intellectual capital; and provide a safe harbour amid a fragmenting or bifurcating world,"" said Mr Chan. Second, a consequence of these global shifts is the greater dispersion of growth, according to Mr Chan. Economies, companies, and workers that can ride these shifts will pull ahead. After large pandemic-related outlays, many governments now face a narrowed fiscal space, constraining their ability to address domestic inequality. But if segments of the population do not reap benefits from globalisation and trade, resistance to these beneficial forces may grow. ""Governments may also lose the courage or the political space to stand up on the international stage to continue to support globalisation and integration,"" he said. In the face of this trend, Singapore must stay committed to connectivity; deepen regional integration and global interdependence; ensure the fruits of trade are distributed; and help firms and workers adjust. Maintaining trade and financial connectivity amid Covid-19, after all, helped firms and livelihoods survive. He said Singapore will keep developing ""modern forms of connectivity in trade, finance, and the digital domains... so that neither Covid-19 nor the geopolitical tensions may divide us"". Finally, as such pressures threaten global leadership and governance systems, Singapore and like-minded partners must work to preserve them. Beyond the United States and China, the rest of the world must also step up to uphold and update the global trading system, he said. ""Given the severe consequences of a retreat from multilateralism, Singapore cannot afford to be a passive participant. We must work with like-minded partners to stand as an integrative force, deepening country-to-country linkages, and set high-standard global rules with partners to enable businesses to thrive,"" Mr Chan noted. He pointed to two critical tasks that lie ahead - rallying the country to avoid complacency, and tackling wage disparity by equipping workers with skills of the future. ""We should not delude ourselves that we will always stay ahead effortlessly, as if the competition were static,"" he said. In the Covid-19 recovery, Singapore ""will not just play defensive to try to get back to where we were"", but instead come up with new ideas and value propositions. The hybrid event on Wednesday saw nearly 300 participants, both in person at The Capitol Kempinski Hotel and online, with Mr Chan taking part in a closed-door dialogue after his speech. He also presented The Distinguished Fellow of The EDB Society Award to two former EDB chairmen, Teo Ming Kian and Lim Siong Guan. Mr Teo chaired the EDB from 2001 to 2006, spearheading new growth areas such as interactive and digital media - attracting LucasFilm to Singapore during his tenure - as well as environmental and water technologies, alternative energy, and education. Mr Lim, who was chairman from 2006 to 2009, attracted corporations to invest in value-added manufacturing and services, and encouraged the development of urban solutions.",2020-12-31 17:45:00,649

When a person makes antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, either because they\u2019ve been vaccinated or have already caught the virus, the body makes an army of these soldiers. After the invader is driven off, some of these antibodies, and the body\u2019s memory of how to make them, remain so they can quickly be re-created if they are ever needed again. E484K is called an escape mutation because it helps the virus escape this standing army. With this mutation, the virus can slip past our immune defenses and make us sick. ... Another scenario that could drive escape mutations is incomplete protection from a vaccine, which could happen in the interval between the first and second doses. \u201cThe period between the two is a period where you have weak antibodies and can create escape mutants,\u201d says John Moore. The U.K. has given public guidance that it\u2019s OK to wait several months between doses of the vaccine, \u201cand that troubles us because it\u2019s a breeding ground for escaped mutants.\u201d ... Early evidence suggests the E484K change does indeed give the virus a significant leg up. Though cases of reinfection are difficult to prove, a growing number of case reports show that people who have recovered from COVID-19 caused by an earlier version of the virus have been reinfected with new variant versions of the virus that contain the E484K change . ... https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/2021...vid-resurgence",2021-07-02 12:34:00,223

7173,8114,'We are not returning to a pre-COVID-19 world': Chan Chun Sing maps out 'new path',2020-12-08 09:58:00,"Quote: Mr Chan outlined three principles Singapore will hold on to as it attempts to chart a new path ahead. First, the country will open for business, \x93safely and sustainability\x94. ""It will not be a binary option of open or close. It can be done. We must stay open while isolating the impacted clusters quickly and tightly,\x94 said Mr Chan. Second, the Government will help businesses and workers make sense of and adjust to the new world. Firms with opportunities, notwithstanding COVID-19 and perhaps because of COVID-19, will be given a boost so they can grow. \x93Because as you grow, we will create more jobs and opportunities for our workers,\x94 said Mr Chan. Examples of such firms are those in infocommunications technology, biopharma, supply chains and precision engineering. Firms suffering a drop in demand now but will eventually recover will have their core capabilities preserved so they can \x93emerge stronger\x94, said Mr Chan. Overall efforts to help such firms include helping them with their cash flows, from the Jobs Support Scheme to rental relief schemes. Over time, support should be redirected to these companies to help them generate fresh revenue and become more cost-efficient. Finally, the Government will help firms whose industries have permanently changed to reinvent themselves, and pivot into new markets and markets, said Mr Chan. A third principle the Government will go by is support for businesses through establishing the \x93right macro conditions\x94, said Mr Chan. \x93To preserve Singapore\x92s ability to compete for jobs for our people, we will strengthen our links with the world for markets, supplies, technology and talent,\x94 he said, adding that Singapore\x92s aviation and port hub status \x93can never be taken for granted\x94. Singapore will also break new ground for digital free trade agreements to open more markets for its businesses while preserving existing access to conventional markets, said Mr Chan. The minister said that while the future may be uncertain and conditions challenging, the Government\x92s commitment to every Singaporean remains unchanged. \x93We will do our utmost to prepare our people \x85 We will not wait for the COVID-19 situation to blow over. We will start now,\x94 he said. Sorry. The new path is? The old path? Then we hold an election during the pandemic for what?",2020-11-08 11:35:00,365

Announcing the economic data at a morning press conference, he said: \x93We are not returning to a pre-Covid-19 world... We must chart a new direction now.\x94 Fresh figures showed the Singapore economy contracted by 13.2 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the April to June quarter. This was worse than the 12.6 per cent fall the government estimated. It also marks a sharp deterioration from the 0.3 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. Chan said at the press conference: ""The forecast for 2020 essentially means the growth generated over the past two to three years will be negated."" The minister also said the \x93painful truth\x94 is that \x93we are not returning to a pre-Covid-19 world\x94 and that recovery will be some time yet and \x93not likely to be smooth\x94. He had heard that some are still hoping for a quick recovery and a return to the \x93familiarity of the old normal\x94. But this current crisis is unlike the past ones. \x93We can expect recurring waves of infection and disruption,\x94 he said. Chan added that he hoped geopolitical issues will not spill into \x93open conflict"", which will further destabilise the rest of the world. \x93We must avoid being caught between the conflicts of major powers or be stranded in a fragmenting world of trade relations and technological standards,\x94 he also said. In the Covid-19 upheaval, global companies will reorganise how they function. Such moves can bring opportunities, as well as cause disruptions. \x93New investments will come our way... some existing ones may also diversify away from Singapore,"" Chan said. \x93With remote work, more global job opportunities for our workers will come. But it also means that other workers, in other countries, can do our jobs from their homes."" However, Chan also sounded a word of caution about the existing disparities widening. Changes in the economy \x93will cause more societal frictions and tensions\x94, he said, between those who have more and those with less, between foreign and local, and even a Singaporean and a permanent resident. Chan said: \x93We will need to better take care of those affected by job and business losses."" \x93We have and will continue to do these in a sustainable way that is not divisive, affirm the dignity of work and strengthen our social fabric. These tensions, unless well managed, can divide our society.\x94 https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...chan-chun-sing",2020-11-08 14:17:00,382

The geopolitical environment that has allowed Singapore to thrive in the last 50 years has changed. \x93The tensions amongst the major powers are increasing,\x94 he said. Mr Chan said he hoped geopolitical issues will not spill into \x93open conflict, further (destabilising) the rest of the world\x94. \x93We must avoid being caught between the conflicts of major powers or be stranded in a fragmenting world of trade relations and technological standards,\x94 he added. Global companies are also reorganising their production and supply chains, with some reviewing the need for regional hubs and the way they organise their production to serve different markets. \x93New investments will come our way \x85 some existing ones may also diversify away from Singapore ... It is a fluid landscape and we must do everything we can to defend our capabilities and capacities.\x94 said Mr Chan. Mr Chan also pointed out how the nature of jobs has changed. \x93With remote work, more global job opportunities for our workers will come. But it also means that other workers, in other countries, can do our jobs from their homes. \x93You might have noticed that some jobs in the regional headquarters here are being advertised as \x91can work in Singapore\x92 or \x91can work remotely\x92. This will affect many PMET jobs, which can be done virtually or through automation and AI,\x94 he said. Finally, changes in the economy \x93will cause more societal frictions and tensions\x94 \x96 between those who have more and those with less, between foreign and local, and even a Singaporean and a permanent resident, said Mr Chan. \x93We will need to better take care of those affected by job and business losses. \x93We have and will continue to do these in a sustainable way that is not divisive, affirm the dignity of work and strengthen our social fabric. These tensions, unless well managed, can divide our society,\x94 he said. THE WAY FORWARD \x93We do not have all the answers yet and the ground realities are fast evolving, often without precedence, but we know that staying still is not an option,\x94 said Mr Chan, adding that the Government will work together with the people to \x93help them understand the need for changes and to implement them smoothly\x94. In the next few months, the Government will provide \x93regular updates\x94 on the economy and job situation, \x93sector by sector\x94, said Mr Chan. \x93We will involve the unions, trade associations and employers. We will visit companies in various sectors, work with unions and associations, discuss with them the changes and chart the way forward to get us through this crisis,\x94 he added. Mr Chan outlined three principles Singapore will hold on to as it attempts to chart a new path ahead. First, the country will open for business, \x93safely and sustainability\x94. ""It will not be a binary option of open or close. It can be done. We must stay open while isolating the impacted clusters quickly and tightly,\x94 said Mr Chan. Second, the Government will help businesses and workers make sense of and adjust to the new world. Firms with opportunities, notwithstanding COVID-19 and perhaps because of COVID-19, will be given a boost so they can grow. \x93Because as you grow, we will create more jobs and opportunities for our workers,\x94 said Mr Chan. Examples of such firms are those in infocommunications technology, biopharma, supply chains and precision engineering. Firms suffering a drop in demand now but will eventually recover will have their core capabilities preserved so they can \x93emerge stronger\x94, said Mr Chan. Overall efforts to help such firms include helping them with their cash flows, from the Jobs Support Scheme to rental relief schemes.

Finally, the Government will help firms whose industries have permanently changed to reinvent themselves, and pivot into new markets and markets, said Mr Chan. A third principle the Government will go by is support for businesses through establishing the \x93right macro conditions\x94, said Mr Chan. \x93To preserve Singapore\x92s ability to compete for jobs for our people, we will strengthen our links with the world for markets, supplies, technology and talent,\x94 he said, adding that Singapore\x92s aviation and port hub status \x93can never be taken for granted\x94. Singapore will also break new ground for digital free trade agreements to open more markets for its businesses while preserving existing access to conventional markets, said Mr Chan. The minister said that while the future may be uncertain and conditions challenging, the Government\x92s commitment to every Singaporean remains unchanged. \x93We will do our utmost to prepare our people \x85 We will not wait for the COVID-19 situation to blow over. We will start now,\x94 he said.",2020-11-08 15:13:00,829

It\x92s not simply a matter of how many infected cases a country reports. You need to understand where the data comes from and how it is obtained. The capacity limits for COVID testing means that we need to be wary about believing the data and it is not because anyone is intentionally under-reporting. (b) Don\x92t just believe what people tell you. Just because people tell you that if the dorms were better everything would be ok, you don\x92t just believe them. You ask why should it be? Don\x92t just take a face value. Just because someone has a PhD, don\x92t just believe him. Heck, don\x92t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles. (c) Learn to use imagination and do thought experiments. Someone tells you, if you only  listened to me and did this, everything will be good. Well, you just happily imagine that they were right and ask yourself, then what? The problem with this big mouths who talk a lot is that they just shoot off their mouths. They have no accountability to actually do anything. They have no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and not sense of the practical constraints. (d) Have a sense of perspective. We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don\x92t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them.

With the first line of defense down and with only contact tracing in place,  its sheer stupidity to expect no cases of community spread Did they actually thought that all those infected with covid19 would automatically wear masks and practice social distancing?!

And that is just a conservative estimate of the lifespan of the mask. Not to mention reusable masks do not require the same raw materials (that were in mass shortage back then) or production process that disposable masks do.

This is a good example of being exceptional administrators, instead of being exceptional leaders. Singapore is an administrative state, and our govt top brass are all very good administrators or managers. Can keep things running well, and in the same direction. Ideally nothing changes and they just maintain the speed and direction of the ship. Good leadership is not the same as good administration. It takes a crisis to bring out the leadership of the top brass. The MTF was supposed to be the FYP of our 4G ministers and showcase their leadership abilities, which unfortunately was not quite as expected. Especially the responses until the start of the CB - were reactive, some were even outright shocking (CCS and his audio recording). Ministers take turns to announce actions or changes, which to me, seem to give an impression of ""who is leading this group?"". Sometimes a minister from portfolio X will be announcing actions pertaining to another portfolio. So yes, we have a good administrative team, who have access to ample resources (our reserves). But steely and decisive leadership was not something we saw from this 4G team (yet). Not all is bad; some of them like Lawrence Wong have shown some mettle (in fact after this, I feel LW can be a good potential candidate for prime minister), but for the rest like CCS, JT, OYK... they were not impressive.",2020-05-24 17:27:00,338

Singapore is an administrative state, and our govt top brass are all very good administrators or managers. Can keep things running well, and in the same direction. Ideally nothing changes and they just maintain the speed and direction of the ship. Good leadership is not the same as good administration. It takes a crisis to bring out the leadership of the top brass. The MTF was supposed to be the FYP of our 4G ministers and showcase their leadership abilities, which unfortunately was not quite as expected. Especially the responses until the start of the CB - were reactive, some were even outright shocking (CCS and his audio recording). Ministers take turns to announce actions or changes, which to me, seem to give an impression of ""who is leading this group?"". Sometimes a minister from portfolio X will be announcing actions pertaining to another portfolio. So yes, we have a good administrative team, who have access to ample resources (our reserves). But steely and decisive leadership was not something we saw from this 4G team (yet). Not all is bad; some of them like Lawrence Wong have shown some mettle (in fact after this, I feel LW can be a good potential candidate for prime minister), but for the rest like CCS, JT, OYK... they were not impressive. Concur. Being a leader goes beyond bureaucratic ability, is about projecting a certain presence, of calm, of communication, of, well, leadership. Only Lawrence Wong has stepped up to the plate in this regard. If we're truly meritocratic he deserves to be pushed to DPM at the least.

No need to argue until the cow come home. Putting some much disclaimer at the beginning of the article just to protect his ricebowl and at the same time trying to play angel. No need to argue whether Dr Tan is right or wrong. The fact is every country was facing exactly the same crisis and getting the same information and updates since the Covid 19 outbreak was made known on 31 Dec 2020 but other countirs can handle better than our MTF. On the shortage of masks, Singapore is not the only country facing this problem, the rest if not all are also not having enough mask for their people. just take example of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Taiwan's and Hong Kong's Government did not discourage their people to wear mask even there wasn't enough to go along. They (the Authorities and the people) started to improvise - homemade mask after many could not get the mask. Many videos on youtube showing long long long queue in Hong Kong but they soldiered on. As it is better to at least having a mask than no mask be it not as effective as a surgical mask. THIS IS THE POINT WHERE WE FAILED MISERABLY. Our MTF have given many wrong messages to the public. 1. No need to wear mask if you are not sick. They should not have said this. They should in fact just leave it to the public to make their own judgement. Also because of this message, those who worn mask at that time were discriminated.  I remember reading an article about a pre-school kid being penalised for wearing mask to kindergarten and the parent was called to bring him home if he insisted to wear the mask. 2. Covid 19 (Wuhan Virus at that time) Not as deadly As SARs 3. Encourage people to go stayacation and visit places of interest in Singapore. Allow Chingay Parade and Airshow to go on.

Instead of assembling a team of medical professionals better equipped to understand how a novel pathogen could infect and inflict harms on the people and community, the task force incepted all key 4G political leaders as members and the Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Kiat as the advisor. So right from the start, the objective appears to be using the task force as a political platform for the 4G leaders to win the trust of Singaporeans by repeating the success of the 2003 SARs outbreak when Singapore emerged relatively unscathed. The ruling party eagerly wanted to show that its new generation of leaders were just as capable in dealing with the challenges of managing the crisis while keeping the economy afloat.

The Seed of the Mishandling Sowed Right from the Start The seed of \x91missteps\x92 has been sowed right from the beginning when the Ministerial Task Force (MTF) was formed. Instead of assembling a team of medical professionals better equipped to understand how a novel pathogen could infect and inflict harms on the people and community, the task force incepted all key 4G political leaders as members and the Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Kiat as the advisor. So right from the start, the objective appears to be using the task force as a political platform for the 4G leaders to win the trust of Singaporeans by repeating the success of the 2003 SARs outbreak when Singapore emerged relatively unscathed. The ruling party eagerly wanted to show that its new generation of leaders were just as capable in dealing with the challenges of managing the crisis while keeping the economy afloat.

Only 20 of the infections have resulted in deaths. About 90 per cent of Singapore\x92s cases are linked to crowded foreign workers\x92 dormitories that were a blind spot in the government\x92s crisis management. Arif\x92s dorm complex, which has 14,000 beds, accounts for 11 per cent of total infections, with over 2,500 cases. This massive second wave of infections caught Singapore off guard and exposed the danger of overlooking marginalized groups during a health crisis. Despite warnings from human rights activists as early as February about the dorms\x92 crowded and often unsanitary living conditions, no action was taken until cases spread rampantly last month. Singapore\x92s costly oversight was also an important lesson to other countries in the region with large migrant populations. Neighboring Malaysia recently announced mandatory coronavirus testing for its more than 2 million foreign workers after dozens were diagnosed with COVID\x9719. The slip-up highlighted Singapore\x92s treatment of its large population of low-wage foreign workers, who play an integral part in the economy but live on the fringes in conditions where social distancing is impossible. The misjudgment was also an embarrassment for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\x92s government ahead of a general election anticipated in the next few months that is expected to be the last for Lee, who has led Singapore since 2004 and is planning to retire soon. Singapore\x92s nanny state government, which won global praise for its meticulous contact tracing and testing in the early stages of the crisis, quickly moved to contain the problem by treating the flare-up in the dorms as a separate outbreak from that in the local community, a policy that some say is discriminatory.",2020-11-05 16:57:00,309

The four of them are a radiographer, two nurses and a healthcare volunteer. You know what they say, right? First time\u2019s a fluke, the second time might still be a fluke but four times? Something seems to be wrong. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that they are now reviewing the infections happening at the Singapore Expo. The key, he said, is to see if they were infected through interaction with the patients, or with fellow colleagues. Only by knowing this, he says, will allow them to see if infection control processes within the healthcare system are enough and whether they should put additional measures in place.

What does \u2018recovered from coronavirus\u2019 mean? 4 questions answered about how some survive and what happens next The coronavirus is certainly scary, but despite the constant reporting on total cases and a climbing death toll, the reality is that the vast majority of people who come down with COVID-19 survive it. Just as the number of cases grows, so does another number: those who have recovered. In mid-March, the number of patients in the U.S. who had officially recovered from the virus was close to zero. That number is now in the tens of thousands and is climbing every day. But recovering from COVID-19 is more complicated than simply feeling better. Recovery involves biology, epidemiology and a little bit of bureaucracy too. https://theconversation.com/what-doe...ns-next-134883",2020-09-05 15:00:00,140

The more positive patients in one environment (no matter how mild/assymptomatic), the higher the concentration of the virus.

Singapore followed those countries terrible quarantine system. SG actually did it right initially with the NTUC D'resort. Why do you think till now, there're no cases of infected healthcare workers and volunteers from NTUC D'resort? All the patients are in proper room by room. Lesser contact with the patients who no longer needs clinical care. Food can be placed outside their door. If sick, the doctor meet one by one instead of camping together with other positive patients in same environment separated by only partitions like the medical room in that mothership video of expo. Healthcare workers and volunteers are so much safer in the hotel. Japan also using hotels to place mild and recovering patients to lighten the hospital bed loads. None of their healthcare workers & staffs who were deployed to those hotels got infected with that strategy. All their healthcare workers who got infected were from hospitals and quarantine facilities where they house many in one place. They couldn't afford to risk their very limited healthcare workers and volunteers, so they keep using more & more hotels. Not only safer for patients (prevent other strains infecting patients), but also safer for healthcare workers, staffs and volunteers. I remembered WHO also recommended using of hotels to quarantine mild and assymptomatic positive patients. Many countries are also following that approach to use hotels. Over 210,000 hotel rooms secured for recovering & mild patients in JP: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/20.../#.XrbSmm5uKUk ^ Even with this, some assymptomatic/mild positive Japanese are complaining they don't want to be quarantined in hotel if they're positive. They rather want to be quarantine at home until they've fully cleared of the virus. I was like... -_- They should come see SG community facilities like Expo, Changi and TP. I want to see their reaction. FW will never complain being in Expo/Changi/TP because those community facilities are many times better than being sick in others or their own countries. The living conditions in those facilities are even alot times better than their dorms. To them, they're very grateful already. It's also fine for them because they're young and their body immunity are in general better than us Singaporeans because they were upbrought in environment exposed to many things, so they naturally have stronger bodies. I cannot say the same for Singaporeans. Some Singaporeans I saw in FB are praising the expo out of sense of patriotism and only because they thought they will never ever get infected with the virus. But here's the hard truth. Those same Singaporeans who praised expo... if they themselves get infected, I'm sure... most if not all will never want to be quarantine in those community facilities. Do people think they will never ever get it? The virus is also more infectious than your common flu. See that other thread, that NTU guy stayed at home during whole CB period also get infected. FWs are happier in expo because it's an upgrade to stay in those community facilities compared to the dorms. Singaporeans will 100% be depressed and feel like in jail if end up in those places because we're used to the comfort of our own homes. Those praising the expo also don't give a thought on those frontlines healthcare workers, volunteers and NSmen who may end up deployed those community facilities. It's really very risky for them to be there.. there're countless of evidences globally with similar concept. Then, now we start to have healthcare workers infected in expo locally. I don't know but I feel like SG trying to hint those positive cases may not get infected from the expo environment in order to maintain image? Sometimes it's not good to 100% rely on ""local evidences"". They must also study global evidences. This is a new virus, it's always better to learn from each other. Don't take chances. SG took chances with masks, delay in closures, a step too late with the FWs dorms and we end up in our current situation now. The consequence for being late is really that much.. I really hope they change their approach with the quarantine facilities in months to come.. Start planning now before the deadlier strains comes in... (Please hope not. I doubt SG can survive those strains.) Those community facilities where they pack many in one place are really not good.. It must be either hotel quarantine (if many people in same home) or home quarantine for mild, recovering and assymptomatic confirmed cases. I saw few said in the past maybe we don't have enough hotels. We have more than enough hotels... They even used Siloso Beach resort for healthy FWs.. (which covid-19 patients need it more than healthy ones). SG is technically doing semi-home quarantine for undetected cases through CB already. Those who doesn't need clinical care anymore but still positive, home or hotel quarantine is better, safer for both patients and healthcare workers than those community facilities.",2020-10-05 01:41:00,931

None of their healthcare workers & staffs who were deployed to those hotels got infected with that strategy. All their healthcare workers who got infected were from hospitals and quarantine facilities where they house many in one place. They couldn't afford to risk their very limited healthcare workers and volunteers, so they keep using more & more hotels. Not only safer for patients (prevent other strains infecting patients), but also safer for healthcare workers, staffs and volunteers. I remembered WHO also recommended using of hotels to quarantine mild and assymptomatic positive patients. Many countries are also following that approach to use hotels. Over 210,000 hotel rooms secured for recovering & mild patients in JP: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/20.../#.XrbSmm5uKUk ^ Even with this, some assymptomatic/mild positive Japanese are complaining they don't want to be quarantined in hotel if they're positive. They rather want to be quarantine at home until they've fully cleared of the virus. I was like... -_- They should come see SG community facilities like Expo, Changi and TP. I want to see their reaction. FW will never complain being in Expo/Changi/TP because those community facilities are many times better than being sick in others or their own countries. The living conditions in those facilities are even alot times better than their dorms. To them, they're very grateful already. It's also fine for them because they're young and their body immunity are in general better than us Singaporeans because they were upbrought in environment exposed to many things, so they naturally have stronger bodies. I cannot say the same for Singaporeans. Some Singaporeans I saw in FB are praising the expo out of sense of patriotism and only because they thought they will never ever get infected with the virus. But here's the hard truth. Those same Singaporeans who praised expo... if they themselves get infected, I'm sure... most if not all will never want to be quarantine in those community facilities. Do people think they will never ever get it? The virus is also more infectious than your common flu. See that other thread, that NTU guy stayed at home during whole CB period also get infected. FWs are happier in expo because it's an upgrade to stay in those community facilities compared to the dorms. Singaporeans will 100% be depressed and feel like in jail if end up in those places because we're used to the comfort of our own homes. Those praising the expo also don't give a thought on those frontlines healthcare workers, volunteers and NSmen who may end up deployed those community facilities. It's really very risky for them to be there.. there're countless of evidences globally with similar concept. Then, now we start to have healthcare workers infected in expo locally. I don't know but I feel like SG trying to hint those positive cases may not get infected from the expo environment in order to maintain image? Sometimes it's not good to 100% rely on ""local evidences"". They must also study global evidences. This is a new virus, it's always better to learn from each other. Don't take chances. SG took chances with masks, delay in closures, a step too late with the FWs dorms and we end up in our current situation now. The consequence for being late is really that much.. I really hope they change their approach with the quarantine facilities in months to come.. Start planning now before the deadlier strains comes in... (Please hope not. I doubt SG can survive those strains.) Those community facilities where they pack many in one place are really not good.. It must be either hotel quarantine (if many people in same home) or home quarantine for mild, recovering and assymptomatic confirmed cases. I saw few said in the past maybe we don't have enough hotels. We have more than enough hotels... They even used Siloso Beach resort for healthy FWs.. (which covid-19 patients need it more than healthy ones). SG is technically doing semi-home quarantine for undetected cases through CB already. Those who doesn't need clinical care anymore but still positive, home or hotel quarantine is better, safer for both patients and healthcare workers than those community facilities. like to ownself masturbate to make ownself feel shiok shiok so that it's kkj can be long long & stiff stiff.
