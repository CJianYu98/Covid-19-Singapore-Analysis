About 4.7 million residents have the TraceTogether app or have collected the TraceTogether tokens, and this has allowed the authorities to shave days off the contact tracing process, said Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative Vivian Balakrishnan in Parliament on Friday (Feb 26). With both the TraceTogether and SafeEntry programmes, the authorities now take 1\xbd days or less to identify and quarantine close contacts of Covid-19 patients, down from the previous average of four days, said Dr Balakrishnan. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ther-programme",2021-02-26 22:23:00,108

Second, the Bluetooth data collected is stored locally in the user\x92s App/Token in an encrypted form. The data is not accessible unless uploaded. Any data shared with the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be used for contact tracing persons possibly exposed to COVID-19. Only authorised public officers will be able to use the data. Third, user personal information, including their unique identification number and mobile number, is not revealed to other TraceTogether users. They are substituted by a random permanent ID. This information is stored in a secured server. As an added layer of protection, TraceTogether also creates temporary IDs that change regularly. Only these temporary IDs are exchanged between phones. These measures protect users from malicious actors who may seek to eavesdrop and track interactions over time. Lastly, once contact tracing ceases, we will prompt users to disable TraceTogether's functionality. Your privacy is important to us.

So if my next few paragraphs becomes something unreasonable or too biased for you to reply, please don't. What is the point of tracking? Let's say 100% compliance for TT.  Just for argument sake.  Everyone has a TT.  Now.  Today, let's say I am diagnosed with covid-19.  I surrender my token.  In it, there is data on 1000 people I have met in the last 14 days.  What happens then? The 1000 people get informed to watch for symptoms, correct?  Let's say 1 has symptoms.  He reports it. In his token, there is 1000 other people he met over the past 14 days.  So, now another 1000 people are informed.  And let's say 1 in the 1000 develops symptoms etc....Very soon, you have to mass quarantine or lockdown.  The reason why it hasn't happened yet is either because the virus is not spreading among the community, there is asymptomatic spread OR there are symptomatic people who are not seeking medical help.  All these cannot be solved with a TT. Of cos I leave out the obvious that maybe very few are actually using the TT.  But I am arguing on 100% take up rate cos that is the goal (I know its 70% but it's definitely hoped for 100%). A TT might be more useful in a lockdown where contact with people is very minimal or on places where human population density is low.  Otherwise, if the TT works as planned and it catches a spread, you are headed to a lockdown.  Imagine the foreign dormitories now with its routine check on a national scale.  Once you catch one, you quarantine some. So imagine randomly a company shuts, a school shuts etc.  All at random. So in short, without a lockdown and our human density and the fact that TT does not show a person infectious level in real time, it has no benefit in preventing the spread of infection but could potentially lead to another lockdown. that is what they wanna do. Alert people if kana. If situation blows up, then bobian lockdown",2020-10-26 19:59:00,355

Isn't that also collecting location data via bluetooth means? You can tell me that is not doable? Our government comments on the TT initiative. Quote: The TraceTogether App does not collect or use physical location data (e.g. GPS, WiFi fingerprinting, cell ID). It only records proximity via Bluetooth. So if they have a bluetooth device installed at entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth? Proximity to entrance so they can track your location. To pinpoint a person's location you just need 3 fixed bluetooth transponders to triangulate your exact location. Then you have it, how to get a person's location based on proximity data. Can be done anot? A university professor also mentioned the same thing: Quote: Dr Michael Veale, a digital rights expert at University College London, warns of the potential for mission creep. He gives an example in which a government struggling against Covid-19 might want to enforce quarantine control. It could do so, he says, by fitting Bluetooth sensors to public spaces to identify dongle users who are out and about when they should be self-isolating at home.

Very simple, the TT scheme and now with this TT token is to streamline the contact tracing process to make it more efficient.

But as the old saying goes, it's better then nothing. For the token, the flaws are pretty layman knowledge and comes as no surprise. But the idea that Government can use it to track people's movement for no reason whatsoever is all conspiracy theories that have no credibility whatsoever. The idea of privacy is moot too. If government really want to track your movements for whatever reason they don't need this TT to do it. Nowadays cameras are everywhere, from HDB lift landings to MRT stations and lamp posts etc. If they want they can start tracking you the moment you step out of your house. The main point is that this TT token requires the public to corporate with goodwill. Anyone that seeks to undermine the functionality of the TT token could be deemed malicious and should be prosecuted. Anyway once it's made mandatory to be used in public spaces let's see how many people will really put the tokens in faraday pouches or whatever mods ""discussed"" here.

It's in the breakdown. As for the transmitter I've already stated my case earlier on Quote: Welp if you insist, I manage to dig up this datasheet by looking at a teardown and the chip label https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/bluenrg-2.pdf it has a max transmit power of 8dBm. I must admit that I'm not an expert on this particular chipset and I've not scrutinized the entire datahsheet yet. I'm also by no means an electrical engineer, but I can guarantee that the jammer mentioned in the medium article works especially since not every TT device has an output power of 20dBm. I doubt that TX power of these tokens go anywhere near 8dBm since all they need is a proximity of 10m. They're more likely to have a transmit power of 0dBm or less.

Exactly, as I pointed out and rightly so. the current tracking system has it's limitations. That's where TT comes in. Just because police able to track 1-2 person or 100 person a day. Doesnt mean they have the capabilities to track 1 million at a go. So that's why I dont get the oh SPF can track us anyway ior our smartphone/laptop is already being tracked so we should let the government use TT to track us instead argument. I use those same arguments they offer back at them, since they claim government/companies already can track us, then use current solutions, no need TT then. Oh suddenly, the current solutions got limitations. Exactly lo, now you know why they need a more invasive programme to track us. And when I mean track us is not tha I'm claiming they track us for some dubious reason right off the bat. But let's be very honest here, nobody can promise we wont get there eventually. We have to look at the entire situation from a holistic point of view, it is not 1 person or 10 person's privacy being trodden. But an entire nation of 3 million+++ people. MikeDirnt78 wrote: SPF is quite efficient in solving most of the crimes. They certainly don't need the help of a token. Does that put your claim to rest? TLDR: All the simplistic argument about they already can track us through our laptop smartphone so TT is nothing. Simple answer. Then can explain why they dont use those to track? Like that wont need TT what. I guarantee plus chop nobody can give a satisfactory answer that explain if the government already has all that data at their fingertips, why do they even need to implement TT.

Although you argue that SPF can already scrutinise CCTV footage and telephone lines, these are things which have a proper system in place to deter misuse. In fact, the SPF has to issue a warrant to obtain CCTV data on private premises. The resolution provided by cell phone towers isn't high either as cell phone towers need not be too close to a mobile phone user and a mobile phone is only connected to one cell tower at any point in time. That makes triangulation of the phone's exact location much harder through dead reckoning. There's still some degree of obfuscation here.

I don't think any of the above mentioned can give you the accuracy BLE can give. There's a reason why indoor positioning is possible with BLE.

CCTV will be extremely painful to piece together as you'll have to obtain footage from different vendors (e.g. transitioning from condos to malls to public transport), contrary to many speculations, they're not actually connected. Safe entry and ezlink only provide temporary tracking as it leaves a timestamp on where you last tapped in, there is no periodic/ constant tracking here. Credit card and data at bank is an entirely different thing, they do not track location or are not supposed to, unless you're talking about ATMs in which case it is about as good as ezlink cards/ safeentry in offering location tracking. Another myth-busting fact is that cell towers can't track you with that degree of accuracy as well, especially since you do not have to be that close to a cell tower and any form of interference (from buildings or people walking) would cause significant changes to the signal strength. You also won't be connected to 2 let alone 3 cell towers concurrently or switch between them rapidly. Triangulation would be extremely painful. There's a reason why BLE was picked instead of using cell towers or CCTVs to track, BLE does have a higher degree of accuracy in location tracking. BLE can connect and disconnect with nearby devices in a matter of milliseconds while cell towers or WiFi are still negotiating handshakes. The lifetime of a BLE device is very very short, it does not remain connected to another device for long as all it needs is to send a ~30 bytes packet. Combine this with existing tech like CCTVs/ safe entry/ EZlink taps and many more, we get sensor fusion. They can technically narrow down the probability of your exact location and time. FYI: BLE is the primary protocol used for both the TT app and token. This is not a matter of arguing that TT was preferred instead of using cell tower tracking because not many people have phones.

Better protect those around us Protect our loved ones Being notified earlier also means we can better protect those around us, reducing the spread of COVID-19. Ease frontliners' load Protect our community Ease the load on our frontliners, and support one another to live life normally and safely. Together, we can overcome COVID-19. *HIGHLIGHTED IN BOLD IN CASE YOU HAVE ANOTHER BOUT OF SELECTIVE  AMNESIA Looks like you shot yourself in the foot. Selfpawn. btw I didnt say we shouldnt trace at all. I'm just saying we should not have compulsory invasive tracking in the name of easier contact tracing. Please dont misquote me again and again, I already lost count of how many times you misquoted me and demanded I reply to your misquote.",2020-03-11 14:41:00,190

Mate, if you just glance through the website, what is the takeaway from it? Basically the TTs ability to protect us is streneous at best. But that is what the government is posting big big on the website. the protect they use is the very same protect that are using. it is clear as day, so stop claiming otherwise. so first the argument is that im claiming that TT protect us and nobody else is saying so, and when i post ss from TT website, suddenly its different kind of protect. knn so am i the only one claiming Tt is supposed to protect us anot. dun come bs here lei. even your argument is that tt protects us a lil as it contains the spread. Faster and efficient tracing only translate to minimal improvement in containment. based on moh track record, they are only able to track cases on avg weeks after onset of symptoms. there is no protection for anyone between getting the virus and before moh tracks them with tt, neither does it stop the infected from spreading during this duration. so lemme ask u what protection they talking about. and never mind hor, still say we should allow gov to intrude into everyones privacy for this sort of minimal protection. unbelievable.",2020-04-11 09:17:00,330

And if somebody wants to track your location, why don't they use handphone towers? Isn't that better than TT data that supposedly expires after a few weeks. A lot of people, if not all adults, are already aware that phones can be tracked. If even movie criminals know they need to turn off phone, remove battery or don't carry phone, obviously real criminals would know as much if not better. With TT, since they need to have it to enter buildings and other places, it offers another possible channel of tracking. So the persons would either need to have a shielded box to keep their TT when needed, or conduct their activity in isolated location. In which case other methods of tracking becomes more effective. Also of importance is the proximity information, reasonable case can be established that two persons were in close contact, i.e. X cannot say he was simply passing by Y if TT information showed they were within 1m proximity for more than a minute.

From this group of people who is in close proximity with the infected person, they will also try to identify the original carrier. That small battery power from this cheap device will not have sufficient power to continuously transmit data of your ID and locations for 6 months, who will want 3.4 millions of such data every hour, when it is much easier to track a target person via their phone? Yup that's the primary function of this device. For it to be able to work it must be sufficiently low powered to give a better resolution of the amount of close contacts with the infected person.

Already pointed out the potential for misuse from day 1 and till today you still cant concile with this fact even when government admitted they are doing so? And the underlying concern that has still not been addressed by you or anyone here is how effective is the TT programme, taking into consideration that an infected person is usually only detected 7-14 days after infection, by then, it would have spread, so how effective is contact tracing actually in curbing the spread? Nobody has come out with any figures showing it's effectiveness, community cases still continue to appear even with 78% of Singaporeans onboard. Really brings the purpose of TT into question doesnt it? Especially in light of how the government mismanages the data, quietly providing it to SPF for investigations(contrary to what they promised) and which was only informed to Singaporeans only when someone asked in parliament. And your dont use smart phone argument is moot. The smartphone and appmakers have access to the data, but the government cant access it one. They have to request for access and the companies can choose not to give to protect your data. Did MOH even make a sound when they hand your data to SPF? Why dont you try to think further for once.

Suspect panicked and quickly moved corpse into bushes before leaving scene of crime, unaware that he had picked up blood on his shoes and pants. But thanks to TT, we were able to positively identify the last and only close contact the victim had within the last 30 minutes of her life""",2021-07-02 11:56:00,124
