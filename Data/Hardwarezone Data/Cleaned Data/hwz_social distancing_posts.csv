"[GVGT] Lawrence Wong on how the ""maximum of 8 visitors"" rule will be enforced",14/2/21 17:58,"Lawrence Wong: New rule on 8 visitors a day hard to enforce, EOs will do random spot checks No more than eight. The new restrictions before Chinese New Year will include a cap of eight distinct visitors per household per day. This is different from the current restriction of eight visitors at one time. But enforcing the rule might be a tad difficult, considering these are houses and not public places. Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) co-chair Lawrence Wong acknowledged that enforcement for this new rule is ""not going to be so easy"". He listed a few possible ways that the enforcement might occur if the rules are not adhered to. Enforcement Officers will do random spot checks, and neighbours might also tell on rule-breakers. In response to a media question, Wong said that random spot checks had been done before, and it wasn't new. However he reiterated that it would not be easy, and called on everyone to cooperate and do their part. Wong also strongly advised those going out to visit to keep it to no more than two other households per day, particularly during the Chinese New Year period.

The new restrictions before Chinese New Year will include a cap of eight distinct visitors per household per day. This is different from the current restriction of eight visitors at one time. But enforcing the rule might be a tad difficult, considering these are houses and not public places. Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) co-chair Lawrence Wong acknowledged that enforcement for this new rule is ""not going to be so easy"". He listed a few possible ways that the enforcement might occur if the rules are not adhered to. Enforcement Officers will do random spot checks, and neighbours might also tell on rule-breakers. In response to a media question, Wong said that random spot checks had been done before, and it wasn't new. However he reiterated that it would not be easy, and called on everyone to cooperate and do their part. Wong also strongly advised those going out to visit to keep it to no more than two other households per day, particularly during the Chinese New Year period.

That will be more efficient way to enforce the ""max 8 visitors"" and ""2 household"" rules. After CNY, don't have to make it compulsory anymore. Example, random spot check on people outside whether they bring their TT or install their app or not. If they were caught not bringing nor installed the app, give reasonable fine.

The new restrictions before Chinese New Year will include a cap of eight distinct visitors per household per day. This is different from the current restriction of eight visitors at one time. But enforcing the rule might be a tad difficult, considering these are houses and not public places. Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) co-chair Lawrence Wong acknowledged that enforcement for this new rule is ""not going to be so easy"". He listed a few possible ways that the enforcement might occur if the rules are not adhered to. Enforcement Officers will do random spot checks, and neighbours might also tell on rule-breakers. In response to a media question, Wong said that random spot checks had been done before, and it wasn't new. However he reiterated that it would not be easy, and called on everyone to cooperate and do their part. Wong also strongly advised those going out to visit to keep it to no more than two other households per day, particularly during the Chinese New Year period.

"Banana Leaf Apolo to be charged with breaching Covid-19 measures, 11 more F&B outlets penalised",12/2/21 16:53,"This came as the authorities stepped up inspections at food and beverage premises, malls and other public spaces over the past week to ensure compliance with safe management measures during the Chinese New Year period. The ministry said 102 individuals and 12 F&B premises were penalised for breaches during the week. Among these, six F&B outlets have been ordered to close, while five outlets and 29 people were fined for breaching safe management measures, said the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) in a press release on Wednesday (Feb 10). A total of 73 individuals were also issued fines for breaching Covid-19 regulations at parks and beaches. As a result of the ramped-up enforcement, crowd size in Chinatown has also shrunk by about 20 per cent compared with the week before, as the enhanced crowd control measures started last Friday, added the ministry. The F&B outlets ordered to close included Ah Yat Seafood Restaurant at 200 Turf Club Road, which allowed a company dinner gathering of 65 people in its restaurant on Feb 6. The guests were seated across nine tables. East Treasure Chinese Restaurant in River Valley Road accepted a group of 16 diners on Jan 29, who were seated across two tables. Investigations revealed that the gathering was a dinner organised by a company for its employees. Both the company and 16 diners will be fined $1,000 and $300 each, respectively. Crystal Jade Jiang Nan at VivoCity accepted a booking for 16 diners from different households and seated them across two tables on Feb 6. Investigations are ongoing. These three restaurants will be closed for 10 days from Wednesday till Feb 19. Ding Garden in New Bridge Road which allowed 13 diners from different households who sat across three tables on Feb 5 has been ordered to close from Feb 6 to 15. The 13 diners, who arrived together, were fined $300 each for gathering in a group larger than eight. Wangzi Music Restaurant in New Bridge Road allowed diners to consume alcohol at 2.30am on Feb 6. It has been ordered to close for 20 days from Feb 6 to 25. Zam Zam in North Bridge Road seated different groups of diners less than 1m apart on Feb 5. The outlet had committed two previous offences in May and December last year and was fined $1,000 and $2,000 respectively. For its February breach, the restaurant has to close from Feb 9 to 18. Four other F&B outlets were fined $1,000 each , and one outlet was fined $2,000 for repeat offences of seating groups of diners less than 1m apart. They are: Chuan Garden at 1 Pagoda Street; Eating House at Upper Cross Street and Jalan Membina; Kim's Family Food Korea Restaurant at Telok Ayer Street; and Sichuan Restaurant at 72 Pagoda Street. Multiple table bookings at F&B outlets for groups larger than eight are strictly prohibited, unless the diners are from the same household. Intermingling across different tables is not allowed. In addition, a total of 73 people were fined $300 each for flouting safe management measures on Feb 6 and 7 in parks and beaches. These breaches included gathering in groups of more than eight people and intermingling between groups. In Changi Beach Park alone, 39 individuals were fined, including 17 who were caught gathering in one group.",10/2/21,511,Social Distancing,564,4,-11.84915252,87,14,0,-0.21790615,0,0,1

Don't forget some household by itself already have many people, add on 8 visitors it then become a big group to the many silly no brainer out there even if they within limit. Thus think that's one problem with it. For lack of better reference, if vaguely remembered, the issue with it could be just like initially the CB safe distancing thingy. Where think if not wrong people are allowed to go out in small group within the family to exercise and such. But then the implementation (and many silly ones out there) fail to see that many such small groups together in parks and such doing so call exercising, even if got safe distancing, also become a large group gathering to the many none the wiser and no brainer third parties.

Forum: Spread out amenities along beachfront to avoid crowding,11/2/21 22:53,"Time and again, Singaporeans read in the news that East Coast Park (ECP) and Changi beaches are overcrowded. I have made my own observation and, interestingly, discovered that the crowds are not well spread out across the few kilometres along the seafront. Most of the crowds tend to gather around the vicinity of the toilets or under a few trees that provide shade. Therefore, to spread out the crowds, the authorities should build more toilet facilities at regular intervals. More shady trees should be planted along the entire stretch of beach, instead of clustering them together. In addition, some snack and drink kiosks, together with kiosks that rent out deck chairs and beach umbrellas, should be provided along the whole stretch of beach, to spread out the crowd and for the convenience of beachgoers. At present, along the beach at ECP, there are a few restaurants in Parkland Green and Marine Cove. There is only one food centre, East Coast Lagoon Food Village, and it is very crowded throughout the day. In order to spread out the crowd, one more food centre should be built in the vicinity of the former Big Splash. The beachfront is one of the most popular playgrounds for families, as it is a cheap and convenient place to cycle and to keep fit. When residents are healthy, it is good for the economy and the country as a whole. Hence, money spent on rejuvenating the beach parks is well worth it. People should be encouraged to go to the beach for more fresh air. Harry Ong Heng Poh",11/2/21,263,Social Distancing,263,4,-11.03271423,40,9,1,0.124359745,0,1,1

Visitors per household capped at 8 per day from Jan 26; CNY visits limited to 2 other households,11/2/21 13:31,"SINGAPORE - From next Tuesday (Jan 26), each household will only be allowed to receive up to eight unique visitors a day, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday. Individuals should also limit themselves to visiting at most two other households a day, as far as possible. During the Chinese New Year period, people should visit family members only, he added. The tightened measures come on the back of rising community cases after the year-end festivities. ""With more interactions, with more human activities, there is an increased chance of transmission of any infectious disease,"" said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministerial task force tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Compared to a month ago, our vulnerability has increased, and the situation can escalate very quickly, especially with the likelihood of more interactions taking place over the Chinese New Year period."" Although people will still be allowed to gather outside in groups of up to eight, he stressed that Singaporeans should keep their social circles small. Mr Wong also reminded diners that face masks must be worn when not eating or drinking, adding that voices should not be raised at any time. This means that masks must be worn while tossing the traditional yusheng, with no recitation of the usual auspicious phrases that are said at the time. Enforcement checks will be stepped up during this period, with strict action taken against individuals and business operators that breach safe management measures, he said. He noted that the virus is still raging around the world. Places that have been successful in controlling the infection up until now - such as Taiwan and Hong Kong - are also imposing restrictions on Chinese New Year celebrations, he said. Mr Wong also recounted how Singapore saw a spike in Covid-19 cases after Chinese New Year last year, with multiple clusters linked to such gatherings. That is why the task force is making a pre-emptive move to tighten measures to avoid a repeat of what happened last year, he said. ""Let us be mentally prepared that Chinese New Year this year will not be the same as before,"" he added. ""It will be quieter, it will be more subdued, and we will have to be more disciplined in how we go about our daily activities and interactions."" He stressed that the underlying principle behind the measures is for people to reduce exposure to one another. A surveillance testing exercise will also be carried out for stallholders, shop owners, restaurant workers, as well as food delivery workers operating in and around Chinatown, said the ministry. The two-day exercise will start on Feb 8, with the authorities planning to progressively contact identified groups with further details. ""While there has been no evidence that these community groups are at higher risk of infection, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be offering tests to them as they are expected to interact more frequently with other members of the public during this time,"" MOH said in a statement. The Government will fully bear the costs of these tests, it added. ""We strongly encourage all individuals in the identified community groups to come forward for testing.""",22/1/21,512,Social Distancing,522,4,-10.90890743,100,16,4,-0.173684708,0,1,1

"Important to show appreciation to family over Chinese New Year, but COVID-19 restrictions necessary:",11/2/21 7:11,"Quote: SINGAPORE: Showing appreciation to family members this Chinese New Year is ""perhaps more important than ever"" amid COVID-19, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday (Feb 11). ""Chinese New Year is a time for reunions and celebration. Tonight, across Singapore, families will enjoy dinners with their loved ones. Over the next few days, we will visit parents and relatives in smaller groups to exchange New Year wishes for good health and prosperity, and to welcome new arrivals to the family,"" said Mr Lee in his Chinese New Year message. ""The warmth, comfort and support of our families have given all of us strength to get through the most trying times of COVID-19."" But stricter COVID-19 measures are necessary as the coronavirus is still \x93spreading rapidly\x94 around the world, said the Prime Minister. Restrictions on home gatherings have been tightened to no more than eight visitors a day. ""Our own visits should be to at most two other households daily, and only to relatives,"" added Mr Lee. READ: Rules on visiting and tossing yusheng: 7 things to note this Chinese New Year amid COVID-19 \x93This January, we saw the new waves of infection caused by year-end celebrations in many countries, where many people gathered and let their guard down. This is something we should learn from and avoid,\x94 said Mr Lee. \x93I know these restrictions will dampen the festive atmosphere somewhat. Bigger extended families will be especially inconvenienced. But the precautions are essential to keep our loved ones safe. \x93I am sure you will find other ways to hold your reunions and connect with family members and friends, perhaps through video calls or teleconferencing.\x94 People can look forward to \x93more carefree"" celebrations when the pandemic is over, he added. VACCINATIONS FOR WHOLE POPULATION IN 2021 Singapore should be able to offer COVID-19 vaccinations to its whole population within this year, provided vaccine supplies come in as scheduled, said Mr Lee. About 250,000 people in Singapore have already received the first dose of the vaccine so far. \x93We have vaccinated most frontline and essential workers, and are now vaccinating our seniors, starting with those over 70,\x94 said the Prime Minister. READ: Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine authorised for use in Singapore, first shipment expected around March Mr Lee said he \x93strongly\x94 encourages everyone to take the vaccine when it is their turn. \x93Vaccination protects ourselves, and our loved ones. Furthermore, if enough of us are vaccinated, our population will have herd immunity. \x93But we are not there yet, so in the meantime please keep up our safe distancing precautions, even if you yourself have been vaccinated,\x94 he added. READ: More frequent tests, additional requirements likely for those who do not take COVID-19 vaccine: Lawrence Wong Keeping people safe from COVID-19, especially seniors, has been the Government\x92s top priority, said the Prime Minister. \x93We have gone all out to control the spread of the virus, treat the infected and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed, even at great economic cost. Because of this tremendous effort, our COVID-19 situation has now stabilised.\x94 Mr Lee added that Singapore has avoided the \x93disastrous outbreaks and the enormous pain and suffering\x94 experienced by many other countries, and has restarted most of its economy while cautiously resuming cross-border travel. READ: People who need to travel have to wait turn to be vaccinated for COVID-19: MOH \x93As we welcome the Year of the Ox, we can look back and give thanks that we have come through the Year of the Rat, not without trouble, but relatively unscathed.\x94 The Prime Minister also called on people to show their appreciation for healthcare and transport workers, cleaners, migrant workers, delivery riders and other essential workers who are making personal sacrifices to keep Singapore going during this festive period. \x93Many of our Malay, Indian and Eurasian friends will be working, covering for their Chinese colleagues. They deserve our heartfelt thanks,\x94 said Mr Lee. \x93I wish all Singaporeans good health, and a very happy Chinese New Year.\x94 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...ssage-14166300",11/2/21,642,Social Distancing,677,4,-11.95123321,127,27,22,-0.32886887,0,1,1

?­ Continued crowd management measures and advisory for festive period,10/2/21 13:49,"Continued crowd management measures and advisory for festive period There have been heavier crowds over the past weekends in Chinatown. STB, together with relevant agencies and community partners such as the Chinatown Business Association and Chinatown Festivals Organising Committee, has implemented additional measures from 5 February 2021 to better manage the crowds. These measures include not turning on the Chinatown Chinese New Year street light-up from 5 to 7 February and deploying more Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs) and Enforcement Officers (EOs) on the ground. Since 5 February, there has been an estimated 20 per cent reduction in crowd size compared to the week before. STB will continue to work with the relevant agencies to monitor the situation in Chinatown, and will adjust measures accordingly. Around 3,000 SDAs and EOs are deployed daily to enforce Safe Distancing Measures (SDMs) and SMMs at various premises and public spaces, with more being deployed during peak hours, weekends and in hotspots. We will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against errant operators and individuals. This includes fines, suspension of operations even for first offences, and prosecution for egregious breaches. We strongly urge members of the public to plan visits to Chinatown and other potentially crowded areas such as shopping malls, F&B outlets, markets, supermarkets and parks, during off peak hours. This will help mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission during the festive period and keep us all safe. We would also like to remind members of the public that households are limited to eight unique visitors a day. Individuals should also limit themselves to visiting at most two other households per day. For the tossing of yusheng, masks must be worn and the lo hei should be done without any verbalisation of the auspicious phrases or toasting. Multiple table bookings at F&B premises for groups larger than eight persons are also strictly prohibited, unless the diners are from the same household. Intermingling across different tables is not allowed. We strongly advise F&B operators to double-check the reservations they have already received to ensure that the bookings are in order. We also urge diners to not try to circumvent the rules, for the sake of their loved ones and the well-being of the community. We will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action. Let us be socially responsible in observing all these measures to prevent a resurgence in community transmission. https://www.sgpc.gov.sg/media_releas...e/P-20210210-1",10/2/21,389,Social Distancing,400,4,-11.87801044,64,16,2,-0.147315767,0,1,1

[GPGT] PAP fail ! More people go to Chinatown thinking the new measure will reduce the crowd !,9/2/21 10:40,"Crowds still seen in Chinatown despite new measures SATURDAY, FEB 6: Despite new measures, crowding in Chinatown does not seem to have changed much from a week earlier. PHOTOS: CLARISS CHIA, TNP FILE SATURDAY, JAN 30: Despite new measures, crowding in Chinatown does not seem to have changed much from a week earlier. PHOTOS: CLARISS CHIA, TNP FILE Despite new crowd control measures, people still converge on Chinatown to shop and take in the atmosphere Turn off the Chinese New Year light-up over the weekend? Check. Put in new crowd control measures. Check. A lot can change in a week, such as the introduction of the above measures to reduce crowding in Chinatown's shopping precinct after The New Paper reported on shoppers ""rubbing shoulders"" in packed streets and shops two Saturdays ago. What has not changed so much is the crowding in Trengganu Street, Temple Street and Pagoda Street in the wake of the new measures. Though the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) estimated a 20 per cent drop in the crowds compared to the previous Saturday, many people were still too close for comfort in safe distancing terms. In fact, some of them told The New Paper that they had gone to Chinatown because they expected the new measures to reduce the crowding. Housewife Tan Mei Sin, 42, who was there with her husband and their three young children, said they wanted to take in the Chinese New Year atmosphere. ""It's an annual must-do for our family and Chinatown is the best place to come and feel festive. ""Things are already so gloomy. We can't even go to Johor Baru to shop for new year goodies. We decided we would spend about an hour here, have dinner and then leave."" Madam Tan was not alone. Of the 24 people who spoke to TNP, 11 said they were in Chinatown primarily to soak in the atmosphere. Or as one put it, ""just come to feel the vibes"". The new crowd control measure were announced by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) last Friday to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Apart from suspending the light-up over the weekend, they included closing the up-riding escalator at Chinatown MRT station exit A from time to time to manage passenger flow into Pagoda Street. The MSE also urged the public to adapt their Chinese New Year celebrations to ""protect vulnerable members in our community, such as the elderly"" and be socially responsible to prevent a resurgence in community transmission. The Chinatown Business Association (CBA) said on Saturday that barriers were put in place and additional security staff and safe distancing ambassadors would be deployed in crowded areas. Mr Anthony Tan, 56, who was with his 76-year-old mother and their helper, said: ""I promised my mother I would bring her here... like in past years."" The technician added: ""But I made sure she wore her mask properly and sanitised her hands every time we moved from each stall. I find it hard to deprive her from enjoying the festivity."" Noting an estimated 20 per cent reduction in crowd size, Ms Serene Tan, STB's director for arts and cultural precincts, told TNP: ""We thank the public for their understanding and seek their continued cooperation to visit Chinatown during off-peak hours."" The STB also said last week that 34 people have been fined $300 each in Chinatown since Jan 15 for not wearing face masks or gathering in groups of more than eight. In the same period, 11 businesses in Chinatown were fined $1,000 to $2,000 for failing to ensure 1m safe distancing between customers and for allowing gatherings of more than eight people. Most of the shopkeepers approached by TNP said they were fine with the stepped-up enforcement. One of them, who wanted to be known only as Ms Jessica, 50, said: ""I think that it is better this way because I am worried too. ""Our shop received a warning for not controlling the crowd... With the (new) restrictions, it is easier for us to control the situation now."" A security officer for CBA told TNP there is a contingency plan to close off the streets if the crowds became unmanageable. When shown the new photographs of the crowds, infectious disease specialist Leong Hoe Nam said: ""Singaporeans are absolutely becoming complacent... but we can also 'share the cheer' by doing something else. Go outside of Chinatown and tone down the celebration, have fun without the crowds."" Noting that the ability to impose restrictions has its limits, Dr Leong said: ""Can the authorities police everything? I plead for common sense to prevail among the public. ""We all hate it when our parents nag us. And as parents, we hate nagging our kids too. ""I do hope the enlightened Singaporean will rise to the occasion instead of the 'kiasu'one."" https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/cr...e-new-measures",8/2/21,774,Social Distancing,804,4,-11.48607755,141,27,14,-0.562771294,0,0,1

Firm to step up measures after covid case involving employee working at ChangiAirport,9/2/21 10:31,"A company that manages the deployment of some taggers, ushers and administrators at Changi Airport will increase the frequency of*temperature taking and disinfecting counters*after one of its employees tested positive for COVID-19.* The 43-year-old Singaporean, who was the country's sole community case reported on Sunday (Feb 7), is employed by BGC Group and works at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3. His job involves issuing electronic monitoring devices to people who will be serving stay-home notice*outside dedicated facilities and helping them to put on these devices. While on duty, he wears a surgical mask, face shield and gloves, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). In response to CNA\x92s queries, BGC Group said on Monday that the infection was detected during a routine, bi-weekly swab, and that he had tested negative in the prior round of testing. \x93BGC Group will continue to closely monitor the health of 12 negatively-tested employees who have been in contact with our affected employee,\x94 said the firm.* \x93We are treating this unfortunate first incident very seriously and BGC Group will be increasing the frequency of temperature taking to a three-hourly reporting. Our frequency of disinfecting our counters will also be strictly stepped up so to ensure an even safer environment for all employees under our care.\x94 MOH said on Sunday that all the man\x92s identified close contacts, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period. Since the man's positive test on Feb 5, BGC Group has reviewed its healthcare and safety standard operating procedures and said there were \x93no breaches\x94. The HR company has about 30 people who are actively deployed in shifts at the airport currently. It*said its employees who are required to be in close contact with incoming passengers are equipped with face shields, masks and gloves. \x93Given that the nature of the job involves potential contact with imported cases, our employees understand the risk factors involved and have to strictly adhere to frequent disinfecting schedules and daily temperature reporting. We clean and disinfect our equipment before and after every passenger is tagged,\x94 said BGC Group. It added that it is awaiting its vaccination schedule as Singapore progressively rolls out doses to more frontliners, including airport staff. The HR firm's Changi Airport project has been*running since August last year. The 43-year-old confirmed case has been with the company for more than four months, it added. Singapore introduced*electronic monitoring devices*in August last year for all incoming travellers serving their stay-home notice outside of dedicated facilities. Those aged 12 and below are exempted from this requirement. These individuals are issued with the*device at the checkpoints*after immigration clearance. They are required to activate the electronic monitoring device upon reaching their place of residence. If the device is not activated as required, the authorities will follow up to determine their location*and assist to resolve any technical difficulties, or take enforcement action, as the case may be. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...evice-14139374",9/2/21,484,Social Distancing,512,4,-11.73575556,104,16,4,-0.231833916,0,0,1

Chinese New Year (CNY) visitations have become a logistical headache for some, especially those with large families. In the week leading up to CNY, we talk to a few Singaporeans to find out how their families have been affected by the measures, and their thoughts on the whole situation. How do you know it's CNY? Perhaps it's when a throng of relatives you hardly see suddenly gather to exchange greetings, niceties and angpows. For me, it's when my entire extended family of over 30 people gathers at my grandmother's place on the first day of CNY. It's like a typical family gathering filled with lots of food and laughter. The only difference? We're better-dressed. But CNY in the midst of a pandemic, however, is looking to be slightly different. Peculiar even. With households only able to accept eight visitors per day, the biggest question is: How will families organise themselves? Of course, it could very well be that a family just decides to cancel CNY and scrap all visitation plans. Me to a friend: ""Hey, how is your family going to celebrate CNY this year ah?"" Friend: Which is perfectly fine. But for most families, mine included, my guess is that they will still try to ensure that some form of visiting still takes place. With over 30 people and only eight allowed per day, some will not get to visit during the first weekend When the announcement on the eight-visitor rule first happened, there was a bit of a scramble in my family's WhatsApp chat. And understandably so, since the implication of the policy meant that not every family would get to visit our grandmother during the first (or even second) day of CNY. My dad has seven siblings, and the majority of which have their own families of one to three kids. Some of these ""kids"" have also gone on to have their own kids. Basically, CNY this year would look vastly different from the CNY celebrations we've known all our lives and the restrictions would require us to do a bit of organising amongst ourselves. We're not alone as well. Tang Mei Yong, 50, told Mothership that their usual family gatherings involve a much smaller crowd of less than 30. But CNY is a slightly different, with over 50 relatives, including those they only see once a year, ""(squeezing) together"". 55-year-old Amy Cheong also told us that there would be around 50 to 60 people ""crammed into ah ma's house"" on the first day of CNY. But due to the virus, Cheong explained: ""If they are uncomfortable with it, because there are still risks, they can choose not to come to visit at all and we will respect their decision."" Who does all the coordinating? Is anybody even doing it? The next logical step is to organise those who wish to visit anyway. But who is to be entrusted with the laborious task of coordinating different families? The most fuss-free method for my family is to make use of an existing WhatsApp chat group so everyone can add on to a running list of who visits when. More importantly, the chat allows everyone to coordinate requests in real-time. (""Sorry, ah ma requesting mahjong kaki (friends) for day 1 so can non-mahjong players swap to another date?""). An illustrative example of a proposed list involving who to visit when, with the number of visitors helpfully indicated in parentheses: (Translation: Day 1: Eldest Brother, Second eldest brother; Day 2: Third brother, fifth brother; Day 3: Eldest Sister) There could be other practical factors influencing who coordinates the entire timetable too. In the case of Cheong, for instance, her sister helps to coordinate since she lives with their mum. But for other families without similar chat groups, this role might simply fall onto the lap of the most organised person in the family, simply by virtue of the fact that this individual is just naturally better at keeping track of things and chasing others for a response. How to decide which family visits when? The next order of business is to arrange who gets to visit when. Which is potentially a real headache when you need to think about the capacity limits, and to also factor in the schedules of multiple families. It could be on a first-come first-serve basis. Like Tang's family, where whoever calls to lock in their timeslot will get to visit first. But other families have other considerations. The daughters on my dad's side of the family were quick to decide on behalf of everyone: ""Let the sons visit first"". Which makes sense when you consider how daughters are traditionally considered 'outsiders' once they get married. After marriage, the daughter would prioritise her husband's family. For Cheong's family, they decided to use age as an organising principle instead, where the families of the older siblings get to visit their mum first. How does Cheong feel, not being able to visit her family during the first week (she will be visiting on the following week instead as she is the youngest sibling)? ""No one is cut out intentionally,"" she told us. ""It's a mutual decision among the siblings."" She also added, with profound reflectiveness: ""The days don't matter. Because we can visit them other days too. If we only visit our parents or grandparents during CNY then siao liao (something has gone wrong). Every day can be chu yi (CNY Day 1). It's the attitude and mindset."" One can accept and understand the rules but still be disappointed A common initial response to the rule is disappointment. Particularly for some older folks, who are used to having large gatherings as a sign of a happy and prosperous family. But despite the emotional response, one gets the sense that people rationally understand the need for having such restrictions. My grandmother, for one, would love to have the whole family over at her place on the first two days (who knew that CNY 2020 would be the last time we all saw one another in the same space at the same time?). But when my dad called her to explain our visitation plans, reiterating the new restrictions, she seemed pretty accepting of it. For Cheong, she pointed out how her mum, who is already 93 years old, was actually hoping to see most relatives during the CNY period. Nevertheless, there is consensus that this rule is ""inconvenient"" but important. ""The house won't be lively anymore. Ah ma likes many people at her house, but we have no choice because of this pandemic. The festive mood is not there but we will make it work with the restrictions. Ah ma is very sad that all of us cannot gather together since she is 93 years old already. She doesn't know how many more CNYs she can celebrate."" https://mothership.sg/2021/02/large-...-to-cny-visit/",7/2/21,1136,Social Distancing,1182,4,-11.08091047,205,40,27,-0.543393848,0,0,1
