I am wearing high grade surgical mask which is real surgical standard brought way  before all these random mass production surgical masks on the market How to make surgical mask feels better on you ears..... Loosen the elastic tension on the ear loop... Holding the 2 connecting points (elastic loop and mask) using your thumb and index finger, stretch the elastic loop a few times. This makes the elastic band lose and won't strap to your ear too tightly. Also for mask in the current market, they are mess produced at normal open air factories and not inside Clean Room Environment..... And not certified to medical standards. So it justify the $2.90 for 50 masks catergory. Usual pricing pre Covid-19 is $8~$10 for medical practices purchase. (Dental or clinic).",2021-09-03 11:29:00,146

British national Skea Nigel, 52, was serving a 14-day stay-home notice at the hotel when he left his room without a mask on three occasions on Sep 21 last year. According to court documents, he loitered along the corridor outside his room on the 14th floor twice, for about 10 minutes each time. On the third occasion, he met his Singaporean fiancee, Agatha Maghesh Eyamalai, 39. She was not serving a stay-home notice but had booked a different room on the 27th floor of the same hotel. The pair met on the 27th floor, with Eyamalai opening the emergency exit door for Nigel, the charge sheet read. They then spent the night together in the room from about 2.30am to 11.40am. Nigel was charged under the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 \x96 Stay Orders) Regulations 2020 and COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020. For abetting his breach of stay-home notice requirements, his fiancee was charged under the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 \x96 Stay Orders) Regulations 2020 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, said ICA. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...arged-13964998",2021-01-15 11:57:00,193

2118,2369,"Over 8,600 fines, totalling over $2.5m, issued for breach of Covid-19 safety measures",2021-02-21 17:02:00,"From April to December last year, over 8,600 fines - totalling more than $2.5 million - were meted out to people who did not follow safe distancing and safe management measures and who did not wear masks. From April to December last year,  more than 6,900 fines were meted out to individuals who did not follow safe distancing and safe management measures. During this same period, more than 1,700 fines were imposed on those who did not wear masks, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) told The Sunday Times. First-time offenders who breach safe distancing measures are fined $300, and second-time wrongdoers $1,000. Offenders may also face prosecution in court for egregious cases and higher fines if convicted. The figures mean that fines for failing to follow safe distancing and safe management measures amounted to more than $2 million. Fines for not wearing masks totalled more than $510,000. MSE added that gathering in groups larger than the permitted size was one of the most common infringements of the Covid-19 safety measures. Another common offence was intermingling at food and beverage outlets, game courts in Housing Board estates as well as parks and beaches. The MSE said: ""Covid-19 remains a serious threat and we must not become complacent, including during festive periods, when there will be an increase in social interactions."" On Friday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, cautioned against easing measures introduced to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Since Jan 26, households can have a maximum of eight unique visitors per day. This additional measure comes on top of those already in place, such as the wearing of masks outside one's home which was mandated from April 14 last year. Under phase three of Singapore's reopening which began on Dec 28, groups of up to eight people can gather socially, up from five previously. MSE urged the public to observe the tightened measures announced by the multi-ministry task force. It said: ""All of us must comply with these measures to avoid a resurgence in community cases, which could have devastating impacts on lives and livelihoods. ""Agencies will continue to step up enforcement inspections on F&B premises, malls, parks and beaches, where needed."" In response to queries from The Sunday Times, the police said it supports other agencies to enforce safe management measures at known hot spots. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) conducts inspections of workplaces to ensure that companies abide by safe management measures. Close to 140 firms were told to cease on-site operations after serious violations of workplace safe management measures, which were introduced in March last year. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...afety-measures",2021-02-21 16:07:00,419

Tried again and again with a fresh mask from a 2nd and 3rd box and they were all the same. The elastic straps were also too tight and the ears hurt after a while. Threw all 4 boxes away as I was risking my health when I kept on pulling and touching the exterior of the mask to get the fibres out of my nose.

Bonus Usually for the  masks with more restrictive media (eg surgical masks), it would leak at the nose and sides....that is why it's still breathable.  Try using your hands to cusp the sides and nose, it'd be much more unbreathable. Video shows this very clearly.  It does cut the distance travelled and catches the big ballistic droplets so there is reduction, but the plume is still there, and any slight air movement would move this. Look at the more DIY type pretty pretty cloth masks (not talking about the temasek ones).

She departed Singapore on 30 January on a turnaround flight to the UAE , and returned on 1 February without disembarking from the aircraft at the overseas destination. She developed anosmia on 4 February, but did not seek medical attention. On 7 February, she was tested for COVID-19 as part of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\x92s requirement for air crew to be tested following their return from overseas. Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 8 February, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for an individual swab, and isolated. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Her previous test on 22 January following another turnaround flight was negative for COVID-19. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. She has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further confirmatory tests.* Case 60102 received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2 February. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, she could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.* Besides Case 60102, 4 passengers on the same flight (Cases 59885, 59893, 59901 and 59902) have tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and are also preliminarily positive for the B117 strain.

5276,5983,Double-Masking lai liao,2021-11-02 08:02:00,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released new guidance about the best ways to use masks to help prevent transmission of covid-19. One key recommendation highlights the added benefits of using a more snugly fitting mask or pairing a cloth mask with a surgical mask. Experimental data collected by the agency suggests that either option should greatly reduce the risk of transmission between people. Rochelle Walensky, the newly appointed CDC director, discussed the new recommendations during a White House coronavirus briefing on Wednesday. Walensky first reiterated the current consensus that properly worn masks can help limit the spread of the coronavirus. Some masks are better at protecting the wearer from infection (N95 and KN95 masks in particular), but they all limit the outward transmission of potentially infectious droplets and aerosols to others. New research from the CDC, however, looked at the relative effectiveness of different methods using cloth and surgical masks and how it could be improved. In the study, even cloth masks were more effective than no masks at limiting the spread of aerosol and droplet particles the size of those emitted by people with covid-19. But surgical masks that were more snugly fit or that had a cloth mask worn on top of them were the most effective at protecting the user and others. In an experiment that simulated being exposed to an infectious person breathing nearby, having both parties wear better-fitted or double-layered masks reduced the level of exposure by more than 95 percent, Walensky said, compared to no mask at all. \x93I want to be clear that these new scientific data released today do not change the specific recommendations about who should wear a mask or when they should wear one, but they do provide new information on why wearing a well-fitting mask is so important to protect you and others,\x94 she added. The CDC has now updated its website on improving the effectiveness of masks based on this new data. To make surgical masks better-fitting, for instance, the CDC recommends first knotting the strands of the ear loops and tucking in the outer layer of the mask fabric (there\x92s a helpful guide and visual provided by the CDC if that description isn\x92t clear enough). There are also other products, such as mask fitters and braces or masks with nose bridges, that will make a mask tighter. However it\x92s done, you can tell a mask is snug enough if you can feel warm air come through the front of the mask and the mask moves with every breath you take. As for double-masking, the CDC recommends either wearing a cloth mask with multiple layers or wearing a cloth mask over a surgical mask. However, it doesn\x92t recommend wearing two surgical masks at once, or combining an KN95 mask with any other mask (to be fair, these masks are already very good at protection when worn correctly). In addition to wearing masks in public, people should obviously still practice physical distancing whenever possible, avoid crowded indoor spaces, and wash their hands regularly. https://gizmodo.com/cdc-releases-new...ing-1846242314",2021-11-02 08:02:00,499

Quote: When a mannequin exposed to the virus was equipped with various masks (cotton mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask), the uptake of the virus droplets/aerosols was reduced. A cotton mask led to an approximately 20% to 40% reduction in virus uptake compared to no mask (Fig. 2B). The N95 mask had the highest protective efficacy (approximately 80% to 90% reduction) of the various masks examined; however, infectious virus penetration was measurable even when the N95 mask was completely fitted to the face with adhesive tape (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission, whereas the N95 mask showed considerable protective efficacy (Fig. 2C). There was a synergistic effect when both the virus receiver and virus spreader wore masks (cotton masks or surgical masks) to prevent the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols (Fig. 2D and E). However, it remains unknown whether the small amount of virus that was able to pass through the N95 masks would result in illness.",2021-10-02 09:46:00,222

Wearing mask is just giving people a false sense of security. Add : If the infected rate is high, the chances of catching the virus in crowded places would be high even if everyone wears mask. The main reason why so many people in Singapore are still crowding around in hawker centers and shopping malls (including Chinatown during CNY) is the infected rate in the population is very low (thanks to the various government measures). The testing, isolation and SHN of travelers coming into Singapore are also greatly reducing the possibility of the virus spreading from outside the country to the community.  So, contrary to the concerns of some people, the number of import cases is actually not a concern at current levels (<50 each day). Based on the number of new community cases each day, the infected rate in the population might be 1 in 2 million each day. When the infected rate is so low, the chances that someone in a crowd of a few hundreds has the virus is extremely low.  Add to this, the chances of an infected person spreads the virus to the surrounding is reduced when he/she wears a mask. This is why we have not seen any explosion of the number of new cases despite so many people crowding in hawker centers, supermarkets, shopping malls and public transport everyday. Therefore, as long as the infected rate in the population remains this low, crowds of a few hundreds or even a few thousands is, contrary to some people's thinking, not a major concern.

Somemore below was not B117 variant.... https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/11/20-3299_article Transmission of SARS-CoV 2 During Long-Haul Flight Transmission on flight VN54 was clustered in business class, where seats are already more widely spaced than in economy class, and infection spread much further than the existing 2-row (36) or 2 meters (37) rule recommended for COVID-19 prevention on airplanes and other public transport would have captured. Similar conclusions were reached for SARS-CoV superspreader events on a flight in 2003, in which a high risk for infection was observed for passengers seated farther than 3 rows from the index case (4). This finding also concurs with transmission patterns observed for influenza virus (38) and is generally in line with the mounting evidence that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major yet underrecognized transmission route (39,40). Making mask wearing obligatory and making hand hygiene and cough etiquette standard practice while on board and at airports seems an obvious and relatively simple measure (27). Blocking middle seats, currently recommended by the airline industry (7,35), may in theory prevent some in-flight transmission events but seems to be insufficient to prevent superspreading events. We conclude that the risk for on-board transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during long flights is real and has the potential to cause COVID-19 clusters of substantial size, even in business class\u2013like settings with spacious seating arrangements well beyond the established distance used to define close contact on airplanes.",2021-10-02 02:12:00,223

Quote: When a mannequin exposed to the virus was equipped with various masks (cotton mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask), the uptake of the virus droplets/aerosols was reduced. A cotton mask led to an approximately 20% to 40% reduction in virus uptake compared to no mask (Fig. 2B). The N95 mask had the highest protective efficacy (approximately 80% to 90% reduction) of the various masks examined; however, infectious virus penetration was measurable even when the N95 mask was completely fitted to the face with adhesive tape (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission, whereas the N95 mask showed considerable protective efficacy (Fig. 2C). There was a synergistic effect when both the virus receiver and virus spreader wore masks (cotton masks or surgical masks) to prevent the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols (Fig. 2D and E). However, it remains unknown whether the small amount of virus that was able to pass through the N95 masks would result in illness.",2021-08-02 09:45:00,193

It is not too late at this stage for Singapore and we definitely can overcome this as a population. Cheers. In before PAP IBs reply The circumstances did not change. Can easily prove that Singapore public health policy was based on fake news that the PAP Ministers and MOH spread. 1) When evidence has been published, the PAP Ministers and MOH Chief Scientist cannot pretend to be blind and say no evidence was seen. Did MOH Chief Scientist spread fake news when he claimed he saw no evidence of community spread on 27 Feb? Yes or no. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...t-is-over-says Professor Tan Chorh Chuan told The Straits Times: ""Singapore's approach of actively looking for new cases and quarantining close contacts has been effective in ring-fencing clusters of infection so far, and we have not seen evidence of community spread. Here is the definition of community spread from USA CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html What is community spread? Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. As of Feb 27, MOH reported a total of 96 cases. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...-case-12475870 Based on MOH report on 28 February, there were a total of 32 unlinked cases out of 96 confirmed cases = 33% unlinked cases. 33% of confirmed cases were unlinked according to MOH report on 28 Feb, so on what basis did MOH Chief Scientist claim that he did not see any evidence of community spread? https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...ion-confirmed/ Unlinked cases 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10 11,12,14,15,16,17,18 22,23,29 32,35,37 43,45,46 64 76,78 83,85,87,89 92 Linked cases 8,9 13,19 20,21,24,25,26,27,28 30,31,33,34,36,38,39 40,41,42,44,47,48,49 50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59 60,61,62,63,65,66,67,68,69 70,71,72,73,74,75,77,79 80,81,82,84,86,88 90,91,93,94,95,96 2) Science is based on peer review. Did MOH spread fake news when they said no evidence of aerosol transmission on 10 Feb? Yes or no. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...n-moh-12418446 ""Based on evidence available in China, an expert from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said that there is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through aerosol,"" said MOH. On what basis did MOH claim there was no evidence, just by citing only 1 single publication from China? Did MOH suspect that China publication was fake news propaganda? Remember Dr. Li Wenliang already whistleblew how China tried to coverup the Wuhan virus spread in Dec 2019. He was arrested for fake news. He died on Feb 6 2020 due to the virus. https://www.theguardian.com/world/20...om-coronavirus Did MOH review the confirmed case of the Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship [Diamond Princess] and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator? Did MOH not review the possibility that if MERS-CoV can be spread by aerosol transmission, why did they rule out Covid-19 being spread by droplets as well? http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-persp...ction-covid-19 Droplet or aerosol infection spread? Surgical mask or respirator? Asymptomatic transmission or symptomatic only? These are the defining questions surrounding the person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 that have yet to be answered\x97or answered sufficiently\x97for US experts monitoring the disease. And the answers hold the key to infection control policies that will become necessary as the disease continues to infect tens of thousands in China and hundreds more across the globe. Yesterday the media reported that a Japanese doctor who was monitoring cruise ship passengers quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess in the port of Yokohama contracted the virus despite wearing gloves and a surgical mask. He joins the more than 500 healthcare workers in Wuhan, China, who have also reportedly contracted the disease\x97just by the middle of January. These infections put into question how effective infection control policies are at preventing transmission. Masks vs respirators\x97key differences In its newly published infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of N95 respirators in a healthcare setting with the suspected novel coronavirus, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended surgical masks for general patient care and respirators for aerosol-generating procedures only. Face masks have become ubiquitous in China, sold on the street, and worn by almost everyone in public. A new survey, the Premise Coronavirus Awareness Survey, showed that in Taiwan 79.9% of people questioned said they were wearing masks in an effort to protect themselves from COVID-19. A similar percentage was noted in the Philippines. Bruce Ribner, MD, medical director of the Serious Communicable Diseases Unit at Emory University Hospital, said the two masks serve very different functions. A surgical mask, or procedural mask, is meant to protect the environment from the wearer. ""It's meant to keep the surgeon's respiratory issues away from a patient,"" Ribner explained. A surgical mask does a good job of trapping large droplets, and some aerosol transmission, he said. Many of the masks being worn in China, though, are not designed for medical use or to any standards and so their effectiveness in trapping droplets is unknown. A respirator, such as an N95, fits tighter to the face and is meant to help protect the wearer from inhaling infectious droplets in the environment. ""We don't really know how the coronavirus is being transmitted from person to person, because no one has done the NIOSH studies that simulate the cough big droplets that land 3 to 6 feet away from a person or the little droplets that can travel long distances and in air handling system,"" Ribner said. ""So we have to use what we know about other coronaviruses and influenza when it comes to this disease."" What we know, Ribner said, is that multiple modes of transmission are likely at play, including large droplets, small droplets (or aerosols), and contaminated hands. At Emory, Ribner is responsible for the care of patients treated for Ebola, Lassa fever, and other serious pathogen diseases. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which publishes CIDRAP News, says, ""The very unsettling data regarding the number of infected healthcare workers in the Wuhan area and the infection of a Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator\x97should be a real wake-up call to all of us about how do we really protect against this critical occupational risk."" How the virus travels in the air Donald Milton, MD, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, helped prove via the use of his Gesundheit machine that influenza could be spread via aerosol transmission. He said he is in contact with colleagues in Singapore who are attempting to study the transmission of the COVID-19 viruses, which are often called nCoV, for novel coronavirus. Though Chinese officials said earlier this week that they believe the coronavirus is transmitted only via droplets, implying they do not believe airborne or contact transmission plays a role, Milton said that statement is likely rooted in fear, not science. ""To me this sounds like someone trying to deal with panic, because people panic when they hear airborne transmission and long-distance transmission,"" he said. He said there has been scientific evidence of aerosol transmission of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), so it is likely possible for this novel coronavirus, as well. Milton cautions that the difference between aerosol and droplet transmission is largely in name only. Respiratory droplets, emitted with a sneeze or a cough, are commonly thought to land within 6 feet of patients and are too large to be buoyant on air currents. Respiratory aerosols are droplets too, Milton said, but smaller and light enough to travel farther. ""You cannot tell the difference epidemiologically between something aerosol transmitted by weak sources and large droplet spray,"" said Milton. ""They behave so similar, it's very hard to pick up the difference."" He said he suspects the capability of long-distance transmission with COVID-19 will be connected to source strength, or how symptomatic a person is. Protection may depend on resources For Ribner, the issue of correct mask use will linger until the exact route of transmission is documented, and it is established if an asymptomatic person (one having no symptoms) can shed the virus before becoming sick. ""If we have a person who is shedding nCoV in the environment, the best way to stop transmission is to stick a surgical procedure mask on them,"" Ribner said. ""In the best of all worlds, anyone coming into the room with an nCoV patient would wear a respirator."" But if a respirator is not available, because of cost or manufacturing, the next best option is a surgical mask, Ribner said. He said that likely contributes to the WHO's surgical mask recommendation. ""The WHO is sensitive to the fact that not every part of the world has the resources of the US and Western Europe,"" he said. Keeping health workers from becoming patients But Osterholm counters, ""Frankly, the WHO recommendation that surgical masks provide adequate protection for healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients is not consistent with data we have from similar transmission dynamics we see with influenza virus."" In an op-ed today in the Washington Post, Osterholm and coauthor Mark Olshaker stressed, ""In a very real sense, what happens to our health-care workers will be the metric of how we respond to this unfolding crisis. If we don't do all we can to protect them, they will quickly transition from providers to patients, further stressing already overburdened facilities."" They add, ""Governments must support private-sector manufacturers in providing N95s and other equipment to front-line health-care providers and other essential workers. In terms of minimizing illness and death, this will be more important than any border closing, airport screening, or quarantine.""",2020-05-04 11:10:00,1700

What was not right is that our leaders shouldn\x92t have followed those advice when it is clear by early February asymptomatic persons could also be spreading the virus. They could have got this info from the China CDC easily, which they probably did but doubted the integrity of the info, which I do not understand why until today. In such cases, it would have been better to be safe than sorry. Maybe they were complacent and thought they could contain this pandemic easily with or without masks. Nevertheless, it is admirable that they are finally doing the right thing despite loss of face. Let\x92s not harp on it anymore and move on.

Also tell people whats the plan and by when they will get more masks....Taiwan even activate their NSmen go mask factories to help out.....

Quote: WHO Interim guidance 29 January 2020 General Advice Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including 2019-nCoV, in affected areas. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. If masks are to be used, this measure must be combined with hand hygiene and other IPC measures to prevent the human-tohuman transmission of 2019-nCov. sunsetbay wrote: Haha~ I already know they were not telling the truth cos WHO was pretty complacence on the Corona virus as there was mere few cases in Europe & US back then~ Also when LW said they heard from the experts advice, he didn't quote it was from WHO, he also didn't explain who are this ""experts"" were~ then in Feb the four local doctors came out their own health 2M advisory, wear mask & stop mingling~ MOH chief was quick to rebut them, he didn't quote WHO as well~ when CCS audio leak came out, he said he took a gamble to give out 4 masks to make sinkies shiok shiok~ if it was WHO advise, then there wasn't a need to give fake advise~ Worst thing is people like Calvin Cheng and his readers are defending hard for the ministers u-turn advisory~ unbelievable~",2020-08-04 11:50:00,398

Why police never arrest PAP Ministers and charge them under POFMA for fake news? In a closed door meeting with SCCI members, PAP Minister Chan Chun Sing said that supply of masks is not enough if everyone rush to buy. The public only knew about this because someone recorded the meeting and leaked it online, which spread viral before finally picked up by MSM and reported as news. 2) MOH Chief Scientist spread fake news that he saw no evidence of community spread on 27 Feb. Why is Singapore public health policy based on fake news? In MOH report on 28 Feb, 32 out of 96 cases were unlinked. That meant 33% of cases were unlinked. On what basis did MOH Chief Scientist claim he saw no evidence of community spread? 3) MOH spread fake news no evidence of aerosol transmission on 10 Feb. Why is Singapore health policy based on fake news? On what basis did MOH claim there was no evidence, just by citing only 1 single publication from China? [Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ] Did MOH suspect that China publication was fake news propaganda? Remember Dr. Li Wenliang already whistleblew how China tried to coverup the Wuhan virus spread in Dec 2019. He was arrested for fake news. He died on Feb 6 2020 due to the virus. Did MOH review the confirmed case of the Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship [Diamond Princess] and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator? Did MOH not review the possibility that if MERS-CoV can be spread by aerosol transmission, why did they rule out Covid-19 being spread by droplets as well? 4) The fact is Singapore public health policy is based on fake news spread by PAP Ministers and MOH Chief Scientist. If PAP Ministers dont step down or harakiri after spreading fake news and implement it for public health policy, then I worry.

I'm using the govt issued reusable mask everyday. The 3 ply one. Washing it everyday. Good quality. Still in tip top condition.

Not to mention reusable masks do not require the same raw materials (that were in mass shortage back then) or production process that disposable masks do.

This is in case we are infected but asymptomatic.  Likewise, other people wear a mask to prevent their saliva from landing on us. So, I think it can be reused after washing, as the mask like any other home made cloth can stop our saliva from firing at people. Washing is also good, and in fact necessary, because soap and water will KILL the virus, so before reusing it, we want to slaughter all the viruses which might have attached themselves happily to the external surface of the mask. Those who still think that the mask is intended to filter out all viruses and bacteria and is meant to protect the person wearing it will argue with me though.",2020-05-24 17:27:00,174

No need to argue until the cow come home. Putting some much disclaimer at the beginning of the article just to protect his ricebowl and at the same time trying to play angel. No need to argue whether Dr Tan is right or wrong. The fact is every country was facing exactly the same crisis and getting the same information and updates since the Covid 19 outbreak was made known on 31 Dec 2020 but other countirs can handle better than our MTF. On the shortage of masks, Singapore is not the only country facing this problem, the rest if not all are also not having enough mask for their people. just take example of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Taiwan's and Hong Kong's Government did not discourage their people to wear mask even there wasn't enough to go along. They (the Authorities and the people) started to improvise - homemade mask after many could not get the mask. Many videos on youtube showing long long long queue in Hong Kong but they soldiered on. As it is better to at least having a mask than no mask be it not as effective as a surgical mask. THIS IS THE POINT WHERE WE FAILED MISERABLY. Our MTF have given many wrong messages to the public. 1. No need to wear mask if you are not sick. They should not have said this. They should in fact just leave it to the public to make their own judgement. Also because of this message, those who worn mask at that time were discriminated.  I remember reading an article about a pre-school kid being penalised for wearing mask to kindergarten and the parent was called to bring him home if he insisted to wear the mask. 2. Covid 19 (Wuhan Virus at that time) Not as deadly As SARs 3. Encourage people to go stayacation and visit places of interest in Singapore. Allow Chingay Parade and Airshow to go on.

Singapore followed those countries terrible quarantine system. SG actually did it right initially with the NTUC D'resort. Why do you think till now, there're no cases of infected healthcare workers and volunteers from NTUC D'resort? All the patients are in proper room by room. Lesser contact with the patients who no longer needs clinical care. Food can be placed outside their door. If sick, the doctor meet one by one instead of camping together with other positive patients in same environment separated by only partitions like the medical room in that mothership video of expo. Healthcare workers and volunteers are so much safer in the hotel. Japan also using hotels to place mild and recovering patients to lighten the hospital bed loads. None of their healthcare workers & staffs who were deployed to those hotels got infected with that strategy. All their healthcare workers who got infected were from hospitals and quarantine facilities where they house many in one place. They couldn't afford to risk their very limited healthcare workers and volunteers, so they keep using more & more hotels. Not only safer for patients (prevent other strains infecting patients), but also safer for healthcare workers, staffs and volunteers. I remembered WHO also recommended using of hotels to quarantine mild and assymptomatic positive patients. Many countries are also following that approach to use hotels. Over 210,000 hotel rooms secured for recovering & mild patients in JP: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/20.../#.XrbSmm5uKUk ^ Even with this, some assymptomatic/mild positive Japanese are complaining they don't want to be quarantined in hotel if they're positive. They rather want to be quarantine at home until they've fully cleared of the virus. I was like... -_- They should come see SG community facilities like Expo, Changi and TP. I want to see their reaction. FW will never complain being in Expo/Changi/TP because those community facilities are many times better than being sick in others or their own countries. The living conditions in those facilities are even alot times better than their dorms. To them, they're very grateful already. It's also fine for them because they're young and their body immunity are in general better than us Singaporeans because they were upbrought in environment exposed to many things, so they naturally have stronger bodies. I cannot say the same for Singaporeans. Some Singaporeans I saw in FB are praising the expo out of sense of patriotism and only because they thought they will never ever get infected with the virus. But here's the hard truth. Those same Singaporeans who praised expo... if they themselves get infected, I'm sure... most if not all will never want to be quarantine in those community facilities. Do people think they will never ever get it? The virus is also more infectious than your common flu. See that other thread, that NTU guy stayed at home during whole CB period also get infected. FWs are happier in expo because it's an upgrade to stay in those community facilities compared to the dorms. Singaporeans will 100% be depressed and feel like in jail if end up in those places because we're used to the comfort of our own homes. Those praising the expo also don't give a thought on those frontlines healthcare workers, volunteers and NSmen who may end up deployed those community facilities. It's really very risky for them to be there.. there're countless of evidences globally with similar concept. Then, now we start to have healthcare workers infected in expo locally. I don't know but I feel like SG trying to hint those positive cases may not get infected from the expo environment in order to maintain image? Sometimes it's not good to 100% rely on ""local evidences"". They must also study global evidences. This is a new virus, it's always better to learn from each other. Don't take chances. SG took chances with masks, delay in closures, a step too late with the FWs dorms and we end up in our current situation now. The consequence for being late is really that much.. I really hope they change their approach with the quarantine facilities in months to come.. Start planning now before the deadlier strains comes in... (Please hope not. I doubt SG can survive those strains.) Those community facilities where they pack many in one place are really not good.. It must be either hotel quarantine (if many people in same home) or home quarantine for mild, recovering and assymptomatic confirmed cases. I saw few said in the past maybe we don't have enough hotels. We have more than enough hotels... They even used Siloso Beach resort for healthy FWs.. (which covid-19 patients need it more than healthy ones). SG is technically doing semi-home quarantine for undetected cases through CB already. Those who doesn't need clinical care anymore but still positive, home or hotel quarantine is better, safer for both patients and healthcare workers than those community facilities.",2020-10-05 01:41:00,931

Why do you think till now, there're no cases of infected healthcare workers and volunteers from NTUC D'resort? All the patients are in proper room by room. Lesser contact with the patients who no longer needs clinical care. Food can be placed outside their door. If sick, the doctor meet one by one instead of camping together with other positive patients in same environment separated by only partitions like the medical room in that mothership video of expo. Healthcare workers and volunteers are so much safer in the hotel. Japan also using hotels to place mild and recovering patients to lighten the hospital bed loads. None of their healthcare workers & staffs who were deployed to those hotels got infected with that strategy. All their healthcare workers who got infected were from hospitals and quarantine facilities where they house many in one place. They couldn't afford to risk their very limited healthcare workers and volunteers, so they keep using more & more hotels. Not only safer for patients (prevent other strains infecting patients), but also safer for healthcare workers, staffs and volunteers. I remembered WHO also recommended using of hotels to quarantine mild and assymptomatic positive patients. Many countries are also following that approach to use hotels. Over 210,000 hotel rooms secured for recovering & mild patients in JP: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/20.../#.XrbSmm5uKUk ^ Even with this, some assymptomatic/mild positive Japanese are complaining they don't want to be quarantined in hotel if they're positive. They rather want to be quarantine at home until they've fully cleared of the virus. I was like... -_- They should come see SG community facilities like Expo, Changi and TP. I want to see their reaction. FW will never complain being in Expo/Changi/TP because those community facilities are many times better than being sick in others or their own countries. The living conditions in those facilities are even alot times better than their dorms. To them, they're very grateful already. It's also fine for them because they're young and their body immunity are in general better than us Singaporeans because they were upbrought in environment exposed to many things, so they naturally have stronger bodies. I cannot say the same for Singaporeans. Some Singaporeans I saw in FB are praising the expo out of sense of patriotism and only because they thought they will never ever get infected with the virus. But here's the hard truth. Those same Singaporeans who praised expo... if they themselves get infected, I'm sure... most if not all will never want to be quarantine in those community facilities. Do people think they will never ever get it? The virus is also more infectious than your common flu. See that other thread, that NTU guy stayed at home during whole CB period also get infected. FWs are happier in expo because it's an upgrade to stay in those community facilities compared to the dorms. Singaporeans will 100% be depressed and feel like in jail if end up in those places because we're used to the comfort of our own homes. Those praising the expo also don't give a thought on those frontlines healthcare workers, volunteers and NSmen who may end up deployed those community facilities. It's really very risky for them to be there.. there're countless of evidences globally with similar concept. Then, now we start to have healthcare workers infected in expo locally. I don't know but I feel like SG trying to hint those positive cases may not get infected from the expo environment in order to maintain image? Sometimes it's not good to 100% rely on ""local evidences"". They must also study global evidences. This is a new virus, it's always better to learn from each other. Don't take chances. SG took chances with masks, delay in closures, a step too late with the FWs dorms and we end up in our current situation now. The consequence for being late is really that much.. I really hope they change their approach with the quarantine facilities in months to come.. Start planning now before the deadlier strains comes in... (Please hope not. I doubt SG can survive those strains.) Those community facilities where they pack many in one place are really not good.. It must be either hotel quarantine (if many people in same home) or home quarantine for mild, recovering and assymptomatic confirmed cases. I saw few said in the past maybe we don't have enough hotels. We have more than enough hotels... They even used Siloso Beach resort for healthy FWs.. (which covid-19 patients need it more than healthy ones). SG is technically doing semi-home quarantine for undetected cases through CB already. Those who doesn't need clinical care anymore but still positive, home or hotel quarantine is better, safer for both patients and healthcare workers than those community facilities. like to ownself masturbate to make ownself feel shiok shiok so that it's kkj can be long long & stiff stiff.
