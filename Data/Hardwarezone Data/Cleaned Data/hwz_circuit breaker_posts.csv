Man admits to providing unlawful carpooling services during Covid-19 circuit breaker,15/2/21 23:29,"In the first case of its kind, a man has been convicted of providing unlawful carpooling services during the circuit breaker last year. Ng Chiang Huat, 54, was caught after he picked up two ""passengers"" who turned out to be Land Transport Authority (LTA) officers. Singapore had imposed the circuit breaker between April 7 and June 1 last year to curb the growing number of Covid-19 cases then. Ng on Monday (Feb 15) pleaded guilty to one count each of using his car as a public service vehicle without a proper licence to do so, and an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Ti-Ting and LTA prosecutor Ng Jun Kai stated in court documents that at the time of the offences, Ng was a sales representative for a wholesale trading firm. The Singaporean was also a member of the ""Covid-19 Lockdown SGHitch"" chat group on messaging platform Telegram. On April 23 last year, he posted a message in the group stating: ""Driver looking for pax."" DPP Lee said: ""A prospective passenger by the name of 'Decha' responded to the accused's post, and at about 9.56am, the accused accepted the carpooling request to ferry the said passenger from Block 430 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4 to Plaza Singapura for a fare of $12."" A man and a woman later boarded Ng's car at around 10.20am. Ng was transporting the pair to their destination when an LTA enforcement officer stopped the vehicle along Handy Road near the shopping mall about 25 minutes later. When questioned, Ng lied to the man, claiming that the pair were his relatives. The DPP added: ""(The officer) asked the accused for the names of the passengers. ""As the accused was unable to provide the exact names of the passengers, the accused then admitted... that the two passengers in his vehicle were not his relatives, and that he was ferrying them in exchange for a fare."" On Monday, the prosecutors urged the court to sentence Ng to at least a week's jail, a fine of $1,800 and disqualify him from driving for a year. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ircuit-breaker",15/2/21,337,Circuit Breaker,354,4,-11.52331617,53,10,0,0.491408829,0,0,1

Circuit breaker spurs 29-year-old to put more into his CPF accounts,2/8/21 15:06,"The circuit breaker period last year gave Mr Cuthbert Yeo, 29, more time to look into his finances, and the engineer decided to better utilise his Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts. He voluntarily refunded the amount he had used from his Ordinary Account for his share of the down payment on his Housing Board flat, and transferred money from his Ordinary Account, which has a base interest rate of 2.5 per cent per year, to his Special Account, which has a base interest rate of 4 per cent per year. He had started moving cash to his Special Account from 2018, after reading a CPF Board annual report where a chart showed that many people in his age group had more in CPF savings than he did. At the time, Mr Yeo was two years into his first job, also in the engineering field. He then started topping up his CPF Special Account whenever he received a bonus from his employer. Since then, he has put in about $40,000 in both cash and transfers from his Ordinary Account. ""We should really build up a base of retirement savings while we're still young, especially now that the job market is not as stable with innovative disruption and it's not guaranteed that we can get a job we might want when we're older,"" he said. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...nary%20Account .",2/4/21,215,Circuit Breaker,225,4,-11.42214691,30,10,1,1.392970354,0,1,1

He had started moving cash to his Special Account from 2018, after reading a CPF Board annual report where a chart showed that many people in his age group had more in CPF savings than he did. At the time, Mr Yeo was two years into his first job, also in the engineering field. He then started topping up his CPF Special Account whenever he received a bonus from his employer. Since then, he has put in about $40,000 in both cash and transfers from his Ordinary Account.

With the virus being around for several months now, there is a body of scientific evidence showing that COVID-19 does not affect the young very much as compared to adults. Parents will be familiar with this concept, as this is the case for other diseases such as chicken pox. Neither is there evidence to show that the young are vectors or spreaders of the virus. The reverse appears to be the case, where the young get infected by adults at home. This is the advice of Prof Dale Fisher, Group Director of Medicine at NUHS and Chair of the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. Indeed, for the small handful of our students (including those from Institutes of Higher Learning) who were infected, every single one caught it outside of their schools. In this context, it may not be a bad idea for our children to spend the bulk of their day in school, where lessons and activities are arranged such that they mingle only with their classmates, who are less susceptible to the virus than adults. They will be quite a resilient group. If we close schools, many will not stay home, but may run around in the community and mingle with a lot more people, exposing themselves to more risk.
