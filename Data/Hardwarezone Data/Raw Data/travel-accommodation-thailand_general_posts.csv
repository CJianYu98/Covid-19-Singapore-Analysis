If you book under nonrefundable policy then is really subject to hotel already.  If hotel okay to refund then agoda will refund you.  You can try contact hotel and check with them.

This Covid came like that and shouldn't hotel or agoda be smart enough to know this isn't traveller's fault. Even scoot refund procedure was simpler and clear cut.

Cause imagine the next moment you injure yourself and have to cancel your trip, you can claim immediately. Not like if you cancel your trip, you don\x92t need insurance. You will still need.

The risk in Thailand is a great deal higher. They continue to allow Chinese tourists into the country and they probably do not have an extensive contact tracing system that we have. The situation may have already gone out of hand. It is a case of not knowing what you do not know.

Iata represents about 290 airlines and more than 80 per cent of global air traffic. Q: Is there a risk of becoming contaminated with the virus on a plane? A: The risk of catching a serious viral infection on an aircraft is low. The air supply to a modern airliner is very different from a movie theatre or an office building. The air is a combination of fresh air and recirculated air, about half each. The recirculated air goes through filters of the exact same type that we use in surgical operating theatres. That supplied air is guaranteed to be 99.97 per cent (or better) free of viruses and other particles. So the risk, if there is one, does not come from the supplied air. It comes from other people. Q: What are the chances of getting the virus by touching the seats, armrest or any of the objects on a plane? A: Viruses and other microbes like to live on living surfaces like us. Just shaking hands with somebody will be a greater risk by far than some dry surface that has no biological material on it. The survival of viruses on surfaces isn't great, so it's believed that normal cleaning, and then the extra cleaning in the event that someone was discovered to be contagious, is the appropriate procedure. Will people stop getting together inside an airplane? I would respond by asking: Will I stop going to the movies, or sports games, or concerts or conferences? I don't think so.

I just asked my friend to bring back sanitiser bought from lazada thailand. This notice seem to contradict the news in Bangkok Post? Quote: On Tuesday last week, the cabinet also approved a proposal to put face masks and alcohol-based hand sanitiser on the state price control list as part of efforts to deal with the deadly virus outbreak. Once an item is on the price control list, manufacturers, distributors, exporters and importers have to inform the Internal Trade Department of the production cost, sales price, production volume, export/import volume and inventory. Those who export more than 500 pieces need to receive approval from the department. Similar measures are applied to hand sanitiser, except for the limit on export volumes, as there are adequate quantities to meet domestic demand. https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand...h-mask-control"

We hope that this notice will help you understand the current situation better. To date, we have not received any official government announcement on the quarantine/restriction for visitors from Singapore travelling to Thailand. However, more stringent health monitoring measures on COVID-19 are in place at all entry Checkpoints (air/land/sea) into Thailand by the Ministry of Public Health (Thailand) for the well-being of its visitors and residents. For the current Health Advisory for Disembarking Passengers from Countries with Reported COVID-19 Infections, please visit https://www.tatnews.org/2020/02/heal...19-infections/ . As the COVID-19 situation is volatile, please visit our TAT Newsroom and the Ministry of Public Health (Thailand) at www.tatnews.org and www.moph.go.th for the latest official updates. We at TAT Singapore Office will keep you updated with the most updated development once we have received any official announcement from the Ministry of Public Health (Thailand). Thank you. Last updated: 4 March 2020 4.20pm\x94 guys, latest update from TAT No self-quarantine for SG travellers"

This announcement can be changed depending on the current situation. The CAAT has issued the following guidelines for all air operators in order to provide practical guidance for the air operators performing flights between those Disease Infected Zones and to support the surveillance measures taken by the Ministry of Public Health. 1. Where the Ministry of Public Health defines any territory outside Thailand as a Disease Infected Zone of the COVID-19, passengers from such Disease Infected Zone shall be subject to quarantine and any other measures for the prevention and control of communicable diseases as imposed by the Government of Thailand. 2. Air operators providing services from the airport of embarkation in the Disease Infected Zones are required to perform the screening of the passengers at the time of check in. The passengers need to present a Health Certificate certifying that they have no risk of COVID-19. If any passenger is unable to present such certificate, boarding shall be denied and the boarding pass shall not be issued. 3. Air operators may apply the measure as specified in Item 2 for the screening of passengers from the airport of departure in the countries affected by COVID-19 from the report of the Ministry of Public Health or World Health Organisation. 4. After being satisfied with the Health Certificate and the boarding passes are issued to the passengers, the air operators shall furnish the passengers with Form T8 issued under Thailand\x92s Communicable Diseases Act 2015 and require the passengers to fill out the forms and submit them to the Communicable Disease Control officials at the control post at the airport of disembarkation. 5.

The requirement also applies to Thai returnees from high risk countries. The measure was agreed at a meeting of the Digital Economy and Society Ministry, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, the Immigration Bureau, the Department of Disease Control, Airports of Thailand and five telecom operators. Once the app is downloaded, they will have to fill in the required information - name, surname, passport ID , mobile phone number, e-mail address and present them to the immigration officials on duty . The information will be stored for 14 days after arrival. In the case of a virus-infected person, the information given will enable related state agencies to follow protocols. The state agencies will also be able to trace and inform passengers on the same flight as the infected individual. Digital Economy Minister Puttipong Punnakanta said the measure was meant to reassure both Thais and foreign travellers of Thailand's readiness in tackling the Covid-19 outbreak."

The new flight itinerary should be completed by 31 March 2021. This new policy will allow customers the flexibility to defer their travel plans and applies to all bookings for travel up to 31 May 2020. All rebooking fees will be waived, although a fare difference may apply for the new itinerary. SIA will continue to review its waiver policy and retains the flexibility to extend the cut-off date of 31 May 2020 as it assesses the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on global air travel in the coming weeks. For all new SIA and SilkAir tickets issued from now to 31 March 2020, SIA will also waive change fees. Customers may contact us through our online form via https://bit.ly/2TP42OW .

At least 25% are imported. Recently also quite a number of imported cases. For example, yesterday out of 14 cases , 9 were imported case. Earlier this month, there are few tourists who mis-declared their status. Just to fly into Singapore to seek treatment for their covid-19 . Government says if there is a sudden surge of them, there would not be enough for our citiz ns. This is actually quite true.

About 1,000 continue to travel daily, risking the health of other Singaporeans and residents when they return, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday (March 24). As such, any Singapore resident or long-term pass holder who leaves Singapore from March 27 (Friday), in disregard of the prevailing travel advisories, will be charged unsubsidised rates for their inpatient stay at public hospitals if they are admitted for suspected Covid-19 and have onset of symptoms within 14 days of returning to Singapore. MOH added that Singapore residents will also not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at public and private hospitals. On top of that, work-pass holders or their dependants who leave Singapore from March 27 will be deprioritised for entry approval and could see significant delays before they are allowed to return to Singapore if they persist in travelling abroad and return infected. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...3PeW1lwLQtexL0"
