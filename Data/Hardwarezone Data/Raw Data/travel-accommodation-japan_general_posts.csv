However the place is only opened during certain period of the time per year. I think closed in Dec and only permitted vehicles are allowed in. if u are driving like me, u nd to park outside and change a taxi in. as for olympics, i can say anything but the virus has been spreading into many parts of Europe and middle east as well. dun think the olympics is something on their mind at the moment"

However the place is only opened during certain period of the time per year.
