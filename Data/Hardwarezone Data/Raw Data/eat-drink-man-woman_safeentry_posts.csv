Data collected by TraceTogether, as well as other contact tracing systems, should be used solely for the purpose of contact tracing as several ministers had pledged, said Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai during the debate on the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill. ""As the PSP's Secretary-General, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, has stated, backtracking is not good politics, and it erodes the confidence and social compact of our citizens in our political institutions,"" added Mr Leong. ""The PSP is not objecting to this Bill for the sake of objecting... But to trade off public trust in public health measures - which must be of utmost priority in a pandemic crisis - for public safety in which we are already strong, as evidenced by the much acclaimed crime-solving abilities of our police, calls into question the judgment to make such a trade-off."" The proposed amendments to the law follow an outcry after it was revealed in Parliament last month that the police had the powers to use TraceTogether data for criminal investigations, under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC). Mr Leong asked if this was necessary, given that the police already has ""broad powers"" under the CPC to access documents, people's computers and decryption data for investigation purposes. He also said: ""Besides, I find it quite unbelievable that such criminals would carry their TraceTogether tokens while committing such crimes, especially now that the Government has announced that TT data is accessible by the SPF."" Noting that Singaporeans have ""long accepted some erosion over their civil rights and, by extension, their privacy, in order to ensure public safety"", Mr Leong said that the Covid-19 contact tracing systems, taken together, can compromise privacy quite extensively. ""SafeEntry collects an individual's NRIC, contact numbers, their location whenever they enter a building, and even how long an individual stays in a location, while TraceTogether collects who that individual was in close proximity to, and for how long. ""The two programmes together allow the Government to easily create a map of where an individual goes and who he associates with,"" said the NCMP. He asked when the police first accessed TraceTogether data and how many cases it has used the data for, as well as when the Cabinet was first informed of the use of the data, among other things. When asked by Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah if he would object to the use of TraceTogether data to investigate a child kidnapping, even if no other evidence was forthcoming, Mr Leong said his party's position would not change. He added that his party believes it is more important to prioritise public trust over public safety after weighing the costs and benefits. Pointing to how more than 70 per cent of people had downloaded the TraceTogether app or collected the token as at December last year, he said many had been assured that the data collected would be used only for contact tracing following remarks by Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean. He accused the Government of breaking people's trust and compromising contact tracing efforts, adding that he had come across some people who were now leaving their TraceTogether tokens at home, and others who refuse to use TraceTogether altogether. Stressing that public trust in the Government is a cornerstone of Singapore's political system, he said ""this very same trust enabled the Government to combat and curtail the Sars crisis in 2003, and the H1N1 crisis in 2009"". He said that Covid-19 will not be the last pandemic Singapore will have to face, and warned that any action taken by the Government now will affect trust and confidence in the Government during future pandemics or other unforeseen calamities. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...investigations"

"Bill introduced to spell out use of TraceTogether, SafeEntry data for investigations",1/2/2021 22:47,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/bill-introduced-spell-out-use-tracetogether-safeentry-data-investigations-6458346.html,132309107,1/2/2021 22:09,"An amendment to temporary Covid-19 laws tabled in Parliament on Monday (Feb 1) spells out how the Government is allowed to use contact-tracing data, formalising assurances set out earlier by government leaders on its use.For instance, users whose data is needed for contact tracing or criminal investigations will be asked to surrender their TraceTogether token or submit their data by entering a personal identification number.The Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill was tabled by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, on behalf of Law Minister K Shanmugam under a certificate of urgency signed by President Halimah Yacob. This allows the legislation to be fast-tracked in a single parliamentary sitting. It will be debated in the House on Tuesday. The revelation in Parliament last month that the police may obtain data from TraceTogether, a key contact-tracing tool, for criminal investigations under the Criminal Procedure Code upset some people, as the Government had earlier assured the public that the data would be used solely for contact tracing to combat Covid-19. The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) under the Prime Minister’s Office said that more than 84 per cent of Singapore’s population have downloaded the TraceTogether mobile application or collected the TraceTogether token. With data from these digital tools, the average time it takes to identify a Covid-19 patient’s close contacts has been cut from an average of four days to less than one-and-a-half days. WHY IT MATTERS - The law, if passed, gives legal force to the authorities’ commitments that data from TraceTogether and the SafeEntry check-in system may be used only for contact tracing, except when there is a pressing need to use such data for criminal investigations into serious offences - The draft laws also specify that after the pandemic ends, public agencies must stop collecting contact-tracing data and delete any personalised contact-tracing information collected “as soon as reasonably practicable” - The authorities hope the legislation will encourage the public to continue taking part in the TraceTogether programme by removing any doubt about the purpose and use of the data HOW YOUR DATA WILL BE PROTECTED The law applies to contact-tracing data that will identify an individual. It does not cover anonymised or aggregate data recorded by these systems.It will apply to all data collected through TraceTogether and SafeEntry since the programmes were launched early last year. Under the amendments, any public officer or contractor found guilty of unauthorised use or disclosure of personal contact-tracing data can be fined up to S$20,000 or jailed up to two years, or punished with both. No other law can override this legislation when it pertains to the use or disclosure of personal contact-tracing data.Once the pandemic ebbs, the TraceTogether and SafeEntry programmes will be stood down. WHAT DATA IS PROTECTED There are safeguards in place to protect the data of users. TraceTogether exchanges Bluetooth signals with other users who are nearby to track people exposed to confirmed Covid-19 cases. - The data is encrypted and stored on a user’s device. It is automatically deleted after 25 days - If data is needed for contact tracing or criminal investigations, users will be asked to surrender their token or submit their data by entering a personal identification number SafeEntry keeps a log of a person’s visits to certain public places. - The data is encrypted and stored on a government server. It is also automatically deleted after 25 days - Data needed for contact tracing or criminal investigations will be retained until it is “deemed no longer necessary”, SNDGG said BluePass is a contact-tracing token distributed to more than 500,000 migrant and resident workers housed in dormitories as well as those in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors. - The tokens work similarly to TraceTogether tokens. Users must surrender their tokens if their data is needed for contact tracing or criminal investigations - While the BluePass token is developed by technology firm D’Crypt, which is owned by state investment firm Temasek Holdings, any person who misuses the contact-tracing data will be dealt with under this legislation Parliament must approve the removal of any system from this list of contact-tracing systems covered by the amendment, but the minister may give the go-ahead for more systems to be added. That is because any data added to the list will come with greater safeguards on its use, compared with when it is not on the list. WHAT IS A SERIOUS OFFENCE The police and law enforcement agencies will be allowed to use personal contact-tracing data for seven categories of serious offences: - Those involving the use or possession of corrosive substances, or offensive or dangerous weapons (for example, the possession of firearms or armed robbery with the use of firearms) - Terrorism-related offences under the Terrorism (Suppression of Bombings) Act, Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act, and Terrorism (Suppression of Misuse of Radioactive Material) Act - Crimes where a victim is seriously hurt or killed, such as murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder or voluntarily causing grievous hurt (where the victim’s injury is life-threatening) - Drug trafficking offences that carry the death penalty - Escape from legal custody where there is reasonable belief that the subject will cause imminent harm to others - Kidnapping - Serious sexual offences such as rape or sexual assault by penetration This list cannot be amended without Parliament’s approval. HOW ANONYMISED DATA WILL BE USED As for information collected through TraceTogether or SafeEntry that does not identify an individual, it may be used for other purposes, such as research on the spread and nature of Covid-19 or to monitor the effectiveness of precautions against Covid-19 that businesses have put in place.Although the use of such anonymised data will not be covered under this legislation, public agencies must comply with government instruction manuals and the Public Sector (Governance) Act, which provides a consistent governance framework across Singapore’s public agencies and supports a whole‑of‑government approach to the delivery of public-sector services. https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...ns-and-contact"

For some ppl privacy ish no big deal, for others, the implications that could be as serious as the end of the world to them. As such, only cases where it ish a real life and death, life threatening or equivalent should the privacy of an individual be infringed in order to prevent further perpetuation of the crimes or any more victims from suffering. Preferable, as little ppl's privacy details be implicated as possible(e.g. there were 10 pieces of fully valid evidences, but 1 ish more than enough to nail down the criminal, sho only that would be revealed. Then also ranked based on the person most associated or closely linked to the case. If all evidences are equal, and link/association with the case equal, then heng suay random pick one loh)."
