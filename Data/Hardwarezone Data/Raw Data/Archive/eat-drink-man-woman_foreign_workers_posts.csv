British nationals Helen Ann Sullivan, 31; Joshua Adam Roth, 31; James Riby Oram Trimming, 31; and Edward John Joseph Lee-Bull, 33, pleaded guilty to a charge of meeting others for a non-permitted purpose and without reasonable excuse under the Covid-19 regulations. The other eight people were earlier fined $3,000 each. They are William Edwin Dunford, 32; Richard Henri Lagesse, 31; Lowri Mair Jeffs, 31; Zoe Louise Cronk, 30; Jeff Richard Alexander, 32; Luong Thi Thu Ha, 31; Natalie Joanna Sarkies, 29 and Paul Jonathon Gold, 32. All of them are British except for Sarkies, who is Singaporean, and Ha, who is Vietnamese. Their trip took place during phase two of Singapore's reopening, when only groups of up to five people were allowed to meet outside their homes for social purposes. The court heard that at about 11am on Aug 8 last year, the group took a ferry to St John's Island, before walking to the beach at Lazarus Island. They spent the day there before taking a ferry back to mainland Singapore at about 6pm. Sullivan, Roth and Lee-Bull were represented by lawyer Shafiuddin Ong who originally represented Trimming as well, but he was discharged. Trimming represented himself and expressed remorse for his actions. Mr Ong said his clients were sorry for their actions and ""with the benefit of hindsight, realise the severity of their actions"". He asked that the fines be reduced from the sentences in cases cited by prosecution which occurred during the circuit breaker period, since the gathering happened during phase two of Singapore's reopening. However, deputy public prosecutor Timotheus Koh reiterated that there should be no difference in the sentencing of offences committed during and after the circuit breaker as the regulations still serve the common purpose of ""guard(ing) against outbreak of Covid-19"". District Judge Ong Luan Tze agreed with the prosecution and added that it was ""fair and appropriate"" for the four accused to receive the same sentence as the previous eight."

The other two are 29-year-old Natalie Joanna Sarkies, who is Singaporean, and Luong Thi Thu Ha, 31, who is Vietnamese. The Straits Times understands that the individuals must leave Singapore within seven day upon the revocation of their work passes, subject to appeal.

MOM has revoked their work passes. They were part of a group of 12 people who were on Lazarus Island on Aug 8. The four British nationals were sentenced on Wednesday and fined $3,000 for breaching Covid-19 regulations. Three of them - Helen Ann Sullivan, Joshua Adam Roth, and James Riby Oram Trimming - are 31, and the fourth, Edward John Joseph Lee-Bull, is 33. They pleaded guilty to a charge of meeting others for a non-permitted purpose and without reasonable excuse under the Covid-19 regulations. The Straits Times understands that the individuals must leave Singapore within seven days upon the revocation of their work passes, subject to appeal. Their trip happened during phase two of Singapore's reopening, when only groups of up to five people were allowed to meet outside their homes for social purposes. The other eight persons were earlier fined $3,000 each. Six others from the group were also permanently banned from working in Singapore by MOM last year. Five of these were work pass holders and one was a dependant\x92s pass holder. All their passes had already been cancelled by their former employers before the ban took effect. The six, William Edwin Dunford, Richard Henri Lagesse, Lowri Mair Jeffs, Zoe Louise Cronk, Jeff Richard Alexander and Paul Jonathon Gold, are also British, and all in their early 30s. The remaining two are Natalie Joanna Sarkies, who is Singaporean, and Luong Thi Thu Ha, who is Vietnamese. Those found guilty of breaching a Covid-19 regulation can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...rom-working-in"

MOM has revoked their work passes. They were part of a group of 12 people who were on Lazarus Island on Aug 8. The four British nationals were sentenced on Wednesday and fined $3,000 for breaching Covid-19 regulations. Three of them - Helen Ann Sullivan, Joshua Adam Roth, and James Riby Oram Trimming - are 31, and the fourth, Edward John Joseph Lee-Bull, is 33. They pleaded guilty to a charge of meeting others for a non-permitted purpose and without reasonable excuse under the Covid-19 regulations. The Straits Times understands that the individuals must leave Singapore within seven days upon the revocation of their work passes, subject to appeal. Their trip happened during phase two of Singapore's reopening, when only groups of up to five people were allowed to meet outside their homes for social purposes. The other eight persons were earlier fined $3,000 each. Six others from the group were also permanently banned from working in Singapore by MOM last year. Five of these were work pass holders and one was a dependant\x92s pass holder. All their passes had already been cancelled by their former employers before the ban took effect. The six, William Edwin Dunford, Richard Henri Lagesse, Lowri Mair Jeffs, Zoe Louise Cronk, Jeff Richard Alexander and Paul Jonathon Gold, are also British, and all in their early 30s. The remaining two are Natalie Joanna Sarkies, who is Singaporean, and Luong Thi Thu Ha, who is Vietnamese. Those found guilty of breaching a Covid-19 regulation can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...rom-working-in wah.... really ish sinkie pwn all"

The defendant arranged her to live with three other three in a room with three bunk beds. The moment the defendant met the girl, she was deeply attracted by her. Since the dormitory had tried to illegally spend the night in the dormitory, the defendant would go to the room for surprise inspections. At 4:30 a.m. on the 18th of the same month, the defendant went to the room where the girl was staying for inspection, and saw that the sleeping girl had a hand in her underwear, which made him wonder. Afterwards, the defendant walked to the girl's bed, knelt by the bed, and reached out to lift the girl's panties from the inside of the girl's thighs. At this time, the girl suddenly woke up and sat up. The defendant tried to hide under the bed, but the girl had seen him beside the bed. The defendant kept apologizing, but the girl stood up silently, walked out of the room to wash her face, and then left the dormitory. The prosecutor said in the court that the victim was asleep at the time, and the defendant acted when she was unable to protect herself and should be severely punished. Although the defendant did not touch the privacy of the victim, he lifted the underwear of the victim very close to the privacy. Fortunately, the victim woke up at this moment to prevent the defendant from continuing to commit the crime."

Still 41 hard disks are to be scanned and number of Fake Degrees are likely to be in lakhs. Director General of Police Sanjay Kundu, while interacting with media on Saturday, revealed that the passport of kingpin of the scam Raj Kumar Rana, the chairman of Manav Bharti Charitable Trust, has been revoked and initiated the extradition proceeding to bring back his family from the Australia, he further added. DGP Kundu revealed that investigation teams had visited 17 states, including terror hit Shopian region of the Jammu-Kashmir UT, and booked 8 accused involved in the scam. 2 of them are in Judicial custody. The state cabinet, in August 2008, had rejected the proposal of Manav Bharti Charitable Trust to set up University, on the basis of weak financial ground and lack of experience in the education sector. However, surprisingly same cabinet had given its nod in February 2009 to set up the University. DGP hinted to investigate how trust fulfil the criteria in just six months. Earlier, on 29 January, Enforcement Directorate had attached properties worth Rs. 194.17 Crore of University Chairman and family, which was the biggest-ever attachment of properties of any educational institution in the country in a money laundering case."

It was reported that Manav Bharti University in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh had sold 36,000 fake degrees across 17 states in over 11 years. In fact, of the total 41,000 degrees issued by the university, only 5,000 have been found to be genuine so far. The university is run by the Manav Bharti Charitable Trust, Police have now initiated the process to extradite trust chairman Raj Kumar Rana, his wife Ashoni Kanwar and daughter Aina Rana \x97 both trustees \x97 and son from Australia. The trust operates private universities in the states of Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. It also led to questions if the other universities run by Manav Bharti Charitable Trust are also involved in selling fake degrees. With the news of the extradition, the Indian Enforcement Directorate had provisionally placed the land, houses and commercial buildings of the trust chairman and his family in Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan as well as bank deposits totaling Rs194.17 crore (S$35 million) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The Indian authorities estimated that Rana and his family had amassed property worth Rs387 crore (S$70 million) from the proceeds of the racket. The 36,000 fake degrees issued by Manav Bharti University was said to be only the tip of an iceberg, as the number of fake degrees issued is known to be many more. The scam is likely to run into crores of rupees, said the investigation team. Manav Bharti University graduates found working in Singapore A cursory check on LinkedIn, a popular social media site for working professionals, revealed that there are already a number of graduates from Manav Bharti University working in Singapore: It\x92s not known how they have obtained their degrees from Manav Bharti University. It\x92s also not known if Minister Josephine Teo\x92s Manpower Ministry (MOM) has checked if the degrees of Manav Bharti University submitted by those work pass applicants are genuine or not. It would certainly be good if Ms Teo could clarify the matter in Parliament so that local companies who have employed these Manav Bharti University graduates would have a peace of mind, knowing that the quality of their hires is not in dispute."

The 15 individuals are currently employed in Singapore and had declared qualifications from Manav Bharti University in their work pass applications, said MOM. ""If found to have falsely declared their educational qualifications, their work passes will be immediately revoked and they will be permanently barred from employment in Singapore,"" said an MOM spokesperson in a statement on Wednesday (Feb 17). Employers have the primary responsibility to ensure the ""authenticity and quality"" of the academic qualifications of the foreigners they wish to hire, said MOM. Before making a work pass application, the employer should have already evaluated the candidate, including his qualifications, to ensure the applicant has the right skills and qualifications for the position applied. ""The majority of employers take this role seriously as it is in their interest to have a rigorous selection and recruitment process in place to ensure qualified candidates,"" said the ministry. As an additional safeguard to uphold the integrity of the work pass framework, MOM conducts its own checks and verification after the employer submits the academic documents. ""We scrutinise higher-risk academic institutions, companies and individuals more closely, conduct additional checks and require submission of verification proof of the qualifications declared in selected applications,"" it said. MOM also verifies the authenticity of submitted qualifications directly through the issuing institutions or third-party screening agencies. ""In addition, MOM receives and acts on reports from employers who discover that they have been misled after the work pass holder has arrived."" the ministry added. MOM will revoke the work passes of foreign employees found to have submitted forged documents in their work pass applications. They will also be permanently barred from working in Singapore. They may also be prosecuted under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. If found guilty, they face a fine of up to S$20,000, a jail term of up to two years or both. MOM said in the last five years, an average of 660 foreigners have been permanently barred each year from working in Singapore for submitting fake education qualifications in their work pass applications. Over the same period, an average of eight foreigners each year were convicted and penalised by the courts for false declarations of educational qualifications. curry sauce song bo sleep well tonight"

The 15 individuals are currently employed in Singapore and had declared qualifications from Manav Bharti University in their work pass applications, said MOM. ""If found to have falsely declared their educational qualifications, their work passes will be immediately revoked and they will be permanently barred from employment in Singapore,"" said an MOM spokesperson in a statement on Wednesday (Feb 17). Employers have the primary responsibility to ensure the ""authenticity and quality"" of the academic qualifications of the foreigners they wish to hire, said MOM. Before making a work pass application, the employer should have already evaluated the candidate, including his qualifications, to ensure the applicant has the right skills and qualifications for the position applied. ""The majority of employers take this role seriously as it is in their interest to have a rigorous selection and recruitment process in place to ensure qualified candidates,"" said the ministry. As an additional safeguard to uphold the integrity of the work pass framework, MOM conducts its own checks and verification after the employer submits the academic documents. ""We scrutinise higher-risk academic institutions, companies and individuals more closely, conduct additional checks and require submission of verification proof of the qualifications declared in selected applications,"" it said. MOM also verifies the authenticity of submitted qualifications directly through the issuing institutions or third-party screening agencies. ""In addition, MOM receives and acts on reports from employers who discover that they have been misled after the work pass holder has arrived."" the ministry added. MOM will revoke the work passes of foreign employees found to have submitted forged documents in their work pass applications. They will also be permanently barred from working in Singapore. They may also be prosecuted under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. If found guilty, they face a fine of up to S$20,000, a jail term of up to two years or both. MOM said in the last five years, an average of 660 foreigners have been permanently barred each year from working in Singapore for submitting fake education qualifications in their work pass applications. Over the same period, an average of eight foreigners each year were convicted and penalised by the courts for false declarations of educational qualifications. curry sauce song bo sleep well tonight"

The whole issue now is that the so called university sold fake degrees, presumably to anyone not willing to study but willing to pay. So what MOM seems to be saying, if they declared they had a degree from this place and did not, they would be prosecuted. But if its true that they did buy one of these degrees, looks like its ok as they are indeed a degree holder after all, fake or otherwise. LOL"

The Manav Bharti University is a private university in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, which was exposed earlier this month by local authorities for having sold around 36,000 fake degrees across India for a period of 11 years, according to reports. Of the 41,000 degrees issued by the university so far, only 5,000 have been found to be genuine, one report by the Times of India newspaper said. The university is run by a charitable trust, whose chairman and his family are in Australia. In Singapore, the MOM commenced investigations on the 15 work pass holders, who are still working here, as they had declared that their qualifications had come from the university. The ministry did not identify them or their employers. Said the MOM: \x93Employers have the primary responsibility to ensure the authenticity and quality of the academic qualifications of the foreigners they wish to hire.\x94 Read more at https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...d-fake-degrees"

Could have their work passes revoked In a Feb. 16 press release, MOM said that their work passes will be immediately revoked and they will be permanently barred from employment in Singapore if found to have falsely declared their educational qualifications. MOM may also prosecute them under Singapore's Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. If found guilty, an offender may be jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$20,000, or both. Reports of fake degrees Manav Bharti University is a private university in India. On Feb. 1, Times of India reported that the university had sold 36,000 fake degree certificates across 17 states in over 11 years. This was discovered when the Indian police were conducting an investigation into a fake degree case. It was also discovered that out of the total 41,000 degrees issued by the university, only 5,000 have been found to be genuine so far. https://mothership.sg/2021/02/work-p...TKvX3SyQ_XHb38"

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is investigating 15 work pass holders who are currently working in Singapore and had declared qualifications from Manav Bharti University in their work pass applications. Could have their work passes revoked In a Feb. 16 press release, MOM said that their work passes will be immediately revoked and they will be permanently barred from employment in Singapore if found to have falsely declared their educational qualifications. MOM may also prosecute them under Singapore's Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. If found guilty, an offender may be jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$20,000, or both. Reports of fake degrees Manav Bharti University is a private university in India. On Feb. 1, Times of India reported that the university had sold 36,000 fake degree certificates across 17 states in over 11 years. This was discovered when the Indian police were conducting an investigation into a fake degree case. It was also discovered that out of the total 41,000 degrees issued by the university, only 5,000 have been found to be genuine so far. Employers have primary responsibility MOM said in its press release that employers ""have the primary responsibility"" to ensure the authenticity and quality of the academic qualifications of the foreigners they wish to hire. Before making an application for a work pass, MOM said that the employer should have already evaluated the candidate, including his qualifications. This is to ensure that the applicant has the right skills and qualification for the position they applied. ""The majority of employers take this role seriously as it is in their interest to have a rigorous selection and recruitment process in place to ensure qualified candidates,"" added MOM. MOM conducts its own checks As an additional safeguard to uphold the integrity of the work pass framework, MOM said that it conducts its own checks and verifications after the employer submits the academic documents. MOM scrutinises higher-risk academic institutions, companies and individuals more closely, conduct additional checks and require submission of verification proof of the qualifications declared in selected applications. The ministry will also verify the authenticity of submitted qualifications directly through the issuing institutions or third-party screening agencies. In addition, MOM said that it receives and acts on reports from employers who discover that they have been misled after the work pass holder has arrived. In the last five years, MOM said that an average of 660 foreigners were permanently barred each year from working in Singapore because they had submitted fake educational qualification in their work pass applications. Over the same period, an average of eight foreigners each year were convicted and penalised by the courts for false declarations of educational qualifications."

Still 41 hard disks are to be scanned and number of Fake Degrees are likely to be in lakhs. Director General of Police Sanjay Kundu, while interacting with media on Saturday, revealed that the passport of kingpin of the scam Raj Kumar Rana, the chairman of Manav Bharti Charitable Trust, has been revoked and initiated the extradition proceeding to bring back his family from the Australia, he further added. DGP Kundu revealed that investigation teams had visited 17 states, including terror hit Shopian region of the Jammu-Kashmir UT, and booked 8 accused involved in the scam. 2 of them are in Judicial custody. The state cabinet, in August 2008, had rejected the proposal of Manav Bharti Charitable Trust to set up University, on the basis of weak financial ground and lack of experience in the education sector. However, surprisingly same cabinet had given its nod in February 2009 to set up the University. DGP hinted to investigate how trust fulfil the criteria in just six months. Earlier, on 29 January, Enforcement Directorate had attached properties worth Rs. 194.17 Crore of University Chairman and family, which was the biggest-ever attachment of properties of any educational institution in the country in a money laundering case.

Still 41 hard disks are to be scanned and number of Fake Degrees are likely to be in lakhs. Director General of Police Sanjay Kundu, while interacting with media on Saturday, revealed that the passport of kingpin of the scam Raj Kumar Rana, the chairman of Manav Bharti Charitable Trust, has been revoked and initiated the extradition proceeding to bring back his family from the Australia, he further added. DGP Kundu revealed that investigation teams had visited 17 states, including terror hit Shopian region of the Jammu-Kashmir UT, and booked 8 accused involved in the scam. 2 of them are in Judicial custody. The state cabinet, in August 2008, had rejected the proposal of Manav Bharti Charitable Trust to set up University, on the basis of weak financial ground and lack of experience in the education sector. However, surprisingly same cabinet had given its nod in February 2009 to set up the University. DGP hinted to investigate how trust fulfil the criteria in just six months. Earlier, on 29 January, Enforcement Directorate had attached properties worth Rs. 194.17 Crore of University Chairman and family, which was the biggest-ever attachment of properties of any educational institution in the country in a money laundering case."

"Myanmar helper saw doctor about 2 months before she died, 'nothing adverse' flagged: MOM",2021-02-25 09:56 PM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/myanmar-helper-saw-doctor-about-2-months-before-she-died-nothing-adverse-flagged-mom-6472280.html,132745510,25-02-2021  12:42 PM,"Piang Ngaih Don, the Myanmar foreign domestic worker who was repeatedly assaulted while in the employ of a Singaporean family, was examined by a doctor just about two months before her tragic death in July 2016. She was also examined by the same doctor in January that year. However, ""nothing adverse"" was ""flagged to the authorities' attention"" on either occasion. Physically abused by employer A statement from the Ministry of Manpower on Feb. 24 provided details about Piang's employment with Gaiyathiri Murugayan and her husband Kevin Chelvam, a Singaporean couple. Piang, the mother of a three-year-old son, came to Singapore and began working for Chelvam on May 28, 2015. It was her first time working in Singapore, and Chelvam was her first employer. Straits Times reported that Gaiyathiri was unhappy with Piang's performance, and shouted at her if she felt that Piang was being disobedient. This escalated into physical abuse in Oct. 2015, about four months after Piang began working there. The abusive practices included: Slapping, pushing, punching, kicking Piang and stomping on her while she was on the ground. Hitting Piang with objects like a plastic bottle or metal ladle, pulling her up from the ground by her hair, burning her with a heated iron and choking her. Allowing her to sleep only five hours every night. Piang was also given ""meals"" like bread soaked in water and cold food straight from the refrigerator. By the time of her death in July 2016, Piang weighed just 24kg. Examined by same doctor twice On Jan. 19, 2016, Piang went for her six-monthly medical examination, and passed the examination. In May 2016, MOM said that Piang visited the same doctor for a runny nose, cough and swelling on her legs. According to CNA, regarding the May 2016 clinic visit: ""When the helper removed her face mask and sunglasses in the clinic, the doctor saw bruises around her eye sockets and cheeks, but Gaiyathiri explained these away by saying the victim fell down frequently as she was clumsy. She turned down the doctor's suggestions for further tests of the victim's swollen legs, as there could be underlying conditions."" According to MOM, ""Nothing adverse was flagged to the authorities\u2019 attention on either occasion."" No adverse feedback from Singapore couple's previous foreign domestic workers MOM added that during the first six months of Piang's employment (June to December 2015), Chelvam complained about ""communication problems"" and Piang's work performance. The employment agent offered to replace Piang ""multiple times"", but Chelvam did not take up the offer. MOM also said that during this time, the agent spoke to Piang twice but ""did not pick up on any issues."" Chelvam and his family had previously employed four other foreign domestic workers, but MOM said they did not receive any complaints or ""adverse feedback"" from them. MOM expressed their sympathies to Piang's next of kin: ""The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) would like to express our deepest sympathies to the next-of-kin of former foreign domestic worker (FDW) Ms Piang Ngaih Don. At the time of her death, MOM ensured that a full insurance payout was made to the next-of-kin, consisting of the full death benefit, repatriation cost and a special gratuity payment. Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) had also made a donation to her family and facilitated her brother\u2019s visit to Singapore."" MOM added that it will ""intensify"" their efforts to interview all new foreign domestic workers about their well-being. They will also engage with healthcare providers to see how they can support them to identify cases of possible abuse. MOM added: ""Members of the public who may be aware of any ill-treatment of FDWs, or FDWs facing employment or other issues (may) reach out to CDE or Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (FAST) for help. FDWs can also call the MOM helpline at 1800 339 5505 to speak to an MOM officer."" Manpower Minister Josephine Teo called the case ""appalling"", extended her deepest condolences to Piang's family and said her team had reached out to the family to provide support and assistance. https://mothership.sg/2021/02/mom-my...verse-flagged/"

Prema replied that the victim ""ate a lot"", and * the doctor eventually called the police herself *.

Source @ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath Hippocratic Oath I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant: I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow. I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism. I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug. I will not be ashamed to say ""I know not"", nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery. I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God. I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick. I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure. I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm. If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help."

Case 60432 is a 35 year-old male Bangladesh national who works as a delivery assistant at Chng Woodworking Pte Ltd, and resides in a dormitory located at Kranji Way. His job entails loading and unloading of goods, and he does not interact with clients. He was detected when his pooled COVID-19 test taken on 21 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) came back positive. An individual swab was done on 22 February, and he started to develop a sore throat and cough on the same day. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 22 February, and was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT \x96 the last being on 7 February \x96 were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including his dormitory and workplace contacts, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them. Amongst the 3 imported cases, 1 (Case 60423) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from the UAE and UK.1 (Case 60430) is a Work Permit holder who arrived from the Philippines and is a foreign domestic worker.1 (Case 60427) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from India to visit his family members who are Singapore Permanent Residents. They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN. https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...eb-2021-update"

My BIL house NTUC is just downstairs nia.  With trolley is v easy. For my family we use trolley. 1 shot can do 6 cartons.  150m walk from NTUC.  Fully disabled friendly route. Direct loading from pallet -> trolley.  Go NTUC cashier auntie scan 1 only, she settle the rest.  Paste PAID sticker onto 1 of the cartons.   Push/pull back, gao dim. Parents a bit difficult.  I buy then store at my place first, then daily or alternate day bring back 6-12 packets.  Coz they taking care of my kids and bring/fetch from school and my place is along the way to school (just 120m from sch and 100% along the way).   Just leave at the gate can liao. 100% can finish within a few months.  Low sugar + zero sugar no issue. Main thing is can bring out to malls or outdoor activities, no need to buy too many of those bubble tea stuff, pop into freezer for 1hr and then into the insulated backpack, will stay cool."

Last year also, purchased quite fair bit due to COVID.   I already knew it was gonna be a pretty big deal, so emergency prepped. A lot of people said cannot finish......but can finish one lah......just gotta plan properly, ensure got space to store and only buy the compact storeable stuff.  And plan that you are not buying more than what your family can consume. Like the Nescafe Gao Siew Dai, last year 8.65 for 2 packs and each pack is 15 + 5 packets (20 packets)....which is more than the current year's typical 15 packets.     Last year we cheong and purchased 20 packs (400 individual packets).    Still cld finish before Xmas, no issue. The packets drinks we store in the riser, quite compact to store also, confirm way better than 1.5L types.  Double plastic packaging for protection in addition to the soft drink packaging and straw's plastic packaging, won't be contaminated lah.  No cockroach or pests issue."

The opportunities may include the SGUnited Traineeships programme, which will be extended this year to help fresh and recent graduates gain experience while waiting for the jobs market to improve. On Tuesday (Feb 16), while presenting Budget 2021, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced that the traineeship programme would be extended until March 30 and that allowances will be increased for Institute of Technical Education and diploma traineeship positions. Mrs Teo, who was speaking to reporters on Friday at Tampines Changkat Community Centre after meeting job seekers at a Workforce Singapore job fair for logistics roles, said the aim was to increase the number of company-hosted traineeships, attachments and training positions this year to up to 35,000 from 25,000 currently. She said that fresh graduates would obviously prefer to land a full-time job, but urged them to consider the benefits of a traineeship. ""It is not a dream job. The allowance is certainly nowhere near what you might be able to get with a salary and benefits,"" Mrs Teo said. ""But from the perspective of starting to build up, the perspective of starting to get some real-life skills, from the perspective of being able to say to the next prospective employers that 'I have been in this industry... this job role', these are actually very valuable things that you will not get without being in a traineeship."" The minister said the response from employers on the traineeships has been ""very overwhelming"". So far, there are about 5,400 SGUnited trainees, with some 25,000 positions still available. Mr Desmond Choo, mayor of North East District and assistant secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, who was also present at Tampines Changkat CC on Friday, noted that some SGUnited trainees managed to impress the employer and had their contracts converted into full-time positions.

The Straits Times was at the wet markets in Kovan, Chong Pang and Potong Pasir on Tuesday morning (Feb 9) and some customers said they had to queue for more than two hours. Safe distancing measures did not appear to be observed in some queues. When ST visited the Kovan Market and Food Centre at Block 209 Hougang Street 21 at 10am, a queue of about 250 people had formed from the market all the way to Kovan MRT station, about a three-minute's walk away. Customers said they had been queueing for between one and two hours. A customer, who wanted to be known only as Madam S. Koh, 60, had been queueing for about 1\xbd hours and said this was the first time she had seen such a long queue in more than 50 years. She said: ""I'm not surprised, it's quite expected. CNY is coming. I think people are doing last-minute shopping."" Ms Sera Ho, 62, who works in a legal firm, said the queue was not so long when she visited the market last Saturday. Ms Ho, who usually spends about an hour to do her shopping but took three hours today, said: ""The queue is very long because of safe distancing. They're controlling the crowds so there aren't that many people inside."" Customers told ST that officers from the National Environment Agency were managing the crowd inside the market. An employee from the Aljunied Town Council, who was helping out with crowd control, said around 120 people were allowed into the market at a time. A safe distancing ambassador helping to regulate the crowd at Kovan Market and Food Centre on Feb 9, 2021. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY Ms Doris Lau, 58, who lives in Punggol, said she had been queueing for an hour since 9am. She added: ""I wanted to turn back, but I have groceries to top up."" She said some items she wanted to buy, such as fishballs, had sold out. Housewife Theresa Tan, 73, said she might visit the market in Ang Mo Kio instead of Kovan tomorrow to avoid the queue. She said: ""This is the first time I have queued from the MRT station. I don't know why today is so special."" When ST reached Chong Pang City Wet Market at 9.30am, there were about 95 people in the queue. About six crowd controllers were ensuring that customers adhered to safe distancing measures. Customers had to scan SafeEntry QR codes before being allowed to enter the market and were trying to keep a safe distance from one another. The crowd controllers told ST that only 150 patrons were allowed inside the market and that the barriers would be lifted at 11am. Inside, ST saw a safe distancing ambassador patrolling, together with a crowd controller. Crowd controllers were also stationed at each exit, ensuring that members of the public did not jump queue to enter the market. Accounts officer Neo Bee Leng, 46, who waited about an hour with her elderly mother to enter the market, said that in previous years, the market would be packed and people would have to push one another inside the market. She was concerned about the crowds, especially for her elderly mother, but said she would try to ensure they kept a safe distance from one another. Mr Kelvin Yuen, 50, who owns a fruit stall in the market, said that in previous years, the market would be packed at around 10am. But this year, the crowds have reduced by about half. At Block 147 Potong Pasir, Avenue 1, residents flocked to the mini market. When ST visited at 9.30am, customers were seen brushing past one another inside Jackson Market Shop while more than 20 customers queued to pay without observing safe distancing measures. When asked why she was doing her marketing now and not earlier, Ms Rooba Chevi, 27, who works as a student care teacher, said: ""It was hard to buy earlier as I work on weekdays and the weekend (crowd) is worse."" https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ays-before-cny"

National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay told The Straits Times yesterday that ""it is ever more critical for us to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly, especially in the current employment climate"". He has been lobbying to tighten the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to ensure workplaces are fair and progressive, and to strongly deter unfair hiring practices. The FCF was introduced in 2014 to maintain a strong Singaporean core in PMET (professional, managerial, executive and technician) jobs and requires employers to assess Singaporeans fairly for all job openings. Amid concerns from job seekers in a tough job market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that 47 more employers were recently added to the FCF watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, on top of an earlier 1,200. Eighteen of these firms have foreigners comprising over half of their PMET workforce. Thirty are in the financial and professional services, and were found to have a high concentration of PMETs from single nationalities - significantly higher than their industry peers. Their Employment Pass (EP) applications for foreign hires will be closely scrutinised, and those who are recalcitrant or uncooperative will have their work pass privileges cut back. Mr Tay said disclosing the companies' names will allow job seekers to be better informed. Asked why MOM did not name companies on the watch list, which was first introduced in 2016, a ministry spokesman told ST that it will periodically publicise the names of firms that are found guilty of discriminatory hiring practices. ""For example, in March 2020, MOM released the names of five employers penalised for age-related discriminatory hiring,"" it said. They are: education centre Wisdomtree Learning Centre, events company Outshinerz Events, and security firm Security & Risk Solutions, all of which had indicated preferred age criteria in job ads. Two related companies, Incredible Service Doc and IDOC, granted interviews only to female Chinese applicants under the age of 45. For breaching Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, MOM barred the five firms from hiring foreigners and from renewing the work passes of existing foreign employees for 12 months. Mr Tay proposed two other measures to tackle biased hiring: Remove the exemption for intra-corporate transferees (ICTs), and have tougher measures and penal sanctions against companies that treat the FCF as ""mere window dressing"" or find ways to circumvent the requirements through the use of exemptions. He said: ""This will help level the playing field for Singaporean job seekers, such that as long as they are competent and qualified for the job, they can apply and be considered for the position."" Currently, a job is exempted from the FCF advertising requirement if it will be filled by an ICT. The requirement states that employers must advertise positions for Singaporeans on Jobs Bank - launched in 2014 to facilitate job matching for local job seekers - before they can apply for an EP. To be exempted, the EP candidate has to meet the stringent definition of ICTs under the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, or any applicable free trade pact that Singapore is party to. This includes term limits and a minimum number of years of work experience in the company outside Singapore. Yesterday, MOM said the FCF watch list was introduced to proactively identify employers suspected of discriminatory hiring practices. Through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices' engagement, firms suspected of discriminatory hiring practices will be referred to MOM for investigation and action, it said. MOM added that those on the watch list have to take immediate actions to correct their practices, and will be assessed every six months. ""If they improve on their hiring practices, they will exit the watch list. Only a handful of firms have been put back on the watch list after exiting it."" Calls for tougher measures have been raised in Parliament. Last November, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said the FCF watch list has shifted employer behaviour, but has not gone unnoticed: ""If leading global companies think twice about investing in Singapore or rethink their future plans for Singapore, the result could be fewer good jobs for Singaporeans. So, it is a delicate balancing act."" https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/20...rs-from-india/ ""There is also no quota requirement imposed on intra-corporate transferees, which means an Indian company can hire a whole \x93village\x94 of staff and transfer them to Singapore 6 months later lock, stock and barrel. Furthermore, under Article 9.3 of CECA, all the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 are to be exempted from any \x93labour market testing\x94 or \x93economic needs testing\x94. That means, economic needs testing like Singapore\x92s fair consideration framework which ensures fair hiring of Singaporeans cannot be applied to \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94. To top it all, Article 9.6 even allows the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 to bring in their spouses or dependents to work here too."""

Half her division, she added, was made up of foreigners. A bank executive recounted that the trading floor of the multinational bank where she works is crowded with employees from a particular Asian country, including their family members from the same region in the country . ""How is it possible that (they) are almost always the best person for the job or a promotion?"" she asked.

National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay told The Straits Times yesterday that ""it is ever more critical for us to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly, especially in the current employment climate"". He has been lobbying to tighten the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to ensure workplaces are fair and progressive, and to strongly deter unfair hiring practices. The FCF was introduced in 2014 to maintain a strong Singaporean core in PMET (professional, managerial, executive and technician) jobs and requires employers to assess Singaporeans fairly for all job openings. Amid concerns from job seekers in a tough job market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that 47 more employers were recently added to the FCF watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, on top of an earlier 1,200. Eighteen of these firms have foreigners comprising over half of their PMET workforce. Thirty are in the financial and professional services, and were found to have a high concentration of PMETs from single nationalities - significantly higher than their industry peers. Their Employment Pass (EP) applications for foreign hires will be closely scrutinised, and those who are recalcitrant or uncooperative will have their work pass privileges cut back. Mr Tay said disclosing the companies' names will allow job seekers to be better informed. Asked why MOM did not name companies on the watch list, which was first introduced in 2016, a ministry spokesman told ST that it will periodically publicise the names of firms that are found guilty of discriminatory hiring practices. ""For example, in March 2020, MOM released the names of five employers penalised for age-related discriminatory hiring,"" it said. They are: education centre Wisdomtree Learning Centre, events company Outshinerz Events, and security firm Security & Risk Solutions, all of which had indicated preferred age criteria in job ads. Two related companies, Incredible Service Doc and IDOC, granted interviews only to female Chinese applicants under the age of 45. For breaching Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, MOM barred the five firms from hiring foreigners and from renewing the work passes of existing foreign employees for 12 months. Mr Tay proposed two other measures to tackle biased hiring: Remove the exemption for intra-corporate transferees (ICTs), and have tougher measures and penal sanctions against companies that treat the FCF as ""mere window dressing"" or find ways to circumvent the requirements through the use of exemptions. He said: ""This will help level the playing field for Singaporean job seekers, such that as long as they are competent and qualified for the job, they can apply and be considered for the position."" Currently, a job is exempted from the FCF advertising requirement if it will be filled by an ICT. The requirement states that employers must advertise positions for Singaporeans on Jobs Bank - launched in 2014 to facilitate job matching for local job seekers - before they can apply for an EP. To be exempted, the EP candidate has to meet the stringent definition of ICTs under the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, or any applicable free trade pact that Singapore is party to. This includes term limits and a minimum number of years of work experience in the company outside Singapore. Yesterday, MOM said the FCF watch list was introduced to proactively identify employers suspected of discriminatory hiring practices. Through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices' engagement, firms suspected of discriminatory hiring practices will be referred to MOM for investigation and action, it said. MOM added that those on the watch list have to take immediate actions to correct their practices, and will be assessed every six months. ""If they improve on their hiring practices, they will exit the watch list. Only a handful of firms have been put back on the watch list after exiting it."" Calls for tougher measures have been raised in Parliament. Last November, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said the FCF watch list has shifted employer behaviour, but has not gone unnoticed: ""If leading global companies think twice about investing in Singapore or rethink their future plans for Singapore, the result could be fewer good jobs for Singaporeans. So, it is a delicate balancing act."" https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/20...rs-from-india/ ""There is also no quota requirement imposed on intra-corporate transferees, which means an Indian company can hire a whole \x93village\x94 of staff and transfer them to Singapore 6 months later lock, stock and barrel. Furthermore, under Article 9.3 of CECA, all the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 are to be exempted from any \x93labour market testing\x94 or \x93economic needs testing\x94. That means, economic needs testing like Singapore\x92s fair consideration framework which ensures fair hiring of Singaporeans cannot be applied to \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94. To top it all, Article 9.6 even allows the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 to bring in their spouses or dependents to work here too."" Please don't be Xenophobic. Thanks."

MIW claims that FCF applies to them insofar that they have to apply for work passes and advertise in jobs bank. That much appears to be true however that is just red herring. EP has no limits so telling us that they need to apply for work passes doesn't address the main concern which is there is too many of them. What they also conveniently leave out in their statements is the part on ICTs. ICTs are exempted from the advertising component of the FCF and there are no limits as to the number and the barriers(as stated in the agreement) are seemingly low such that even a freshie in the industry can qualify. Jobs bank is another joke altogether and can be summarized as nothing more than lip service since it doesn't seem to be monitored beyond whether the company posts on it. It isn't only about posting it there. The point of it is to get such companies to actually consider sinkies and eventually hire them. Hands up, how many who used jobs bank before actually received an interview or even a reply(automated one doesn't count)? There is also the question of whether they are applying FCF equally to all or do they close one eye to some? Especially those with strong links to foreign govts. For example, tata consultancy according to 158 started out with only 20% local and even now, only has 40% local. No indication as to what level of position either. Going by mom's standards, tata consultancy should have been put on the list and punitive actions taken against it. But has tata consultancy ever been taken to task for it? Even for those that landed on the list. What happened in the end? Back when cecaland declared ""victory"" that most of their companies were taken off the list. what was the outcome? Did the gahment manage to get them to rectify the issues before removing them from the list? Or they close one eye? It was deafening silence on our end. It is also concerning that MIW's reply to cecaland land's ""no limits and quotas"" interpretation of the agreement was relatively mute. That does not give confidence that they will draw the line and put their foot down on the matter. To summarize, FCF ""applies"" to them but the extent of the application is questionable and doesn't address concerns about large numbers being brought in. That is to say, it looks more like a formality than actual control."

Jobs bank is another joke altogether and can be summarized as nothing more than lip service since it doesn't seem to be monitored beyond whether the company posts on it. It isn't only about posting it there. The point of it is to get such companies to actually consider sinkies and eventually hire them. Hands up, how many who used jobs bank before actually received an interview or even a reply(automated one doesn't count)? There is also the question of whether they are applying FCF equally to all or do they close one eye to some? Especially those with strong links to foreign govts. For example, tata consultancy according to 158 started out with only 20% local and even now, only has 40% local. No indication as to what level of position either. Going by mom's standards, tata consultancy should have been put on the list and punitive actions taken against it. But has tata consultancy ever been taken to task for it? Even for those that landed on the list. What happened in the end? Back when cecaland declared ""victory"" that most of their companies were taken off the list. what was the outcome? Did the gahment manage to get them to rectify the issues before removing them from the list? Or they close one eye? It was deafening silence on our end. It is also concerning that MIW's reply to cecaland land's ""no limits and quotas"" interpretation of the agreement was relatively mute. That does not give confidence that they will draw the line and put their foot down on the matter. To summarize, FCF ""applies"" to them but the extent of the application is questionable and doesn't address concerns about large numbers being brought in. That is to say, it looks more like a formality than actual control."

Since it's about knowledge transfer / tech transfer, 2 years is a reasonable duration to do knowledge transfer / tech transfer? Unless specific industry that is heavily focused on research may have it at a 3 years duration. Such a plan will ensure there is less tendency for entrenchment by any individuals and nationality. The transfer also must exclude the dependent, since this is solely an economic / employment type of agreement, what has it got to do with individual's dependents.

They thought cecaland would be reasonable in this respect like other countries. The last thing they expected was to be called out for it. MIW underestimated just how desperate cecaland land is. They are facing their biggest unemployment crisis which shows no signs of abatement, any surprise that they would be trying to secure jobs for their people even if it means displacing natives in other countries? Another thing to note is that India itself is high on protectionism as well. From what my ceca collick shared with me, they are extremely strict with foreigners when it comes to jobs. It is actually spelt out in their labour laws that the company has to demonstrate satisfactorily first that no Indian can do the job. If people think sinkie is strict, should try looking at India first."

But sb else in edmw beg to differ Savantrainmaker wrote: Many think that George Yeo was responsible for CECA as the FM under LHL's Administration. The truth is that in the late 1990s and early 2000s, India was seen as the 'next big thing' after the rise of China. It didn't helped that many were projecting that India, with its higher population growth and absence of 'Stop@1' baby policy would take over China as the economic power by 2020-2030. Many including LHL bought into this economic thesis. LHL as DPM and Finance Minister in the early 2000s was thus very keen to push through co-operation with India on Temasek's behalf because it was also Ching's 'pet-project' as ED then transform Temasek's portfolio from Singapore-centric to a more regional and global portfolio. But the green-dragon couple's efforts in the early 2000 met with resistance from GCT (as the PM) and LKY (who was still SM in the cabinet). LKY has opined that India will never be as great as China as an economic power. Savantrainmaker wrote: LKY has an deep understanding of India since our common colonial times. He understood that the very 'glue' that is holding the various divisive states of India together - DEMOCRACY - is also the same source of trouble for such a big country. In short, LKY understood that India will have an ""Indian Chiefs"" problem because every state chief wanted a say and safeguard their home states and economic turfs in the Indian parliament. This is contrasted to the autocratic communist system in China where every provincial chief will align with Zhong Nan Ha's decisions or get their whole family 'executed'. So in this sense, LKY understood that China will be able to make country-unified economic decisions faster and be able to developed faster economically. And this is something that India can never achieve, even if they  have double the population of China. In fact, the more population India will have, the more chaotic and disunited it will be because more Indian Chiefs will emerge, literally too. So the more people India have, the messier their problems and slower their progress will be. This is a key strategic cross-cultural economic point that LHL nor his million-dollars yesmen cabinet never understood with his insistence to open up the Indian market."

No wonder must include dependents - 8 years would have been a good time period to try for PR and SC. Thats why the first amendment is to put a time limit of a 2 years deployment max, with no extension. While the transfer post will still be rotated to another internal transferee, at least it reduces the possibility of entrenchment by an individual due to long period of employment here, which also then disincentive the idea of bringing dependents over... Since it's only a 2 years deployment. The other amendment is really to place a limit to the overall number of these transfer positions / head-count in a organisation. So even if they wanna play musical chair, it is only limited to a fixed number of chairs they can rotate around with."

National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay told The Straits Times yesterday that ""it is ever more critical for us to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly, especially in the current employment climate"". He has been lobbying to tighten the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to ensure workplaces are fair and progressive, and to strongly deter unfair hiring practices. The FCF was introduced in 2014 to maintain a strong Singaporean core in PMET (professional, managerial, executive and technician) jobs and requires employers to assess Singaporeans fairly for all job openings. Amid concerns from job seekers in a tough job market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that 47 more employers were recently added to the FCF watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, on top of an earlier 1,200. Eighteen of these firms have foreigners comprising over half of their PMET workforce. Thirty are in the financial and professional services, and were found to have a high concentration of PMETs from single nationalities - significantly higher than their industry peers. Their Employment Pass (EP) applications for foreign hires will be closely scrutinised, and those who are recalcitrant or uncooperative will have their work pass privileges cut back. Mr Tay said disclosing the companies' names will allow job seekers to be better informed. Asked why MOM did not name companies on the watch list, which was first introduced in 2016, a ministry spokesman told ST that it will periodically publicise the names of firms that are found guilty of discriminatory hiring practices. ""For example, in March 2020, MOM released the names of five employers penalised for age-related discriminatory hiring,"" it said. They are: education centre Wisdomtree Learning Centre, events company Outshinerz Events, and security firm Security & Risk Solutions, all of which had indicated preferred age criteria in job ads. Two related companies, Incredible Service Doc and IDOC, granted interviews only to female Chinese applicants under the age of 45. For breaching Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, MOM barred the five firms from hiring foreigners and from renewing the work passes of existing foreign employees for 12 months. Mr Tay proposed two other measures to tackle biased hiring: Remove the exemption for intra-corporate transferees (ICTs), and have tougher measures and penal sanctions against companies that treat the FCF as ""mere window dressing"" or find ways to circumvent the requirements through the use of exemptions. He said: ""This will help level the playing field for Singaporean job seekers, such that as long as they are competent and qualified for the job, they can apply and be considered for the position."" Currently, a job is exempted from the FCF advertising requirement if it will be filled by an ICT. The requirement states that employers must advertise positions for Singaporeans on Jobs Bank - launched in 2014 to facilitate job matching for local job seekers - before they can apply for an EP. To be exempted, the EP candidate has to meet the stringent definition of ICTs under the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, or any applicable free trade pact that Singapore is party to. This includes term limits and a minimum number of years of work experience in the company outside Singapore. Yesterday, MOM said the FCF watch list was introduced to proactively identify employers suspected of discriminatory hiring practices. Through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices' engagement, firms suspected of discriminatory hiring practices will be referred to MOM for investigation and action, it said. MOM added that those on the watch list have to take immediate actions to correct their practices, and will be assessed every six months. ""If they improve on their hiring practices, they will exit the watch list. Only a handful of firms have been put back on the watch list after exiting it."" Calls for tougher measures have been raised in Parliament. Last November, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said the FCF watch list has shifted employer behaviour, but has not gone unnoticed: ""If leading global companies think twice about investing in Singapore or rethink their future plans for Singapore, the result could be fewer good jobs for Singaporeans. So, it is a delicate balancing act."" https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/20...rs-from-india/ ""There is also no quota requirement imposed on intra-corporate transferees, which means an Indian company can hire a whole \x93village\x94 of staff and transfer them to Singapore 6 months later lock, stock and barrel. Furthermore, under Article 9.3 of CECA, all the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 are to be exempted from any \x93labour market testing\x94 or \x93economic needs testing\x94. That means, economic needs testing like Singapore\x92s fair consideration framework which ensures fair hiring of Singaporeans cannot be applied to \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94. To top it all, Article 9.6 even allows the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 to bring in their spouses or dependents to work here too."" CECA summary: Heng (chief negitiator) bent forward, Lim Hng Kiang (MTI) spread his butt cheeks, Pinky (PM) gave the lube to India while George Yeo (FM) clapped."

Basically set a maximum of 2 years employment period per individual transferred here, and after 2 years, the individual transferred here have to go back without any possibility of extension. Since it's about knowledge transfer / tech transfer, 2 years is a reasonable duration to do knowledge transfer / tech transfer? Unless specific industry that is heavily focused on research may have it at a 3 years duration. Such a plan will ensure there is less tendency for entrenchment by any individuals and nationality. The transfer also must exclude the dependent, since this is solely an economic / employment type of agreement, what has it got to do with individual's dependents. Just get the individual here to work for a minimal period, then get back to the home country - instead of bringing dependents here to leech and add on to the strain on public amenities. What India can teach us? They come here is to leech money and teachings. Those better Indian will go to euro or USA instead."

National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay told The Straits Times yesterday that ""it is ever more critical for us to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly, especially in the current employment climate"". He has been lobbying to tighten the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to ensure workplaces are fair and progressive, and to strongly deter unfair hiring practices. The FCF was introduced in 2014 to maintain a strong Singaporean core in PMET (professional, managerial, executive and technician) jobs and requires employers to assess Singaporeans fairly for all job openings. Amid concerns from job seekers in a tough job market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that 47 more employers were recently added to the FCF watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, on top of an earlier 1,200. Eighteen of these firms have foreigners comprising over half of their PMET workforce. Thirty are in the financial and professional services, and were found to have a high concentration of PMETs from single nationalities - significantly higher than their industry peers. Their Employment Pass (EP) applications for foreign hires will be closely scrutinised, and those who are recalcitrant or uncooperative will have their work pass privileges cut back. Mr Tay said disclosing the companies' names will allow job seekers to be better informed. Asked why MOM did not name companies on the watch list, which was first introduced in 2016, a ministry spokesman told ST that it will periodically publicise the names of firms that are found guilty of discriminatory hiring practices. ""For example, in March 2020, MOM released the names of five employers penalised for age-related discriminatory hiring,"" it said. They are: education centre Wisdomtree Learning Centre, events company Outshinerz Events, and security firm Security & Risk Solutions, all of which had indicated preferred age criteria in job ads. Two related companies, Incredible Service Doc and IDOC, granted interviews only to female Chinese applicants under the age of 45. For breaching Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, MOM barred the five firms from hiring foreigners and from renewing the work passes of existing foreign employees for 12 months. Mr Tay proposed two other measures to tackle biased hiring: Remove the exemption for intra-corporate transferees (ICTs), and have tougher measures and penal sanctions against companies that treat the FCF as ""mere window dressing"" or find ways to circumvent the requirements through the use of exemptions. He said: ""This will help level the playing field for Singaporean job seekers, such that as long as they are competent and qualified for the job, they can apply and be considered for the position."" Currently, a job is exempted from the FCF advertising requirement if it will be filled by an ICT. The requirement states that employers must advertise positions for Singaporeans on Jobs Bank - launched in 2014 to facilitate job matching for local job seekers - before they can apply for an EP. To be exempted, the EP candidate has to meet the stringent definition of ICTs under the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, or any applicable free trade pact that Singapore is party to. This includes term limits and a minimum number of years of work experience in the company outside Singapore. Yesterday, MOM said the FCF watch list was introduced to proactively identify employers suspected of discriminatory hiring practices. Through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices' engagement, firms suspected of discriminatory hiring practices will be referred to MOM for investigation and action, it said. MOM added that those on the watch list have to take immediate actions to correct their practices, and will be assessed every six months. ""If they improve on their hiring practices, they will exit the watch list. Only a handful of firms have been put back on the watch list after exiting it."" Calls for tougher measures have been raised in Parliament. Last November, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said the FCF watch list has shifted employer behaviour, but has not gone unnoticed: ""If leading global companies think twice about investing in Singapore or rethink their future plans for Singapore, the result could be fewer good jobs for Singaporeans. So, it is a delicate balancing act."" https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/20...rs-from-india/ ""There is also no quota requirement imposed on intra-corporate transferees, which means an Indian company can hire a whole \u201cvillage\u201d of staff and transfer them to Singapore 6 months later lock, stock and barrel. Furthermore, under Article 9.3 of CECA, all the \u201cintra-corporate transferees\u201d are to be exempted from any \u201clabour market testing\u201d or \u201ceconomic needs testing\u201d. That means, economic needs testing like Singapore\u2019s fair consideration framework which ensures fair hiring of Singaporeans cannot be applied to \u201cintra-corporate transferees\u201d. To top it all, Article 9.6 even allows the \u201cintra-corporate transferees\u201d to bring in their spouses or dependents to work here too."" gahmen was at best farking kum to agree or at worst farking deliberately screwed sinkies having no regard for their lives Sent from Anfield YNWA using GAGT"

Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member): I have two supplementary questions, Madam. I understand that India is claiming that our Work Pass framework, which has been tightened in recent years, somehow violates CECA, or they are saying that they are entitled to allow more workers to come in here. So, can the Minister share with us his interpretation of what India's claims are? Secondly, can the Minister also share Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)'s position on this, and also give us an assurance that the Government will stand up to pressure from the Indians to allow more of their nationals to work here? Mr Lim Hng Kiang: Under the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) that we negotiated, there is an exchange of preferential treatment. In India's case, in CECA's case, one of the privileges we extend to India was to create greater conveniences for business people to move between the two countries, Singaporean businessmen to India, and vice versa. One category is Intra-Corporate Transferees. That means if you got employees that you have employed and you are setting up a business in Singapore, we facilitate the transfer of your corporate employees to help you set up and run the business. Under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) in World Trade Organization (WTO), we grant such Intra-Corporate Transferees, say five years. In India's case, we allow them to do so for eight years. These are the kind of privileges. All these privileges do not deviate from our right to apply measures to regulate the entry as well as a temporary stay. So, the overall immigration and employment rules that we regulate have to be maintained. But where the special privileges are negotiated in the FTA, then, of course, the counter-party will enjoy those privileges. And we will follow these rules strictly. Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song: Madam, I understand the point about the privileges. My question is, are we granting them all the privileges that they are entitled to under the CECA, or are they saying that we are not granting them enough? If it is the latter, would that mean that, effectively, the Indians are asking for more Work Passes for themselves? Mr Lim Hng Kiang: The privileges are clearly delineated in the FTAs and in CECA. As I had explained just now, say, for example, Intra-Corporate Transferees, if the Indians dispute that we are not giving them eight years as we agreed, then they can refer the case to us and, ultimately, there is a dispute settlement process. https://www.facebook.com/geraldgiam....95447267140348"

National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay told The Straits Times yesterday that ""it is ever more critical for us to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly, especially in the current employment climate"". He has been lobbying to tighten the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to ensure workplaces are fair and progressive, and to strongly deter unfair hiring practices. The FCF was introduced in 2014 to maintain a strong Singaporean core in PMET (professional, managerial, executive and technician) jobs and requires employers to assess Singaporeans fairly for all job openings. Amid concerns from job seekers in a tough job market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that 47 more employers were recently added to the FCF watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, on top of an earlier 1,200. Eighteen of these firms have foreigners comprising over half of their PMET workforce. Thirty are in the financial and professional services, and were found to have a high concentration of PMETs from single nationalities - significantly higher than their industry peers. Their Employment Pass (EP) applications for foreign hires will be closely scrutinised, and those who are recalcitrant or uncooperative will have their work pass privileges cut back. Mr Tay said disclosing the companies' names will allow job seekers to be better informed. Asked why MOM did not name companies on the watch list, which was first introduced in 2016, a ministry spokesman told ST that it will periodically publicise the names of firms that are found guilty of discriminatory hiring practices. ""For example, in March 2020, MOM released the names of five employers penalised for age-related discriminatory hiring,"" it said. They are: education centre Wisdomtree Learning Centre, events company Outshinerz Events, and security firm Security & Risk Solutions, all of which had indicated preferred age criteria in job ads. Two related companies, Incredible Service Doc and IDOC, granted interviews only to female Chinese applicants under the age of 45. For breaching Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, MOM barred the five firms from hiring foreigners and from renewing the work passes of existing foreign employees for 12 months. Mr Tay proposed two other measures to tackle biased hiring: Remove the exemption for intra-corporate transferees (ICTs), and have tougher measures and penal sanctions against companies that treat the FCF as ""mere window dressing"" or find ways to circumvent the requirements through the use of exemptions. He said: ""This will help level the playing field for Singaporean job seekers, such that as long as they are competent and qualified for the job, they can apply and be considered for the position."" Currently, a job is exempted from the FCF advertising requirement if it will be filled by an ICT. The requirement states that employers must advertise positions for Singaporeans on Jobs Bank - launched in 2014 to facilitate job matching for local job seekers - before they can apply for an EP. To be exempted, the EP candidate has to meet the stringent definition of ICTs under the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, or any applicable free trade pact that Singapore is party to. This includes term limits and a minimum number of years of work experience in the company outside Singapore. Yesterday, MOM said the FCF watch list was introduced to proactively identify employers suspected of discriminatory hiring practices. Through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices' engagement, firms suspected of discriminatory hiring practices will be referred to MOM for investigation and action, it said. MOM added that those on the watch list have to take immediate actions to correct their practices, and will be assessed every six months. ""If they improve on their hiring practices, they will exit the watch list. Only a handful of firms have been put back on the watch list after exiting it."" Calls for tougher measures have been raised in Parliament. Last November, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said the FCF watch list has shifted employer behaviour, but has not gone unnoticed: ""If leading global companies think twice about investing in Singapore or rethink their future plans for Singapore, the result could be fewer good jobs for Singaporeans. So, it is a delicate balancing act."" https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/20...rs-from-india/ ""There is also no quota requirement imposed on intra-corporate transferees, which means an Indian company can hire a whole \x93village\x94 of staff and transfer them to Singapore 6 months later lock, stock and barrel. Furthermore, under Article 9.3 of CECA, all the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 are to be exempted from any \x93labour market testing\x94 or \x93economic needs testing\x94. That means, economic needs testing like Singapore\x92s fair consideration framework which ensures fair hiring of Singaporeans cannot be applied to \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94. To top it all, Article 9.6 even allows the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 to bring in their spouses or dependents to work here too."" proposed proposed proposed proposed proposed proposed proposed proposed Got use meh?

The familiar phrase ""sinkie pwn sinkie"" used here actually happens in real life where it is called ""office politics"" FTs and FWs will lie low when sinkies backstab each other, and when one of them is almost down, the FT will move in for the finishing blow. Often, when sinkies are fighting it out, what do they need?  Answer: they need support. And this is where they will rope in FTs and FWs to gang up against another sinkie. I can give all sort of scenarios, and I am sure many edmwer can identify with those with real life experience of seeing such things happening.  I, along with many other sinkies, once ""ganged up"" with some FTs and FWs to get rid of a sinkie because that lau chabor had an attitude like she was a laojiao, and she could throw her weight about. Nobody could stand her, and we were glad when she was finally sacked."

However, I have seen it a few times in edmw, members using the word ceca to refer to everyone who is an ethnic Indian.  They'd avoid calling PS a ceca if they are a WP supporter, but if it were Minister Shan, I have even seen words like black dog being used... The racism is so obvious. RK is not even a Malay if the same test is being applied to her as it is applied to our President.  Is Khan a Malay name?  But she, like our President, is accepted to be a Muslim Malay by that community.  Why are those edmwers picking on our President but not on RK?

Guess which way they voted, Brexit or Bremain. OK I know one SGean -a foreigner in UK- chose Brexit. https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion...965-separation Quote: As a Singaporean (and thus, a Commonwealth citizen) now residing in Britain, I was allowed to participate in the referendum, and indeed I exercised my right on polling day, when I voted for Leave. This may come as a surprise to those who know me. After all, I do not fit neatly into the stereotype of the average Brexiter (that is, lacking higher education, of a lower-income bracket and British-born, as a comprehensive analysis of voter demographics from The Guardian newspaper revealed). In fact, you could say I am the very antithesis of that stereotypical voter profile. So why would I vote for Leave when, arguably, I have benefited most from EU membership? Quote: Businessmen and bureaucrats from all across the country warned that the average British family would be thousands of pounds worse off each year - money we could all ill-afford to lose in these challenging and austere times - and a barrage of statistics to support these claims were unleashed upon the public. In contrast, the Leave campaign focused less on facts and figures and more on the intangibles and unquantifiables. Much attention was trained on issues such as national identity, uncontrolled immigration and the democratic deficit that resulted from being part of an European super-state. Thinking about how I arrived at my decision to vote Leave, it's not that I didn't believe the Remain campaign's warnings of economic hardship (although like many of my generation, I have certainly grown mistrustful of politicians over the years). Rather, while there was no doubt that Brexit would be detrimental (particularly to Londoners) in the short term, I had faith in the resourcefulness of the British people to identify and iron out any issues in the long run. Furthermore, I was struck by a number of parallels between the Britain-EU relationship and that of Singapore and Malaysia prior to Separation. In both, there is a lack of a common culture or unified identity. There is a pernicious bureaucracy of the larger economic entity that is holding back, indeed stifles, business and innovation of the smaller territory. I asked myself how I would vote if Singapore were in this situation. I arrived at the conclusion, as Dr Goh Keng Swee no doubt did in 1965, that a painful but swift divorce was preferred to a long and unhappy marriage. Ultimately, while the risk-averse, selfish side of me was inclined to vote for the status quo - to preserve economic stability and to boost the immediate value of my sterling-denominated savings and investments - I was swayed by Leave's uplifting message of optimism that despite the risks and uncertainty, Britain was better off being the master of its own destiny, unshackled from an EU that lacked democratic legitimacy. It was, in some ways, almost a triumph of hope over fear. Upon reflection, I found myself echoing the sentiments of billionaire financier and prominent Leave supporter, Mr Peter Hargreaves, who drew parallels between Britain's exit from the EU and Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965. He noted how Singapore metamorphosed from ""a mosquito-infested swamp"" into ""the greatest economy in the world"" with nothing more than ""people with brains and hands"" , and posited that the British people could rise to the occasion and do the same."

Not back to their countries\x92 economies. Or maybe a form of exit tax. Where at least 60% of their income is captured back to the nation. Meaning to say Employers have to withhold 20% of their income to IRAS monthly. When they terminate their pass Calculation will be done to see their total income earned in SG Less off their total expenses in SG (rental utilities plus a certain % for other living expenses) (Foriegner can choose to declare any other local expenses they have spent) Less off income tax So ultimately a foreigner must have contributed 60% of his income back to SG Else the difference is deducted from the 20% withheld by IRAS. Any underpayment will be borne by employer. This includes income capital in nature"

Rationally, all of us know the difference between: (1)  a construction worker who is building BTOs for us, to whom we are grateful and (2) an IT professional from India who's a graduate, hopefully, from IIT. I think nobody is confused between the two, and nobody is trying to confuse the two categories. However, I can sense that there are edmwers who simply do not like Indians, never mind if they are road diggers, construction workers, IT specialists or bankers.  I asked a forummer upthread...you see how he evaded my question? The other thing we need to be careful with is that the 323,000 FWs staying in dorms, most of whom are from South Asia, do create the impression that there are a lot of CECAs even though they are not. So, even though CECAs are not really that many, the impression we get is that they are. Likewise, there are not as many ethnic Chinese sinkies as we think, our TFR of 1.1 is not a lie, but with almost one million ethnic Chinese jhks in our midst, we don't realise that we have a local worker shortage.  We think that those jhks are sinkies when they are NOT. I repeat my example above. If there are 100K construction workers window shopping in Suntec City, we might think we have a lot of cecas.  If those are jhks, we think they are sinkies.  Either way, we are actually having foreigners just that the Indians stand out because of their skin colour... If we do not like having so many foreigners, then we should speak out against ALL OF THEM, including those from Malaysia, China, the Philippines besides India.  But if we only speak out against ""ceca"" DESPITE KNOWING that they are only 6% of the total migrant population, and if that is not racism, then I wonder what is."

I think nobody is confused between the two, and nobody is trying to confuse the two categories. However, I can sense that there are edmwers who simply do not like Indians, never mind if they are road diggers, construction workers, IT specialists or bankers.  I asked a forummer upthread...you see how he evaded my question? The other thing we need to be careful with is that the 323,000 FWs staying in dorms, most of whom are from South Asia, do create the impression that there are a lot of CECAs even though they are not. So, even though CECAs are not really that many, the impression we get is that they are. Likewise, there are not as many ethnic Chinese sinkies as we think, our TFR of 1.1 is not a lie, but with almost one million ethnic Chinese jhks in our midst, we don't realise that we have a local worker shortage.  We think that those jhks are sinkies when they are NOT. I repeat my example above. If there are 100K construction workers window shopping in Suntec City, we might think we have a lot of cecas.  If those are jhks, we think they are sinkies.  Either way, we are actually having foreigners just that the Indians stand out because of their skin colour... If we do not like having so many foreigners, then we should speak out against ALL OF THEM, including those from Malaysia, China, the Philippines besides India.  But if we only speak out against ""ceca"" DESPITE KNOWING that they are only 6% of the total migrant population, and if that is not racism, then I wonder what is. Still using that chart? I already showed before in another thread that those figures don't hold up at least when it comes to ceca. Figures from India's ministry of external affairs put the figure at 300k which means there are nearly(14%) just as many ceca as there are tiongs here assuming if the tiong figures are accurate in the first place. Secondly, ceca in particular is noted because they have an increasing presence here especially among the pmets unlike other nationalities. More importantly, NO OTHER country has tried to restrict what is essentially our sovereign right unlike cecaland. Name me another country that tried to do so? They essentially stirred **** with us. Trying to play race card again? In case you have forgotten, there were a lot of complaints against the tiongs and pinoys back before the 2011 election and hardly anything about ceca. Why the shift? Because the gahment likes to play ""flavour of the month"". They heard we don't like the aforementioned and assumed we would be ok with more ceca in exchange when the reality is that we don't like too many foreigners regardless of where they come from. We can tolerate more JHK because we share a similar history and culture. However, if the gahment reduces ceca and replace them with more JHK instead, you can be sure that we will shift the complain to them as well. Same goes for any single nationality MIW might seek to replace ceca with after this. If you want to talk about ""racist"" then look no further than your MIW. Did you know as well that MIW was a strict racial quota % policy? They have openly declared their intention to stick to it rigidly because they believe it is essential to preserving stability."

However, I can sense that there are edmwers who simply do not like Indians, never mind if they are road diggers, construction workers, IT specialists or bankers.  I asked a forummer upthread...you see how he evaded my question? The other thing we need to be careful with is that the 323,000 FWs staying in dorms, most of whom are from South Asia, do create the impression that there are a lot of CECAs even though they are not. So, even though CECAs are not really that many, the impression we get is that they are. If we do not like having so many foreigners, then we should speak out against ALL OF THEM, including those from Malaysia, China, the Philippines besides India.  But if we only speak out against ""ceca"" DESPITE KNOWING that they are only 6% of the total migrant population, and if that is not racism, then I wonder what is. Nobody is confused and this edwmer keep mixing with FW with CECA PMET? Did u even read before posting your flawed WOT comment? This thread is about CECA agreement being exempted from MOM fair consideration framework and you chose to paste a newspaper screenshot on the overall migrant statistics. Where is the source how they derive the statistics? Where is the breakdown statistics for PMET?"

National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay told The Straits Times yesterday that ""it is ever more critical for us to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly, especially in the current employment climate"". He has been lobbying to tighten the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to ensure workplaces are fair and progressive, and to strongly deter unfair hiring practices. The FCF was introduced in 2014 to maintain a strong Singaporean core in PMET (professional, managerial, executive and technician) jobs and requires employers to assess Singaporeans fairly for all job openings. Amid concerns from job seekers in a tough job market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that 47 more employers were recently added to the FCF watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, on top of an earlier 1,200. Eighteen of these firms have foreigners comprising over half of their PMET workforce. Thirty are in the financial and professional services, and were found to have a high concentration of PMETs from single nationalities - significantly higher than their industry peers. Their Employment Pass (EP) applications for foreign hires will be closely scrutinised, and those who are recalcitrant or uncooperative will have their work pass privileges cut back. Mr Tay said disclosing the companies' names will allow job seekers to be better informed. Asked why MOM did not name companies on the watch list, which was first introduced in 2016, a ministry spokesman told ST that it will periodically publicise the names of firms that are found guilty of discriminatory hiring practices. ""For example, in March 2020, MOM released the names of five employers penalised for age-related discriminatory hiring,"" it said. They are: education centre Wisdomtree Learning Centre, events company Outshinerz Events, and security firm Security & Risk Solutions, all of which had indicated preferred age criteria in job ads. Two related companies, Incredible Service Doc and IDOC, granted interviews only to female Chinese applicants under the age of 45. For breaching Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, MOM barred the five firms from hiring foreigners and from renewing the work passes of existing foreign employees for 12 months. Mr Tay proposed two other measures to tackle biased hiring: Remove the exemption for intra-corporate transferees (ICTs), and have tougher measures and penal sanctions against companies that treat the FCF as ""mere window dressing"" or find ways to circumvent the requirements through the use of exemptions. He said: ""This will help level the playing field for Singaporean job seekers, such that as long as they are competent and qualified for the job, they can apply and be considered for the position."" Currently, a job is exempted from the FCF advertising requirement if it will be filled by an ICT. The requirement states that employers must advertise positions for Singaporeans on Jobs Bank - launched in 2014 to facilitate job matching for local job seekers - before they can apply for an EP. To be exempted, the EP candidate has to meet the stringent definition of ICTs under the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, or any applicable free trade pact that Singapore is party to. This includes term limits and a minimum number of years of work experience in the company outside Singapore. Yesterday, MOM said the FCF watch list was introduced to proactively identify employers suspected of discriminatory hiring practices. Through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices' engagement, firms suspected of discriminatory hiring practices will be referred to MOM for investigation and action, it said. MOM added that those on the watch list have to take immediate actions to correct their practices, and will be assessed every six months. ""If they improve on their hiring practices, they will exit the watch list. Only a handful of firms have been put back on the watch list after exiting it."" Calls for tougher measures have been raised in Parliament. Last November, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said the FCF watch list has shifted employer behaviour, but has not gone unnoticed: ""If leading global companies think twice about investing in Singapore or rethink their future plans for Singapore, the result could be fewer good jobs for Singaporeans. So, it is a delicate balancing act."" https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/20...rs-from-india/ ""There is also no quota requirement imposed on intra-corporate transferees, which means an Indian company can hire a whole \x93village\x94 of staff and transfer them to Singapore 6 months later lock, stock and barrel. Furthermore, under Article 9.3 of CECA, all the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 are to be exempted from any \x93labour market testing\x94 or \x93economic needs testing\x94. That means, economic needs testing like Singapore\x92s fair consideration framework which ensures fair hiring of Singaporeans cannot be applied to \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94. To top it all, Article 9.6 even allows the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 to bring in their spouses or dependents to work here too."" Ng chee meng. Pls come clean."

TS's cited article for comments/discussions: https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-on-watch-list Quote: A senior labour MP has called on the authorities to disclose the names of companies put on a watch list for biased hiring, to improve transparency and send a strong signal that such behaviour must stop. National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay told The Straits Times yesterday that ""it is ever more critical for us to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly, especially in the current employment climate"". He has been lobbying to tighten the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to ensure workplaces are fair and progressive, and to strongly deter unfair hiring practices. The FCF was introduced in 2014 to maintain a strong Singaporean core in PMET (professional, managerial, executive and technician) jobs and requires employers to assess Singaporeans fairly for all job openings. Amid concerns from job seekers in a tough job market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that 47 more employers were recently added to the FCF watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, on top of an earlier 1,200. Eighteen of these firms have foreigners comprising over half of their PMET workforce. Thirty are in the financial and professional services, and were found to have a high concentration of PMETs from single nationalities - significantly higher than their industry peers."

(Will go search and post it here -if I can find the news) Edit: OK here's something I've found (as reported by Indian media): https://www.business-standard.com/ar...1700123_1.html Quote: Govt decries CECA violation by Singapore The country has imposed restrictions on inflow of foreign workers, which is going to affect Indians working there Nayanima Basu  |  New Delhi Last Updated at February 17, 2013 12:30 IST Those of you planning to make it big in Singapore might be in for a setback. Singapore recently made certain changes to its Employment Pass Framework law to reduce inflow of foreign workers significantly to create more job opportunities for local professionals. The move is expected to impact even those Indians working there at present across various sectors. The amendments, made on a proposal by its Ministry of Manpower, has armed the Singapore government to bring down the foreign share of the total workforce to around one-third while encouraging employers to invest in productivity in return for incentives in the form of tax breaks. The move came as a recent Singapore's policy paper predicted that its population would grow by 30 per cent to 6.9 million by 2030, with immigrants making up nearly half that figure. The paper led to demonstrations in Singapore yesterday, a rare happening in the country, in protest against rise in immigrants. The step has irked India as the new law does not give India a preferential treatment incorporated in the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CECA) between the two countries, operational since 2005. This stance by the Singapore Government is expected to affect Indians working as middle-level managers, executives and technicians. Speculations are rife that India might take up the issue with World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) dispute settlement bod y. However, according to Singapore such a decision was imperative in the interest of the natives as the share of the foreign workforce is rising very rapidly."

Pre COVID-19, many young and middle-aged Singaporeans were still doing relatively well. WP cannot afford to alienate the swing voters by rocking the sampan too hard You can't attribute the vote swing towards opposition in GE 2020 purely to political awakening. Rather, I think the swing was fueled mostly by anger as they are suffering in this crisis, exacerbated by PAP policies such as CECA. Unfortunately, (massive) political awakening is unlikely to happen as long as SGeans remain apolitical (which I feel most SGeans still are).."

National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay told The Straits Times yesterday that ""it is ever more critical for us to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly, especially in the current employment climate"". He has been lobbying to tighten the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to ensure workplaces are fair and progressive, and to strongly deter unfair hiring practices. The FCF was introduced in 2014 to maintain a strong Singaporean core in PMET (professional, managerial, executive and technician) jobs and requires employers to assess Singaporeans fairly for all job openings. Amid concerns from job seekers in a tough job market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that 47 more employers were recently added to the FCF watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, on top of an earlier 1,200. Eighteen of these firms have foreigners comprising over half of their PMET workforce. Thirty are in the financial and professional services, and were found to have a high concentration of PMETs from single nationalities - significantly higher than their industry peers. Their Employment Pass (EP) applications for foreign hires will be closely scrutinised, and those who are recalcitrant or uncooperative will have their work pass privileges cut back. Mr Tay said disclosing the companies' names will allow job seekers to be better informed. Asked why MOM did not name companies on the watch list, which was first introduced in 2016, a ministry spokesman told ST that it will periodically publicise the names of firms that are found guilty of discriminatory hiring practices. ""For example, in March 2020, MOM released the names of five employers penalised for age-related discriminatory hiring,"" it said. They are: education centre Wisdomtree Learning Centre, events company Outshinerz Events, and security firm Security & Risk Solutions, all of which had indicated preferred age criteria in job ads. Two related companies, Incredible Service Doc and IDOC, granted interviews only to female Chinese applicants under the age of 45. For breaching Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, MOM barred the five firms from hiring foreigners and from renewing the work passes of existing foreign employees for 12 months. Mr Tay proposed two other measures to tackle biased hiring: Remove the exemption for intra-corporate transferees (ICTs), and have tougher measures and penal sanctions against companies that treat the FCF as ""mere window dressing"" or find ways to circumvent the requirements through the use of exemptions. He said: ""This will help level the playing field for Singaporean job seekers, such that as long as they are competent and qualified for the job, they can apply and be considered for the position."" Currently, a job is exempted from the FCF advertising requirement if it will be filled by an ICT. The requirement states that employers must advertise positions for Singaporeans on Jobs Bank - launched in 2014 to facilitate job matching for local job seekers - before they can apply for an EP. To be exempted, the EP candidate has to meet the stringent definition of ICTs under the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, or any applicable free trade pact that Singapore is party to. This includes term limits and a minimum number of years of work experience in the company outside Singapore. Yesterday, MOM said the FCF watch list was introduced to proactively identify employers suspected of discriminatory hiring practices. Through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices' engagement, firms suspected of discriminatory hiring practices will be referred to MOM for investigation and action, it said. MOM added that those on the watch list have to take immediate actions to correct their practices, and will be assessed every six months. ""If they improve on their hiring practices, they will exit the watch list. Only a handful of firms have been put back on the watch list after exiting it."" Calls for tougher measures have been raised in Parliament. Last November, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said the FCF watch list has shifted employer behaviour, but has not gone unnoticed: ""If leading global companies think twice about investing in Singapore or rethink their future plans for Singapore, the result could be fewer good jobs for Singaporeans. So, it is a delicate balancing act."" https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/20...rs-from-india/ ""There is also no quota requirement imposed on intra-corporate transferees, which means an Indian company can hire a whole \x93village\x94 of staff and transfer them to Singapore 6 months later lock, stock and barrel.

Singaporeans are highly educated by international standards and are more than capable to perform any junior, middle, senior or even top roles at any MNCs. That 12 years-old Singaporean kid in 2004 grew up to be a 28-year-old struggling to make ends meet by delivering pizzas to FTs still working in the comfort and safety of their homes? What happened these 16 years from 2004 to 2020? Creating good paying jobs and training Singaporeans from scratch is not rocket science. It a matter of resolve and priorities. Fyi, US took just three years of training from scratch and preparation to send their first man into space. And we are talking about the Yanks working with the constraints of 1960s/70s technology, when a whole computer had to be built and house in large buildings. Even our modern day iPhone in the pockets have 1,000,000 times more processing power and 10,000,000 times more RAM. And the Americans just took three years from zero to hero to send a man into space! The LHL's administration has 16 years and they cannot even train up sufficient Singaporean workers to work in those good and well-paid jobs created by giving tax incentives and rebates to foreign MNCs?"

National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay told The Straits Times yesterday that ""it is ever more critical for us to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly, especially in the current employment climate"". He has been lobbying to tighten the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to ensure workplaces are fair and progressive, and to strongly deter unfair hiring practices. The FCF was introduced in 2014 to maintain a strong Singaporean core in PMET (professional, managerial, executive and technician) jobs and requires employers to assess Singaporeans fairly for all job openings. Amid concerns from job seekers in a tough job market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that 47 more employers were recently added to the FCF watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, on top of an earlier 1,200. Eighteen of these firms have foreigners comprising over half of their PMET workforce. Thirty are in the financial and professional services, and were found to have a high concentration of PMETs from single nationalities - significantly higher than their industry peers. Their Employment Pass (EP) applications for foreign hires will be closely scrutinised, and those who are recalcitrant or uncooperative will have their work pass privileges cut back. Mr Tay said disclosing the companies' names will allow job seekers to be better informed. Asked why MOM did not name companies on the watch list, which was first introduced in 2016, a ministry spokesman told ST that it will periodically publicise the names of firms that are found guilty of discriminatory hiring practices. ""For example, in March 2020, MOM released the names of five employers penalised for age-related discriminatory hiring,"" it said. They are: education centre Wisdomtree Learning Centre, events company Outshinerz Events, and security firm Security & Risk Solutions, all of which had indicated preferred age criteria in job ads. Two related companies, Incredible Service Doc and IDOC, granted interviews only to female Chinese applicants under the age of 45. For breaching Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, MOM barred the five firms from hiring foreigners and from renewing the work passes of existing foreign employees for 12 months. Mr Tay proposed two other measures to tackle biased hiring: Remove the exemption for intra-corporate transferees (ICTs), and have tougher measures and penal sanctions against companies that treat the FCF as ""mere window dressing"" or find ways to circumvent the requirements through the use of exemptions. He said: ""This will help level the playing field for Singaporean job seekers, such that as long as they are competent and qualified for the job, they can apply and be considered for the position."" Currently, a job is exempted from the FCF advertising requirement if it will be filled by an ICT. The requirement states that employers must advertise positions for Singaporeans on Jobs Bank - launched in 2014 to facilitate job matching for local job seekers - before they can apply for an EP. To be exempted, the EP candidate has to meet the stringent definition of ICTs under the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, or any applicable free trade pact that Singapore is party to. This includes term limits and a minimum number of years of work experience in the company outside Singapore. Yesterday, MOM said the FCF watch list was introduced to proactively identify employers suspected of discriminatory hiring practices. Through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices' engagement, firms suspected of discriminatory hiring practices will be referred to MOM for investigation and action, it said. MOM added that those on the watch list have to take immediate actions to correct their practices, and will be assessed every six months. ""If they improve on their hiring practices, they will exit the watch list. Only a handful of firms have been put back on the watch list after exiting it."" Calls for tougher measures have been raised in Parliament. Last November, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said the FCF watch list has shifted employer behaviour, but has not gone unnoticed: ""If leading global companies think twice about investing in Singapore or rethink their future plans for Singapore, the result could be fewer good jobs for Singaporeans. So, it is a delicate balancing act."" https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/20...rs-from-india/ ""There is also no quota requirement imposed on intra-corporate transferees, which means an Indian company can hire a whole \x93village\x94 of staff and transfer them to Singapore 6 months later lock, stock and barrel. Furthermore, under Article 9.3 of CECA, all the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 are to be exempted from any \x93labour market testing\x94 or \x93economic needs testing\x94. That means, economic needs testing like Singapore\x92s fair consideration framework which ensures fair hiring of Singaporeans cannot be applied to \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94. To top it all, Article 9.6 even allows the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 to bring in their spouses or dependents to work here too."""

IMHO, no wonder now more and more Singaporean don\u2019t want to give birth to the next generation. Who would want to see their next generation grow up with university degree education becoming Grab Drivers or Foodpanda Delivery? Let's examine what are the ""irreversible damage"" that is already done to the economic capbility of our nation . Government keeps on saying that Singaporeans do not possess the necessary skill-sets for certain jobs that MNCs in Singapore need, so foreigners need to be imported. Ask the critical question that if we keep on importing foreigners, then how can Singaporeans ever be trained to have these skill-sets? And this argument become circular the next time round in the future. Since the MNCs do not take in and train local Singaporeans in these skill-sets, it'll forever use the lack of necessary skill-sets excuse to keep on demanding for the Government to allow more foreigners in. So over time, Singaporeans are not only squeeze out of economic opportunities - to make and spend money within Singapore to strengthen the wealth creation effect domestically ; MANY vital and high value-add economic skill-sets such as business valuation, financial modelling, global trading (all assets classes), algorithm writing, actuarial science, international accounting, cross-borders conveyancing & arbitrage, global risk management, engineering know-how, high vaue bio-tech and pharma research, IT coding etc. will be lost to FTs and their friends. And when an economic crisis arrive, these FTs can go home and retire comfortably. Who's left the re-build Singapore and ensure that we have the vital skills to come back again? Economic crisis will come and go as part of the global business cycles; but with each cycle, the vital national economic skill-sets of Singaporeans become lesser and less valuable because the FTs took away those good global jobs and learning opportunities when times are good and even property and insurance agents drive BMWs. Fresh graduates during those boom times are happy doing those lesser economic value-add jobs because the upfront salary seemed decent. When this goes on long enough till your children's children generation, Singapore will just go into oblivion and into the annals of history as the once bustling port of Temasek II, Singapore - the global city that existed for 100 years and hosted F1s + two casinos."

National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay told The Straits Times yesterday that ""it is ever more critical for us to ensure that Singaporeans are considered fairly, especially in the current employment climate"". He has been lobbying to tighten the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) to ensure workplaces are fair and progressive, and to strongly deter unfair hiring practices. The FCF was introduced in 2014 to maintain a strong Singaporean core in PMET (professional, managerial, executive and technician) jobs and requires employers to assess Singaporeans fairly for all job openings. Amid concerns from job seekers in a tough job market caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that 47 more employers were recently added to the FCF watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices, on top of an earlier 1,200. Eighteen of these firms have foreigners comprising over half of their PMET workforce. Thirty are in the financial and professional services, and were found to have a high concentration of PMETs from single nationalities - significantly higher than their industry peers. Their Employment Pass (EP) applications for foreign hires will be closely scrutinised, and those who are recalcitrant or uncooperative will have their work pass privileges cut back. Mr Tay said disclosing the companies' names will allow job seekers to be better informed. Asked why MOM did not name companies on the watch list, which was first introduced in 2016, a ministry spokesman told ST that it will periodically publicise the names of firms that are found guilty of discriminatory hiring practices. ""For example, in March 2020, MOM released the names of five employers penalised for age-related discriminatory hiring,"" it said. They are: education centre Wisdomtree Learning Centre, events company Outshinerz Events, and security firm Security & Risk Solutions, all of which had indicated preferred age criteria in job ads. Two related companies, Incredible Service Doc and IDOC, granted interviews only to female Chinese applicants under the age of 45. For breaching Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, MOM barred the five firms from hiring foreigners and from renewing the work passes of existing foreign employees for 12 months. Mr Tay proposed two other measures to tackle biased hiring: Remove the exemption for intra-corporate transferees (ICTs), and have tougher measures and penal sanctions against companies that treat the FCF as ""mere window dressing"" or find ways to circumvent the requirements through the use of exemptions. He said: ""This will help level the playing field for Singaporean job seekers, such that as long as they are competent and qualified for the job, they can apply and be considered for the position."" Currently, a job is exempted from the FCF advertising requirement if it will be filled by an ICT. The requirement states that employers must advertise positions for Singaporeans on Jobs Bank - launched in 2014 to facilitate job matching for local job seekers - before they can apply for an EP. To be exempted, the EP candidate has to meet the stringent definition of ICTs under the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, or any applicable free trade pact that Singapore is party to. This includes term limits and a minimum number of years of work experience in the company outside Singapore. Yesterday, MOM said the FCF watch list was introduced to proactively identify employers suspected of discriminatory hiring practices. Through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices' engagement, firms suspected of discriminatory hiring practices will be referred to MOM for investigation and action, it said. MOM added that those on the watch list have to take immediate actions to correct their practices, and will be assessed every six months. ""If they improve on their hiring practices, they will exit the watch list. Only a handful of firms have been put back on the watch list after exiting it."" Calls for tougher measures have been raised in Parliament. Last November, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said the FCF watch list has shifted employer behaviour, but has not gone unnoticed: ""If leading global companies think twice about investing in Singapore or rethink their future plans for Singapore, the result could be fewer good jobs for Singaporeans. So, it is a delicate balancing act."" https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/20...rs-from-india/ ""There is also no quota requirement imposed on intra-corporate transferees, which means an Indian company can hire a whole \x93village\x94 of staff and transfer them to Singapore 6 months later lock, stock and barrel. Furthermore, under Article 9.3 of CECA, all the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 are to be exempted from any \x93labour market testing\x94 or \x93economic needs testing\x94. That means, economic needs testing like Singapore\x92s fair consideration framework which ensures fair hiring of Singaporeans cannot be applied to \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94. To top it all, Article 9.6 even allows the \x93intra-corporate transferees\x94 to bring in their spouses or dependents to work here too."" This was actually quite significant to be honest. And Patrick Tay's heart is in the right place, albeit with little power."

If many unemployed has 3-5 years experience, do you still want to take up such a low level and low paid job? Talk about upskilling, this just moves us backward rather than moving us to a higher level."

In the end, the FTs benefited by having a higher salary. Bad move by MOM"

Just put the local graduates to intern with these EPs for the next 6 months, with the INTENTION of replacing them. All the internship/traineeship salary will be paid by MOM, subsequently after replacing these EPs, the company can decide to pay them whatever salary they deem fit. Suggestion 2: They should have a 2 year notice to inform employers that these FTs cannot rehire anymore So employer have to go through smooth transition for them Suggestion 3: All companies accepting any kind of support from government should not be eligible to apply for S-pass or E-pass. The S-pass quota should depend solely in the number of citizens that company has, not both citizens and PRs. Suggestion 4: (my contribution) Instead of MOH employing Safe distancing ambassadors, get MOM to employ ""interview ambassadors (IAs)"". As employers must post in Jobs bank before they apply for EPs, the IAs will then sit in in all interviews for these positions together with the employer's HR/hiring manager. The IAs can then give an independent judgement on whether the job can go to a Sinkie or an EP must be issue to a foreigner. Can also make this applicable for EP renewals."

Just have a minimum living wage levy on every EP hired. The levy can be used to create a fund to cushion the impact of Singaporeans who lost jobs, level the playing field for minimum living wage of a Singaporean vs a EP and also make it hard for HR that do not want to develop a Singapore core to justify to their bosses why a EP is hired instead of a Singaporean. The returning of minimum living wage levy by the EP to the company will leave the EP with not have much wages left unless he/she is valuable enough for the company to pay top dollar. This will deter unqualified EPs from disrupting the job market and allow only the true foreign talent to work in Singapore. COVID 19 is a golden opportunity to implement this because travel restriction will limit the inflow of EP and JSS will make hiring a Singaporean even more attractive."

First, FTs on employment passes (EP-pass) earning more than $3,600 per month are not subjected to quota. That's why some firms when you walk in, can only see 100% FTs. Second, the FT recruit their own FTs situation in Singapore now is endemic, especially in MNCs firms with good skills training and career prospects, where Singaporeans get slim or no chance to get in because MoM almost always approve the FTs' ep-passes application within 7 days! Even those rejected ones on the surface will still get the Ep-pass approved after ONE appeal, by justifying that they had been looking for Singaporeans in the WDA Job Bank and no good-fit Singaporeans could be found. Third, Singapore is not with ZERO jobs today. Just take a look at the WDA Job Banks, there are close to 69,000 vacancies in there everyday - all waiting for the 14 days 'advertisement period' to 'expire' before the companies are eligible to apply for an employment pass for their internally decided FTs.

Fact is that foreigners are paying more income tax than Singaporeans in their own country today. I have said this before; Singapore cannot have an economy consisting of 40% foreign labour who accounts for 55% of the income tax paid year-on-year. Whilst, spin doctors under the LHL's Administration would declare proudly that HALF of Singaporeans DO NOT NEED to pay income taxes, it simply means 50% of Singaporeans are either jobless or earn less than S$20,000 per year (circa $1,700 per month) . Last checked, compared to a Singapore citizen, foreigners in Singapore do not need to pay any extra income tax given the same earning power, nor do foreigners need to pay any National Service / National Defence taxes on their income earned in Singapore. Then why is it that foreigners in Singapore account for a much bigger percentage of the Singapore's total income taxes collected vis-a-vis local Singaporean income taxpayers? So if foreigners are earning more than Singaporeans (since they are paying proportionately more income tax than Singapore citizens); do they also spend more of their disposable income in Singapore to create a bigger wealth-creation effect in the larger domestic economy? Or do FTs remit a large amount of the money earned in Singapore out and back to their home countries to build up their own domestic economies to be Singapore's competition tomorrow? This is an unsustainable model because Singapore's core global competitive advantage is our own highly educated and productive labour force; if Singapore do not develop our own youth labour force today and give them the MNCs training opportunities and exposures, this group of youths today will become the burdens of our country tomorrow. Worse, we are allowing massive capital outflow and training up the foreign labour force of our competitors who with much more land, more capital and cheaper cost of living can easily replace Singapore's position as a regional hub as geographical distance becomes negligible in the next internet-age. Singaporeans as a whole need to think about the answers to such questions. I think we must also understand why MNCs choose Singapore in the first place. MNCs are here because there's business to be done in the region, because they need a hub office in a similar time zone to serve their customers, and because of the tax arrangements Singapore provides, whether it's incentives or DTAs. What is lacking is not labour force competitiveness - singapore has never been that much of an outlier in this aspect, whether positively or negatively."

If anything, MNCs are having the best of both worlds at Singapore and Singaporeans' expense, by enjoying ultra-low international corporate taxes as well as parachuting their own people and own networks to enjoy the low personal income taxes they cannot find anywhere else in the world. The LHL's administration had allowed them to have cake and eat it. And have Singaporeans clean up after them! Low personal income taxes for foreigners earning high salary in Singapore. Compared to HK's headline personal income tax rate of 17%; Singapore's 20% for income above $320,000 seemed much higher to the uneducated. But in actual practice Singapore\x92s net effective personal income tax rate is much lower than that of Hong Kong\x92s. For example, a person earning US$65,000 in Hong Kong would end up paying close to US$6,500 in personal income tax. Whereas in Singapore, he or she would only have to pay approximately US$4,000 - as a foreigner or local all the same. Low corporate taxes for booking MNCs profits . Headline tax rate of 17% is already one of the lowest in the world. But in practice it could go even lower to 5%-10% for some with special tax incentives, without evening needing to employ a Singaporean core. The headline corporate tax rate in Singapore again does not necessarily provide an accurate indication of the effective corporate tax rate. The LHL's administration had been giving away many applicable tax exemptions and tax incentives, depreciation rules to drastically reduce the effective tax rates for companies in Singapore when compared to the corporate tax rate payable in Hong Kong. Effective corporate tax rate for Singapore private limited companies for profits up to $300,000 is capped at 17% for profits above $300,000. However, newly-setup Singapore incorporated start-ups enjoy full tax exemption on the first $100,000 in profits earned for 3 consecutive years and 50% off the next $200,000. With effect from 2010, the LHL's administration has updated its partial and full-tax exemption schemes for start-ups as well, allowing start-ups to enjoy either Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rebates or SME cash grants. Moreover the LHL's administration has also introduced many industry-specific tax incentives to encourage foreign investment and growth of the targeted industries in Singapore. This tax structure allows foreigners to start and set up operations in Singapore to reap the double-benefits of ultra-low personal income and corporate taxes. Finally, the icing on the cake for foreigners - no national service obligations for foreigners working in Singapore; nor is that any extra taxes being levied on foreigners for the defence and security of this country."

Why MOM continues to issue/renew EPs while sinkies are asked to go for internship/traineeship???,08-02-2021 06:44 AM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/why-mom-continues-issue-renew-eps-while-sinkies-asked-go-internship-traineeship-6330306.html,131625026,27-12-2020  09:24 PM,"PlayDough wrote: You are right as hell. I just moved into Duo Residence early this year and most of my neighbors are FTs on working visas here. I would say around 70%. Shocking but real. And the older generation are still thinking FTs are cheaper, better and faster. Fact is that foreigners are paying more income tax than Singaporeans in their own country today. I have said this before; Singapore cannot have an economy consisting of 40% foreign labour who accounts for 55% of the income tax paid year-on-year. Whilst, spin doctors under the LHL's Administration would declare proudly that HALF of Singaporeans DO NOT NEED to pay income taxes, it simply means 50% of Singaporeans are either jobless or earn less than S$20,000 per year (circa $1,700 per month) . Last checked, compared to a Singapore citizen, foreigners in Singapore do not need to pay any extra income tax given the same earning power, nor do foreigners need to pay any National Service / National Defence taxes on their income earned in Singapore. Then why is it that foreigners in Singapore account for a much bigger percentage of the Singapore's total income taxes collected vis-a-vis local Singaporean income taxpayers? So if foreigners are earning more than Singaporeans (since they are paying proportionately more income tax than Singapore citizens); do they also spend more of their disposable income in Singapore to create a bigger wealth-creation effect in the larger domestic economy? Or do FTs remit a large amount of the money earned in Singapore out and back to their home countries to build up their own domestic economies to be Singapore's competition tomorrow? This is an unsustainable model because Singapore's core global competitive advantage is our own highly educated and productive labour force; if Singapore do not develop our own youth labour force today and give them the MNCs training opportunities and exposures, this group of youths today will become the burdens of our country tomorrow. Worse, we are allowing massive capital outflow and training up the foreign labour force of our competitors who with much more land, more capital and cheaper cost of living can easily replace Singapore's position as a regional hub as geographical distance becomes negligible in the next internet-age. Singaporeans as a whole need to think about the answers to such questions."

The case is a 28-year-old Bangladeshi work permit holder who lives in a dormitory at 43 Tech Park Crescent. He was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Apr 12 last year, and on Jan 25 this year, he tested positive again. ""He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH\x92s surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their postinfection immunity,"" said the ministry. When the man was confirmed to have had COVID-19 last year, he was identified as Case 2513 and was part of the cluster of infections at Tech Park Crescent dormitory, which is located at 43 Tech Park Crescent. He recovered from that infection and tested negative for COVID-19 from last June onwards. However, the man tested positive for COVID-19 once again on Jan 25 this year and he was isolated. ""Numerous repeat tests conducted subsequently were also positive for the virus,"" said MOH on Saturday. The man's new infection was not previously stated in the ministry's situation reports.

On Saturday (Feb 6), MOH said the 28 year-old male Bangladeshi national holds a work permit and resides in a dormitory at 43 Tech Park Crescent. He had been confirmed to have Covid-19 infection on April 12 last year and subsequently recovered, consistently testing negative for the infection from June onwards. But on Jan 25, his test result came back positive for Covid-19 infection, and he was isolated. Numerous repeat tests conducted subsequently were also positive for the virus. He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH's surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their post-infection immunity. He reported that he felt unwell on Jan 22 and 23, but was otherwise asymptomatic. MOH said that while reinfection is rare, the expert panel, which comprises infectious diseases and microbiology experts from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital and the National Public Health Laboratory, assessed that the clinical and laboratory evidence suggests this is a likely case of re-infection. MOH added: ""In addition to his positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results, there was a corresponding marked increase in antibody titres compared to the period prior to the likely re-infection, suggesting that he was exposed to a new infection which boosted his antibody levels."" It also noted that the virus detected in his samples taken in January this year is also genetically distinct from that associated with the dormitories outbreak last year, suggesting this is likely a different and new infection. ""MOH will continue to closely monitor recovered Covid-19 cases to determine their post-infection immunity. So far, there is no indication that recovered workers in the dormitories have significant loss of post-infection immunity,"" MOH said. On Saturday, MOH reported 26 new cases, all imported. There were no new cases of locally-transmitted infection. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from three cases in the week before to one case in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased from two cases in the week before to one case in the past week."

""He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH\x92s surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their postinfection immunity,"" said the ministry. The man was first confirmed to have had COVID-19 on Apr 12 last year and was identified as Case 2513. He recovered from the infection and tested negative for COVID-19 from last June onwards. However, the man tested positive for COVID-19 once again on Jan 25 this year, and he was isolated. Multiple repeat tests were conducted subsequently and were also positive, MOH said. The man reported feeling unwell on Jan 22 and 23, but was otherwise asymptomatic, said MOH. He is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and all his identified close contacts have been isolated and quarantined. None have tested positive for COVID-19 so far. \x93While re-infection is rare, the expert panel, which comprises infectious diseases and microbiology experts from NCID, Singapore General Hospital and the National Public Health Laboratory, has assessed that the clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that this is a likely case of re-infection,\x94 MOH said. \x93In addition to his positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results, there was a corresponding marked increase in antibody titres compared to the period prior to the likely re-infection, suggesting that he was exposed to a new infection which boosted his antibody levels. \x93The virus detected in his samples taken in January 2021 is also genetically distinct from that associated with the dormitories outbreak in 2020, suggesting that this is likely a different and new infection.\x94 MOH said that it will continue to monitor recovered COVID-19 cases to determine their post-infection immunity. No significant loss of post-infection immunity has been detected among recovered workers in dormitories so far."

Could be due to weather, virus circulating now not so potent, we\u2019ve all acquired antibody but didn\u2019t know, or whatever. But we should just stay safe. At worldwide level, COVID aka SARS 2, is different from SARS 2003. That time they said A pass to B, B to C, C to D, then E, will see the virus effect diminish (lower mortality rate). Hence it suddenly disappeared. This time, it mutates and both UK and US CDC are saying B117 is more deadly. The scientists did cover backside and said need more data to confirm. Now UK found E484K, meaning virus still mutating. So far only hear UK scientists release a lot of new info. Read one thread here saying this country has achieved herd immunity while UK/US said virus is mutating. Cannot be virus only mutate in UK, right? So dangerous to believe countries that talk rubbish and import their people indiscreetly. MOH has to continue to work very hard even though they have done well to date. No end in sight yet."

His job does not entail interaction with flight passengers.* He developed a cough on 2 February but did not seek medical attention and continued to go to work . As he had been identified earlier as a contact of a tuberculosis (TB) case at his workplace, he went to the Tuberculosis Control Unit on 4 February for TB screening. There, he was tested for COVID-19 after he reported his symptoms.* His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier test from a testing operation of airport cargo workers on 18 January had been negative for COVID-19 infection. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection."

Quote: Case 59629 is a 19 year-old female Singaporean who returned from the UK on 6 December and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 20 December. Her swab done on 16 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19. She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 23 January in preparation for her return to the UK. Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Her Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and her serology test result has also come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported based on her travel history .

There, he was tested for COVID-19 after he reported his symptoms.* His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier test from a testing operation of airport cargo workers on 18 January had been negative for COVID-19 infection.

Incidentally, FDWs (maids) and confinement nannies have to do on-arrival serology test. But not the rest, meaning, work permit holders, PRs, citizens, dependent pass holders, etc. I can only guess the others may jjww if asked to pay more. If maids get infected, the whole family are at risk, and we are talking about many pregnant ladies, young children and old people. Quote: To further reduce the risk of transmission from newly arrived migrant workers into the workplace, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has decided to extend the post-Stay-Home Notice (SHN) 7-day testing regime to all newly arrived Work Permit and S Pass workers in Construction, Marine and Process (CMP) sectors from higher-risk countries/regions1. Previously only those headed to dormitories needed to be subject to the additional 7-days testing. MTF has also decided on mandatory On-Arrival Serology test for foreign domestic workers (FDW) and confinement nannies (CN) who have recent travel history to higher-risk countries/regions . The additional test will help to identify FDWs who have recovered from an old infection and can therefore be released early from SHN in Singapore. https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/pres...oreign-workers"
