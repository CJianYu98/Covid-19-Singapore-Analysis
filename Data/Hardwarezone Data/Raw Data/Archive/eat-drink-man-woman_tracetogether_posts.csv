This task force is co-chaired by Minister for Health, Gan Kim Yong (Gan), and former Minister for National Development (and current Minister for Education), Lawrence Wong (Wong). Given that the vaccination exercise falls within the ambit of the taskforce, why have neither Wong nor Gan issued a public statement? Surely, it falls within their ministerial portfolios and ambits to reassure the public and be accountable for mistakes? Why hasn\x92t there been a press conference where both Wong and Gan are available to answer questions on this error? Collectively, are Madam Ho, Gan and Wong trying to deflect from the mistakes that have been made? While the Ministry of Health (MOH) has said that clinical trial data from Pfizer-BioNTech has indicated that receiving more than the recommended dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is*unlikely to be harmful,*shouldn\x92t Gan, as head of MOH be fronting such a statement as opposed to a generic statement from the ministry? At the end of the day, the crux of the issue is not about the fact that a mistake has been made. Rather, it is a case of how that mistake has been dealt with. The vaccination process involves all Singaporeans and is most definitely a public interest issue. The fact that the Government took nearly a month to disclose the occurrence of this mistake is in itself a red flag. The deafening silence of both Gan and Wong only serves to cause further disquiet. Madam Ho now chiming in to seemingly dismiss the enormity of the error is surely adding insult to injury. The lateness of disclosure, the lack of proper ownership from those in charge and the apparent attempt to dismiss the enormity of the error could create the impression that those in power are hoping to sweep the matter under the carpet. https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2021/02/09/ho-ching-appears-to-defend-snec-mistake-while-lawrence-wong-and-gan-kim-yong-remain-silent/"

And then, election into the ruling People\x92s Action Party (PAP), the highest decision-making body for the first time, the Central Executive Committee. Added to this is a much-commended performance in the unenviable job of co-steering the multi-ministry task force assigned to address the myriad of problems stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. All this has led to speculation that Education Minister Lawrence Wong may be in the running to be Prime Minister of Singapore in the future, according to an article in the South China Morning Post (SCMP). The 47-year-old Mr Wong was the subject of a profile in a \x93Lunch With Sumiko\x94 column, wherein the Education Minister sat down to a meal with the executive editor of ST, Sumiko Tan, that highlighted his monumental task of leading the team that managed the pandemic. Early in the article Ms Tan wrote, \x93He has a reputation among civil servants for being a smart, serious guy who gets the job done. A teary moment in Parliament in March, while he was paying tribute to front-liners, humanised him. Some political pundits now say he could well be a contender for prime minister one day.\x94 And the SCMP article, published before the PAP\x92s biennial conference, said that pundits are looking for \x93any clues on the party\x92s thinking about education minister Lawrence Wong.\x94 In the article, Mr Wong was praised for his handling of the pandemic by the director at the Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Lawrence Loh, who is quoted as saying he has a \x93steady hand with clear articulation skills\x94. Even more compelling was a quote from former PAP MP Inderjit Singh, who said that Mr Wong was \x93emerging as a potential choice as a future PM\x94. According to Bilveer Singh, a political scientist with the NUS, Mr Wong \x93is being tested in different portfolios and is definitely in the running for the post of the prime minister in the near future.\x94 Mr Inderjit Singh and others added that if Mr Wong is among those included as an elected CEC member, this could open doors for him to take even bigger roles in the party. And elected to the CEC he was, for the first time, along with National Development Minister Desmond Lee. The two men join Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, Parliamentary Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin and Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan as the top 12 nominees voted by more than 2,000 party cadres for a 2-year term. Minister in the Prime Minister\x92s Office Indranee Rajah and Manpower Minister Josephine Teo, who received the 13th and 14th highest number of votes, respectively, have also been co-opted into the CEC. Writing about his election into the CEC in a Facebook post on Sunday (Nov 8), Mr Wong said, \x93We have lots to do in the coming years \x96 to steer Singapore through this pandemic, and to continue our never-ending of building a fairer, more equal and just society. I will do my best to serve. The challenges ahead are great. But we will walk this journey alongside every Singaporean. Join us to make a difference and build a better Singapore together!\x94 \x97/TISG"

Even more compelling was a quote from former PAP MP Inderjit Singh, who said that Mr Wong was \x93emerging as a potential choice as a future PM\x94. According to Bilveer Singh, a political scientist with the NUS, Mr Wong \x93is being tested in different portfolios and is definitely in the running for the post of the prime minister in the near future.\x94 Mr Inderjit Singh and others added that if Mr Wong is among those included as an elected CEC member, this could open doors for him to take even bigger roles in the party. And elected to the CEC he was, for the first time, along with National Development Minister Desmond Lee. The two men join Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, Parliamentary Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin and Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan as the top 12 nominees voted by more than 2,000 party cadres for a 2-year term. Minister in the Prime Minister\x92s Office Indranee Rajah and Manpower Minister Josephine Teo, who received the 13th and 14th highest number of votes, respectively, have also been co-opted into the CEC. Writing about his election into the CEC in a Facebook post on Sunday (Nov 8), Mr Wong said, \x93We have lots to do in the coming years \x96 to steer Singapore through this pandemic, and to continue our never-ending of building a fairer, more equal and just society. I will do my best to serve. The challenges ahead are great. But we will walk this journey alongside every Singaporean. Join us to make a difference and build a better Singapore together!\x94 \x97/TISG"

This is called stupidity. Even if he didn't say it nobody would have expected a guarantee from the government on SERS. At most, they'll just be anticipating and hoping for one. But he is big mouth and said that value will go to zero, causing big panic among owners who still have a good 60 years of lease ahead of them.

Singtel has completed initial investigations into the breach and established which files on the Accellion file transfer appliance (FTA) were accessed illegally, the company said in a news release. READ: Singtel third-party vendor hacked, customer information 'may have been compromised' The personal information taken includes about 129,000 customers' NRIC numbers and a combination of names, dates of birth, mobile numbers and addresses, said Singtel. In addition, bank account details of 28 former Singtel employees and credit card details of 45 staff members of a corporate customer with Singtel mobile lines were taken. ""Some information"" from 23 enterprises, including suppliers, partners and corporate customers, was also stolen. The company has started notifying all affected individuals and enterprises to help them and their staff manage the possible risks involved and take appropriate follow-up action, it said. Singtel's Group CEO Yuen Kuan Moon said: ""While this data theft was committed by unknown parties, I\x92m very sorry this has happened to our customers and apologise unreservedly to everyone impacted. ""Data privacy is paramount, we have disappointed our stakeholders and not met the standards we have set for ourselves. ""Given the complexity and sensitivity of our investigations, we are being as transparent as possible and providing information that is accurate to the best of our knowledge. We are doing our level best to keep our customers supported in mitigating the potential risks."" Singtel said a ""large part"" of the leaked data includes its ""internal information that is non-sensitive"", such as data logs, test data, reports and emails. ""SOPHISTICATED"" CYBERATTACK ON ACCELLION Accellion FTA, which Singtel used as a third-party file sharing system, was the target of a ""sophisticated"" cyberattack exploiting a ""previously unknown vulnerability"", said the telco. When it was first alerted to exploits against the system in December last year, Singtel ""promptly applied"" a series of patches provided by Accellion to ""plug the vulnerability"", it said. The last patch was on Dec 27 last year. On Jan 23, Accellion advised that a new vulnerability had emerged that rendered the earlier patches previously applied in December ineffective. Singtel immediately took the system offline, and the FTA system has been kept offline since Jan 23, said the company. ""On Jan 30, Singtel's attempt to patch the new vulnerability in the FTA system triggered an anomaly alert. Accellion informed thereafter that the system could have been breached,"" said Singtel. The telco's investigations later confirmed the breach and identified Jan 20 as the date it had occurred. ""On Feb 9, Singtel established that files were taken as a result of the breach and informed the public two days later on Feb 11,"" said the company. IDENTITY MONITORING SERVICES FOR AFFECTED CUSTOMERS On Wednesday, Singtel said it is appointing a global data and information service provider to provide identity monitoring services at no cost to affected customers to help them ""manage potential risks"". This service monitors public websites and ""non-public places"" on the Internet, and notifies users of any unusual activity related to their personal information, the telco explained. Affected individual customers will be notified via email or post about what personal details were accessed and how they can best manage the risks involved, Singtel said in an FAQ on its website. ""We are working with the utmost urgency to ascertain the nature and extent of data that has been potentially accessed. We will reach out to individuals and organisations whose information may have been illegally downloaded,"" it added in the FAQ. Singtel's core operations and functions remain ""unaffected and sound"" as the incident involves a standalone system provided by a third-party vendor, said Mr Yuen. He thanked customers and partners for their ""patience and understanding"" as it continued its cyber and criminal investigations to ""understand the full extent of this breach"". ""Information security remains our highest priority and you have my commitment that we are conducting a thorough review of our systems and processes to strengthen them,"" he added.

Although the firm has already developed a more advanced software \x93kiteworks\x94 to replace FTA, the latter remained in use by numerous customers globally. A few months before the EOL, the cybercriminals spotted a zero-day vulnerability. Specifically, it was a SQL injection flaw that they started exploiting on December 23, 2020. Consequently, the vulnerable software indirectly affected the security of consumer firms, including Singtel. Before that, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand also suffered a breach due to the vulnerable software. As Accellion stated in its press release, In mid-December, Accellion was made aware of a zero-day vulnerability in its legacy FTA software. Accellion released a fix within 72 hours. This initial incident was the beginning of a concerted cyberattack on the Accellion FTA product that continued into January 2021. Accellion identified additional exploits in the ensuing weeks and rapidly developed and released patches to close each vulnerability. Accellion continues to work closely with FTA customers to mitigate the impact of the attack and to monitor for anomalies."

Recipients get links to files hosted on the FTA, which can then be downloaded. The product is nearly 20 years old, yet it's still used by hundreds of organizations in the finance, government and insurance sectors to transfer sensitive files. Accellion prides itself on secure file sharing, so the appliance \x96 given its age and wide use \x96 is a juicy target. Over the last seven weeks or so, several SQL and other vulnerabilities have emerged in the product. Given the danger of using old software, why haven\x92t Accellion\x92s customers moved to the company\x92s latest content sharing and firewall platform, kiteworks, as Accellion has been recommending for years? Accellion offers a license and free migration support to kiteworks as an incentive."

You are saying TT data are not sensitive compared to CCTVs and various other forms of survellance. This means that the TT data is comparatively useless in light of CCTV. In that case, there is no point using the TT data when the CCTV data provides everything that TT data provides, plus much more. Also, a person carrying out premeditated murder will also be logical enough to not carry or activate his/her TT token/app. This renders TT data useless most of the time."

Main reason is that CIP is quite a FAILURE !!! For the last 20 years, I have seen so many students pretending to participate in Community and social works to gain points and vested interests.  So while they are outside the house, they have can transform instantly into ""hypocrites"" pretending to care for the elders and clean the school compound or aged homes with ""enthusiasm"" and ""joy"". However, once at home we see their true colors which is the real ""brat"" that MOE has molded.  When these ""brats"" becomes have their family, the majority are unable to cope with simple household work like doing laundry or washing the utensil and have to employ maids to do these jobs.  Some will even call their aged parents to these house if leaving nearby to do these daily household chores while the ""brats"" pretend to contribute to society by messing with other families that are actually NOT dysfunctional but maybe poor in their context.  So our society is actually back-tracking to a new generations of ""brats"" who was good in ""wayang"" or acting to do good while they are outside but are actually dysfunctional.  Our Ministry of Education should start to implement my suggested Household Enrichment Program (HOEP) .  Maybe can learn from Japan where the students treat their classroom like their own bedroom where they are supposed to clean their personal desk, sweep the floor and even wash their own utensils.  In this COVID period, when many students are now staying many hours at home, most will also ""pretend"" to work infront of the computer and will not even offer or lift a finger to help their parents in simple household work.  MOE can use ""Zoom"" to video these students doing simple HOEP task that MOE can allocate on a routine basis and do random checks.  Teachers can visit various household to better understand the various household problems.  I hope MOE can meetup with real people to better understand how to train a new generation of students who can become FUNCTIONAL adults that can do household work as part of their nature or nurture.  Thank you."

Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 16), Dr Balakrishnan pointed to World Bank estimates that about a quarter of Myanmar's population lives below the poverty line, and that this had been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""And so in all my discussions, my phone calls, I have said that we should not embark on widespread, generalised indiscriminate sanctions, because the people who will suffer most would be the ordinary people in Myanmar,"" he said. Dr Balakrishnan's comments come after the military seized power in Myanmar earlier this month, detaining leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party, which had won the country's election last year. Last week the United States announced it was imposing sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders, calling on them to relinquish power. Dr Balakrishan said Singapore hoped for ""peaceful resolution and national reconciliation"" in Myanmar. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...shnan-14207986"

The Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to social media companies WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook in connection with a plea challenging the company\x92s new privacy policy. The plea filed seeks a stay on the operation of the new WhatsApp privacy policy. The SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, sought responses from both WhatsApp and Facebook. The SC bench of SA Bobde, AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, added that it will have to intervene to protect the privacy of people if the new WhatsApp privacy policy is introduced. The top court has also issued a notice to the central government in connection with the matter. The bench further said that Indian citizens have apprehensions regarding the privacy concerns with respect to the WhatsApp\x92s new privacy policy. \x93You (Facebook and WhatsApp) may be a $2-3 trillion company, but people value their privacy more than money,\x94 SC told Facebook and WhatsApp while issuing the notice. WhatsApp had earlier announced that it would bring a new privacy policy and implement it from February 5. But after the government's notice, the date was extended to May 14. It is worth mentioning that WhatsApp's new privacy policy is different for India and Europe. Senior counsel Shyam Divan appearing for the petitioner in the case alleged that WhatsApp was differentiating between Indians and Europeans in terms of privacy policy standards. On behalf of the petitioner, Shyam Divan said that media reports indicate that the central government is taking the matter seriously. In this case, the central government has also sent a notice to WhatsApp. Divan said that the privacy policy of WhatsApp cannot be different for India and added that the government should order WhatsApp not to implement the new privacy policy. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that no compromise will be made with privacy as it is the right of the people of the country. Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, on behalf of WhatsApp, said that there is no threat to privacy from the policy. However, CJI Bobde said that Facebook and WhatsApp should clarify their policy regarding data sharing. The central government, WhatsApp and Facebook have four weeks to reply in the matter."

The new restrictions before Chinese New Year will include a cap of eight distinct visitors per household per day. This is different from the current restriction of eight visitors at one time. But enforcing the rule might be a tad difficult, considering these are houses and not public places. Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) co-chair Lawrence Wong acknowledged that enforcement for this new rule is ""not going to be so easy"". He listed a few possible ways that the enforcement might occur if the rules are not adhered to. Enforcement Officers will do random spot checks, and neighbours might also tell on rule-breakers. In response to a media question, Wong said that random spot checks had been done before, and it wasn't new. However he reiterated that it would not be easy, and called on everyone to cooperate and do their part. Wong also strongly advised those going out to visit to keep it to no more than two other households per day, particularly during the Chinese New Year period.

The new restrictions before Chinese New Year will include a cap of eight distinct visitors per household per day. This is different from the current restriction of eight visitors at one time. But enforcing the rule might be a tad difficult, considering these are houses and not public places. Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) co-chair Lawrence Wong acknowledged that enforcement for this new rule is ""not going to be so easy"". He listed a few possible ways that the enforcement might occur if the rules are not adhered to. Enforcement Officers will do random spot checks, and neighbours might also tell on rule-breakers. In response to a media question, Wong said that random spot checks had been done before, and it wasn't new. However he reiterated that it would not be easy, and called on everyone to cooperate and do their part. Wong also strongly advised those going out to visit to keep it to no more than two other households per day, particularly during the Chinese New Year period.

That will be more efficient way to enforce the ""max 8 visitors"" and ""2 household"" rules. After CNY, don't have to make it compulsory anymore. Example, random spot check on people outside whether they bring their TT or install their app or not. If they were caught not bringing nor installed the app, give reasonable fine. Also make temporary update not able to pause the app. The idea is to deter people from lying to contact tracers if any single one of them become positive later. If they're found that they broke the ""max 8 visitors"" and ""2 household"" rules, then send them to jail or fine them. I just don't want repeat of last year.

The new restrictions before Chinese New Year will include a cap of eight distinct visitors per household per day. This is different from the current restriction of eight visitors at one time. But enforcing the rule might be a tad difficult, considering these are houses and not public places. Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) co-chair Lawrence Wong acknowledged that enforcement for this new rule is ""not going to be so easy"". He listed a few possible ways that the enforcement might occur if the rules are not adhered to. Enforcement Officers will do random spot checks, and neighbours might also tell on rule-breakers. In response to a media question, Wong said that random spot checks had been done before, and it wasn't new. However he reiterated that it would not be easy, and called on everyone to cooperate and do their part. Wong also strongly advised those going out to visit to keep it to no more than two other households per day, particularly during the Chinese New Year period.

As think more, if not most people are covered by these measures, rather than not. For think from certain perspectives see, to greater extent perhaps, with the making of many places needing the app or token to access, its somewhat implied, don't need to be so explicit about it. Don't have these many people cannot go that many places also, especially places where there are concentrated public presence. In that respect, given the inconvenience, think those that don't have these usually don't go far and/or don't come in contact with that many places or people also.

(By the way, if battery out, are we allowed to just pop into the nearest CC to change? Or idiotically have to wait to go back to the ""correct"" one? And who the hell will daily stare at the token for a whole minute to see if the green light blinks? ) EDMW, don't laugh at those old folks who hang the token around their neck. At least they bother to bring out, regardless of how it's done. We who don't bring it out with us all the time should be frowned upon, especially if you're blaming this father & son for not having theirs. TT app? Please lah, not everyone has a phone that can tahan having BT (and data) on all the time. Use your head... the correct one. https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg...ttery-quickly- Based on the above, and if you do not disbelieve, the battery drain is low. have not heard of anyone in this forum having high phone batter drain. as this is a national effort to enable all of us to survive COVID-19, i dont see why we should not play our part. How difficult is it to lose 2% of phone battery life over say 6 hours? How difficult is it to bring out the TT token if not using the phone app? How difficult is it to get off the self-righteous horse?"

But it's bigger than the first generation one. Bigger but slimmer. The battery compartment is clearly marked behind the token. Can open easily using a 10 or 20 cent coin. In fact, the battery compartment is also fairly easily assessed in the first generation token. Just that you need to use some force to pry it open."

He developed a dry cough on 28 January and anosmia on 9 February but did not seek medical attention. He was subsequently detected from our community surveillance testing of stallholders and shop owners in Chinatown on 9 February. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 10 February, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Case 60150 Case 60150 is a 32 year-old male Singaporean who is the son of Case 60138 and works part-time as a waiter at Swensen\x92s located at Changi Airport Terminal 3. He was last at work on 8 February. He developed a runny nose on 8 February after work but did not seek medical treatment. As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 60138, he was contacted by MOH on 10 February and placed on quarantine. He reported his symptoms and was conveyed to NCID where he was tested for COVID-19 on the same day. His test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 11 February. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. We strongly urge everyone to do their part to reduce the risk of transmission. Those who are unwell, including those showing early/mild symptoms, should be socially responsible and seek medical attention immediately and stay at home to prevent the spread of illness to others. Case 60145 Case 60145 is a 20 year-old male Singaporean who is a full-time National Serviceman. He works at the Singapore Armed Forces premises at 200 Airport Road. He does not stay in camp, and his work does not entail interacting with other units. He felt unwell on 3 February, and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic. As he did not have symptoms associated with acute respiratory infection, he was not tested for COVID-19 but was placed on medical leave. He subsequently went back to work on 8 February, and on 9 February, he developed fever and a runny nose. He sought medical treatment at the medical centre located at Paya Lebar Airbase and was swabbed. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.

Main issue ish 1) Either deliberately conceal the facts, or missed out on that important part 2) When issue gotch discovered, tried to bulldoze through it on moral high ground 3) Did not intend to amend bills or made proper safeguards until the public sentiments turned for the worst Could hab been upfront and then made proper laws to govern the use of the data, or that if that was an oversight, just admit it and make appropriate changes to the laws... In the end the issue was dragged and the trust lost was unlikely to be fully recoverable. Then comes the WP... If their intention ish to make the ppl believe in the TT program, then huai try to create a situation to create distrust at the start, by making it rooks rike the gov themselves don't trust TT? If their intention ish to question the viability or the trust of the program huai tell ppl to DL the program. That ish as good as deliberately trolling... Does not make sense ever. Sho much sho for a credible oppo... And then their push for as well as the other oppo's push for libtard policies just drop my respect for them a big big notch."

It says nothing about how many people are actually using it and it doesn't show how many users it detects 5 mins ago or 10 mins. And I don't think it actually detects at full range of the bluetooth signal.

We are working on showing in your App the possible exposures based on TraceTogether Bluetooth records too.> TraceTogether and SafeEntry work together to increase the speed and accuracy of MOH\x92s contact tracing efforts. TraceTogether helps MOH identify people who were in close proximity with COVID-19 cases, while SafeEntry helps COVID-19 cases remember the places that they\x92ve been to so that MOH can spot potential clusters. If you were in close contact with a COVID-19 case, MOH will contact you to provide the relevant care advice. More details on how possible exposures are determined i) TraceTogether Bluetooth records When a COVID-19 case shares their TraceTogether Bluetooth records with MOH to help with contact tracing, the records are securely decrypted and filtered for based on duration and signal strength, to identify those who had substantial contact with the COVID-19 case. ii) SafeEntry check-in/-out records Among your SafeEntry records across all modes (e.g. TraceTogether App, SingPass Mobile App, your phone\x92s camera, or scanning your NRIC/FIN barcode), those that match the locations visited by COVID-19 cases will be shown to you through the App. As there is minimal risk through transient contact of less than 5 minutes, this service will apply to individuals with an overlap of at least 5 minutes with the COVID-19 cases (see image below). You can read more about the SafeEntry location matching here."

Outdoors, in an open field, you can get a range of up to a hundred meters. But that is a rare situation. Indoors, obstacles like concrete walls will attenuate the radio signal and the effective range will be drastically reduced. In normal use, ten meters is a good guide to what can be achieved between two Bluetooth devices indoors. When developing a Bluetooth device, you can give your device a better range by selecting the Bluetooth chip with the best receiver sensitivity and output power, and making sure that you use a good antenna. Sometimes you may need to use Bluetooth over hundreds or thousands of meters.

This is only partially true AFAIK. What you stated is the theoretical range of BT. Range is still dependent on the device transmission class. Most phones are still Class 2 devices, so range is limited to more or less 10m. The tokens are probably also only Class 2.

He also called for stronger deterrence against unfair hiring, saying the country should consider enacting anti-discrimination laws to punish errant companies that discriminate against Singaporean workers. He made the suggestions as he spoke during the debate on the President's Address about the need to change the way foreign professionals are managed here, to address the concerns of citizens who feel excluded from job opportunities. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ive-industries SINGAPORE - Disruptive industries involving technologies such as autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence (AI) require specialised skills that are in short supply in Singapore, said opposition MP Leon Perera (Aljunied GRC) on Thursday (Oct 15). One way to nurture the growth of such industries, without relying on an unsustainable importation of skilled foreign workers, could be to issue limited-term foreign work passes tied to the training of Singaporean workers, he told Parliament. Mr Perera, of the Workers' Party (WP), said individuals with the necessary specialised skills could be offered, say, a five-year pass."

And you did say no PAP MP or minster dare to say they are all using it. Which showed people WP is more committed to do the right thing and WP is obviously way better at gaining trust from the people then PAP. this is clearly a WP thrash PAP scenario and is an undeniable fact which you failed and unable to defend. And no i did not deny the facts. I listed the facts that WP outperformed PAP and you twisted the facts that WP is PAP lackey. Conclusion: WP thrashed PAP period. Who shift goal posts. You really mental case. My points are simple. 1) The TT privacy was not first brought up by WP but by PAP MP Chris De Souza. This is a fact. Dun prata. 2) The WP MPs have proven more loyal to PAP than PAP members themselves. The WP SG openly declare that all WP have download the TT even with the privacy concerns. During elections, a criticism of PAP MPs is that they will support PAP Bills even if they asked questions. But WP MPs have outdone them. Openly canvassing support for a PAP policy. You are right. In terms of proving loyalty to PAP, indeed WP MPs have thrashed PAP MPs in this aspect. Very obedient pets."

My unit is a corner unit away from other units, which means that I don\u2019t have anybody living next to me. So the 24 - 28 people can be from upstairs or downstairs; or maybe it means that it can capture more than 10 metres. The TT FAQ already said in https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg...ogether-users- that it can be more than 10 metres.  Never does anywhere state that TT can only capture max 10 metres. If I can capture 30 devices at home and Pritnam says 36 on his phone, what does it mean? It means that either the TT can only capture max 10 metres radius as what the PAP iBs claiming and desperately wanting us to believe or; there are soooo many people in my household Maybe desperate iBs like FAP and SMRTFb can explain better? I live in a built up area. My phone reports 0 contacts."

Increasingly, there are more options for Singaporeans to return to university several times to upgrade and upskill at different points of their career. Employers should not see this as a disruption. Instead, they should look at students and graduates for who they are, their experiences and the value proposition that they bring to the workplace, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday (Feb 5). Speaking at The Straits Times Education Forum 2021 on Reimagining Universities, Post-Covid, he said: ""That will be the ultimate test - (hiring) not based on the qualifications or credentials or whether you had this experience or that experience, which somehow feels different from what I had gone through. ""Of course, it will be different, but look at the value that the student or the graduate brings to the workplace - the skills, the competencies and the contributions. Reimagining Universities, Post-Covid | The Straits Times Education Forum 2021 Webinar ""We hope, with all that we are doing and all that the universities are doing, each batch of graduates will be able to bring more value and more contributions to the workplace and to employers."" Mr Wong, who obtained his bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, said he was reminded of how the Public Service Commission had questioned him upon his return on why he chose to take music classes at university. ""But I think mindsets have changed, and it will continue to change,"" he said. The forum, which was held online this year, examined the ripple effects of the coronavirus pandemic on higher education and the changes that it will forge. Professor Lily Kong, president of the Singapore Management University (SMU) that co-organised the forum, said that ""every generation will look at the next generation and see how they're different"". She said she has heard senior leaders in companies and firms say that they have learnt new things from the new graduates. ""Each generation brings something different and something positive. The younger generation is going to bring a whole lot of technological skills that the older generation doesn't have, for example."" She added: ""Of course, the senior employers and employees have the experience that younger ones don't have. So it's really about learning from one another and optimising the skill sets within a company."""

Transparent and unknown to anybody. Token is a blackbox, they claim it only collects data and deletes all after some time. They say, who check who confirm? It can include a simple backdoor that uploads the data whenever it receives a certain command. The first few version of the token may be innocent/harmless. The goverment also not completely stupid. But once people are used to carrying it, replacing it with new ones, who guarantees new version won't have added ""features""? Some features can also be intentionally made known, to give some benefit ( use as EZLink, electronic payment ) to justify adding components to support other undisclosed functionality. Lastly, the benefits/protection that this token supposedly provides to Singaporeans, is practically non-existent. There are so many situations it can miss out. Plus way too costly compared to better alternatives like simply banning some countries from coming in. We've almost stamped out community cases so no imported cases = no need to trace."

And guess what permissions is required by SGSecure? All you need is just ONE device with both apps installed within the vicinity to track everyone.

It can include a simple backdoor that uploads the data whenever it receives a certain command. The first few version of the token may be innocent/harmless. The goverment also not completely stupid. But once people are used to carrying it, replacing it with new ones, who guarantees new version won't have added ""features""? Some features can also be intentionally made known, to give some benefit ( use as EZLink, electronic payment ) to justify adding components to support other undisclosed functionality. Lastly, the benefits/protection that this token supposedly provides to Singaporeans, is practically non-existent. There are so many situations it can miss out. Plus way too costly compared to better alternatives like simply banning some countries from coming in. We've almost stamped out community cases so no imported cases = no need to trace. that makes sense..."

Methinks what you said is true of all diseases, and you're right tt will not covid because the incubation period is long. Maybe it helps to think tt doesn't stop covid, but applies a brake to slow down the transmission. If you don't have the contact tracing to get people to self quarantine, then these same people will continue to spread it unstopped. You can't prevent the spread to those that have already been in contact, but you can avoid further spread. Until a quick test or vaccine appears, this is probably one of the better mechanisms to manage thee disease. It doesn't do anything to slow down transmission. Even assuming perfect 100% adoption, the time lapse between infection, detection of infection, gathering of TT data, sifting for high risk contacts, to finally contacting the potential infected people is way too big. Forever playing catch up only. If the government is truly keen on stopping COVID transmission and have absolutely no other hidden agenda, they should just block certain countries from coming in.

When they encourage others to avoid being tracked ostensibly for privacy reasons, they become safer that they won\x92t stick out due to safety in numbers. Singapore like a lot of other countries already tracks the following. EZ-Link data can easily be cross referenced with the security cameras monitoring all mrt and lrt access points. Carparks with security cameras can be cross referenced with all the street cameras. When you carry a phone with signal, your location is being tracked based on the nric used to register that SIM card. Telcos almost everywhere have to turn over that data with a search warrant. Unless you like walking around without a phone and pay for everything in cash, you are already tracked."

With the recent case of how the police handled the Indian maid vs CEO, you think they will rely on the ""proven"" and ""reliable"" TT data or make the extra effort to verify your claims and prove you not in the area? How about if you were actually in the area but didn't see the crime while the criminal didn't have an active TT token? So you gg as the last and only known contact before victim was murdered"

Furthermore. let's say if I install a bluetooth device at Tampines Mall entrance and record every single device it pairs with and how long. Isn't that also collecting location data via bluetooth means? You can tell me that is not doable? Our government explicit says that Quote: The TraceTogether App does not collect or use physical location data (e.g. GPS, WiFi fingerprinting, cell ID). It only records proximity via Bluetooth. So if they have a bluetooth device installed at entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth? Proximity to entrance so they can track your location. To pinpoint a person's location you just need 3 fixed bluetooth transponders to triangulate your exact location. Then you have it, how to get a person's location based on proximity data. Tell me isit possible anot lo."

Let's say if I install a bluetooth device at a shopping mall, let's say, Tampines Mall entrance and record every single device it pairs with and how long. Our government explicit says that Quote: The TraceTogether App does not collect or use physical location data (e.g. GPS, WiFi fingerprinting, cell ID). It only records proximity via Bluetooth. So if they have a bluetooth device installed at all entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth? Proximity to entrance so they can track your location. To pinpoint a person's location you just need 3 fixed bluetooth transponders to triangulate your exact location.

Let's say we are able to do do immediate mass-testing It can only tell you who has covid now, and isolate those people. but viruses can spread/be imported/test negative at first then turn positive therefore mass testing will not eradicate covid19. if it is feasible, govt would have done it already; no need you to suggest, you are not smarter than govt. it is more sensible to trace where the virus spreads, and apply measures to contain the spread. that is why we have SAFE ENTRY - to track location of spread and TRACE TOGETHER - to track spreading clusters amongst the people plus the device is free, and safe. why people so against it, is really due to lack of understanding."

It could do so, he says, by fitting Bluetooth sensors to public spaces to identify dongle users who are out and about when they should be self-isolating at home.

And after that you can decide on who deserves help. and you are supportive of a national initiative forced down our throats that does nothing to prevent the virus instead bolstering our poor detection capabilities, detection of not old virus carriers but new ones. its like buying another bag for the cat once its out of the bag and mark its pee all over the floor. absolutely nothing is being done to prevent the cat from getting out of the bag. reactive is not evem the term for it, it should be backwards"

Poomer wrote: Scenario 1: Let's say if government install a bluetooth device at Tampines Mall entrance and record every single device it pairs with and how long. Isn't that also collecting location data via bluetooth means? You can tell me that is not doable? Our government comments on the TT initiative. Quote: The TraceTogether App does not collect or use physical location data (e.g. GPS, WiFi fingerprinting, cell ID). It only records proximity via Bluetooth. So if they have a bluetooth device installed at entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth? Proximity to entrance so they can track your location. To pinpoint a person's location you just need 3 fixed bluetooth transponders to triangulate your exact location. Then you have it, how to get a person's location based on proximity data. Can be done anot? A university professor also mentioned the same thing: Quote: Dr Michael Veale, a digital rights expert at University College London, warns of the potential for mission creep. He gives an example in which a government struggling against Covid-19 might want to enforce quarantine control. It could do so, he says, by fitting Bluetooth sensors to public spaces to identify dongle users who are out and about when they should be self-isolating at home. ""All you have to do is install physical infrastructure in the world and the data that is collecting can be mapped back to Singapore ID numbers,"" he explains. ""The buildability is the worrying part."" is this concept too big for you coern? dun have a mind of your own just say dun have a mind of your own la."

We want the cake and eat it. But in reality there is no such thing. You rightly pointed out, tracking is already a possibility. the key is the intent. Why are ppl doubtful of the intent?

Speculating on what the gahmen can/will do with the info is one thing la, I curious about the ""whether TT provides protection"" bit. I am no expert la, but i think when a person is found to be infected, they download all their trace together pings over the last 14 days and in theory let everyone who was ping'd know that they have been in close contact with an infected, please stay home and go to a doc immediately if unwell. So if you are the infected, well, life sucks. If you are the ping'd, depending on your... social responsibility, you may consider semi self-quarantining and just generally be even more careful. However, if you are neither of these people, you will hope that the ping'd group are socially responsible boys and girls, and will limit their going out into public until 2 weeks later. If that's the case, even if the entire ping'd group tio, you are protected from this ping'd group and remain blissfully unaware of what happened. On the other hand. If infectee doesn't even use TT. That potential group of people who would have been ping'd, will no longer be ping'd and they wont know until their symptoms show. Of course, by then they might have already gone out and caused a few more victims. So TT hopefully in theory protects you by limiting exposures of possible virus carriers/spreaders to the public. Or TT can also be used to trace where I go buy my dinner i guess. Because i really dont want people to know my favourite stall so there wont be a queue or something."

No less. Reading the exchanges here, It's true the TT token and app have it's flaws. But as the old saying goes, it's better then nothing. For the token, the flaws are pretty layman knowledge and comes as no surprise. But the idea that Government can use it to track people's movement for no reason whatsoever is all conspiracy theories that have no credibility whatsoever. The idea of privacy is moot too.

Very simple, the TT scheme and now with this TT token is to streamline the contact tracing process to make it more efficient. Previously they have to utilize hige amount of resources and manpower to conduct contact tracing, which is the initial flaw as it took too long for them to trace each contact that had close contact with the infected person. This token seeks to close that time gap between identifying the infected person and close contact people."

Actually, they can track potential victims and prevent them from exposing themselves to you which allows you to continue to be blissfully unaware of the risks and continue to online poop on their efforts."

I must admit that I'm not an expert on this particular chipset and I've not scrutinized the entire datahsheet yet. I'm also by no means an electrical engineer, but I can guarantee that the jammer mentioned in the medium article works especially since not every TT device has an output power of 20dBm. I doubt that TX power of these tokens go anywhere near 8dBm since all they need is a proximity of 10m. They're more likely to have a transmit power of 0dBm or less. I'm just here to discuss and provide the tools for people to protect their own privacy.

But as the old saying goes, it's better then nothing. For the token, the flaws are pretty layman knowledge and comes as no surprise. But the idea that Government can use it to track people's movement for no reason whatsoever is all conspiracy theories that have no credibility whatsoever. The idea of privacy is moot too. If government really want to track your movements for whatever reason they don't need this TT to do it. Nowadays cameras are everywhere, from HDB lift landings to MRT stations and lamp posts etc. If they want they can start tracking you the moment you step out of your house. The main point is that this TT token requires the public to corporate with goodwill. Anyone that seeks to undermine the functionality of the TT token could be deemed malicious and should be prosecuted. Anyway once it's made mandatory to be used in public spaces let's see how many people will really put the tokens in faraday pouches or whatever mods ""discussed"" here. Don't be surprised if the authorities have a way to check if your token is active or not. And lastly don't have to argue with the other fella lah. That fella previously got banned many times for fear-mongering here by keep posting fake information that supermarkets are running low on food when many others already proved him wrong with pictures lol. Ownself come derail then ownself act like saint. While letting the retards like kyo465 and numberX pcw their insults. But it's a one man insult show I guess. Dont worry, I'll return the favour one.

Looks like this fella run road liao. Zero credibility. Oh well. time to get out of this thread... A simple google search of the data sheet would bring it up lol.. Again I'm still waiting for someone to disprove me that the jammer doesn't work. I got this http://www.green-antenna.com/web/sit...3416BL02_S.pdf by looking at the label on the TT token as well. It's in the breakdown. As for the transmitter I've already stated my case earlier on Quote: Welp if you insist, I manage to dig up this datasheet by looking at a teardown and the chip label https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/bluenrg-2.pdf it has a max transmit power of 8dBm. I must admit that I'm not an expert on this particular chipset and I've not scrutinized the entire datahsheet yet. I'm also by no means an electrical engineer, but I can guarantee that the jammer mentioned in the medium article works especially since not every TT device has an output power of 20dBm. I doubt that TX power of these tokens go anywhere near 8dBm since all they need is a proximity of 10m. They're more likely to have a transmit power of 0dBm or less. I'm just here to discuss and provide the tools for people to protect their own privacy. I've not heard of anyone offering a good solution for mitigation against BLE replay attacks or BLE jamming yet. Refer to post #831"

Yes. Common sense is not so common. Faster tracking = Faster containment = Less spread In Europe or US, they have zero tracking. Thus, cases are skyrocketing."

Exactly, as I pointed out and rightly so. the current tracking system has it's limitations. That's where TT comes in. Just because police able to track 1-2 person or 100 person a day. Doesnt mean they have the capabilities to track 1 million at a go. So that's why I dont get the oh SPF can track us anyway ior our smartphone/laptop is already being tracked so we should let the government use TT to track us instead argument. I use those same arguments they offer back at them, since they claim government/companies already can track us, then use current solutions, no need TT then. Oh suddenly, the current solutions got limitations. Exactly lo, now you know why they need a more invasive programme to track us. And when I mean track us is not tha I'm claiming they track us for some dubious reason right off the bat. But let's be very honest here, nobody can promise we wont get there eventually. We have to look at the entire situation from a holistic point of view, it is not 1 person or 10 person's privacy being trodden. But an entire nation of 3 million+++ people. MikeDirnt78 wrote: SPF is quite efficient in solving most of the crimes. They certainly don't need the help of a token. Does that put your claim to rest? TLDR: All the simplistic argument about they already can track us through our laptop smartphone so TT is nothing. Simple answer. Then can explain why they dont use those to track? Like that wont need TT what. I guarantee plus chop nobody can give a satisfactory answer that explain if the government already has all that data at their fingertips, why do they even need to implement TT. Furthermore, what kinda logic is since the government is able to track us on our smartphone/laptop, we should give up all our privacies and let them track us. If i slap you on your left cheek, are you going to lemme slap your right cheek too? But based on the retarded logic of some forummers, it is since they already slap left cheek, no difference from slapping right cheek la, so let's give them the right cheek to slap."

Lol. This goon doesnt know not everyone has a phone. Thats why hes asking if tracking on phone works, why need a token. And the plan for this nonsense to work, he expect the whole sg to be bluetooth'ed. So I was wondering, when I am driving alone around the estate, but I left my token at home, who is going to trace me? When I bring my dog to the nearby park, with my token at home, who is going to trace me? When I take a bus all over singapore, with my token at home, who is going to trace me? Or maybe he just such a good boy that he likes the token so much that he will hang around his neck 24/7. So after bluetooth'ing the entire sg for nothing will also get nothing. And our professor is still working so hard everyday to preach his nonsense. Thumbs up for effort. Thumbs down for the ignorance."

I believe it is better to define that line now instead of giving in and letting them know that they can implement all sorts of draconian measures. Although you argue that SPF can already scrutinise CCTV footage and telephone lines, these are things which have a proper system in place to deter misuse. In fact, the SPF has to issue a warrant to obtain CCTV data on private premises. The resolution provided by cell phone towers isn't high either as cell phone towers need not be too close to a mobile phone user and a mobile phone is only connected to one cell tower at any point in time. That makes triangulation of the phone's exact location much harder through dead reckoning. There's still some degree of obfuscation here. TT provides a much greater resolution in pinpointing who you've interacted with and where you've been as gathers multiple data points among multiple users in the vicinity."

I don't think any of the above mentioned can give you the accuracy BLE can give. There's a reason why indoor positioning is possible with BLE. GPS loses its accuracy when you're shielded from GLONASS signals. CCTV will be extremely painful to piece together as you'll have to obtain footage from different vendors (e.g. transitioning from condos to malls to public transport), contrary to many speculations, they're not actually connected. Safe entry and ezlink only provide temporary tracking as it leaves a timestamp on where you last tapped in, there is no periodic/ constant tracking here. Credit card and data at bank is an entirely different thing, they do not track location or are not supposed to, unless you're talking about ATMs in which case it is about as good as ezlink cards/ safeentry in offering location tracking. Another myth-busting fact is that cell towers can't track you with that degree of accuracy as well, especially since you do not have to be that close to a cell tower and any form of interference (from buildings or people walking) would cause significant changes to the signal strength. You also won't be connected to 2 let alone 3 cell towers concurrently or switch between them rapidly. Triangulation would be extremely painful. There's a reason why BLE was picked instead of using cell towers or CCTVs to track, BLE does have a higher degree of accuracy in location tracking. BLE can connect and disconnect with nearby devices in a matter of milliseconds while cell towers or WiFi are still negotiating handshakes. The lifetime of a BLE device is very very short, it does not remain connected to another device for long as all it needs is to send a ~30 bytes packet. Combine this with existing tech like CCTVs/ safe entry/ EZlink taps and many more, we get sensor fusion. They can technically narrow down the probability of your exact location and time. FYI: BLE is the primary protocol used for both the TT app and token. This is not a matter of arguing that TT was preferred instead of using cell tower tracking because not many people have phones. There is huge a limitation in cell tower tracking."

There's a reason why indoor positioning is possible with BLE. GPS loses its accuracy when you're shielded from GLONASS signals. CCTV will be extremely painful to piece together as you'll have to obtain footage from different vendors (e.g. transitioning from condos to malls to public transport), contrary to many speculations, they're not actually connected. Safe entry and ezlink only provide temporary tracking as it leaves a timestamp on where you last tapped in, there is no periodic/ constant tracking here. Credit card and data at bank is an entirely different thing, they do not track location or are not supposed to, unless you're talking about ATMs in which case it is about as good as ezlink cards/ safeentry in offering location tracking. Another myth-busting fact is that cell towers can't track you with that degree of accuracy as well, especially since you do not have to be that close to a cell tower and any form of interference (from buildings or people walking) would cause significant changes to the signal strength. You also won't be connected to 2 let alone 3 cell towers concurrently or switch between them rapidly. Triangulation would be extremely painful. There's a reason why BLE was picked instead of using cell towers or CCTVs to track, BLE does have a higher degree of accuracy in location tracking. BLE can connect and disconnect with nearby devices in a matter of milliseconds while cell towers or WiFi are still negotiating handshakes. The lifetime of a BLE device is very very short, it does not remain connected to another device for long as all it needs is to send a ~30 bytes packet. Combine this with existing tech like CCTVs/ safe entry/ EZlink taps and many more, we get sensor fusion. They can technically narrow down the probability of your exact location and time. FYI: BLE is the primary protocol used for both the TT app and token. This is not a matter of arguing that TT was preferred instead of using cell tower tracking because not many people have phones. There is huge a limitation in cell tower tracking. Sorry, I didnt read your WOT. Are you another thinking of bluetoothing the whole country to make that nonsense even workable? I am not even talking about how easy or difficult it is to get tracked. You get tracked means you get tracked. You lose your previcy means you lose your privacy. You can lose your privacy to a third party and then lose it to the gov. Or you can lose your privacy to the gov directly. The end result is you lost your privacy. You privacy going through a third partty means you didnt lose your privacy?"

Mate, if you just glance through the website, what is the takeaway from it? Basically the TTs ability to protect us is streneous at best. But that is what the government is posting big big on the website. the protect they use is the very same protect that are using. it is clear as day, so stop claiming otherwise. so first the argument is that im claiming that TT protect us and nobody else is saying so, and when i post ss from TT website, suddenly its different kind of protect. knn so am i the only one claiming Tt is supposed to protect us anot. dun come bs here lei. even your argument is that tt protects us a lil as it contains the spread. Faster and efficient tracing only translate to minimal improvement in containment. based on moh track record, they are only able to track cases on avg weeks after onset of symptoms. there is no protection for anyone between getting the virus and before moh tracks them with tt, neither does it stop the infected from spreading during this duration. so lemme ask u what protection they talking about. and never mind hor, still say we should allow gov to intrude into everyones privacy for this sort of minimal protection. unbelievable."

Bluetooth wasn\x92t designed for contact tracing, but in the pandemic era it\x92s being held up as a potential solution to the crisis."

Don't try to flip prata. The TT doesn't literally protect you like what a vaccine does. Only you are implying this. The TT indirectly protects you in a sense that if more patients are detected EARLIER, less infection will happen. So general population can be protected from the outbreak. Let's try not to kid ourselves. Just google around. Contract tracing is mission critical in any outbreak as discussed by many medical and research scientists. Actually you don't need a PHD but just use some common sense. Faster and efficient contract tracing means faster containment of the virus. Why do you still want to argue until the cows come home?

Wong said, \u201cThere is no intention to use a TraceTogether app, or TraceTogether token, as a means of picking up breaches of existing rules.

Knowing the govt, they will use any means and not disclose. A little surprised that they admitted in parliament though. A pap MP asked the question that caused Desmond to reply leh. And if somebody wants to track your location, why don't they use handphone towers? Isn't that better than TT data that supposedly expires after a few weeks. A lot of people, if not all adults, are already aware that phones can be tracked. If even movie criminals know they need to turn off phone, remove battery or don't carry phone, obviously real criminals would know as much if not better. With TT, since they need to have it to enter buildings and other places, it offers another possible channel of tracking. So the persons would either need to have a shielded box to keep their TT when needed, or conduct their activity in isolated location. In which case other methods of tracking becomes more effective. Also of importance is the proximity information, reasonable case can be established that two persons were in close contact, i.e. X cannot say he was simply passing by Y if TT information showed they were within 1m proximity for more than a minute. Lastly, TT is likely more useful for unplanned crimes like a spur of the moment robbery or rape than pre-mediated crimes like drug trafficking."

Just like safe entry program, they are only advising you to screenshot after you checked in but all those details that MOH published about where infected cases has visited, etc; how many people actively check their screenshot to see if they might have been on location at affected times? Many of these ideas are just in theory but how do they translate in real life, nobody has ever mentioned. If these things and program are so successful, you will probably see headlines like ""Trace Together token staved off potentially what might have been super spreader event."" on msm already. The main issue with TraceTogether is that it doesn't prevents infection in the first place yet PAP is maliciously marketing TT in that direction. And there are no clause stating that the TT data won't be accessed for non-tracing reasons or by other apps(SGSecure malware)."

But again he is paid millions to push this narrative right? I wont expect him to come out and blast the SPF for it's misuse of the data. It is being used to track our movement what. If SPF uses your TT data, if they dont track your movement and who you are in proximity with, why do they need your data for? Already pointed out the potential for misuse from day 1 and till today you still cant concile with this fact even when government admitted they are doing so? And the underlying concern that has still not been addressed by you or anyone here is how effective is the TT programme, taking into consideration that an infected person is usually only detected 7-14 days after infection, by then, it would have spread, so how effective is contact tracing actually in curbing the spread? Nobody has come out with any figures showing it's effectiveness, community cases still continue to appear even with 78% of Singaporeans onboard. Really brings the purpose of TT into question doesnt it? Especially in light of how the government mismanages the data, quietly providing it to SPF for investigations(contrary to what they promised) and which was only informed to Singaporeans only when someone asked in parliament. And your dont use smart phone argument is moot. The smartphone and appmakers have access to the data, but the government cant access it one. They have to request for access and the companies can choose not to give to protect your data. Did MOH even make a sound when they hand your data to SPF? Why dont you try to think further for once. If government had access to all that data, why would they even need to bother with getting your TT data?"

My worry is mainly to do with ""in the wrong place, at the wrong time"", especially considering that TT does not provide tangible/visible information that gives more straightforward evidence like CCTV or dashcam footage. It simply shows that you were near someone at a certain time. Using the Punggol murder as example, if I were waiting for a bus or walking past the bus stop at the time that the murder took place: 1.

""Sabo""-ing someone is an active action. I did not actively say or do anything to ""sabo"" the person. If I were to give any statement as a witness, it should be out of my own choice and goodwill, and not because I am forced to be involved in somebody else's problem. I do not have a duty of protection to that person at my own risk unless the person is related to me (friend, family, etc). That would be an outright intrusion of my right to reasonable self-preservation. By your reasoning I can also say I am ""sabo'ed"" by whoever is the culprit, or whoever may be ""wrongfully accused"", by their performing the crime or for being embroiled in the investigation while I was in the vicinity, because I am then put at risk or inconvenience for their benefit. Not forgetting that I can also become ""wrongfully accused"" in the process. ""For the greater good"" is irrelevant to one when one happens to be in the side that does not benefit from that ""good"" and even has something to lose. It is only relevant to those who stand to benefit from it. The more one learns about data protection/information security, the more one realizes that seemingly harmless data could be used or misused against one whether deliberately or unconsciously. Too much revealed information can be dangerous regardless of the intent. It's not as straightforward as ""I have nothing to hide""."

This then opens up plenty of speculative scenarios for the investigators, 99.9% of which are wrong (there can only be one factual truth). What if they follow a wrong one? Like someone above said earlier, you might walk past a hidden corpse and pick up some of the blood, etc from the nearby foliage on your shoes, clothes, etc. Not barring the absence of any other evidence to your innocence, say, if the culprit conceals his trail extremely well or was just lucky - boom, you're convicted based on circumstantial evidence. The Singapore law does not require direct or physical evidence to convict as far as I remember, i.e. convicting can be based on pure inference as long as the judge(s) feels it is reasonable. And obviously there is yet to be any precedent on whether the courts regard TT data to be valid to support circumstantial evidence beyond reasonable doubt, so it could end both ways."

Not started Please be aware that TRACETOGETHER is a program to do, well, tracing of possible contacts. At the moment, it is mainly through the app or by scanning your ID card. The Tokens is just another method of registering your presence and it has same function as the app, ie, the phone or token Bluetooth senses presence of another phone or token within Bluetooth range. I am not sure whether or not a phone Bluetooth will sense the token Bluetooth. However, there is a problem with those who use ID card bar code to register at premises because this does Not have the proximity sensing function. The authorities can monitor how many people actually use the TraceTogether Program by monitoring how many people actually have records of going here and there. Based on this, they say the take up of the Program is so and so. They did not base their assessment on number of tokens collected. For those who are afraid of the Big Brother Syndrome, take it from a guy who came from a neighbouring country, married and raised a family here, now with 4 grandchildren, and Voluntarily took up sg citizenship, we are very lucky to be sg citizens. I don't worry too much even if Big Brother is Watching."

Source: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...cing-data-says Quote: Workers' Party supports Bill on use of TraceTogether data, but asks how critical info is for criminal probe Lim Min Zhang PUBLISHED3 HOURS AGO FACEBOOKTWITTER SINGAPORE - The Workers' Party (WP) is prepared to support a proposed law that would restrict the use of personal contact tracing data by the police to investigations into the most serious crimes, said Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh. Joining the debate on the Bill on Tuesday (Feb 2), Mr Singh said the move to confine the use of TraceTogether data to seven types of serious crimes constitute a ""significant reduction"" of the wide ambit of Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which empowers the police to obtain any data under Singapore's jurisdiction for criminal investigations. ""In other words, a Singaporean's right to privacy is better protected with this Bill than without it,"" he said. In setting out his party's position on the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill, the WP chief also posed a range of questions to Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan, including how critical TraceTogether data was for criminal investigations, given the number of other tools at the police's disposal. The WP's view is that Singapore's top priority should be to tackle the public health and economic effects of the pandemic, he said. Anything that compromises this priority has to give way unless there are overwhelming good reasons, he added, saying it is apparent that the Government's handling of the matter ""has eroded trust from some members of the public"". Mr Singh (Aljunied GRC) also called on the Government to initiate a broader national conversation on privacy concerns, taking in lessons learnt from this episode. He said his own preference was for TraceTogether data to be used only for contact tracing purposes, in line with ""the Government's original emphatic assurances"". Explaining this, he noted the concerns some Singaporeans still have about privacy, and discomfort over sharing cellphone data. ""I am of the view that such an approach would also engender confidence given that a public conversation on privacy has hitherto not been ventilated in a significant way in Singapore,"" he said. Mr Singh noted the ""disquiet, unhappiness, and even cynicism in some quarters"" following the Government's revelation in January that TraceTogether data can be used for criminal investigations. It comes down to a question of trust, the perceived lack of empathy over the public's privacy concerns, and discomfort over sharing mobile phone data with the authorities without sufficient assurances, he said. Dr Balakrishnan, who is also Foreign Minister, had given the assurance last June that TraceTogether would be used only for contact tracing. Vivian Balakrishnan speaks in Parliament about the use of TraceTogether data When the minister admitted in Parliament that it did not occur to him that TraceTogether was subject to the Criminal Procedure Code, there were Singaporeans who felt this was ""not fathomable"" for a largely efficient government machinery that has consistently approached Covid-19 as a whole-of-Government endeavour, Mr Singh said. He added that there were even some Singaporeans who suspect the Government had suppressed information surrounding the use of TraceTogether data for criminal investigations until the target of 70 per cent of the population has been reached. Mr Singh then asked Dr Balakrishnan for the exact date when he knew the Criminal Procedure Code would apply to TraceTogether. He also wanted to know if Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) had filed a parliamentary question on the matter before or after the minister became aware of the code applying to contact tracing data. ""These questions are important for the House to understand at what point the Government determined that its original representations on the use of TraceTogether were misleading, and whether it could have corrected the position and updated the public on its own initiative,"" said Mr Singh. MORE ON THIS TOPIC Bill to restrict use of TraceTogether to serious crimes seeks to assure public their data will be safeguarded: Vivian Progress Singapore Party objects to use of TraceTogether data for criminal investigations: Leong Mun Wai Calling the national fight against Covid-19 a ""wartime scenario"", he asked whether the change in the Government's position could compromise this fight and jeopardise contact tracing. While TraceTogether data is critical for contact tracing, he questioned if it would also be vital in solving these seven categories of crimes such as terrorism-related offences, kidnapping, murder and serious sexual offences such as rape. As it is, the police already have an abundance of investigative tools, such as CCTVs, examining mobile phones and laptops, as well as old-fashioned forensic analysis of crime scenes, he said. ""There is a legitimate view that these tools should be more than sufficient in detecting crime and securing convictions,"" he added. He also asked about the use of TraceTogether data for actual cases: For the one known case where TraceTogether was used, was that case solved and how critical was TraceTogether data in doing so; and how many other times has TraceTogether been used for the seven categories of serious crimes so far. MORE ON THIS TOPIC TraceTogether data was accessed in May 2020 for Punggol Fields murder investigation 350 people asked for their contact tracing data to be deleted in the past month: Vivian Balakrishnan Mr Singh said some people have shared that they would use the TraceTogether app to gain entry to a place, but turn off their Bluetooth immediately afterwards. This shows that a high level of downloads of the app does not necessarily translate to a high degree of usage, he noted. ""It is therefore open to question whether the efficacy of TraceTogether for contact tracing could be compromised because of the Government's belated explanation on the use of TraceTogether data for investigative purposes."" Mr Singh then gave several suggestions on how the Government could counter scepticism and replace it with trust and cooperation. It should be forthcoming, without prompting, in informing the public about what data it collects, as well as how it ensures the robustness and integrity of its processes, he said. The Government should also ensure that the laws reassure Singapore citizens and residents that investigatory powers and data collection are used for legitimate purposes and are subject to rigorous checks that prevent abuses of personal data. He called for a broad review of the state's powers to collect data for the purpose of investigations. Some people have shared that they would use the TraceTogether app to gain entry to a place, but turn off their Bluetooth immediately afterwards. ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO MORE ON THIS TOPIC Bill limiting use of TraceTogether for serious crimes passed with govt assurances data will be protected To check against abuse, a neutral commissioner or ombudsman could be appointed to monitor the use of such powers by the Government, he suggested. He acknowledged the difficulty in holding discussions about data privacy, but warned that not having such conversations, and holding the ""erroneous assumption that continuing down tried and tested routes will suffice"", could lead to worse outcomes like a disunited populace. ""We will all lose if that happens,"" he said. ""Covid-19 is a crisis like no other, but insofar as finding a better balance between policing and privacy, the lessons that have been taught by this TraceTogether episode inform us they are lessons the Government would be wise not to dismiss."" Quote: ""In other words, a Singaporean's right to privacy is better protected with this Bill than without it ,"" he said. wtf is this WP?? disappointed sia. I thought WP will oppose and fight for our privacy. End up become PAP-lite again. PSP opposed but still not gonna support them cos they associate themselves with preetipls."

The plan is to eventually replace every lamp post in the island. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...lives-10229804 Quote: SINGAPORE: An ambitious project is underway to equip lamp posts in Singapore with various capabilities to improve urban planning - serving to be more than just a light source. A trial by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) and the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) will start next year in Geylang and One-North. This is part of Singapore\x92s Smart Nation Sensor Platform project, which could see all of Singapore\x92s 110,000 lamp posts fitted with a network of wireless sensors, to transform them into ""smart lamp posts"". For example, environmental sensors could potentially be added to monitor rainfall, humidity and temperature, and noise sensors to detect unusually loud sounds, such as a person screaming or a car crash. With video sensors, it would be possible to incorporate facial recognition systems. Navigational beacons could also be mounted to direct autonomous vehicles while speed-trap sensors could be used to track speeding bicycles or personal mobility devices."

Opposition MPs press for details on Govt's error on use of TraceTogether data Parliament screengrabs Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (left) and Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan (right) in Parliament on Feb 2, 2021. Opposition party members wanted details on why the Government took so long to disclose that TraceTogether data can be used in criminal investigations Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh said details were needed so the public would regain trust in the Government Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said he was aware that he misspoke only in late October last year Progress Singapore Party\x92s Leong Mun Wai said the Government was making a bad tradeoff between public trust and public health and safety Dr Balakrishnan said he should avoid false dichotomies such as choosing between saving a child\x92s life and the public benefit of digital contact tracing SINGAPORE \x97 Opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) pressed Foreign Affairs MinisterVivian Balakrishnan in Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 2) for details on how he made an error in not stating that data from the TraceTogether contact-tracing programme can be used in criminal investigations. They also asked Dr Balakrishnan, who is Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, why it took so long for the Government to come clean that such data can be used for purposes other than fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, given that blanket assurances were given from at least the middle of last year. The opposition MPs noted that the police had even managed to access data from TraceTogether when investigating a murder that occurred in May last year. They were speaking during the debate on the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill that would restrict the use of personal contact-tracing data to investigating seven types of serious crimes. Among them was Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh who said that the details were needed so that some Singaporeans would regain their trust in the Government. He asked for the exact date when Dr Balakrishnan knew that Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) \x97 which empowers the police to access specific data necessary for the investigation of crime \x97 would apply to TraceTogether. He also questioned if Dr Balakrishnan had known that the CPC would apply to TraceTogether before Mr Christopher de Souza, MP for Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency (GRC), filed a parliamentary question in late December that eventually brought the error to light on Jan 4 this year. Mr Singh, the secretary-general of the Workers\x92 Party (WP) and MP for Aljunied GRC, said that the answers would allow the public to pinpoint whether the Government could have corrected the position and updated the public on its own initiative. His fellow Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim, who is WP chairman, separately asked: \x93The bigger question is: For all these months, why did no one in the Government step forward to correct the misrepresentation that TraceTogether was fully ring-fenced for Covid-19 tracing?\x94 Mr Leong Mun Wai, Non-Constituency MP (NCMP) of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), asked when the police first accessed the data, and whether they*had considered that they would be breaking a promise that the Government had given to limit such data to contact tracing. HE REALISED HIS MISTAKE IN LATE OCTOBER In answering these queries, Dr Balakrishnan said he became aware that what he said was wrong at the end of October last year, after a member of the public had asked if he was sure that CPC would not apply, even for a murder case. At that time, he got a staff member to check the legal provisions. That was when he was informed that CPC applied and that the police had already requested TraceTogether data on one occasion. In the month that followed, he said that he had many sleepless nights, double-checked the legislation and engaged in several rounds of discussions with senior Cabinet members to deliberate on whether and how the use of TraceTogether data should be carved out from the CPC. Aware that he had given an assurance in June last year, he also told a staff member then that \x93regardless of the outcome of this internal review... we will clarify\x94. So he took the opportunity to do so when Mr de Souza filed a related parliamentary question last December. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State for Home Affairs, said that the police first accessed TraceTogether data when investigating a murder that occurred in May last year, adding that it was in line with the police\x92s powers under the CPC. However, investigators were unable to get any useful data because the TraceTogether app was not installed on the suspect\x92s phone, Mr Tan added. Having tabled the Bill on behalf of Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, Dr Balakrishnan said on Tuesday: \x93I am sharing this with you so that you\x92ll understand that there is nothing to hide. The CPC is written law. But I should have been aware, and I should have made it clear right from the onset. I\x92ve reflected that if, in June, I had added four words, \x91subject to prevailing legislation\x92, perhaps we wouldn\x92t be here this afternoon. Nevertheless, it has occurred.\x94 AVOID FALSE DICHOTOMIES, MINISTER WARNS During the debate, which lasted more than four hours, Mr Singh said that WP is prepared to support the Bill for the reason that the exceptional criminal cases identified in the Bill do not cover the wide ambit of Section 20 of the CPC. Mr Leong, in stating that PSP objects to the Bill, went a step further to say that the Government would compromise public health and public trust for some benefit in public safety by passing the Bill in its current form. \x93PSP is not objecting to this Bill for the sake of objecting,\x94 he said. \x93We have thought of supporting it with some changes. But to trade off public trust in public health measures, which must be of utmost priority in a pandemic crisis, for public safety is too much to give for us after much consideration.\x94 Mr Leong\x92s point drew a question from Leader of the House Indranee Rajah who wanted to know if PSP\x92s position would be to leave TraceTogether data untapped in the scenario that a child was kidnapped and there were no other signs of evidence except for the data. Replying in the affirmative, Mr Leong said: \x93Of course, in many of the decisions that we make, there is a tradeoff\x85 What you say is that public trust plus the needs of public health, both of these benefits are less than the benefits that you draw, or you expect to draw, from public safety. \x94Ms Indranee, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister\x92s Office, retorted: \x93He is right. There is a tradeoff, but we will not trade a child\x92s life for something like that.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan warned against false dichotomies along this line of reasoning, reiterating that it was better for the Government to be transparent and fix the error rather than double down on the mistake. \x93False dichotomies I\x92ve heard today is that you have to choose between saving the life of a child and participation in digital contact tracing,\x94 he said. \x93I believe, by being completely open, transparent, answering every question, explaining, and letting people see the purpose behind what we're doing and why we're doing it, I believe we can avoid this dichotomy.\x94 He also said that one of the reasons that Singapore is better off than other countries when it comes to the Covid-19 situation is because the country\x92s response had not been politicised. \x93And I am grateful to Mr Singh and the Workers\x92 Party that, unlike in other countries where wearing a mask or not wearing a mask is a badge of political identity, we have avoided that kind of political dichotomies,\x94 he added. \x93So for people who are angry or disappointed in my mistake, you're entitled to do that. But don't deprive yourself and your loved ones of the protection from this system.\x94 Before the debate closed, Mr Leong asked what was behind the minister\x92s decision in making the tradeoff, saying agin: \x93It is about one victim versus thousands of possible dropouts from the TraceTogether programme.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan said: \x93That\x92s why I referred to false dichotomies. In contrast to you, the Workers\x92 Party, in my view, has taken a more responsible position that so long as you can envisage certain extreme, serious offences for which you need to make an exception, then this Bill, with its construction, is necessary. \x94He continued: \x93If you vote against the Bill, then the status quo applies. And the status quo is that the CPC has licence over this data as well. So, I would still appeal to your good sense and your sense of responsibility to the nation to do the right thing.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan stressed that by making the admission of his own error, it was not politically expedient or convenient, but it was the right thing to do. \x93I thank the Workers\x92 Party for standing with us and doing the right thing in the midst of a crisis. I hope PSP can do likewise, but that's your decision,\x94 he added. Mr Leong and fellow PSP member Hazel Poa, who is also an NCMP, still opposed the Bill and said \x93no\x94 when the vote was taken, and the Bill was passed. https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...09102018_today"

I pondered over this for quite a while. Why didn\x92t VV release a statement immediately in Oct when he first found out? Let me guess. He could be trying to study the law to see if the police access is indeed cast in stone. In another words, find something to prevent their access to let his original statement stick. Save his backside first. When he realized there was no case, making a statement would guarantee it\x92s done deal. Putting it forward for discussion in parliament, however, gave him another chance to erect a bill, change the law, etc, to let TT purpose remain as contact tracing only.

Opposition party members wanted details on why the Government took so long to disclose that TraceTogether data can be used in criminal investigations Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh said details were needed so the public would regain trust in the Government Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said he was aware that he misspoke only in late October last year Progress Singapore Party\x92s Leong Mun Wai said the Government was making a bad tradeoff between public trust and public health and safety Dr Balakrishnan said he should avoid false dichotomies such as choosing between saving a child\x92s life and the public benefit of digital contact tracing SINGAPORE \x97 Opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) pressed Foreign Affairs MinisterVivian Balakrishnan in Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 2) for details on how he made an error in not stating that data from the TraceTogether contact-tracing programme can be used in criminal investigations. They also asked Dr Balakrishnan, who is Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, why it took so long for the Government to come clean that such data can be used for purposes other than fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, given that blanket assurances were given from at least the middle of last year. The opposition MPs noted that the police had even managed to access data from TraceTogether when investigating a murder that occurred in May last year. They were speaking during the debate on the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill that would restrict the use of personal contact-tracing data to investigating seven types of serious crimes. Among them was Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh who said that the details were needed so that some Singaporeans would regain their trust in the Government. He asked for the exact date when Dr Balakrishnan knew that Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) \x97 which empowers the police to access specific data necessary for the investigation of crime \x97 would apply to TraceTogether. He also questioned if Dr Balakrishnan had known that the CPC would apply to TraceTogether before Mr Christopher de Souza, MP for Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency (GRC), filed a parliamentary question in late December that eventually brought the error to light on Jan 4 this year. Mr Singh, the secretary-general of the Workers\x92 Party (WP) and MP for Aljunied GRC, said that the answers would allow the public to pinpoint whether the Government could have corrected the position and updated the public on its own initiative. His fellow Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim, who is WP chairman, separately asked: \x93The bigger question is: For all these months, why did no one in the Government step forward to correct the misrepresentation that TraceTogether was fully ring-fenced for Covid-19 tracing?\x94 Mr Leong Mun Wai, Non-Constituency MP (NCMP) of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), asked when the police first accessed the data, and whether they*had considered that they would be breaking a promise that the Government had given to limit such data to contact tracing. HE REALISED HIS MISTAKE IN LATE OCTOBER In answering these queries, Dr Balakrishnan said he became aware that what he said was wrong at the end of October last year, after a member of the public had asked if he was sure that CPC would not apply, even for a murder case. At that time, he got a staff member to check the legal provisions. That was when he was informed that CPC applied and that the police had already requested TraceTogether data on one occasion. In the month that followed, he said that he had many sleepless nights, double-checked the legislation and engaged in several rounds of discussions with senior Cabinet members to deliberate on whether and how the use of TraceTogether data should be carved out from the CPC. Aware that he had given an assurance in June last year, he also told a staff member then that \x93regardless of the outcome of this internal review... we will clarify\x94. So he took the opportunity to do so when Mr de Souza filed a related parliamentary question last December. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State for Home Affairs, said that the police first accessed TraceTogether data when investigating a murder that occurred in May last year, adding that it was in line with the police\x92s powers under the CPC. However, investigators were unable to get any useful data because the TraceTogether app was not installed on the suspect\x92s phone, Mr Tan added. Having tabled the Bill on behalf of Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, Dr Balakrishnan said on Tuesday: \x93I am sharing this with you so that you\x92ll understand that there is nothing to hide. The CPC is written law. But I should have been aware, and I should have made it clear right from the onset. I\x92ve reflected that if, in June, I had added four words, \x91subject to prevailing legislation\x92, perhaps we wouldn\x92t be here this afternoon. Nevertheless, it has occurred.\x94 AVOID FALSE DICHOTOMIES, MINISTER WARNS During the debate, which lasted more than four hours, Mr Singh said that WP is prepared to support the Bill for the reason that the exceptional criminal cases identified in the Bill do not cover the wide ambit of Section 20 of the CPC. Mr Leong, in stating that PSP objects to the Bill, went a step further to say that the Government would compromise public health and public trust for some benefit in public safety by passing the Bill in its current form. \x93PSP is not objecting to this Bill for the sake of objecting,\x94 he said. \x93We have thought of supporting it with some changes. But to trade off public trust in public health measures, which must be of utmost priority in a pandemic crisis, for public safety is too much to give for us after much consideration.\x94 Mr Leong\x92s point drew a question from Leader of the House Indranee Rajah who wanted to know if PSP\x92s position would be to leave TraceTogether data untapped in the scenario that a child was kidnapped and there were no other signs of evidence except for the data. Replying in the affirmative, Mr Leong said: \x93Of course, in many of the decisions that we make, there is a tradeoff\x85 What you say is that public trust plus the needs of public health, both of these benefits are less than the benefits that you draw, or you expect to draw, from public safety. \x94Ms Indranee, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister\x92s Office, retorted: \x93He is right. There is a tradeoff, but we will not trade a child\x92s life for something like that.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan warned against false dichotomies along this line of reasoning, reiterating that it was better for the Government to be transparent and fix the error rather than double down on the mistake. \x93False dichotomies I\x92ve heard today is that you have to choose between saving the life of a child and participation in digital contact tracing,\x94 he said. \x93I believe, by being completely open, transparent, answering every question, explaining, and letting people see the purpose behind what we're doing and why we're doing it, I believe we can avoid this dichotomy.\x94 He also said that one of the reasons that Singapore is better off than other countries when it comes to the Covid-19 situation is because the country\x92s response had not been politicised. \x93And I am grateful to Mr Singh and the Workers\x92 Party that, unlike in other countries where wearing a mask or not wearing a mask is a badge of political identity, we have avoided that kind of political dichotomies,\x94 he added. \x93So for people who are angry or disappointed in my mistake, you're entitled to do that. But don't deprive yourself and your loved ones of the protection from this system.\x94 Before the debate closed, Mr Leong asked what was behind the minister\x92s decision in making the tradeoff, saying agin: \x93It is about one victim versus thousands of possible dropouts from the TraceTogether programme.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan said: \x93That\x92s why I referred to false dichotomies. In contrast to you, the Workers\x92 Party, in my view, has taken a more responsible position that so long as you can envisage certain extreme, serious offences for which you need to make an exception, then this Bill, with its construction, is necessary. \x94He continued: \x93If you vote against the Bill, then the status quo applies. And the status quo is that the CPC has licence over this data as well. So, I would still appeal to your good sense and your sense of responsibility to the nation to do the right thing.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan stressed that by making the admission of his own error, it was not politically expedient or convenient, but it was the right thing to do. \x93I thank the Workers\x92 Party for standing with us and doing the right thing in the midst of a crisis. I hope PSP can do likewise, but that's your decision,\x94 he added. Mr Leong and fellow PSP member Hazel Poa, who is also an NCMP, still opposed the Bill and said \x93no\x94 when the vote was taken, and the Bill was passed. https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...09102018_today"

What process is in place to ensure no abuse? For premeditated crimes, it really takes a goondu criminal to not know how to circumvent TT. If he is so goondu, the police probably don\u2019t need TT data to catch him. Hence, TT data is useless for premeditated crimes. At the end, it is only useful for crimes committed on impulse. Kidnapping, for example, is hardly on impulse. The good thing about this episode is I now know about CPC and police\u2019s data access. Next time, antenna must go up immediately when gov tries to implement any system that tracks. The MOE saga is a concern after all."

Opposition MPs press for details on Govt's error on use of TraceTogether data Parliament screengrabs Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (left) and Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan (right) in Parliament on Feb 2, 2021. Opposition party members wanted details on why the Government took so long to disclose that TraceTogether data can be used in criminal investigations Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh said details were needed so the public would regain trust in the Government Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said he was aware that he misspoke only in late October last year Progress Singapore Party\x92s Leong Mun Wai said the Government was making a bad tradeoff between public trust and public health and safety Dr Balakrishnan said he should avoid false dichotomies such as choosing between saving a child\x92s life and the public benefit of digital contact tracing SINGAPORE \x97 Opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) pressed Foreign Affairs MinisterVivian Balakrishnan in Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 2) for details on how he made an error in not stating that data from the TraceTogether contact-tracing programme can be used in criminal investigations. They also asked Dr Balakrishnan, who is Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, why it took so long for the Government to come clean that such data can be used for purposes other than fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, given that blanket assurances were given from at least the middle of last year. The opposition MPs noted that the police had even managed to access data from TraceTogether when investigating a murder that occurred in May last year. They were speaking during the debate on the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill that would restrict the use of personal contact-tracing data to investigating seven types of serious crimes. Among them was Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh who said that the details were needed so that some Singaporeans would regain their trust in the Government. He asked for the exact date when Dr Balakrishnan knew that Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) \x97 which empowers the police to access specific data necessary for the investigation of crime \x97 would apply to TraceTogether. He also questioned if Dr Balakrishnan had known that the CPC would apply to TraceTogether before Mr Christopher de Souza, MP for Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency (GRC), filed a parliamentary question in late December that eventually brought the error to light on Jan 4 this year. Mr Singh, the secretary-general of the Workers\x92 Party (WP) and MP for Aljunied GRC, said that the answers would allow the public to pinpoint whether the Government could have corrected the position and updated the public on its own initiative. His fellow Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim, who is WP chairman, separately asked: \x93The bigger question is: For all these months, why did no one in the Government step forward to correct the misrepresentation that TraceTogether was fully ring-fenced for Covid-19 tracing?\x94 Mr Leong Mun Wai, Non-Constituency MP (NCMP) of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), asked when the police first accessed the data, and whether they*had considered that they would be breaking a promise that the Government had given to limit such data to contact tracing.

I\x92ve reflected that if, in June, I had added four words, \x91subject to prevailing legislation\x92, perhaps we wouldn\x92t be here this afternoon. Nevertheless, it has occurred.\x94 AVOID FALSE DICHOTOMIES, MINISTER WARNS During the debate, which lasted more than four hours, Mr Singh said that WP is prepared to support the Bill for the reason that the exceptional criminal cases identified in the Bill do not cover the wide ambit of Section 20 of the CPC. Mr Leong, in stating that PSP objects to the Bill, went a step further to say that the Government would compromise public health and public trust for some benefit in public safety by passing the Bill in its current form. \x93PSP is not objecting to this Bill for the sake of objecting,\x94 he said. \x93We have thought of supporting it with some changes. But to trade off public trust in public health measures, which must be of utmost priority in a pandemic crisis, for public safety is too much to give for us after much consideration.\x94 Mr Leong\x92s point drew a question from Leader of the House Indranee Rajah who wanted to know if PSP\x92s position would be to leave TraceTogether data untapped in the scenario that a child was kidnapped and there were no other signs of evidence except for the data. Replying in the affirmative, Mr Leong said: \x93Of course, in many of the decisions that we make, there is a tradeoff\x85 What you say is that public trust plus the needs of public health, both of these benefits are less than the benefits that you draw, or you expect to draw, from public safety. \x94Ms Indranee, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister\x92s Office, retorted: \x93He is right. There is a tradeoff, but we will not trade a child\x92s life for something like that.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan warned against false dichotomies along this line of reasoning, reiterating that it was better for the Government to be transparent and fix the error rather than double down on the mistake. \x93False dichotomies I\x92ve heard today is that you have to choose between saving the life of a child and participation in digital contact tracing,\x94 he said. \x93I believe, by being completely open, transparent, answering every question, explaining, and letting people see the purpose behind what we're doing and why we're doing it, I believe we can avoid this dichotomy.\x94 He also said that one of the reasons that Singapore is better off than other countries when it comes to the Covid-19 situation is because the country\x92s response had not been politicised. \x93And I am grateful to Mr Singh and the Workers\x92 Party that, unlike in other countries where wearing a mask or not wearing a mask is a badge of political identity, we have avoided that kind of political dichotomies,\x94 he added. \x93So for people who are angry or disappointed in my mistake, you're entitled to do that. But don't deprive yourself and your loved ones of the protection from this system.\x94 Before the debate closed, Mr Leong asked what was behind the minister\x92s decision in making the tradeoff, saying agin: \x93It is about one victim versus thousands of possible dropouts from the TraceTogether programme.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan said: \x93That\x92s why I referred to false dichotomies. In contrast to you, the Workers\x92 Party, in my view, has taken a more responsible position that so long as you can envisage certain extreme, serious offences for which you need to make an exception, then this Bill, with its construction, is necessary. \x94He continued: \x93If you vote against the Bill, then the status quo applies. And the status quo is that the CPC has licence over this data as well. So, I would still appeal to your good sense and your sense of responsibility to the nation to do the right thing.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan stressed that by making the admission of his own error, it was not politically expedient or convenient, but it was the right thing to do. \x93I thank the Workers\x92 Party for standing with us and doing the right thing in the midst of a crisis. I hope PSP can do likewise, but that's your decision,\x94 he added. Mr Leong and fellow PSP member Hazel Poa, who is also an NCMP, still opposed the Bill and said \x93no\x94 when the vote was taken, and the Bill was passed. https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...09102018_today"

I pondered over this for quite a while. Why didn\x92t VV release a statement immediately in Oct when he first found out? Let me guess. He could be trying to study the law to see if the police access is indeed cast in stone. In another words, find something to prevent their access to let his original statement stick. Save his backside first. When he realized there was no case, making a statement would guarantee it\x92s done deal. Putting it forward for discussion in parliament, however, gave him another chance to erect a bill, change the law, etc, to let TT purpose remain as contact tracing only. Alas, only Pritam and WP zuo gang. The rest of the team members kooning.

By redundant, I meant police don\x92t need to be granted access since they have other traditional tools to use. They have been solving crimes in the past without TT, so this can carry on. And yes, frivolous use is a concern as that infringes privacy to he core. If they did not build in the system to track every access (Read timestamp, user, record, etc), the access information would be lost."

Opposition party members wanted details on why the Government took so long to disclose that TraceTogether data can be used in criminal investigations Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh said details were needed so the public would regain trust in the Government Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said he was aware that he misspoke only in late October last year Progress Singapore Party\x92s Leong Mun Wai said the Government was making a bad tradeoff between public trust and public health and safety Dr Balakrishnan said he should avoid false dichotomies such as choosing between saving a child\x92s life and the public benefit of digital contact tracing SINGAPORE \x97 Opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) pressed Foreign Affairs MinisterVivian Balakrishnan in Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 2) for details on how he made an error in not stating that data from the TraceTogether contact-tracing programme can be used in criminal investigations. They also asked Dr Balakrishnan, who is Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, why it took so long for the Government to come clean that such data can be used for purposes other than fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, given that blanket assurances were given from at least the middle of last year. The opposition MPs noted that the police had even managed to access data from TraceTogether when investigating a murder that occurred in May last year. They were speaking during the debate on the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill that would restrict the use of personal contact-tracing data to investigating seven types of serious crimes. Among them was Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh who said that the details were needed so that some Singaporeans would regain their trust in the Government. He asked for the exact date when Dr Balakrishnan knew that Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) \x97 which empowers the police to access specific data necessary for the investigation of crime \x97 would apply to TraceTogether. He also questioned if Dr Balakrishnan had known that the CPC would apply to TraceTogether before Mr Christopher de Souza, MP for Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency (GRC), filed a parliamentary question in late December that eventually brought the error to light on Jan 4 this year. Mr Singh, the secretary-general of the Workers\x92 Party (WP) and MP for Aljunied GRC, said that the answers would allow the public to pinpoint whether the Government could have corrected the position and updated the public on its own initiative. His fellow Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim, who is WP chairman, separately asked: \x93The bigger question is: For all these months, why did no one in the Government step forward to correct the misrepresentation that TraceTogether was fully ring-fenced for Covid-19 tracing?\x94 Mr Leong Mun Wai, Non-Constituency MP (NCMP) of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), asked when the police first accessed the data, and whether they*had considered that they would be breaking a promise that the Government had given to limit such data to contact tracing. HE REALISED HIS MISTAKE IN LATE OCTOBER In answering these queries, Dr Balakrishnan said he became aware that what he said was wrong at the end of October last year, after a member of the public had asked if he was sure that CPC would not apply, even for a murder case. At that time, he got a staff member to check the legal provisions. That was when he was informed that CPC applied and that the police had already requested TraceTogether data on one occasion. In the month that followed, he said that he had many sleepless nights, double-checked the legislation and engaged in several rounds of discussions with senior Cabinet members to deliberate on whether and how the use of TraceTogether data should be carved out from the CPC. Aware that he had given an assurance in June last year, he also told a staff member then that \x93regardless of the outcome of this internal review... we will clarify\x94. So he took the opportunity to do so when Mr de Souza filed a related parliamentary question last December. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State for Home Affairs, said that the police first accessed TraceTogether data when investigating a murder that occurred in May last year, adding that it was in line with the police\x92s powers under the CPC. However, investigators were unable to get any useful data because the TraceTogether app was not installed on the suspect\x92s phone, Mr Tan added. Having tabled the Bill on behalf of Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, Dr Balakrishnan said on Tuesday: \x93I am sharing this with you so that you\x92ll understand that there is nothing to hide. The CPC is written law. But I should have been aware, and I should have made it clear right from the onset. I\x92ve reflected that if, in June, I had added four words, \x91subject to prevailing legislation\x92, perhaps we wouldn\x92t be here this afternoon. Nevertheless, it has occurred.\x94 AVOID FALSE DICHOTOMIES, MINISTER WARNS During the debate, which lasted more than four hours, Mr Singh said that WP is prepared to support the Bill for the reason that the exceptional criminal cases identified in the Bill do not cover the wide ambit of Section 20 of the CPC. Mr Leong, in stating that PSP objects to the Bill, went a step further to say that the Government would compromise public health and public trust for some benefit in public safety by passing the Bill in its current form. \x93PSP is not objecting to this Bill for the sake of objecting,\x94 he said. \x93We have thought of supporting it with some changes. But to trade off public trust in public health measures, which must be of utmost priority in a pandemic crisis, for public safety is too much to give for us after much consideration.\x94 Mr Leong\x92s point drew a question from Leader of the House Indranee Rajah who wanted to know if PSP\x92s position would be to leave TraceTogether data untapped in the scenario that a child was kidnapped and there were no other signs of evidence except for the data. Replying in the affirmative, Mr Leong said: \x93Of course, in many of the decisions that we make, there is a tradeoff\x85 What you say is that public trust plus the needs of public health, both of these benefits are less than the benefits that you draw, or you expect to draw, from public safety. \x94Ms Indranee, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister\x92s Office, retorted: \x93He is right. There is a tradeoff, but we will not trade a child\x92s life for something like that.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan warned against false dichotomies along this line of reasoning, reiterating that it was better for the Government to be transparent and fix the error rather than double down on the mistake. \x93False dichotomies I\x92ve heard today is that you have to choose between saving the life of a child and participation in digital contact tracing,\x94 he said. \x93I believe, by being completely open, transparent, answering every question, explaining, and letting people see the purpose behind what we're doing and why we're doing it, I believe we can avoid this dichotomy.\x94 He also said that one of the reasons that Singapore is better off than other countries when it comes to the Covid-19 situation is because the country\x92s response had not been politicised. \x93And I am grateful to Mr Singh and the Workers\x92 Party that, unlike in other countries where wearing a mask or not wearing a mask is a badge of political identity, we have avoided that kind of political dichotomies,\x94 he added. \x93So for people who are angry or disappointed in my mistake, you're entitled to do that. But don't deprive yourself and your loved ones of the protection from this system.\x94 Before the debate closed, Mr Leong asked what was behind the minister\x92s decision in making the tradeoff, saying agin: \x93It is about one victim versus thousands of possible dropouts from the TraceTogether programme.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan said: \x93That\x92s why I referred to false dichotomies. In contrast to you, the Workers\x92 Party, in my view, has taken a more responsible position that so long as you can envisage certain extreme, serious offences for which you need to make an exception, then this Bill, with its construction, is necessary. \x94He continued: \x93If you vote against the Bill, then the status quo applies. And the status quo is that the CPC has licence over this data as well. So, I would still appeal to your good sense and your sense of responsibility to the nation to do the right thing.\x94 Dr Balakrishnan stressed that by making the admission of his own error, it was not politically expedient or convenient, but it was the right thing to do. \x93I thank the Workers\x92 Party for standing with us and doing the right thing in the midst of a crisis. I hope PSP can do likewise, but that's your decision,\x94 he added. Mr Leong and fellow PSP member Hazel Poa, who is also an NCMP, still opposed the Bill and said \x93no\x94 when the vote was taken, and the Bill was passed. https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...09102018_today"

What process is in place to ensure no abuse? For premeditated crimes, it really takes a goondu criminal to not know how to circumvent TT. If he is so goondu, the police probably don\u2019t need TT data to catch him. Hence, TT data is useless for premeditated crimes. At the end, it is only useful for crimes committed on impulse. Kidnapping, for example, is hardly on impulse. The good thing about this episode is I now know about CPC and police\u2019s data access.

However, over 390,000 people have come on board the system during the same period, said Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, in Parliament on Tuesday (2 February). \u201cEvery one of that 350 who has requested us to delete (their data) is a source of regret for me. Because at least 350 have, for a variety of reasons, decided to forgo the protection that TraceTogether offers them and their loved ones,\u201d he said. Dr Balakrishnan was replying to queries from fellow Members of Parliament during the second reading of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Amendment Bill. The Bill, which was later passed on the same day, seeks to \u2013 among other things \u2013 defines that the authorities can only access data from the TT, SafeEntry and BluePass systems only for the purpose of contact tracing or the investigation of serious criminal offences. It comes following the public outcry over the revelation during a Parliament session in January that TT data can be used under the Criminal Procedure Code to give police access to such information. The consternation also arose as Dr Balakrishnan assured during a Multi-Ministry Taskforce press conference in June last year that TT data would only be used for contact tracing. Emphasising that the TT take-up rate in January was a sign that the public still has faith in the system, Dr Balakrishnan said, \u201cI don't want to belabour this but my simple conclusion or inference is that Singaporeans know that I misspoke, but they also trust that the TraceTogether system is safe.\u201d Responding to concerns raised by several Members of Parliament as to whether the Bill would set a precedent for how the government makes use of data from digital solutions in the future, Dr Balakrishnan assured the House that this would not be the case. \u201cOur decision today to only include serious offences, to tightly scope the use of personal contact tracing data, is a a result of a delicate balance between the right to public health, the right to public security and respecting the sensitivity of personal data...This Bill is about ensuring maximum support from the public in our fight against COVID-19. I want to stress this Bill is not a precedent,\u201d he said. Noting that issues such as privacy and data governance are broad and complex, Dr Balakrishnan said they would need careful contemplation, consultation and open debate to be addressed. \u201cThis should not be settled on a Certificate of Emergency in one day. There will be proper occasions in the future to do this,\u201d he added."

(1) TT token is useless as most bag come with RFID safe pockets (2) When you go to mall or shop, shopper need to take your token and scan.... So, instead of contact tracing, it only encourage contact transmit of virus... Lastly, everyday import cases, but they're trying contact tracing own citizen... Also, PR who come in, clear SHN, lepak and then found with virus when want to go home, is considered imported case.... like that, why need TT????"

Since its launch, TraceTogether has achieved a 20% population adoption rate with 1.1 million users, with half of those coming in the first 24 hours alone. We continue to hope that the people of Singapore join us in supporting our frontline healthcare workers and contact tracers, who are the pillars of our community's response to COVID-19. Our journey, like everyone else's, has been filled with ups and downs. On launch day, we had 385 cases of COVID-19 on our island. Today, there are 8,014. \U0001f62d So much has happened in one short month. We have benefited from our discussions with other teams building digital contact tracing solutions around the world, and have learnt so much along the way; where we are able to, we have shared our experiences and the thinking behind the decisions that informed our product design and architectural choices, as well. The Apple and Google collaboration on digital contact tracing solutions, is a game-changer, as we said previously. It will significantly improve the contact tracing capability available to governments and public health authorities over what is available through public APIs on either Android or iOS platforms. We are glad that Apple and Google are engaging governments and public health authorities around the world, including us, to incorporate feedback as the specifications for their contract tracing protocol and private APIs. We will continue to work with both companies to improve our digital contact tracing app, TraceTogether to support Singapore's pandemic response. We will also contribute that work back to the global software community when it is complete, so that it too can help others. - Team TraceTogether A team of thinkers and doers working with code, pixels and people"

He hasn't asked for forgiveness or apologized. I personally think apologizing is not a sign a weakness, it's a sign of further integrity and honesty. If he had apologized, it would've been better, and I think would reduce people's anger further. Same principle applies, to me, in my course of work, if I make a mistake, I would admit, apologize, correct the error. He admits and corrects the error, but hasn't uttered the word ""I apologize / I'm sorry"". I wish that he could say this."

"Bill introduced to spell out use of TraceTogether, SafeEntry data for investigations",01-02-2021 10:47 PM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/bill-introduced-spell-out-use-tracetogether-safeentry-data-investigations-6458346.html,132309107,01-02-2021  10:09 PM,"An amendment to temporary Covid-19 laws tabled in Parliament on Monday (Feb 1) spells out how the Government is allowed to use contact-tracing data, formalising assurances set out earlier by government leaders on its use.For instance, users whose data is needed for contact tracing or criminal investigations will be asked to surrender their TraceTogether token or submit their data by entering a personal identification number.The Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill was tabled by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, on behalf of Law Minister K Shanmugam under a certificate of urgency signed by President Halimah Yacob. This allows the legislation to be fast-tracked in a single parliamentary sitting. It will be debated in the House on Tuesday. The revelation in Parliament last month that the police may obtain data from TraceTogether, a key contact-tracing tool, for criminal investigations under the Criminal Procedure Code upset some people, as the Government had earlier assured the public that the data would be used solely for contact tracing to combat Covid-19. The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said that more than 84 per cent of Singapore\u2019s population have downloaded the TraceTogether mobile application or collected the TraceTogether token. With data from these digital tools, the average time it takes to identify a Covid-19 patient\u2019s close contacts has been cut from an average of four days to less than one-and-a-half days. WHY IT MATTERS - The law, if passed, gives legal force to the authorities\u2019 commitments that data from TraceTogether and the SafeEntry check-in system may be used only for contact tracing, except when there is a pressing need to use such data for criminal investigations into serious offences - The draft laws also specify that after the pandemic ends, public agencies must stop collecting contact-tracing data and delete any personalised contact-tracing information collected \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable\u201d - The authorities hope the legislation will encourage the public to continue taking part in the TraceTogether programme by removing any doubt about the purpose and use of the data HOW YOUR DATA WILL BE PROTECTED The law applies to contact-tracing data that will identify an individual. It does not cover anonymised or aggregate data recorded by these systems.It will apply to all data collected through TraceTogether and SafeEntry since the programmes were launched early last year. Under the amendments, any public officer or contractor found guilty of unauthorised use or disclosure of personal contact-tracing data can be fined up to S$20,000 or jailed up to two years, or punished with both. No other law can override this legislation when it pertains to the use or disclosure of personal contact-tracing data.Once the pandemic ebbs, the TraceTogether and SafeEntry programmes will be stood down. WHAT DATA IS PROTECTED There are safeguards in place to protect the data of users. TraceTogether exchanges Bluetooth signals with other users who are nearby to track people exposed to confirmed Covid-19 cases. - The data is encrypted and stored on a user\u2019s device. It is automatically deleted after 25 days - If data is needed for contact tracing or criminal investigations, users will be asked to surrender their token or submit their data by entering a personal identification number SafeEntry keeps a log of a person\u2019s visits to certain public places. - The data is encrypted and stored on a government server. It is also automatically deleted after 25 days - Data needed for contact tracing or criminal investigations will be retained until it is \u201cdeemed no longer necessary\u201d, SNDGG said BluePass is a contact-tracing token distributed to more than 500,000 migrant and resident workers housed in dormitories as well as those in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors. - The tokens work similarly to TraceTogether tokens. Users must surrender their tokens if their data is needed for contact tracing or criminal investigations - While the BluePass token is developed by technology firm D\u2019Crypt, which is owned by state investment firm Temasek Holdings, any person who misuses the contact-tracing data will be dealt with under this legislation Parliament must approve the removal of any system from this list of contact-tracing systems covered by the amendment, but the minister may give the go-ahead for more systems to be added. That is because any data added to the list will come with greater safeguards on its use, compared with when it is not on the list. WHAT IS A SERIOUS OFFENCE The police and law enforcement agencies will be allowed to use personal contact-tracing data for seven categories of serious offences: - Those involving the use or possession of corrosive substances, or offensive or dangerous weapons (for example, the possession of firearms or armed robbery with the use of firearms) - Terrorism-related offences under the Terrorism (Suppression of Bombings) Act, Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act, and Terrorism (Suppression of Misuse of Radioactive Material) Act - Crimes where a victim is seriously hurt or killed, such as murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder or voluntarily causing grievous hurt (where the victim\u2019s injury is life-threatening) - Drug trafficking offences that carry the death penalty - Escape from legal custody where there is reasonable belief that the subject will cause imminent harm to others - Kidnapping - Serious sexual offences such as rape or sexual assault by penetration This list cannot be amended without Parliament\u2019s approval. HOW ANONYMISED DATA WILL BE USED As for information collected through TraceTogether or SafeEntry that does not identify an individual, it may be used for other purposes, such as research on the spread and nature of Covid-19 or to monitor the effectiveness of precautions against Covid-19 that businesses have put in place.Although the use of such anonymised data will not be covered under this legislation, public agencies must comply with government instruction manuals and the Public Sector (Governance) Act, which provides a consistent governance framework across Singapore\u2019s public agencies and supports a whole\u2011of\u2011government approach to the delivery of public-sector services. https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...ns-and-contact"

The law will specify government agencies can use contact tracing data only for this purpose, except where there is a need for law enforcement officers to use the data for criminal investigations of serious offenses, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office said in a statement on Monday. Such offenses include murder, terrorism, kidnapping and serious sexual offenses. The move comes after it was disclosed last month the Singapore police can use any data, including data from the widely-adopted contact tracing program, for criminal investigations. The disclosure had generated a public backlash, creating a test of trust for the government, after a minister previously said such data will not be used for any other purposes. \x93The government is introducing this Bill under extraordinary circumstances,\x94 according to the statement. \x93The legislation is intended to remove any doubt about what personal contact tracing data can be used for.\x94 Once the pandemic is over, the government will cease the use of systems currently used for contact tracing, the statement said. Public agencies must then stop collecting such data, and delete the collected personal contact tracing data as soon as practicable. Any public officer, or contractor engaged by a public sector agency, found guilty of unauthorized use or disclosure of personal contact tracing data can be fined up to S$20,000 ($15,044), or sentenced to jail for up to two years, or both. Error Acknowledged The collection of contact tracing data in the first place have already fueled concerns worldwide over privacy issues. Efforts by many countries to use mobile apps have mostly stalled or have been abandoned amid dismal enrollment rates and worries that the technology poses a threat to privacy rights. In Singapore, the government has acknowledged the error in not stating that the data wasn\x92t exempt from Singapore\x92s criminal code. More than 80% of the population in the city-state have either downloaded the contact tracing app or collected the token, according to Monday\x92s statement. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/artic...serious-crimes"

Hong Kong eyes push on mobile phone SIM cards that could stoke privacy fears,31-01-2021 10:36 AM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/hong-kong-eyes-push-mobile-phone-sim-cards-could-stoke-privacy-fears-6457380.html,132279211,31-01-2021  10:36 AM,"MMMmmmmmmmm.... we have been doing this all this while https://www.reuters.com/article/hong...-idUSL4N2K42PN HONG KONG, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong is canvassing public opinion over a real-name registration system for mobile phone SIM cards, in a bid to fight crime in the Chinese-ruled city, it said on Friday, a move that is likely to stoke concerns over privacy. Many countries have such registration systems, but some people in Hong Kong fear such a change could assist a crackdown on dissent that began with Beijing\x92s imposition of a sweeping national security law last year. Currently only mobile users on SIM service contracts must register actual personal details in Hong Kong, though anyone can buy a pre-paid SIM card from most convenience stores. The rule aims to keep criminals from concealing their identities and put a stop to a \x93common tool used...in committing serious and violent crimes that threaten public safety,\x94 the government said in a statement. It has set a Feb. 28 deadline for comment on the proposed compulsory registration, which would require users to furnish full names and an identity document. In recent months, China has bolstered its security apparatus in the former British colony, creating a security agency with broad powers beyond the scrutiny of the courts. The tighter measures come despite the promise of a high degree of autonomy from Beijing when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Hong Kong has one of Asia\x92s highest smartphone penetration rates, at almost 80% of its population of 7.5 million. Its only regional peers are other developed economies, such as Singapore and South Korea. In 2019, Hong Kong had about 14.5 million pre-paid SIM card subscribers, an increase of 16.6% on the year, says German database firm Statista."

This is because Android/Google requires that apps requesting access to Bluetooth also obtain location permission, as Bluetooth can be used to derive location information when combined with beacons in fixed locations. For more information, please see: https://developer.android.com/guide/...vity/bluetooth In short, we do ask for location permissions because we need Bluetooth permissions.

Don't give the nazi pap reason to find trouble with you. Here, let me teach you the best method. Firstly, get an android phone and install tracetogether app. Then isolate (or ""island"") the tt app. There are apps out there who can not only isolate, but also quick freeze/unfreeze the isolated app. For thouse in doubt, the tracetogether app works fine when isolated. You can still use it as per normal. The whole point of isolating the tracetogether (and even singpass) app is to prevent pap from using these govtech apps, that you are ""forced"" to download and use, to dig and read whatever information in your phone. Isolated apps will be cut off from your phone, and will exist as a mini ""island"" on its own. It retains it's full functionality (bluetooth proximity reading, eg). Promixity reading is not the real concern. The real concern is pap using all these govtech apps like tracetogether and singpass to dig and read information in your phone. That is what you all should be really worried about. Thus isolating the app is the best way to do it. For those pap dogs trying to harp on ""google and facebook"" argument. Firstly, one can choose not to use google or facebook, and their basic needs will not be inconvinenced. Not having tracetogether will be a major disruption to your basic needs in life, as pap has already stated it will force all check-in to use tracetogether only. Also, google and facebook can be sued. Pap, as the ruling party, has full immunity to being sued and also pdpa. Basically pap is not just above the law, they have become the law itself. So no need to uninstall and risk getting into trouble or making your own life difficult. Just use an android phone and isolate the tracetogether app. You will not be breaking any laws, because the tracetogether app will not be affected regarding it's functionality. Isolating just prevents the app from accessing your phone's data freely and maliciously."

Don't give the nazi pap reason to find trouble with you. Here, let me teach you the best method. Firstly, get an android phone and install tracetogether app. Then isolate (or ""island"") the tt app. There are apps out there who can not only isolate, but also quick freeze/unfreeze the isolated app. For thouse in doubt, the tracetogether app works fine when isolated. You can still use it as per normal. The whole point of isolating the tracetogether (and even singpass) app is to prevent pap from using these govtech apps, that you are ""forced"" to download and use, to dig and read whatever information in your phone. Isolated apps will be cut off from your phone, and will exist as a mini ""island"" on its own. It retains it's full functionality (bluetooth proximity reading, eg). Promixity reading is not the real concern. The real concern is pap using all these govtech apps like tracetogether and singpass to dig and read information in your phone. That is what you all should be really worried about. Thus isolating the app is the best way to do it. For those pap dogs trying to harp on ""google and facebook"" argument. Firstly, one can choose not to use google or facebook, and their basic needs will not be inconvinenced. Not having tracetogether will be a major disruption to your basic needs in life, as pap has already stated it will force all check-in to use tracetogether only. Also, google and facebook can be sued. Pap, as the ruling party, has full immunity to being sued and also pdpa. Basically pap is not just above the law, they have become the law itself. So no need to uninstall and risk getting into trouble or making your own life difficult. Just use an android phone and isolate the tracetogether app. You will not be breaking any laws, because the tracetogether app will not be affected regarding it's functionality. Isolating just prevents the app from accessing your phone's data freely and maliciously. Isolating mean force closing? Or need to do another app to control?"

So what the so called isolation app does, e.g. Shelter, it gives you the ability to freeze an app with a shortcut. Shelter allows you to create work profile, which you can freeze all the apps that you placed in that profile."

Can he guarantee 100% that nothing will happen to us? If really got people die he want to take responsibility? Why need rationing? Didn't buy enough for every single citizen? Think if all locals are entitled to it, then its people right to get it as and when people want. Saying such think its also cause they won't get all the stocks for everyone at one go. Thus later if more want to get might not have ready stocks. However if all locals are supposed to be entitled to it, then think by right later stage as they buy more, more supply should be available as more people get vaccinated already, thus less using the later supply. Think just like the mask thing, initially as all rushing for it, enough stocks also become short supply. But later as production are increased and more people stocked up already not all are buying, the market become more saturated, thus the supply become more regular. Not expert but think the play on words probably is so as to 'convince' more to get it earlier instead of later, perhaps so that it can makes the vaccination plan look goods with the huge take up rate upfront, show of people ready support thus they done right maybe."

No need to worry de lah. They will plan accordingly for that. Just like how the participation % figure for the TT app+token hit the target just as SG about to enter Phase 3. Nothing really wrong with how they are doing it. Frontliners first, then the at risk elderly. Eventually general public. All the while, still have to wait for all the ordered shipments to arrive, plus checking/verifying all new medical data. Thus, they cannot just open to general public immediately. Its one approach to just take first for some, even if the true efficacy might not be the purported $ rate as advertised. At least take first. Some ppl just want to take now.

In the 1.5hour interview, it's clearly stated that: 1) the vaccines will be rolled out by phases. i.e.: healthcare, then elderly, then saf etc. It can also coincide with each other. 2) the vaccines are coming in batches. So with that, the approach will be to see how many ppl in 1, matched against 2, then roll out. based on first few batches, they have a %, then they can use that % to do 80/20 rule etc. 1 can always be done before hand. So when 2 arrives, you can match them properly. With this approach, you'll be fine when the rollout goes to population - again it is unlikely to be entire population go queue at once."

And if you still get COVID-19 after you take the jabs, your COVID-19 treatment should be free. Fair?"

All the vaccine does is to make people not get sick, essentially making them asymptomatic. This is true of most other vaccines as well. Currently, nobody knows how long the protection lasts as well, or protection against which strains including any new mutations. A fully vaccinated population does not mean the pandemic is in any way controlled or over."
