Tracetogether App QR Code Reader not working on China-based MI Roms,21-02-2021 06:38 PM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/xiaomi-user-group-391/tracetogether-app-qr-code-reader-not-working-china-based-mi-roms-6418694.html,131100421,28-11-2020  03:02 PM,"Hi all, I have been quite a lot of trouble trying to get Tracetogether's QR Code scanning feature to work. Device is a Xiaomi Note 4X (Hatsune Miku Edition) running MIUI 11 Android 7.0. The scanner won't recognise any QR codes within the app. Strangely, all other apps that have a QR code scanning feature work fine (Grab, Firefox Nightly/Developer Edition, SingPass Mobile, DBS Paylah, MI Camera built in QR code scanner). I have already provisioned all the necessary google services. Tried reinstalling Tracetogether, Google Chrome, Android System Webview but it still doesn't work; anybody encountering the same issue on their China MIUI Roms as well? This problem doesn't occur on the Global MIUI ROM so I am pretty sure something is missing, just can't put my finger to it."

Mine is a K20 with CN rom on Miui 12. The issue settle after Ttacetogether app update. But my issue became crashing of my camera app after a couple of scans with thr app. But camera can work with gcam though.

You'll have to go the playstore to update in order to get it working.

Reflash to lock your bootloader. Seems obvious to me this is your next troubleshooting step."
