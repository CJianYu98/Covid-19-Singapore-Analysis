Also this problem only occurs when I\x92m in crowded places, like on the train. Does anyone else encounter such issues?"

I have to restart both devices to establish link again. Notice this happened after I went to super crowded places with 100+ TT devices nearby. Maybe there is a cap on how many bluetooth devices can be connected at one time?

Not all phones with TT installed will have interference with other bluetooth devices such as smartwatch and wireless earphones. I am using iphone 11 paired with airpods pro and apple watch series 4. TT keep interfering my bluetooth devices at crowded places. On the other hand my sister doesn't face such issues on her Galaxy S10 Lite paired with her Galaxy buds and Galaxy Watch Active 2. There are no random disconnections even at crowded places with TT installed.

And i use TT constantly for SafeEntry too. What i do get (long time liao) is occasional reminders from TT to keep bluetooth on when its already on \U0001f644 Irritating but nothing major.
