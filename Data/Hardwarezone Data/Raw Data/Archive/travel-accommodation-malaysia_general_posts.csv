More than 100,000 Rohingya live in Malaysia after fleeing from Myanmar, but they are considered illegal immigrants. Malaysia's search for the Rohingya highlights the challenge for governments trying to track the virus among communities living without official papers and wary of authorities. The religious gathering late last month at a mosque on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur was attended by some 16,000 people, including the Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, one source said. As well as the Rohingya, about 1,500 Muslims from across Asia attended.
