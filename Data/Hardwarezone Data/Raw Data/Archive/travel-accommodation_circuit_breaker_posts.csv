Most probably due to the latest 12.12 sales where the price is extremely attractive for most 5* hotels ... During the nov sales, we have seen 2 nights Lyf Funan (18m2) room only rates at $80 for 2 nights (taxes in). Hence, you are only paying $40 for 1 night. Travel dates is for 2021 ... When they first launched their promo on those eligible srv ota websites, $80 for 2 nights can be seen on most weekends dates (Fri to Sun, Sat to Mon). Even for school holidays period in Mar, you can simply get $80 for 2 nights spending your time with your kids. $100 for 2 nights, then apply uob $20 discount, you would get $80 for 2 nights . The hotel is conveniently located beside Funan mall. WIth more than 400 rooms, there is no doubt that this promo would help to fill up most of their rooms. Priced at $121 usually, and even $105++ on their opening special, this $40 per nite tax in is really a steal for most of us. The hotel is just 7 min walk from City Hall mrt station. With lots of restaurants around the mall. This hotel is definitely a good deal for ""Cheapo Singaporeans"" who wants to stay at a 4* hotel, paying a 2* hotel price. FYI, 2* hotels in Geylang cost around $60+ on average during Sat to Sun period. The downside of this hotel is that there is no television inside the room. Most of the items are shared among other people staying at your floor. No personal toothbrush and toothpaste given. Fridge, oven can be found at every floor, but is shared. Hence, there were some reviews that says that the fridge is always full. Prior to this $40 per nite tax in promotion, Lyf Funan does have a 9am to 7pm work from hotel promotion. Price is $70++ in a private studio room. According to ""https://www.patnotebook.com/lyf-funan-singapore-workspace-package-work-from-a-hotel/"", there is no bed for the studio room for 1 pax. In addition, many other 4/5* hotels do also have their own 8 to 12 hours of work from hotel series. Perhaps those seems more attractive than the Lyf Funan work from hotel series promotion. Hence, there were more and more attractive promotions coming up after this work from hotel series."

Hotel selection is also kinda limited ... For globaltix, it seems like they are partnering directly with hotel to be eligble for srv vouchers ... For example, if you want to book a promotional rate from village bugis hotel, you can book with them to use srv voucher, since their direct website do not accept srv voucher . However, the down side is that, you have to purchase the voucher first . Then you have to check with the hotel, if your voucher can be used on that date or not . This might seems risky, as you might not be able to use your voucher on that date you want to stay . On the other hand, you can just book and pay first, later then decide on the travel date. For klook, you have to specifically select the travel date to check in. This ensures your booking would be valid for that specific date. however, you might not be able to change the travel date upon payment made."

They only provide light refrsshments at cocktail hour - you get food & alcohol for an hour."".

"" For Sofitel So (134 rooms, ranked #34) , was reading the review that an Australia family has stayed there, booked 3 rooms, and was upgraded due to their family birthday staycations. For Sep review, someone stayed there to serve quarantine order. Quite lucky to get that hotel as the room are nice. Seems like the hotel upgrade their guests ofte.

For Village Hotel Bugis, if offpeak, the deluxe is usually $125 range ... but they marketed it as $200 per nite lol ... was looking at their village hotel bugis at $200 for deluxe, $250 for family. since stayed many times with them, think deluxe is good enough ... their king size bed can sleep up to 4 adults if not too fat their deluxe and family room is the same, except one more single bed ... carpark quite be hard last time, since most of the people bought fave voucher $25.90 to dine in at their lunch buffet ... so carpark always hard to find ... now maybe better ... since not much might go for buffet already ... From my understanding, only superior and family room have bathtub ... But their deluxe room states bathtub for some rooms lol ... Maybe they would downgrade you to superior if you request for bathtub room. The room size for superior, deluxe, club, family ... all r 32m2 room size ..."

Maybe location for some of the 81 hotels are better, such as the one at lavender and selegie ... For those who drive, they might prefer to stay at better room at a 4* hotel at almost the same price ... Those hotels have partnered with globaltix, and those so called good rates by those respective hotels are ""parked"" there ... Those packages are somehow limited ...

Below are the not bad deal: Park Hotel Clarke Quay superior 18m2 @ $117 room only. Used to be $130. If you don't mind the small room size (hotel 81 is 14m2), can go ahead with the bookings. InterContinental, $210 deluxe 40m2 room only, $250 deluxe w bf + $50 dining credit + 6pm check out. Seems to be a good deal, with the additional late check out at 6pm. Sheraton Towers, deluxe 30m2 + bf at $199. Used to be $250+ . The best promotion so far by this hotel is $376, deluxe room with breakfast for 2 nights. Below are the ""NOT-SO-ATTRACTIVE"" deals in my opinion: Boss hotel, superior room 14m2 @ $100, rates with breakfast at $117. Not a good deal. other platform only charges $80 for room, $89 for room with breakfast. somemore can stay on public holidays, and weekends period for most dates. Boss hotel room 14m2 is kinda small, since their boss is also the boss of hotel 81 group. Shangri La Hotel Singapore, room only at $280, room with breakfast at $360. Have booked 2 weeks ago with a better rate : (A) Garden wing room 50m2 + extra bed + breakfast for 2 + dinner buffet for 2 @ $326 nett. (B) Garden wing room 50m2 + extra bed + breakfast for 2 + $50 dining credit @ $276 nett. Sofitel Singapore CC: klook used to have $243 and $249 for luxury room with club lounge + bf, and luxury room with afternoon tea + bf. Reviews on their club lounge not so good ... Fullerton Hotel Premier Courtyard 42m2 with breakfast for 2 @ $338. Used to have $352 nett, free breakfast, free $100 dining credit, extra bed, late check out at 4pm . Grand Park City Hall $144 deluxe room only, $189 premier room only. Used to have $150 deluxe 28m2 no bathtub with breakfast, and $170 premier 32m2 w bathtub with breakfast. Same goes to Grand Park Orchard. Note that their breakfast is bento set, only one serving. Shangri-La\u2019s Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa, deluxe 32m2 + bf at $376. Have seen $330 with deluxe 32m2 + bf + $100 dining credit, recently. Conrad Centennial, deluxe 43m2 + bf + $80 dining credit + late c/o at $315. Best promo by this hotel at another platform is $376 nett (after $60 uob cc promo) for 2 rooms with breakfast for 2a+ 2 c ... Carlton Hotel Singapore, deluxe 30m2 no bathtub, room only at $170. So-so deal. Top up $25 more for breakfast. Premier room 35m2 have bathtub, at the new wing, not the deluxe room. SO/ Sofitel, cosy room 25m2 no bathtub + bf at $198. So-so only. The best promo by klook was free upgrade to urban 42m2 room with breakfast at slightly higher rate.."

Hong Kong: Budget $89 vs SQ/Cathay $188 to $198 (lowest) Would go for SQ, since the duration is doubled, at 4 hours ... Is more wise to fly full fledged, more comfortable Taipei: Budget $72 vs SQ/CI/ BR $388 (lowest) More wise to fly budget, since the price difference is huge ... Somemore, budget airline departs 1am or 6am, taipei to sin depart 2pm or 5pm. better timing than SQ, which departs 8am and 12pm (usually 12pm got promo fares).

From their live show, you can see that trip.com and klook attracted a bigger audience group, compared to traveloka. Hence, maybe that is their tactics of ""show hand"" to attract more ppl to book from their sites. But still better than changirecommends, which didnt manage to catch lots of people's attention. Globaltix seems alright, as they have partnered with hotel directly. Meaning to say that instead of booking those promo from the hotel directly, you can book them on globaltix. For selected hotels and promo only. Trip.com originated from China Klook originated from HK Traveloka originated from Indonesia"

Alas for my family, the intention for staycation is only to use the SRV since no intention to use it for non-hotel sightseeing items Have to do your mental sum quick, cox yesterday coupon seems to be gone within 2 hours. Alternatively, can use an excel spreadsheet to apply the formulas . As some coupons have capped amount, one would have to take note when booking hotel that is priced at a higher rate. For non-srv coupons, can only use OTA + Bank coupon. You would not be able to use OTA + OTA coupon . They have been encouraging people to use their SRV. Hence, they allowed OTA + OTA or OTA + DBS coupons to be stacked together. However, when your amount is more than $200+, you might want to use OTA + DBS (capped at $50), since the OTA + OTA (capped at $35) capped amount is lesser. You cant combine all 3 coupons, as the maximum coupons to be used in conjunction with your SRV code is only 2 coupons ..."

Why would you want to coop yourself in a small confined's hotel room for 14 days + 14 days in both countries? Furthermore, the upfront costs of medical tests, hotel rooms and meals are not cheap.
