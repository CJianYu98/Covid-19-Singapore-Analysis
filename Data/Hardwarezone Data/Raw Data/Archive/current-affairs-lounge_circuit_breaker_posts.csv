"Is Temasek Holdings behind the SIA 'conspiracy' to mislead   creditors and investors,",10-11-2020 08:31 PM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/current-affairs-lounge-17/temasek-holdings-behind-sia-conspiracy-mislead-creditors-investors-6408437.html,130772989,10-11-2020  08:31 PM,"Did SIA/Temasek Holdings mislead  creditors and investors, by utilizing fake accounting methods? (To tune of 44% in  deceit). From: https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/Investor-Relations/Financial-Results/News-Release/nr-q2fy2021.pdf Temasek is significant majority shareholder of SIA stocks. Temasek also didn't say anything when SIA board misappropriated in it BVPS accounting,  the almost $3.5B of MCB funding (treating it as basically a free cash with no strings attached),  just so they could deceptively and misleadingly inflate the SIA share price through misleadingly inflated  BVPS calculations? $3.5B worth of Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCB) were issued in 5th June 2020, as part of SIA $8.8B fundraising exercise (rights shares contributed other $5.3B). https://financialhorse.com/sias-rights-issue-explained-is-singapore-airlines-a-good-investment/ Temasek, as majority shareholder, appoints the board which then employs the management to run the company and report accounts. SIA however, has a very perverse way of inflating it's Book value per share (BVPS) (aka equity per share (EPS)/ nett asset value (NAV)) by 44%, by rather misleading and deceptive accounting methods. Whilst SIA has correctly taken the   conservative and self benificial default stance of treatment of MCB as equity (since in the event that the company is unable to pay the lump-sum compounded interest at designated redemption points within 10years, the default outcome is for almost $2.68 (par value at inception) worth of MCB to convert to 1 SIA ordinary share) without further financial liability; it remains misleading and dishonest for SIA to omit the default eventuality of MCB being converted to shares, given that the accounts were presented upon this premise right from the start. To suddenly, midway omit/ contradict this premise is a dishonest sleight of hand by all accounts. Since SIA has chosen to present it's accounts in the self beneficial, default premise of MCB being treated as equity (i.e not debt) and ultimately repaid in shares (to allow the $3.5B to be accounted for as an asset (equity) and not a liability (debt), then consistent with this accounting treatment of MCB that SIA benifits from, SIA needs to divide the total SIA equity of $15,251.5B (at 30.6.2020) by the total number of 2.963B ordinary SIA shares, plus the 1.305B MCB conversion shares (total 4.267B shares), in so far that SIA has not successfully yet earmarked an equivalent repayment fund of sufficient value, for the purposes of MCB+interest redemption at the material time point. This is as dishonest as it is an inconsistent way of cherry picking values and creating false figures,  similar to how Hyflux creatively inflated it's asset values to deceive both creditors and investors into believing it's inflated equity values. I hope that SIA doesn't resort to such dishonest accounting methods and that this inflated BVPS, which by default ought to be $3.574/share, until and unless SIA has set aside funds in excess of $3.5B + interest, for the redemption of MCB to give creditors and investors an honest picture of the finances of SIA and not be deceived into a false sense of security due to creative (dishonest/disingenuous) accounting methods of the SIA board. And Temasek Holdings shouldn't resort/ allow to this kind of lowly/ cheap ruse to obtain cheap loans or worse liquidate  shares at an elevated price point, vz false/ misleading accounts used if that was indeed the intention behind the irresponsible and misleading accounting treatment of MCB funds."

That's after you wait two years for your flat and obediently get married like the PAP tells you to, just to be deluded that you're a ""homeowner"" when you're just a glorified subletter, since the flat is leased by HDB, which in turn leases the land for 999 years from the government of Singapore. -It's not like they can escape the ******** associated with a mortgage by renting either, because rent is so ****ing expensive too. My friend lives in Tuas, possibly the most remote spot in Singapore, and his room costs $700/mo, and this is probably the kind of room where you barely have walking space anymore once you dump a queen-sized bed in it. I visited my friend in Toa Payoh in 2008, and it cost $1,200/mo for a tiny bedroom. -They have to pay $80,000 just for the *permission* to own a car called the COE (price is determined by BIDDING), and for only 10 years.The car itself runs for at least $60,000, which makes Singapore the world's most expensive place to own a car. This is really sad, because it costs only US$2,000 to own a car here in America. Don't let me get started on the price of road tax, fuel, parking, and the ever-expensive-and-ubiquitous ERP. -Every wage-earning Singaporean is forced to participate in a giant ponzi scheme called the CPF, where a certain percentage of every paycheck goes into a quaint little retirement fund... which is virtually inaccessible, even after the already-high age of withdrawal (65), because of this random policy called the minimum sum, which is ever increasing -- $161,000 at last count. What is the minimum sum? It's the amount of funds you must have in your CPF account before you're even allowed to touch it. Guess what when you're finally allowed to touch it? MONTHLY PAYOUTS, BITCH, NO LUMP SUM WITHDRAWAL! -When the males attain the age of 18, in the prime of their lives, they're all forcibly conscripted into a people's army not very different from communist countries. Only catch? The duration is two and a half years in practice. Skipping it is grounds for imprisonment, a minimum of 3 years of course, because some Jehovah Witnesses tried that stunt before (prison over National Service). Compulsory imprisonment in Pulau Tekong, anyone? Worst of all, it's a dumb idea, because it's useless to be militarily trained without access to GUNS. You want a citizenry capable to thwarting or deterring a foreign invasion? Try the Second Amendment. -The government doesn't give a **** about the plight of Singaporeans. Foreigners are brought in to ""foster competition"" in schools and in the workplace, while Singaporeans are told to shape up or ship out. More scholarships are granted to foreigners than Singaporeans each year, this is a fact I can guarantee. And the influx of ""foreign talents"" isn't stopping anytime soon. The saddest thing is that the real talents simply see Singapore as a stepping stone to a Western country, duh. They eat for free, and they leave. Why would anyone talented want to sink roots in a dictatorial sterile soulless concrete jungle? They offered me Permanent Residentship in 2007, and I threw the letter into the rubbish bin. -Their women are overhyped gold-digging materialistic trash overcaked in cheap makeup who suck white dick to feel like they've achieved something, i.e. total pump-and-dump material who'll eventually end up spinsters at 40 still looking for a man of ""equal income or more"" to snatch them up. The men are perpetual losers who are afraid to even talk to Singaporean girls, totally insecure and intimidated around white men, would pay for prostitutes even in their 20s, and would eventually have to settle for third-rate, third-world-ugly mail-order wives from Vietnam, and then proclaim all sorts of post-choice rationalizations like how Vietnamese girls are supposedly more loyal and caring. What sour grapes... Even the SDN/SDU, set up by the ****ing government to help Singaporeans LEARN HOW TO DATE (this in itself is a ****ing joke), is a ****ing flop. -They have dialects effectively eradicated from their lives, totally cutting them off from any identification with their real ancestral roots and forcing them to pretend that Mandarin is their mother tongue. This ""no dialect"" policy was supposedly instrumental in ensuring that Singaporeans learn Mandarin well, yet I don't need to tell you that the average Singaporean not only doesn't know how to speak dialects or even Malay but also still speaks bad Mandarin and English. Such a shame... -They have even less freedom of speech than us, and we already have very little. We say all sorts of vile things about Najib all the time, and most of us are still walking freely. Try saying vile things about Lee Kuan Yew... Tip: ask Amos Yee . Between dealing with neanderthal Malays and a corrupt government, VERSUS the list of crap above, which would you choose? \u202a#\u200eSingaporeGE17\u202c Well, he did hit the spot on certain points."

That's after you wait two years for your flat and obediently get married like the PAP tells you to, just to be deluded that you're a ""homeowner"" when you're just a glorified subletter, since the flat is leased by HDB, which in turn leases the land for 999 years from the government of Singapore. -It's not like they can escape the ******** associated with a mortgage by renting either, because rent is so ****ing expensive too. My friend lives in Tuas, possibly the most remote spot in Singapore, and his room costs $700/mo, and this is probably the kind of room where you barely have walking space anymore once you dump a queen-sized bed in it. I visited my friend in Toa Payoh in 2008, and it cost $1,200/mo for a tiny bedroom. -They have to pay $80,000 just for the *permission* to own a car called the COE (price is determined by BIDDING), and for only 10 years.The car itself runs for at least $60,000, which makes Singapore the world's most expensive place to own a car. This is really sad, because it costs only US$2,000 to own a car here in America. Don't let me get started on the price of road tax, fuel, parking, and the ever-expensive-and-ubiquitous ERP. -Every wage-earning Singaporean is forced to participate in a giant ponzi scheme called the CPF, where a certain percentage of every paycheck goes into a quaint little retirement fund... which is virtually inaccessible, even after the already-high age of withdrawal (65), because of this random policy called the minimum sum, which is ever increasing -- $161,000 at last count. What is the minimum sum? It's the amount of funds you must have in your CPF account before you're even allowed to touch it. Guess what when you're finally allowed to touch it? MONTHLY PAYOUTS, BITCH, NO LUMP SUM WITHDRAWAL! -When the males attain the age of 18, in the prime of their lives, they're all forcibly conscripted into a people's army not very different from communist countries. Only catch? The duration is two and a half years in practice. Skipping it is grounds for imprisonment, a minimum of 3 years of course, because some Jehovah Witnesses tried that stunt before (prison over National Service). Compulsory imprisonment in Pulau Tekong, anyone? Worst of all, it's a dumb idea, because it's useless to be militarily trained without access to GUNS. You want a citizenry capable to thwarting or deterring a foreign invasion? Try the Second Amendment. -The government doesn't give a **** about the plight of Singaporeans. Foreigners are brought in to ""foster competition"" in schools and in the workplace, while Singaporeans are told to shape up or ship out. More scholarships are granted to foreigners than Singaporeans each year, this is a fact I can guarantee. And the influx of ""foreign talents"" isn't stopping anytime soon. The saddest thing is that the real talents simply see Singapore as a stepping stone to a Western country, duh. They eat for free, and they leave. Why would anyone talented want to sink roots in a dictatorial sterile soulless concrete jungle? They offered me Permanent Residentship in 2007, and I threw the letter into the rubbish bin. -Their women are overhyped gold-digging materialistic trash overcaked in cheap makeup who suck white dick to feel like they've achieved something, i.e. total pump-and-dump material who'll eventually end up spinsters at 40 still looking for a man of ""equal income or more"" to snatch them up. The men are perpetual losers who are afraid to even talk to Singaporean girls, totally insecure and intimidated around white men, would pay for prostitutes even in their 20s, and would eventually have to settle for third-rate, third-world-ugly mail-order wives from Vietnam, and then proclaim all sorts of post-choice rationalizations like how Vietnamese girls are supposedly more loyal and caring. What sour grapes... Even the SDN/SDU, set up by the ****ing government to help Singaporeans LEARN HOW TO DATE (this in itself is a ****ing joke), is a ****ing flop. -They have dialects effectively eradicated from their lives, totally cutting them off from any identification with their real ancestral roots and forcing them to pretend that Mandarin is their mother tongue. This ""no dialect"" policy was supposedly instrumental in ensuring that Singaporeans learn Mandarin well, yet I don't need to tell you that the average Singaporean not only doesn't know how to speak dialects or even Malay but also still speaks bad Mandarin and English. Such a shame... -They have even less freedom of speech than us, and we already have very little. We say all sorts of vile things about Najib all the time, and most of us are still walking freely. Try saying vile things about Lee Kuan Yew... Tip: ask Amos Yee. Between dealing with neanderthal Malays and a corrupt government, VERSUS the list of crap above, which would you choose? \u202a#\u200eSingaporeGE17\u202c K noted."

It does not matter whether singapore is better than malaysia or not. that is not important. what is of MORE IMPORTANT is if you agree or disagree with his points. try refuting him. btw, the only points i disagree with him are all the noise about sinkie gcps & males with vietbu wives. so many here highlight what i think is of the LEAST importance. that is all irelevant crap. instead think about what he said about HDB, COE, CPF etc...what do you agree or disagree with? 3) Sinkies like you can hate him but when you do that, YOU are the Loser, cause you ignore his points & just bash his situation. that means we just have to ignore all losers like JBJ or CSJ ( got bankrupted ) & only listen to the winners ie. the Men In White. 4) dunno why, but most of the sinkies or FTs that critize the SINKAPOOR system seem to get into a lot of trouble, egs.

That's after you wait two years for your flat and obediently get married like the PAP tells you to, just to be deluded that you're a ""homeowner"" when you're just a glorified subletter, since the flat is leased by HDB, which in turn leases the land for 999 years from the government of Singapore. -It's not like they can escape the ******** associated with a mortgage by renting either, because rent is so ****ing expensive too. My friend lives in Tuas, possibly the most remote spot in Singapore, and his room costs $700/mo, and this is probably the kind of room where you barely have walking space anymore once you dump a queen-sized bed in it. I visited my friend in Toa Payoh in 2008, and it cost $1,200/mo for a tiny bedroom. -They have to pay $80,000 just for the *permission* to own a car called the COE (price is determined by BIDDING), and for only 10 years.The car itself runs for at least $60,000, which makes Singapore the world's most expensive place to own a car. This is really sad, because it costs only US$2,000 to own a car here in America. Don't let me get started on the price of road tax, fuel, parking, and the ever-expensive-and-ubiquitous ERP. -Every wage-earning Singaporean is forced to participate in a giant ponzi scheme called the CPF, where a certain percentage of every paycheck goes into a quaint little retirement fund... which is virtually inaccessible, even after the already-high age of withdrawal (65), because of this random policy called the minimum sum, which is ever increasing -- $161,000 at last count. What is the minimum sum? It's the amount of funds you must have in your CPF account before you're even allowed to touch it. Guess what when you're finally allowed to touch it? MONTHLY PAYOUTS, BITCH, NO LUMP SUM WITHDRAWAL! -When the males attain the age of 18, in the prime of their lives, they're all forcibly conscripted into a people's army not very different from communist countries. Only catch? The duration is two and a half years in practice. Skipping it is grounds for imprisonment, a minimum of 3 years of course, because some Jehovah Witnesses tried that stunt before (prison over National Service). Compulsory imprisonment in Pulau Tekong, anyone? Worst of all, it's a dumb idea, because it's useless to be militarily trained without access to GUNS. You want a citizenry capable to thwarting or deterring a foreign invasion? Try the Second Amendment. -The government doesn't give a **** about the plight of Singaporeans. Foreigners are brought in to ""foster competition"" in schools and in the workplace, while Singaporeans are told to shape up or ship out. More scholarships are granted to foreigners than Singaporeans each year, this is a fact I can guarantee. And the influx of ""foreign talents"" isn't stopping anytime soon. The saddest thing is that the real talents simply see Singapore as a stepping stone to a Western country, duh. They eat for free, and they leave. Why would anyone talented want to sink roots in a dictatorial sterile soulless concrete jungle? They offered me Permanent Residentship in 2007, and I threw the letter into the rubbish bin. -Their women are overhyped gold-digging materialistic trash overcaked in cheap makeup who suck white dick to feel like they've achieved something, i.e. total pump-and-dump material who'll eventually end up spinsters at 40 still looking for a man of ""equal income or more"" to snatch them up. The men are perpetual losers who are afraid to even talk to Singaporean girls, totally insecure and intimidated around white men, would pay for prostitutes even in their 20s, and would eventually have to settle for third-rate, third-world-ugly mail-order wives from Vietnam, and then proclaim all sorts of post-choice rationalizations like how Vietnamese girls are supposedly more loyal and caring. What sour grapes... Even the SDN/SDU, set up by the ****ing government to help Singaporeans LEARN HOW TO DATE (this in itself is a ****ing joke), is a ****ing flop. -They have dialects effectively eradicated from their lives, totally cutting them off from any identification with their real ancestral roots and forcing them to pretend that Mandarin is their mother tongue. This ""no dialect"" policy was supposedly instrumental in ensuring that Singaporeans learn Mandarin well, yet I don't need to tell you that the average Singaporean not only doesn't know how to speak dialects or even Malay but also still speaks bad Mandarin and English. Such a shame... -They have even less freedom of speech than us, and we already have very little. We say all sorts of vile things about Najib all the time, and most of us are still walking freely. Try saying vile things about Lee Kuan Yew... Tip: ask Amos Yee. Between dealing with neanderthal Malays and a corrupt government, VERSUS the list of crap above, which would you choose? \u202a#\u200eSingaporeGE17\u202c Talk so much, end of day, so many people still want to come and squeeze with 6.9mil. Comparing ""neanderthal Malays and a corrupt government"" vs. Singapore and trying to point out that it's still better than the ""list of crap"", is like comparing two peoples ****. End of day it's still **** and smelly. LOL. What is there to compare?"

Basil Lim Boon Hoh, 28, admitted to spending a total of nine years, 11 months and 16 days outside Singapore in default of his obligations under the Enlistment Act. He pleaded guilty to two counts under the act, with another two similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. The court heard that Lim was born in Singapore in 1991 to a Singaporean man and a Malaysian woman. Lim is a Singapore citizen by birth. When Lim was about a year old, he left Singapore for Malaysia and is no longer in contact with his father. He studied in Malaysia and later in the United Kingdom for a Master of Science degree. In 2001, he was granted Malaysian citizenship and later issued a Malaysian passport which he used to travel overseas. Lim also used his Singapore passport to travel out of Singapore on about 10 occasions from his birth until 2010, and was also was issued a Singapore NRIC in 2007. His mother had applied for the identity card, despite Lim holding a Malaysian citizenship by that time, as she wanted him to have a choice of where to work in future. Lim knew about his NS liabilities, as his father had told him about it before he turned 10. When he was about 16, his mother told him he could ignore these liabilities as he ""now had Malaysian citizenship and could forget about his NS liabilities"". In the years that followed, he failed to obtain valid exit permits or to report for NS registration. In exchanges with the Central Manpower Base (CMB), Lim's mother claimed that she and her son had ""overlooked his NS matter"" and claimed they had not received any letters about it. In 2016, Lim's lawyer wrote to CMB to ask for Lim to be allowed to renounce his Singapore citizenship, but was rejected. Lim returned to Singapore on Mar 27, 2018 and reported to CMB after earlier telling them that he would return. He enlisted with the Singapore Civil Defence Force and completed his national service on Aug 13 this year. He now says he wishes to keep his Singapore citizenship, ""as he does not speak Malay well and intends to work here instead of Malaysia"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Teh. The Ministry of Defence had said previously that 14 NS defaulters have been imprisoned since 2017. It said that all male Singapore citizens and permanent residents ""have a duty to serve NS and it is important that NS has the support and commitment of all Singaporeans"". ""To achieve this, we have to adhere to the fundamental principles of universality and equity in NS. If we allow Singapore citizens or PRs who are overseas to evade NS or to choose when they want to serve NS, we are not being fair to the vast majority of our national servicemen who serve their country dutifully, and the institution of NS will be undermined,"" said MINDEF in its earlier statement. Lim has not been sentenced and will return to court on Oct 15 for a further mention of his case. For each charge of failing to fulfil his liability under the Enlistment Act, he could be jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$10,000, or both. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...nship-13169476"

Basil Lim Boon Hoh, 28, admitted to spending a total of nine years, 11 months and 16 days outside Singapore in default of his obligations under the Enlistment Act. He pleaded guilty to two counts under the act, with another two similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. The court heard that Lim was born in Singapore in 1991 to a Singaporean man and a Malaysian woman. Lim is a Singapore citizen by birth. When Lim was about a year old, he left Singapore for Malaysia and is no longer in contact with his father. He studied in Malaysia and later in the United Kingdom for a Master of Science degree. In 2001, he was granted Malaysian citizenship and later issued a Malaysian passport which he used to travel overseas. Lim also used his Singapore passport to travel out of Singapore on about 10 occasions from his birth until 2010, and was also was issued a Singapore NRIC in 2007. His mother had applied for the identity card, despite Lim holding a Malaysian citizenship by that time, as she wanted him to have a choice of where to work in future.

Why he suddenly can apply passport in Malaysia?(if he don't have a Malaysia IC) All these happening because poor administration? AFAIK, Dual citizenship is only allowed (legally) for males under 21 yrs of age - so that they cannot renounce Singporean citizenship before doing NS. Had a campmate who was dual Australian-Singaporean citizen back in NS days. So he served then renounce. As for this case, could be administration or the other country not caring/unable to follow up. idk enough about Malaysian policies but some countries allow dual citizenships (e.g for this example purpose let's say France) . So e.g. whilst Singapore doesn't allow, there's nothing stopping someone who is originally Singaporean, to work long time in France and obtain citizenship by naturalisation. France won't ask him/her to renounce Singaporean citizenship since by French law, dual citizenship is allowed. And if he/she doesn't declare to Singapore, then Singapore side won't know too since dual citizenship information is not something that is shared even amongst partners. Edit: But could also be, because he didn't serve & defaulted, he cannot give up his Singaporean citizenship without having served."

'Way beyond my budget': Malaysians entering Singapore for work under PCA scramble to find rental opt,24-08-2020 10:09 PM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/current-affairs-lounge-17/way-beyond-my-budget-malaysians-entering-singapore-work-under-pca-scramble-find-rental-opt-6360705.html,129236886,21-08-2020  05:34 PM,"By                 Amir Yusof             @AmirYusofCNA 7-9 minutes SINGAPORE: Ms Norashikin Rahman is worried she may not have a shelter over her head next month. The  29-year-old Malaysian, who lives in Johor Bahru, is scheduled to enter  Singapore via the Periodic Commutive Arrangement (PCA) scheme on Sep 1.  The scheme allows her to resume work for her company, a computer chip  manufacturing firm based in the north-eastern part of Singapore. As part of the PCA, she will serve a seven day stay-home notice (SHN)  upon arrival, at a facility paid for by her company, and undertake a  COVID-19 swab test. After she finishes her SHN and tests negative for COVID-19, Ms Norashikin would need to move to a place to stay. The  mother of two young children has been trying for weeks to secure a  suitable room that is close to her work place and within her budget, but  to no success. \x93My budget is only S$300, but for rooms in Yishun, the rent I have been quoted for are at least S$650. \x93The prices quoted are way beyond my budget. I won\x92t have enough  money for my family or my living expenses in Singapore,\x94 she said when  interviewed by CNA. Ms  Norashikin is one of many Malaysians who are heading to Singapore to  resume work under the ambit of the PCA, but are struggling to find  suitable homes on short notice, at the right price and with short rental  leases. Some of them are using social media groups to find rental  options and connect with other Malaysians looking to rent rooms at  similar locations. Vehicles and people can be seen crossing the Woodlands causeway linking  Malaysia and Singapore on Aug 17, 2020. For instance, the Facebook group Bilik Sewa Singapore  (Malaysian), or rooms for rent in Singapore for Malaysians, has been  abuzz with many posts in recent weeks, with people looking for roommates  and landlords posting rental opportunities. Although there are  options available, Ms Norashikin said many landlords are looking for  tenants who are willing to commit for between six months to a year. She  is not willing to do this as she plans to return home after three  months. Subsequently, she is hoping that the two governments can find a  solution to resume daily commuting across the border. \x93For the  long term, I don\x92t think I want to continue renting here. It\x92s important  for me to be close to my child and family and see them every day,\x94 she  said. Another  Malaysian who will also be entering Singapore to work via PCA in  September is Mr Fakhrul Adlee, who works in the western part of  Singapore. He told CNA that he has been looking for suitable  rental options on the Bilik Sewa Singapore Facebook group for a couple  of weeks but has found it \x93challenging\x94. He noted that there were limited options for rooms in the area he wants to stay in \x96 near Jurong East or Toh Guan. \x93Also,  the rent quoted is quite high. My budget is S$350, slightly flexible,  but so far nothing falls into the range I can afford,\x94 he said. Mr Fakhrul added that many of the options available were only for female tenants, and virtually none for males. According  to Mr Nicholas Mak, ERA Realty's research and consultancy head,  Malaysian workers who are looking for rental units are typically \x93more  budget conscious\x94. He also said that a total of six tenants would  usually share an entire HDB unit to lower costs. Moreover, there  has been an increase in demand for HDB rental units recently, especially  near industrial estates in Jurong, Tuas, Woodlands, Yishun and Kaki  Bukit, he said. \x93Malaysians who are coming here to work is a big  factor in driving up demand for these units. They are far from the city  centre and are popular among Malaysian workers, who prefer to live in a  place easily accessible to their places of work,\x94 added Mr Mak. He said that this has led to some landlords in these areas raising the prices. \x93For  example, the rent for a 4-room HDB unit in Joo Koon would typically  cost around S$2,300 but recently, the prices have spiked to around  S$2,700. This price is what you usually see for flats closer to the  city.\x94 Ms Christine Sun, head of research and consultancy at  OrangeTee & Tie, said that the increase in HDB rental demand can be  linked to Malaysians working in Singapore. \x93Anecdotally, we have  observed strong rental demand from Malaysians working in Singapore since  the start of the circuit breaker period. \x93Even now, with some of  the border lockdowns being eased recently, many are still reluctant to  travel back as they need to serve their stay-home-notice and have  continued to rent a unit in Singapore,\x94 she added. According to  SRX flash estimates released on Aug 12, the prices for the HDB rental  market in July increased by 1.4 per cent from June. Ms Sun said this was possibly due to landlords raising their rent after observing a sudden surge in demand. Malaysian  worker Imran Malik told CNA that he is due to enter Singapore via PCA  in two weeks but he is \x93feeling anxious\x94 because he believes the higher  demand has priced him out of the market. \x93It\x92s obvious, many of  the landlords have noticed an increase in demand for their units so they  upped their asking price. Some have even refused to reply to my queries  to negotiate price,\x94 he said. \x93And to share a room, they are  charging around S$700. It\x92s not worth it because some of them have no  air-con even,\x94 added Mr Imran. The  issue of Malaysian workers having difficulties finding temporary  shelter in Singapore first surfaced in March, after the Malaysia  government imposed the Movement Control Order to curb the spread of  COVID-19. Under the order, all Malaysians were barred from  travelling abroad, including around 300,000 Malaysians who travel across  the Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link every day for work. It  was then reported that some Malaysian workers who had crossed over to  Singapore before the travel restrictions kicked in were unable to find  accommodation. Subsequently, Singapore\x92s Ministry of Manpower  (MOM) said it found 14 Malaysian workers who were sleeping rough at  Kranji MRT station and took them to a ""temporary relief centre"" in  Jurong East. Ms Sun of OrangTee & Tie said if the landlords  and tenants can find an equilibrium now, it may help to prop up  Singapore's property market going forward. \x93We have quite a number  of Malaysians working in Singapore. Therefore, the PCA and some  lockdown restrictions that are still currently in place may deter  Malaysians from going back. This will continue to prop up the rental  market in Singapore,\x94 she said. However, she noted that the long  term future of these workers might not be secure given how COVID-19 has  impacted the Singapore economy. \x93There will also be other  considerations such as whether the economic uncertainties will impact  the job security and employment of Malaysian workers in Singapore,\x94 Ms  Sun noted."

The  29-year-old Malaysian, who lives in Johor Bahru, is scheduled to enter  Singapore via the Periodic Commutive Arrangement (PCA) scheme on Sep 1.  The scheme allows her to resume work for her company, a computer chip  manufacturing firm based in the north-eastern part of Singapore. As part of the PCA, she will serve a seven day stay-home notice (SHN)  upon arrival, at a facility paid for by her company, and undertake a  COVID-19 swab test. After she finishes her SHN and tests negative for COVID-19, Ms Norashikin would need to move to a place to stay. The  mother of two young children has been trying for weeks to secure a  suitable room that is close to her work place and within her budget, but  to no success. \x93My budget is only S$300, but for rooms in Yishun, the rent I have been quoted for are at least S$650. \x93The prices quoted are way beyond my budget. I won\x92t have enough  money for my family or my living expenses in Singapore,\x94 she said when  interviewed by CNA. Ms  Norashikin is one of many Malaysians who are heading to Singapore to  resume work under the ambit of the PCA, but are struggling to find  suitable homes on short notice, at the right price and with short rental  leases. Some of them are using social media groups to find rental  options and connect with other Malaysians looking to rent rooms at  similar locations. Vehicles and people can be seen crossing the Woodlands causeway linking  Malaysia and Singapore on Aug 17, 2020. For instance, the Facebook group Bilik Sewa Singapore  (Malaysian), or rooms for rent in Singapore for Malaysians, has been  abuzz with many posts in recent weeks, with people looking for roommates  and landlords posting rental opportunities. Although there are  options available, Ms Norashikin said many landlords are looking for  tenants who are willing to commit for between six months to a year. She  is not willing to do this as she plans to return home after three  months. Subsequently, she is hoping that the two governments can find a  solution to resume daily commuting across the border. \x93For the  long term, I don\x92t think I want to continue renting here. It\x92s important  for me to be close to my child and family and see them every day,\x94 she  said. Another  Malaysian who will also be entering Singapore to work via PCA in  September is Mr Fakhrul Adlee, who works in the western part of  Singapore. He told CNA that he has been looking for suitable  rental options on the Bilik Sewa Singapore Facebook group for a couple  of weeks but has found it \x93challenging\x94. He noted that there were limited options for rooms in the area he wants to stay in \x96 near Jurong East or Toh Guan. \x93Also,  the rent quoted is quite high. My budget is S$350, slightly flexible,  but so far nothing falls into the range I can afford,\x94 he said. Mr Fakhrul added that many of the options available were only for female tenants, and virtually none for males. According  to Mr Nicholas Mak, ERA Realty's research and consultancy head,  Malaysian workers who are looking for rental units are typically \x93more  budget conscious\x94. He also said that a total of six tenants would  usually share an entire HDB unit to lower costs. Moreover, there  has been an increase in demand for HDB rental units recently, especially  near industrial estates in Jurong, Tuas, Woodlands, Yishun and Kaki  Bukit, he said. \x93Malaysians who are coming here to work is a big  factor in driving up demand for these units. They are far from the city  centre and are popular among Malaysian workers, who prefer to live in a  place easily accessible to their places of work,\x94 added Mr Mak. He said that this has led to some landlords in these areas raising the prices. \x93For  example, the rent for a 4-room HDB unit in Joo Koon would typically  cost around S$2,300 but recently, the prices have spiked to around  S$2,700. This price is what you usually see for flats closer to the  city.\x94 Ms Christine Sun, head of research and consultancy at  OrangeTee & Tie, said that the increase in HDB rental demand can be  linked to Malaysians working in Singapore. \x93Anecdotally, we have  observed strong rental demand from Malaysians working in Singapore since  the start of the circuit breaker period. \x93Even now, with some of  the border lockdowns being eased recently, many are still reluctant to  travel back as they need to serve their stay-home-notice and have  continued to rent a unit in Singapore,\x94 she added. According to  SRX flash estimates released on Aug 12, the prices for the HDB rental  market in July increased by 1.4 per cent from June. Ms Sun said this was possibly due to landlords raising their rent after observing a sudden surge in demand. Malaysian  worker Imran Malik told CNA that he is due to enter Singapore via PCA  in two weeks but he is \x93feeling anxious\x94 because he believes the higher  demand has priced him out of the market. \x93It\x92s obvious, many of  the landlords have noticed an increase in demand for their units so they  upped their asking price. Some have even refused to reply to my queries  to negotiate price,\x94 he said. \x93And to share a room, they are  charging around S$700. It\x92s not worth it because some of them have no  air-con even,\x94 added Mr Imran. The  issue of Malaysian workers having difficulties finding temporary  shelter in Singapore first surfaced in March, after the Malaysia  government imposed the Movement Control Order to curb the spread of  COVID-19. Under the order, all Malaysians were barred from  travelling abroad, including around 300,000 Malaysians who travel across  the Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link every day for work. It  was then reported that some Malaysian workers who had crossed over to  Singapore before the travel restrictions kicked in were unable to find  accommodation. Subsequently, Singapore\x92s Ministry of Manpower  (MOM) said it found 14 Malaysian workers who were sleeping rough at  Kranji MRT station and took them to a ""temporary relief centre"" in  Jurong East. Ms Sun of OrangTee & Tie said if the landlords  and tenants can find an equilibrium now, it may help to prop up  Singapore's property market going forward. \x93We have quite a number  of Malaysians working in Singapore. Therefore, the PCA and some  lockdown restrictions that are still currently in place may deter  Malaysians from going back. This will continue to prop up the rental  market in Singapore,\x94 she said. However, she noted that the long  term future of these workers might not be secure given how COVID-19 has  impacted the Singapore economy. \x93There will also be other  considerations such as whether the economic uncertainties will impact  the job security and employment of Malaysian workers in Singapore,\x94 Ms  Sun noted. want to earn 3x that is the price to paid, if not , can jolly well f back home"

That prosecution will be carried out at the Penang Sessions Court. ""Both charges in the Kuala Lumpur and Penang courts are related to Penang undersea tunnel project,"" said MACC. Meanwhile, MACC said Lim would also be charged for a separate case next Tuesday under Section 23 of the MACC Act at the Penang Sessions Court.

Lim will be charged at the Special Corruption Court on Friday for offences under Section 16(a)(A) of the MACC Act 2009, which involves accepting gratification, the MACC said in a press statement on Thursday night. On Aug 10, he will also be charged for offences under Section 23 of the Act, which involves using public office or position for gratification, the MACC added. That prosecution will be carried out at the Penang Sessions Court. ""Both charges in the Kuala Lumpur and Penang courts are related to Penang undersea tunnel project,"" said MACC. Meanwhile, MACC said Lim would also be charged for a separate case next Tuesday under Section 23 of the MACC Act at the Penang Sessions Court. Lim, who was Penang's chief minister for more than 10 years until 2018, was seen entering the MACC's headquarters at about 9.10pm on Thursday. 2 years ago so happy. Now become like that."

He said this was part of the government's efforts to help develop a vaccine for the virus through scientific and strategic collaborations with countries capable of producing the vaccine. Explaining further, he said the collaboration team comprising Mosti, MOE and the Foreign Ministry was formed last April, to explore opportunities between Malaysia and other countries in establishing strategic joint ventures in researching and developing Covid-19 vaccine and medication. Malaysia is also talking to China about the vaccine development by companies and institutions from the republic. China now has several companies and institutions which are more advanced in the field. \x93I am scheduled to hold a video conference tomorrow evening with my counterpart in China on the matter including the possibility of Malaysia to gain access to the vaccine from China, if the MOE finds it is suitable, safe and effective to use,\x94 he said during Dewan Rakyat question-and-answer session, today. He was responding to a question from Datuk Mohd Nizar Zakaria (BN-Parit) on Mosti's role in helping with the Covid-19 vaccine development effort at international level, since Malaysia did not have the facility. Khairy said Mosti had taken the initiative to be involved in the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the participation as a coalition member has enabled the country to gain access to vaccine development, technology transfer and new expertise, for local researchers. \x93CEPI is also committed to fair and open vaccine distribution at reasonable cost for the whole world,\x94 he said. \u2015 Bernama https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2020/07/28/khairy-malaysia-might-get-access-to-covid-19-vaccine-from-china/1888850"

He said this was part of the government's efforts to help develop a vaccine for the virus through scientific and strategic collaborations with countries capable of producing the vaccine. Explaining further, he said the collaboration team comprising Mosti, MOE and the Foreign Ministry was formed last April, to explore opportunities between Malaysia and other countries in establishing strategic joint ventures in researching and developing Covid-19 vaccine and medication. Malaysia is also talking to China about the vaccine development by companies and institutions from the republic. China now has several companies and institutions which are more advanced in the field. \x93I am scheduled to hold a video conference tomorrow evening with my counterpart in China on the matter including the possibility of Malaysia to gain access to the vaccine from China, if the MOE finds it is suitable, safe and effective to use,\x94 he said during Dewan Rakyat question-and-answer session, today. He was responding to a question from Datuk Mohd Nizar Zakaria (BN-Parit) on Mosti's role in helping with the Covid-19 vaccine development effort at international level, since Malaysia did not have the facility. Khairy said Mosti had taken the initiative to be involved in the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the participation as a coalition member has enabled the country to gain access to vaccine development, technology transfer and new expertise, for local researchers. \x93CEPI is also committed to fair and open vaccine distribution at reasonable cost for the whole world,\x94 he said. \u2015 Bernama https://www.malaymail.com/news/malay...-china/1888850 and tell tiongs indirectly you can cum to our country built your 2nd naval base"

He added that Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein will also be speaking with his Chinese counterpart on Wednesday, and the MOU as well as the vaccine will be on the agenda. Mr Khairy noted that the vaccine for COVID-19 is now sought after by the world, and this has resulted in what he called vaccine diplomacy. \x93The world is now hunting for a COVID-19 vaccine for us to return to the old normal because if we do not get a vaccine we will have to remain in the new normal. As a result, in the world there is now vaccine diplomacy where advanced countries are buying vaccines being developed by pharmaceuticals in the West. \x93For developing countries, this is an uncomfortable situation when countries like the United States and United Kingdom as well as European countries have already made advance purchases of the vaccines,\x94 he said. .... https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...uddin-12993038"

Instead, Umno will remain dedicated to the Muafakat Nasional pact it has with PAS. The party\x92s decision against formally joining the Perikatan pact does not mean that it\x92s withdrawing support from the government, he added. \x93This is not announcement that we are pulling out of Perikatan. Our decision is that we are not going to be a component member of Perikatan if it were to be registered,\x94 he said when met with reporters at the Federal Court on Thursday (July 30). Zahid also refused to elaborate on Umno\x92s decision not to formally join Perikatan when pressed by reporters. \x93That is up to you to interpret. But our decision is final and we are not going to be a party component of Perikatan.\x94 At present, the Perikatan pact has yet to be registered with the Registrar of Societies (RoS). Zahid said this following an earlier press statement that he read out to reporters, reiterating that Umno had decided against formally joining the Perikatan pact, and instead, it would strengthen the Muafakat Nasional pact which consists of PAS and Barisan Nasional. \x93Our support to the Perikatan government is only based on the support of Barisan MPs in the federal government and several state governments,\x94 said Zahid when he read out the statement. At the same time, Zahid also said Bersatu\x92s intentions to sign a charter of cooperation with Muafakat Nasional would be deliberated between Barisan Nasional and PAS leaders. He said the main committee of Perikatan would deliberate on Bersatu\x92s intentions to join Muafakat Nasional. \x93The main committee had previously decided to give priority to strengthen Muafakat Nasional. \x93I will leave it to the main committee to consider Bersatu\x92s intentions as long as it is able to strengthen Muafakat Nasional for the interest of the people and the country.\x94 Meanwhile, Zahid also said Datuk Seri Najib Razak\x92s position as an MP and the Pekan Umno division chief still stood. \x93The due process of law is taking place where the court of appeal would be sitting. The process must be followed. \x93The two positions stay because the law has allowed these two positions to be retained by him,\x94 he said. ^ zahid statement but what happen in reality might be different"

But you are wrong in the smaller parts. PN is just a loose alliance, not a registered entity like BN and MN which UMNO is part of. PN only survives because UMNO and PAS chooses to support it, but both are waiting to see what happens and when is the best time to have an election. PH is weak, without Malay votes they cannot win power. They need Mahathir more than he needs them. Mahathir doesn't really care for PH, he never did, it's just a vehicle to gain power and perhaps ensure his son is well placed to become No 1 or No 2. But he can't join MN because of Najib and to a certain extent Zahid. So it all boils down to UMNO. There is already talk to move past these 2 leaders and get someone else like Annuar Musa or Khairy to take over. If this is done, then Mahathir will join them. The whole picture will become clearer after the Sabah polls. If Shafie is re-elected then probably UMNO has to persuade the top 2 to quit the scene because of their toxicity. If they win, then they'll be confident of winning everywhere and force the elections, so it's up to which one joins them, MY or Dr M. The only way MY can remain as PM, is to rejoin UMNO and that can only happen if the top 2 retire. Because why would they want another party leader become PM if they have more seats? PAS will sacrifise no 1 spot so long Islamic law is given priority or at the very least Malaysia is more Islamic and more given to Malays. Then they happy to govern their own 2 states and take some ministries. good analysis. i did not realise the impact of the polls in sabah."

But you are wrong in the smaller parts. PN is just a loose alliance, not a registered entity like BN and MN which UMNO is part of. PN only survives because UMNO and PAS chooses to support it, but both are waiting to see what happens and when is the best time to have an election. PH is weak, without Malay votes they cannot win power. They need Mahathir more than he needs them. Mahathir doesn't really care for PH, he never did, it's just a vehicle to gain power and perhaps ensure his son is well placed to become No 1 or No 2. But he can't join MN because of Najib and to a certain extent Zahid. So it all boils down to UMNO. There is already talk to move past these 2 leaders and get someone else like Annuar Musa or Khairy to take over. If this is done, then Mahathir will join them. The whole picture will become clearer after the Sabah polls. If Shafie is re-elected then probably UMNO has to persuade the top 2 to quit the scene because of their toxicity. If they win, then they'll be confident of winning everywhere and force the elections, so it's up to which one joins them, MY or Dr M. The only way MY can remain as PM, is to rejoin UMNO and that can only happen if the top 2 retire. Because why would they want another party leader become PM if they have more seats? PAS will sacrifise no 1 spot so long Islamic law is given priority or at the very least Malaysia is more Islamic and more given to Malays. Then they happy to govern their own 2 states and take some ministries. A good analysis. Sabah polls will determine how BN moves. They made a mistake once and they won't make it again especially now with the MN alliance and Harapan in chaos. Zahid statement is very sly. The reactions of the public and other parties will automatically let BN know what they should do next."

Many may also claim that governments formed as a result of*such jockeying is illegitimate for it may return a government that was voted out in the first place. Thomas Jefferson once said that the people deserve the government they elect. I would add, the people deserve the laws their government enacts.* * The electorate should be aware that when they vote in a government, they must accept not just the policies it implements but also the laws that it enacts. If the elected government allows for party switching in the Constitution, the electorate must accept*the prospect of a so-called back-door government coming to power. Granted, it may be hard for any voter to predict the actions of their governments, much less, the laws their governments would enact. But predicting political postures and their corresponding laws may not entirely be a Herculean task. Whilst no one in 2018, the year Pakatan Harapan unseated the Barisan National from power in Malaysia, could ever imagine what would happen in the country this past week, talk of enacting anti-hopping laws had long surfaced before that. In 2010, the late Karpal Singh of the Democratic Action Party renewed calls for anti-hopping laws. But his critics argued that such laws were unconstitutional for it contravenes Article 10 of the Malaysian Constitution that allows for freedom of association. That Singh\x92s proposal did not gain much traction amongst Malaysian voters then and now suggests that Malaysian voters did not regard it to be of national importance.** So, the recent developments in Malaysian politics shouldn\x92t come as a surprise to most Malaysian voters, particularly the older ones. Despite the arguments against anti-hopping laws, I am relieved that, as a Singapore citizen, our Constitution\x92s Article 46(2)(b) stipulates that lawmakers will lose their seats if they resign or are expelled from the parties that they were elected under. Singaporeans will be heading to the polls no later than April 2021. From now till then, if any political parties think that party switching should be allowed, let them bring it to the fore of political discourse both before and during the hustings.* And may the clarion call amongst those who abhor political switching reverberate*through the pulse of the political class.* Read more at https://www.todayonline.com/voices/n...se-trading-and """

The company is a joint venture between SIA Engineering and American aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng, who is no longer a Cabinet minister and MP, was personally involved in handling the union dispute with the company. In fact, Ng had earlier authorised the unions to prepare for legal strike should the management of the company refuse to budge. The company was said to be \x93lack of transparency\x94 and \x93disregard\x94 for negotiations with the unions. The last legal strike in Singapore happened in 1986 when then NTUC\x92s secretary-general Ong Teng Cheong authorised a 2-day strike by members of the Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Employees\x92 Union against an American company. Eagle Services Asia had initially wanted to retrench 144 workers with the majority (56 per cent) being Singaporeans. Legal strike was averted after the company capitulated and \x93corrected\x94 its retrenchment process. The final retrenchment list would consist of around 44 per cent Singaporeans, with the rest being foreigners. Ng said that the parties had reviewed the selection criteria to ensure that the Singaporean core of the workforce is safeguarded. MD of Eagle Services Asia came from RSAF According to SIA Engineering website, the Managing Director of its joint venture company Eagle Services Asia is Yip Ying Kiong. And according to Yip\x92s LinkedIn information, Yip came from RSAF. \x93I started my working career in the RSAF as a young civilian officer in Paya Lebar Air Base upon graduation with a Bachelor\x92s in Mechanical Engineering from NUS in 1989,\x94 he said. \x93I spent 6 years in RSAF specializing in Aircraft Propulsion. Little would I know that I would one day manage and lead PW\x92s largest Engine Center with close to 800 employees!\x94 He was appointed Managing Director of the joint venture company Eagle Services Asia in 2016. \x93Since my appointment, there were numerous milestones as we execute our Business Transformation,\x94 he added. Yip said he was initially with the company as its Director of Customer & Business Strategies. \x93I was instrumental in leading significant improvement to customer relationships, driving incremental business and establishing long term strategic directions for ESA. This laid my foundation to eventually lead ESA as the Managing Director,\x94 he claimed. still have to salute President Ong the People's Preseident"

SIA could also try to cut costs in other areas, or possibly receive additional government support to tide it through the crisis, they added. The airline had last week announced a net loss of $1.12 billion in the quarter ending June 30 - its worst quarterly showing. It also said it is reviewing the shape and size of its network over the longer term, given the impact of Covid-19 on air travel. The International Air Transport Association has said it will take until 2024 for global passenger traffic to return to the level last year. Mr Nicholas Wyatt, head of research and analysis in travel and tourism at analytics firm GlobalData, said the recovery of international flights depends on how quickly the pandemic can be brought under control, but ""there are few signs that this is happening"". But if airlines cut jobs excessively, they will be shorthanded should the market rebound quicker than expected, he added. Other options to manage costs could include renegotiating deals with suppliers or cutting in-flight amenities, said Mr Wyatt. Ms Joanna Lu, Asia's head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium, said that cutting staff costs, including through retrenchments, seems inevitable with continued low demand for air travel. ""If there is no major breakthrough in containing the virus in the next couple of months, it is extremely challenging for SIA to sustain its business scale."" While SIA has registered strong demand for cargo transport and could benefit from green lane arrangements, Ms Lu said these avenues are only small parts of its business compared with before Covid-19. It is not uncommon to see airlines worldwide cutting staff costs through measures like voluntary retirements, furloughs and leaves of absence, she added. Associate Professor Walter Theseira, an economist with the Singapore University of Social Sciences, noted that the crew manpower costs for SIA would have come down, given that crew are paid for the time spent in the air. He said: ""For SIA and other international airlines, it is really about whether their contracts allow them to pay crew the bare minimum and whether the crew want to stay on. ""I think what could work is if aircrew find outside jobs that take up a substantial portion of their time and be rostered to fly enough so as to keep their skills up, but that is easier said than done."" SIA expects its passenger capacity at the end of the second quarter of the 2020/2021 financial year to be at just 7 per cent compared with the level before Covid-19. Separately, its chief executive Goh Choon Phong announced last week pay cuts for all management and rank-and-file staff, as well as early retirement for ground staff and pilots. He also told staff to brace themselves for additional measures. In the last few months, SIA has also been boosting its balance sheet. It has raised $11 billion since its financial year started in April. CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said the Jobs Support Scheme, which subsidises up to 75 per cent of wages for local workers in the aviation sector, will be key to helping SIA retain workers. The scheme is set to stop after this month. ""I would say that there are compelling reasons for JSS to be extended for some industries which are still finding it extremely difficult to get back on their feet through no fault of theirs,"" he said. ""I think SIA value-adds to the economy and contributes to Singapore's role as a transport hub... It is a national icon that must be protected and must be helped."" Mr Alan Tan, president of the Singapore Airlines Staff Union, noted that unlike some other carriers that have retrenched cabin crew, SIA has managed to hang on to its crew so far. ""We will work with the company to continue to do what we can, but given how badly the global air travel industry is doing, it will honestly take a miracle for us to keep all of them indefinitely,"" he said."

Anyway Chinks can't fight to save their lives, Chinks have an average height of 1.60m while AMDK tower over them at an average height of 1.8m. AMDK are also much more muscular than chinks due to higher testosterone count. In fact kung fu is fake, a MMA fighter already prove he can beat any kung fu ""master"" that challenge him. The first instinct that the chink will do when faced down by an AMDK is to run for his life or beg the AMDK to not beat him up. AMDK love the taste of fear from chinks and will enjoy ripping the chinks @ss apart just like you said. That's why AMDK will always be superior because everyone is afraid of them while chinks is looked down upon by everyone no matter superpower or not because they can't fight or stand up for themselves anyways."

Chinese people who fight for themselves are labeled ""trouble-makers"" or ""uncouth"" by the West, and all kanna rejected from entering the country. Only the guai kias nerd nerd study type will get accepted. So you got selection bias here, the Chinese people inside Western countries are the guai kias to begin with. The more fiery ones stay in China. Just need to look at America now to see whats happening. Black who kanna bully by White ppl and fight back means they kanna arrested and labeled as a violent criminal dirty race. Latinos also known for being very feisty, fight back, ahhh now all kanna labeled stinking Mexicans, MS-13 drug dealers, blahblah.

It\x92s not systemic racism by Whites, it\x92s the AFT and NEA. The problem with systemic racism is that it doesn't mean anything. It's a black box, an empty variable that's used as if it's a measurable constant. It's not. Someone sees an unequal outcome when they take a certain statistical cross section, and instead of doing the hard work of untangling the complex reality that leads to that outcome, they just substitute ""systemic racism,"" and call it a day with lazy justifications like you do. What does exist is another form of structural bias which can be called ""cultural advantage""... namely, that those groups and individuals who better implement values and traditions that produce success in a given culture will tend to have superior social, economic, and political outcomes. Again, there is nothing intentional about this. These advantages are emergent outcomes of the complex system of cultural and social development. By any objective measure, American society is far less racist and more tolerant today than it was ten or twenty or fifty years ago. That's a great thing, an accomplishment that we, even as sinkies, should all be unreservedly proud of. But it also means that racially-disparate outcomes can no longer be uncritically blamed on racism. Other factors have to be honestly examined, and policy interventions will likely need to change to further improve."

I'm willing to bet you can cite numerous examples of immigrants with no money, no English language skills and no knowledge of American society becoming very successful after a generation or two. For instance, Jews, Vietnamese \x93boat\x94 people, Koreans and SW Asians (Indians) all thrive in this country, why? Education is valued above all else. When black Americans or Chinese demand a better education for their children, they will thrive. Some do get it, but they need to do more. Villain? It\x92s not systemic racism by Whites, it\x92s the AFT and NEA. The problem with systemic racism is that it doesn't mean anything. It's a black box, an empty variable that's used as if it's a measurable constant. It's not. Someone sees an unequal outcome when they take a certain statistical cross section, and instead of doing the hard work of untangling the complex reality that leads to that outcome, they just substitute ""systemic racism,"" and call it a day with lazy justifications like you do. What does exist is another form of structural bias which can be called ""cultural advantage""... namely, that those groups and individuals who better implement values and traditions that produce success in a given culture will tend to have superior social, economic, and political outcomes. Again, there is nothing intentional about this. These advantages are emergent outcomes of the complex system of cultural and social development. By any objective measure, American society is far less racist and more tolerant today than it was ten or twenty or fifty years ago. That's a great thing, an accomplishment that we, even as sinkies, should all be unreservedly proud of. But it also means that racially-disparate outcomes can no longer be uncritically blamed on racism. Other factors have to be honestly examined, and policy interventions will likely need to change to further improve. Oh please, as if simpletons can understand the WOT you just typed. Give them a chance and stop spamming WOT."

Still, better to be somewhat ashamed of killing than to revel in all sorts of torture and slow-death methods. the opposite lah, u are trying to paint ur xtians nice nice. the westerners understood fairness and mutual respect becos the protestants and catholics cant subdue each other thru warfare, politics or propaganda. both sides came to a stalemate and it became meaningless to carry on. so they come to a deal at the end of the religious reformation to respect each other, each practice their own faith and thus freedom of expressions and beliefs. but it only applies to the ppl they deemed as equals. ie among xtian angmohs themselves, or a slightly wider group, those within the abrahamic religions, including moslems and a lesser extent, jews. jews ish still systematically discriminated off and on all the way till end of WW2. that ish why slavery and global conqest of other brown/dark ppl ish still ok during the age of sails. the only thing positive ish, at least angmohs brought the idea of respecting contracts to their conquest lands. not 100% becos we knew they oso cheated the locals, but the practices were brought over and respected, esp after they established themselves and have to keep the place running. when things settled down in their colonies, laws and agreements were generally respected in order to keep things running smoothly. all the equality ideas took a long time to become what it ish today. only after WW2 then most of these were established. chinese had a chance to change this under ROC, but CCP took over and worsen it. thats why we are looking at CCP like qing dynasty now. kena whack left right center by the more advanced nations."

The exceptions to this are polling stations in designated stay-home notice facilities. The polls were initially scheduled to close at 8pm. However, several stations across the island saw long queues during the day, including Palm View Primary in Sengkang. The ELD said on Friday that although the queue situation across most of the stations had improved, ""a small number"" continued to see long queues. ""This extension in hours will allow enough time for all voters to cast their votes,"" it added. Opposition parties criticised the move to extend voting by two hours. In a statement on Friday evening, the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) called the extension ""highly irregular"" and unprecedented. The party added that some of its polling agents had to leave the stations as they understood that polling would end at 8pm. ""This will leave some of our polling stations unattended when the boxes are sealed and may render the results questionable. We call on the ELD to rescind the decision and to end polling at 8pm,"" said SDP. The National  Solidarity Party\x92s (NSP) secretary-general Spencer Ng said his party was surprised at the announcement. \x93We have already objected to holding the election during this pandemic as the reasons are clear to everyone. And now with this delay, it places further undue stress and burden on Singaporeans especially with the last minute announcement,\x94 he said. Peoples Voice leader Lim Tean called the extension ""outrageous and totally out of order"". He added: ""We were touring the polling stations today and from what we could see there was only a trickle of voters by 4pm . We are reserving our rights to challenge the decision and its consequences."" Singapore People's Party (SPP) secretary-general Steve Chia expressed concern that the extension coincided with the special voting hour for those who are unwell or on Stay-Home Notice. ""We immediately informed all our polling agents to stay safe and away. The most important priority is for them is to protect themselves and stay safe for their families,"" he said, adding that SPP polling agents were asked to return after voting closes at 10pm to witness the sealing of the ballot boxes. A special voting hour of 7pm to 8pm had initially been set aside for those on stay-home notice, on medical leave due to acute respiratory infection, or who have a fever, to cast their votes. In view of the extended hours, election officials will ask such voters at stations that still have long queues to identify themselves. These voters will be isolated in a separate holding area, in order to prevent them from mixing with other voters. Once the queue has cleared, election officials will then arrange for them to vote. The ELD said it strongly urged such voters to check the queue situation for their polling station at VoteQ.gowhere.gov.sg. If the queue is long, such voters are urged to arrive at the polling station only at 9pm, or risk facing a long wait to cast their vote. For polling stations which have no queue, such voters will be able to cast their votes as planned. The ELD said: ""(We seek) the understanding and cooperation of all voters as we seek to clear the long queues at a small number of stations, while ensuring safe voting for all voters."" https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge2020-voting-hours-extended-to-10pm"

The GRC system can work both ways. 61% mandate can translate to 83 out of 93 seats in Parliament.

The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) Office was directed to issue these correction directions by the alternate authority for the Minister of Manpower. It is the first time that a mainstream media outlet has been issued a correction direction by the Pofma Office. The directions were issued for the following: - A video titled ""NUSS Pre-General Election Forum 2020"", published by NUSS on July 3 on YouTube - A Facebook post and video titled ""Dr Paul Tambyah reveals MOM's role in outbreak of Covid-19 within dormitories"", published by TOC on July 4 - A video titled ""TOC GE2020 Livestream - Afternoon session 2 July 2020"", published by TOC on July 2 - An online article titled ""GE2020: Focus on public health could have been lost in March amid talk of early election, suggests SDP's Paul Tambyah"", published by CNA on July 4 - An audio recording titled ""An Interview with Dr Paul Tambyah"", published by New Naratif on July 5 These materials contained a few statements by Singapore Democratic Party chairman Paul Tambyah, which are false, the statement said. The four organisations will be required to each carry a correction notice stating that the online content contains false statement of facts. The statements which were highlighted as false by the two ministries are: - MOM's email advisory to employers on testing of migrant workers was made without the advice from public health medical professionals - MOM's advisory stated that employers would lose their work pass privileges if they brought their workers for Covid-19 testing - MOM actively discouraged the testing of workers In their joint statement, the Ministries of Manpower and Health stated that the medical management of migrant workers was guided by MOH and its medical professionals, based on the prevailing scientific evidence and local situation. They went on to explain that on 8 February, Changi General Hospital(CGH) informed MOH that an employer in the construction industry was sending all his workers to the CGH A&E Department to be tested for COVID-19 though the workers exhibited no symptoms and were well. They were also asking for memos from the hospital to certify that the workers were not infected with COVID-19 and were fit to work. The hospital was concerned that this would trigger a flood of healthy workers being sent to A&E departments, distracting them from the care and treatment of ill patients who required their attention. On 12 February 2020, MOH, MOM and other agencies jointly issued an advisory to the industry to advise that there was no need to prevent workers who were residing in the dormitory from working if they were not unwell. Subsequently, the hospitals informed MOH that employers were still sending workers who were healthy for testing. MOH then informed MOM, and a further advisory was sent out on 19 February 2020 to advise employers not to send their workers who were healthy for testing, so as to ensure that medical facilities and resources were focused on unwell individuals who needed medical treatment. This advice was based on the prevailing scientific evidence at that time and was also in line with MOH's risk based approach to prioritise testing and care for those who were of high risk. In the advisories to employers, MOM did not say that employers could not bring their workers for testing. Neither did MOM actively discourage the testing of workers. What MOM said was: ""Do not send workers to hospitals unless it is a medical emergency. If the worker is unwell, employers should send him to a general practitioner to seek medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether the worker needs to be sent to the hospital,"" the two ministries said in their statement. They added that the same advice was given to all in Singapore, citizens as well as residents: If unwell, even with mild respiratory symptoms, see a general practitioner immediately, who will decide on the course of treatment.

Quote: They went on to explain that on 8 February, Changi General Hospital(CGH) informed MOH that an employer in the construction industry was sending all his workers to the CGH A&E Department to be tested for COVID-19 though the workers exhibited no symptoms and were well. They were also asking for memos from the hospital to certify that the workers were not infected with COVID-19 and were fit to work. The hospital was concerned that this would trigger a flood of healthy workers being sent to A&E departments, distracting them from the care and treatment of ill patients who required their attention. i guessed this as much...1 employer tried to be funny, jitao blanket warning everyone. pretty much admit they did handle the FWs issue poorly"

This is to ensure that medical facilities and resources are focused on unwell individuals who need medical treatment. ii)                   Do not send workers to hospitals unless it is a medical emergency. If the worker is unwell, employers should send him to a general practitioner to seek medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether the worker needs to be sent to the hospital. iii)                 Employers should monitor the health of their workers by checking their temperatures twice daily and remind them to observe good personal hygiene such as washing their hands with soap frequently. 3            Our hospitals are working hard to ensure that medical emergencies are handled promptly. We encourage you to be socially responsible and only send workers to the hospital if it is a medical emergency as doing so otherwise will deny immediate treatment to those who need it. Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical facility may have their work pass privileges suspended.

The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) Office was directed to issue these correction directions by the alternate authority for the Minister of Manpower. It is the first time that a mainstream media outlet has been issued a correction direction by the Pofma Office. The directions were issued for the following: - A video titled ""NUSS Pre-General Election Forum 2020"", published by NUSS on July 3 on YouTube - A Facebook post and video titled ""Dr Paul Tambyah reveals MOM's role in outbreak of Covid-19 within dormitories"", published by TOC on July 4 - A video titled ""TOC GE2020 Livestream - Afternoon session 2 July 2020"", published by TOC on July 2 - An online article titled ""GE2020: Focus on public health could have been lost in March amid talk of early election, suggests SDP's Paul Tambyah"", published by CNA on July 4 - An audio recording titled ""An Interview with Dr Paul Tambyah"", published by New Naratif on July 5 These materials contained a few statements by Singapore Democratic Party chairman Paul Tambyah, which are false, the statement said. The four organisations will be required to each carry a correction notice stating that the online content contains false statement of facts. The statements which were highlighted as false by the two ministries are: - MOM's email advisory to employers on testing of migrant workers was made without the advice from public health medical professionals - MOM's advisory stated that employers would lose their work pass privileges if they brought their workers for Covid-19 testing - MOM actively discouraged the testing of workers In their joint statement, the Ministries of Manpower and Health stated that the medical management of migrant workers was guided by MOH and its medical professionals, based on the prevailing scientific evidence and local situation. They went on to explain that on 8 February, Changi General Hospital(CGH) informed MOH that an employer in the construction industry was sending all his workers to the CGH A&E Department to be tested for COVID-19 though the workers exhibited no symptoms and were well. They were also asking for memos from the hospital to certify that the workers were not infected with COVID-19 and were fit to work. The hospital was concerned that this would trigger a flood of healthy workers being sent to A&E departments, distracting them from the care and treatment of ill patients who required their attention. On 12 February 2020, MOH, MOM and other agencies jointly issued an advisory to the industry to advise that there was no need to prevent workers who were residing in the dormitory from working if they were not unwell. Subsequently, the hospitals informed MOH that employers were still sending workers who were healthy for testing. MOH then informed MOM, and a further advisory was sent out on 19 February 2020 to advise employers not to send their workers who were healthy for testing, so as to ensure that medical facilities and resources were focused on unwell individuals who needed medical treatment. This advice was based on the prevailing scientific evidence at that time and was also in line with MOH's risk based approach to prioritise testing and care for those who were of high risk. In the advisories to employers, MOM did not say that employers could not bring their workers for testing. Neither did MOM actively discourage the testing of workers. What MOM said was: ""Do not send workers to hospitals unless it is a medical emergency. If the worker is unwell, employers should send him to a general practitioner to seek medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether the worker needs to be sent to the hospital,"" the two ministries said in their statement. They added that the same advice was given to all in Singapore, citizens as well as residents: If unwell, even with mild respiratory symptoms, see a general practitioner immediately, who will decide on the course of treatment.

Do not ignore. It will come after you, your family one day. Wake up.....vote for change... tripleg wrote: Five correction directions have been issued to the National University of Singapore Society (NUSS), Channel News Asia(CNA), The Online Citizen Asia (TOC) and New Naratif, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a joint statement on Sunday (July 5). The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) Office was directed to issue these correction directions by the alternate authority for the Minister of Manpower. It is the first time that a mainstream media outlet has been issued a correction direction by the Pofma Office. The directions were issued for the following: - A video titled ""NUSS Pre-General Election Forum 2020"", published by NUSS on July 3 on YouTube - A Facebook post and video titled ""Dr Paul Tambyah reveals MOM's role in outbreak of Covid-19 within dormitories"", published by TOC on July 4 - A video titled ""TOC GE2020 Livestream - Afternoon session 2 July 2020"", published by TOC on July 2 - An online article titled ""GE2020: Focus on public health could have been lost in March amid talk of early election, suggests SDP's Paul Tambyah"", published by CNA on July 4 - An audio recording titled ""An Interview with Dr Paul Tambyah"", published by New Naratif on July 5 These materials contained a few statements by Singapore Democratic Party chairman Paul Tambyah, which are false, the statement said. The four organisations will be required to each carry a correction notice stating that the online content contains false statement of facts. The statements which were highlighted as false by the two ministries are: - MOM's email advisory to employers on testing of migrant workers was made without the advice from public health medical professionals - MOM's advisory stated that employers would lose their work pass privileges if they brought their workers for Covid-19 testing - MOM actively discouraged the testing of workers In their joint statement, the Ministries of Manpower and Health stated that the medical management of migrant workers was guided by MOH and its medical professionals, based on the prevailing scientific evidence and local situation. They went on to explain that on 8 February, Changi General Hospital(CGH) informed MOH that an employer in the construction industry was sending all his workers to the CGH A&E Department to be tested for COVID-19 though the workers exhibited no symptoms and were well. They were also asking for memos from the hospital to certify that the workers were not infected with COVID-19 and were fit to work. The hospital was concerned that this would trigger a flood of healthy workers being sent to A&E departments, distracting them from the care and treatment of ill patients who required their attention. On 12 February 2020, MOH, MOM and other agencies jointly issued an advisory to the industry to advise that there was no need to prevent workers who were residing in the dormitory from working if they were not unwell. Subsequently, the hospitals informed MOH that employers were still sending workers who were healthy for testing. MOH then informed MOM, and a further advisory was sent out on 19 February 2020 to advise employers not to send their workers who were healthy for testing, so as to ensure that medical facilities and resources were focused on unwell individuals who needed medical treatment. This advice was based on the prevailing scientific evidence at that time and was also in line with MOH's risk based approach to prioritise testing and care for those who were of high risk. In the advisories to employers, MOM did not say that employers could not bring their workers for testing. Neither did MOM actively discourage the testing of workers. What MOM said was: ""Do not send workers to hospitals unless it is a medical emergency. If the worker is unwell, employers should send him to a general practitioner to seek medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether the worker needs to be sent to the hospital,"" the two ministries said in their statement. They added that the same advice was given to all in Singapore, citizens as well as residents: If unwell, even with mild respiratory symptoms, see a general practitioner immediately, who will decide on the course of treatment. Details of the corrections and clarifications regarding the statements can be found here. https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...ahs-statements"

The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) Office was directed to issue these correction directions by the alternate authority for the Minister of Manpower. It is the first time that a mainstream media outlet has been issued a correction direction by the Pofma Office. The directions were issued for the following: - A video titled ""NUSS Pre-General Election Forum 2020"", published by NUSS on July 3 on YouTube - A Facebook post and video titled ""Dr Paul Tambyah reveals MOM's role in outbreak of Covid-19 within dormitories"", published by TOC on July 4 - A video titled ""TOC GE2020 Livestream - Afternoon session 2 July 2020"", published by TOC on July 2 - An online article titled ""GE2020: Focus on public health could have been lost in March amid talk of early election, suggests SDP's Paul Tambyah"", published by CNA on July 4 - An audio recording titled ""An Interview with Dr Paul Tambyah"", published by New Naratif on July 5 These materials contained a few statements by Singapore Democratic Party chairman Paul Tambyah, which are false, the statement said. The four organisations will be required to each carry a correction notice stating that the online content contains false statement of facts. The statements which were highlighted as false by the two ministries are: - MOM's email advisory to employers on testing of migrant workers was made without the advice from public health medical professionals - MOM's advisory stated that employers would lose their work pass privileges if they brought their workers for Covid-19 testing - MOM actively discouraged the testing of workers In their joint statement, the Ministries of Manpower and Health stated that the medical management of migrant workers was guided by MOH and its medical professionals, based on the prevailing scientific evidence and local situation. They went on to explain that on 8 February, Changi General Hospital(CGH) informed MOH that an employer in the construction industry was sending all his workers to the CGH A&E Department to be tested for COVID-19 though the workers exhibited no symptoms and were well. They were also asking for memos from the hospital to certify that the workers were not infected with COVID-19 and were fit to work. The hospital was concerned that this would trigger a flood of healthy workers being sent to A&E departments, distracting them from the care and treatment of ill patients who required their attention. On 12 February 2020, MOH, MOM and other agencies jointly issued an advisory to the industry to advise that there was no need to prevent workers who were residing in the dormitory from working if they were not unwell. Subsequently, the hospitals informed MOH that employers were still sending workers who were healthy for testing. MOH then informed MOM, and a further advisory was sent out on 19 February 2020 to advise employers not to send their workers who were healthy for testing, so as to ensure that medical facilities and resources were focused on unwell individuals who needed medical treatment. This advice was based on the prevailing scientific evidence at that time and was also in line with MOH's risk based approach to prioritise testing and care for those who were of high risk. In the advisories to employers, MOM did not say that employers could not bring their workers for testing. Neither did MOM actively discourage the testing of workers. What MOM said was: ""Do not send workers to hospitals unless it is a medical emergency. If the worker is unwell, employers should send him to a general practitioner to seek medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether the worker needs to be sent to the hospital,"" the two ministries said in their statement. They added that the same advice was given to all in Singapore, citizens as well as residents: If unwell, even with mild respiratory symptoms, see a general practitioner immediately, who will decide on the course of treatment. Details of the corrections and clarifications regarding the statements can be found here. https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...ahs-statements In before PAP IBs reply MOH and PAP Minister Lawrence Wong said they wanted to test all 300,000 foreign workers in Singapore. Then now PAP change their story, they claim only send their workers to hospital unless emergency. So what was MOH instruction to employers for testing all their workers in the first place? Did MOH tell employers to wait until they went to dormitories to test their workers? Or did MOH tell employers to send their workers to somewhere for testing? Where is that somewhere? https://ifonlysingaporeans.blogspot....grant.html?m=1 Also one of the dormitory operator gave his account of working with MOM. There was so many things that MOM did not do properly, and left dormitory operators unable to find manpower to comply with their orders. MOM also kept changing their rules, almost on a daily basis. How to expect employers and dormitory operators to constantly keep track whenever MOM change their mind? https://www.ricemedia.co/current-aff...tory-operator/"

I disagree with this view.\u201d The Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made that argument to Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1988. More than 30 years later, Deng has proved prescient. After decades of extraordinary economic success, Asia today is the world\u2019s fastest-growing region. Within this decade, Asian economies will become larger than the rest of the world\u2019s economies combined, something that has not been true since the nineteenth century. Yet even now, Deng\u2019s warning holds: an Asian century is neither inevitable nor foreordained. Asia has prospered because Pax Americana, which has held since the end of World War II, provided a favorable strategic context. But now, the troubled U.S.-Chinese relationship raises profound questions about Asia\u2019s future and the shape of the emerging international order. Southeast Asian countries, including Singapore, are especially concerned, as they live at the intersection of the interests of various major powers and must avoid being caught in the middle or forced into invidious choices. The status quo in Asia must change. But will the new configuration enable further success or bring dangerous instability? That depends on the choices that the United States and China make, separately and together. The two powers must work out a modus vivendi that will be competitive in some areas without allowing rivalry to poison cooperation in others. Asian countries see the United States as a resident power that has vital interests in the region. At the same time, China is a reality on the doorstep. Asian countries do not want to be forced to choose between the two. And if either attempts to force such a choice\u2014if Washington tries to contain China\u2019s rise or Beijing seeks to build an exclusive sphere of influence in Asia\u2014they will begin a course of confrontation that will last decades and put the long-heralded Asian century in jeopardy. THE TWO PHASES OF PAX AMERICANA Pax Americana in Asia in the twentieth century had two distinct phases. The first was from 1945 to the 1970s, during the early decades of the Cold War, when the United States and its allies competed with the Soviet bloc for influence. Although China joined the Soviet Union to confront the United States during the wars in Korea and Vietnam, its economy remained inwardly focused and isolated, and it maintained few economic links with other Asian countries. Meanwhile, elsewhere in Asia, free-market economies were taking off. Japan\u2019s was the earliest to do so, followed by the newly industrializing economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. What made Asia\u2019s stability and prosperity possible was the United States. The United States championed an open, integrated, and rules-based global order and provided a security umbrella under which regional countries could cooperate and peacefully compete. American multinational corporations invested extensively in Asia, bringing with them capital, technology, and ideas. As Washington promoted free trade and opened U.S. markets to the world, Asian trade with the United States grew. Two pivotal events in the 1970s shifted Pax Americana in Asia into a new phase: the secret visit to China in 1971 by Henry Kissinger, then the U.S. national security adviser, which laid the basis for U.S.-Chinese rapprochement after decades of hostility, and the launch, in 1978, of Deng\u2019s program of \u201creform and opening up,\u201d which allowed China\u2019s economy to take off. By the end of the decade, economic barriers were coming down, and international trade was growing rapidly. After the Vietnam War and the war in Cambodia ended, Vietnam and the other countries of Indochina were able to focus their energies and resources on economic development, and they started catching up with the rest of Asia. Many Asian countries had long viewed the United States and other developed countries as their main economic partners. But they now increasingly seized the opportunities created by China\u2019s rapid development. Trade and tourism with China grew, and supply chains became tightly integrated. Within a few decades, China went from being economically inconsequential for the rest of Asia to being the region\u2019s biggest economy and major economic partner. China\u2019s influence in regional affairs grew correspondingly. Still, Pax Americana held, and these radical changes in China\u2019s role took place within its framework. China was not in a position to challenge U.S. preeminence and did not attempt to do so. Indeed, it adopted as its guiding philosophy Deng\u2019s dictum \u201cHide your strength, bide your time\u201d and prioritized the modernization of its agricultural, industrial, and science and technology sectors over building military strength. Southeast Asian countries thus enjoyed the best of both worlds, building economic relationships with China while maintaining strong ties with the United States and other developed countries. They also deepened ties with one another and worked together to create an open architecture for regional cooperation rooted in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ASEAN played a central role in forming the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 1989, establishing the ASEAN Regional Forum in 1994, and convening the annual East Asia Summit since 2005. China participates fully in these processes. Every year, the Chinese premier travels to an ASEAN member state to meet the ASEAN countries\u2019 leaders, well prepared to explain how China sees the region and armed with proposals to enhance Chinese cooperation with the grouping\u2019s members. As China\u2019s stake in the region has grown, it has launched its own initiatives, including the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. These have helped deepen China\u2019s engagement with its neighbors and, of course, increased its influence. But because the regional architecture is open, China\u2019s influence is not exclusive. The United States remains an important participant, underpinning regional security and stability and enhancing its economic engagement through initiatives such as the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act and the BUILD Act. ASEAN also has formal dialogue mechanisms with the European Union, as well as with India and many other countries. ASEAN believes that such a network of connections creates a more robust framework for cooperation and more space to advance its members\u2019 collective interests internationally. So far, this formula has worked well. But the strategic basis of Pax Americana has shifted fundamentally. In the four decades since it began to reform and open up, China has been transformed. As its economy, technological capabilities, and political influence have grown exponentially, its outlook on the world has changed, as well. Chinese leaders today no longer cite Deng\u2019s maxim about hiding one\u2019s strength and biding one\u2019s time. China sees itself as a continental power and aspires to become a maritime power, too; it has been modernizing its army and navy and aims to turn its military into a world-class fighting force. Increasingly, and quite understandably, China wants to protect and advance its interests abroad and secure what it sees as its rightful place in international affairs. At the same time, the United States, which is still the preeminent power in many dimensions, is reassessing its grand strategy. As its share of global GDP diminishes, it is unclear whether the United States will continue to shoulder the burden of maintaining international peace and stability, or whether it might instead pursue a narrower, \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to protecting its interests. As Washington asks fundamental questions about its responsibilities in the global system, its relationship with Beijing has come under increased scrutiny. THE FUNDAMENTAL CHOICES OF THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA The United States and China each face fundamental choices. The United States must decide whether to view China\u2019s rise as an existential threat and try to hold China back through all available means or to accept China as a major power in its own right. If it chooses the latter path, the United States must craft an approach to China that will foster cooperation and healthy competition wherever possible and not allow rivalry to poison the entire relationship. Ideally, this competition will take place within an agreed multilateral framework of rules and norms of the kind that govern the United Nations and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The United States is likely to find this a painful adjustment, especially with the growing consensus in Washington that engaging Beijing has failed and that a tougher approach is necessary to preserve U.S. interests. But however difficult the task will be for the United States, it is well worth making a serious effort to accommodate China\u2019s aspirations within the current system of international rules and norms. This system imposes responsibilities and restraints on all countries, strengthens trust, helps manage conflicts, and creates a safer and stabler environment for both cooperation and competition. If the United States chooses instead to try to contain China\u2019s rise, it will risk provoking a reaction that could set the two countries on a path to decades of confrontation. The United States is not a declining power. It has great resilience and strengths, one of which is its ability to attract talent from around the world; of the nine people of Chinese ethnicity who have been awarded Nobel Prizes in the sciences, eight were U.S. citizens or subsequently became U.S. citizens. On the other side, the Chinese economy possesses tremendous dynamism and increasingly advanced technology; it is far from being a Potemkin village or the tottering command economy that defined the Soviet Union in its final years. Any confrontation between these two great powers is unlikely to end as the Cold War did, in one country\u2019s peaceful collapse. For its part, China must decide whether to try to get its way as an unencumbered major power, prevailing by dint of its sheer weight and economic strength\u2014 but at the risk of strong pushback, not just from the United States but from other countries, too. This approach is likely to increase tensions and resentment, which would affect China\u2019s standing and influence in the longer term. This is a real danger: a recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that people in Canada, the United States, and other Asian and western European countries have increasingly unfavorable views of China. Despite China\u2019s recent efforts to build soft power abroad\u2014through its network of Confucius Institutes, for example, and through Chinese-owned international newspapers and television outlets\u2014the trend is negative. Alternatively, China could acknowledge that it is no longer poor and weak and accept that the world now has higher expectations of it. It is no longer politically justifiable for China to enjoy the concessions and privileges it won when it was smaller and less developed, such as the generous terms under which it joined the WTO in 2001. A larger and more powerful China should not only respect global rules and norms but also take on greater responsibility for upholding and updating the international order under which it has prospered so spectacularly. Where the existing rules and norms are no longer fit for purpose, China should collaborate with the United States and other countries to work out revised arrangements that all can live with. The path to creating a new order is not straightforward. Powerful domestic pressures impel and constrain both countries\u2019 foreign policy choices. Foreign policy has featured little in the current U.S. presidential campaign, and when it has, the prevailing focus has been variants of the theme of \u201cAmerica first.\u201d In China, the leadership\u2019s overriding priority is to maintain internal political stability and, after enduring nearly two centuries of weakness and humiliation, to manifest the confidence of an ancient civilization on the rise again. So it cannot be taken for granted that the United States and China will manage their bilateral relations based on rational calculations of their national interests or even share a desire for win-win outcomes. The countries are not necessarily set on a course of confrontation, but confrontation cannot be ruled out. DYNAMICS IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC These dynamics will play out all over the world, but one crucial arena will be the Asia-Pacific. The United States has always had vital national interests in this region. It expended blood and treasure fighting the Pacific War to defeat Japan, a war in which the United States nearly lost three future presidents. It fought two costly wars in Korea and Vietnam, which bought precious time for non-communist countries in Asia to consolidate their societies and economies and win the battle of hearts and minds against communism. The United States\u2019 generous, open policies that have so greatly benefited the Asia-Pacific derived from deep-rooted political ideals and its self-image as \u201ca city upon a hill\u201d and \u201ca light unto the nations,\u201d but they also reflected its enlightened self-interest. A stable and prospering Asia-Pacific was first a bulwark against the communist countries in the Cold War and then an important region of the world comprising many stable and prosperous countries well disposed toward the United States. To U.S. businesses, the Asia-Pacific offered sizable markets and important production bases. Unsurprisingly, several of the United States\u2019 staunchest allies are in Asia, such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea, and so are some of its long-standing partners, such as Singapore. China has vital interests in the region, too. In Northeast Asia, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Korean War still cast long shadows. In Southeast Asia, China sees a source of energy and raw materials, economic partners, and important sea lines of communication. It also sees chokepoints in the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea that must be kept open to protect China\u2019s energy security. But one critical difference with the United States is that China sees the Asia-Pacific as its \u201cnear abroad,\u201d to borrow a Russian expression, and thus as essential to its own security. Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that the Pacific Ocean is big enough to accommodate both the United States and China. But he has also said that Asian security should be left to Asians. A natural question arises: Does Xi think that the Pacific Ocean is big enough for the United States and China to coexist peacefully, with overlapping circles of friends and partners, or that it is big enough to be divided down the middle between the two powers, into rival spheres of influence? Singapore and other Asia-Pacific countries have no doubt which interpretation they prefer. Although they may not have much influence over how things will turn out, they fervently hope not to be forced to choose between the United States and China. The U.S. security presence remains vital to the Asia-Pacific region. Without it, Japan and South Korea would be compelled to contemplate developing nuclear weapons; both are nuclear threshold states, and the subject already regularly surfaces in their public discourse, especially given North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear weapons capabilities. Such developments are fortunately still hypothetical, but their prospect is conducive neither to stability in Northeast Asia nor to nonproliferation efforts globally. In Southeast Asia, the U.S. Seventh Fleet has contributed to regional security since World War II, ensuring that sea lines of communication remain safe and open, which has enabled trade and stimulated economic growth. Despite its increasing military strength, China would be unable to take over the United States\u2019 security role. Unlike the United States, China has competing maritime and territorial claims in the South China Sea with several countries in the region, which will always see China\u2019s naval presence as an attempt to advance those claims. Another obstacle that would prevent China from taking over the security role currently played by the United States stems from the fact that many Southeast Asian countries have significant ethnic Chinese minorities, whose relations with the non-Chinese majority are often delicate. These countries are extremely sensitive about any perception that China has an inordinate influence on their ethnic Chinese populations\u2014especially recalling the history of China\u2019s support for communist insurgencies in Southeast Asia until the early 1980s. Those sensitivities will constrain China\u2019s role in Southeast Asian affairs for the foreseeable future. Singapore is the only Southeast Asian country whose multiracial population is majority ethnic Chinese. In fact, it is the only sovereign state in the world with such demographics other than China itself. But Singapore has made enormous efforts to build a multiracial national identity and not a Chinese one. And it has also been extremely careful to avoid doing anything that could be misperceived as allowing itself to be used as a cat\u2019s-paw by China. For this reason, Singapore did not establish diplomatic relations with China until 1990, making it the final Southeast Asian country, except for Brunei, to do so. Of course, Singapore and all other Asian countries want to cultivate good relations with China. They hope to enjoy the goodwill and support of such a major power and to participate in its growth. Global supply chains\u2014whether for aircraft, cellular phones, or surgical masks\u2014link China and other Asian countries closely together. China\u2019s sheer size has made it the largest trading partner of most other Asian countries, including every treaty ally of the United States in the region, as well as Singapore and nearly every other ASEAN country. It would be very difficult, bordering on impossible, for the United States to replace China as the world\u2019s chief supplier, just as it would be unthinkable for the United States itself to do without the Chinese market, which is the third-largest importer of U.S. goods, after Canada and Mexico. But neither can China displace the United States\u2019 economic role in Asia. The global financial system relies heavily on U.S. financial institutions, and the renminbi will not replace the U.S. dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency anytime soon. Although the other Asian countries export more to China than to the United States, U.S. multinational corporations still form the largest source of foreign investments in many Asia-Pacific countries, including Singapore. China\u2019s major companies are starting to invest abroad, but it will be many years before China has multinational corporations of the same scale and sophistication as those based in the United States, which tie global production chains together, link Asia with the global economy, and create millions of jobs. For these reasons, Asia-Pacific countries do not wish to be forced to choose between the United States and China. They want to cultivate good relations with both. They cannot afford to alienate China, and other Asian countries will try their best not to let any single dispute dominate their overall relationships with Beijing. At the same time, those Asian countries regard the United States as a resident power with vital interests in the region. They were supportive\u2014some more overtly than others\u2014when U.S. President Barack Obama declared that the United States intended to \u201crebalance\u201d American foreign policy toward Asia. They take comfort that although the Trump administration has raised issues of cost and burden sharing with its friends and allies, it has also put forward a strategy for the Indo-Pacific region and announced its intention to build up the U.S. military\u2019s Indo-Pacific Command. But those Asian countries also recognize that the United States is a global hyperpower, with far-flung preoccupations and urgent priorities all over the world. They are realistic that should tensions grow\u2014or, even worse, should conflict occur\u2014they cannot automatically take U.S. support for granted. They expect to do their part to defend their countries and interests. They also hope that the United States understands that if other Asian countries promote ties with China, that does not necessarily mean that they are working against the United States. (And of course, these Asian countries hope for the same understanding from China, too, if they strengthen their ties with the United States.) AN INCLUSIVE REGIONAL ARCHITECTURE The United States and China are not the only major countries with a great deal of influence in the region; other players also have significant roles. Japan, in particular, has much to contribute to the region, given the size and sophistication of its economy. Under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, it has contributed more actively than before. For example, after the United States withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017, Japan stepped up. It galvanized the remaining 11 members to complete the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which brings together developed and developing countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean and is a step toward free trade in the Asia-Pacific region. India also enjoys a great deal of potential influence. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has declared a strategic shift through its Act East Policy, and other countries look forward to seeing this policy put into action. The East Asia Summit includes India as a member because other members hoped that as India\u2019s economy grew, it would see more value in regional cooperation. India was also one of the original countries negotiating to form the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a proposed free-trade agreement that aims to integrate all the major economies in the Asia-Pacific, similar to the way that the North American Free Trade Agreement (now the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement) linked together countries in North America. After extensive negotiations, India decided last year not to join the RCEP; the remaining 15 participating countries are moving forward, although without India, something significant has been lost. As most Asian countries recognize, the value of such agreements goes beyond the economic gains they generate. They are platforms that enable Asia-Pacific countries to cooperate with one another, develop stakes in one another\u2019s success, and together mold the regional architecture and the rules that govern it. Such regional arrangements must be open and inclusive. They should not, whether by design or result, keep any party out, undermine existing cooperation arrangements, create rival blocs, or force countries to take sides. This is why CPTPP members have left the door open for the United States to sign on once again, and why the countries that are working to form the RCEP still hope that India will join one day. This is also the basis on which Asia-Pacific countries support regional cooperation initiatives such as the various Indo-Pacific concepts proposed by Japan, the United States, and other countries, as well as China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. Many other Asian countries view supporting the Belt and Road Initiative as a constructive way to accommodate China\u2019s growing influence in the region. If implemented well and with financial discipline, the initiative\u2019s projects can strengthen regional and multilateral cooperation and address the pressing need for better infrastructure and connectivity in many developing countries. Some such projects have been criticized for lacking transparency or viability, but there is no reason to believe that all of the initiative\u2019s projects, by definition, will impose unsustainable financial burdens on countries or prevent them from growing their links with other major economies. Such consequences would not serve China\u2019s interests, either, since they would undermine its international standing and influence. Developing new regional arrangements does not mean abandoning or sidelining existing multilateral institutions. These hard-won multilateral arrangements and institutions continue to give all countries, especially smaller ones, a framework for working together and advancing their collective interests. But many existing multilateral institutions are in urgent need of reform: they are no longer effective, given current economic and strategic realities. For instance, since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in 1994, the WTO has found it increasingly difficult to reach meaningful trade agreements, because any deal requires consensus from its 164 members, which have hugely divergent interests and economic philosophies. And since last year, the WTO\u2019s Appellate Body has been paralyzed by the lack of a quorum. This is a loss for all countries, who should work constructively toward reforming such organizations rather than diminishing their effectiveness or bypassing them altogether. A FERVENT HOPE The strategic choices that the United States and China make will shape the contours of the emerging global order. It is natural for big powers to compete. But it is their capacity for cooperation that is the true test of statecraft, and it will determine whether humanity makes progress on global problems such as climate change, nuclear proliferation, and the spread of infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of how vital it is for countries to work together. Diseases do not respect national borders, and international cooperation is desperately needed to bring the pandemic under control and reduce damage to the global economy. Even with the best relations between the United States and China, mounting a collective response to COVID-19 would be hugely challenging. Unfortunately, the pandemic is exacerbating the U.S.-Chinese rivalry, increasing mistrust, one-upmanship, and mutual blame. This will surely worsen if, as now seems inevitable, the pandemic becomes a major issue in the U.S. presidential election. One can only hope that the gravity of the situation will concentrate minds and allow wiser counsel to prevail. In the meantime, Asian countries have their hands full, coping with the pandemic and the many other obstacles to improving the lives of their citizens and creating a more secure and prosperous region. Their success\u2014and the prospect of an Asian century\u2014will depend greatly on whether the United States and China can overcome their differences, build mutual trust, and work constructively to uphold a stable and peaceful international order. This is a fundamental issue of our time. Let's see what those CCP IBs/wumao/SG traitors will say... and also those kumgong kia in EDMW supporting chinese chauvinism/chinese supremacy in SG..."

The Progress Singapore Party intends to field Mr. Kumaran Pillai in the upcoming General Elections. I must speak out against him. In my experience, he does not possess the values needed to be a leader and a servant of the people. In late 2013, I first met Mr. Pillai to discuss the possibility of contributing to The Independent Singapore on a freelance basis. We established a verbal agreement for payment terms on a per-article basis. When I worked for TISG as a freelancer, he paid for the articles promptly. In November, I saw a recruitment page on The Independent Singapore. The page had just two paragraphs: a statement that TISG was looking to hire journalists, and that individuals interested in the position should submit their CVs for consideration. I decided to apply for the job. Mr. Pillai met me for an interview. During the interview, we discussed the scope of work and payment terms. I agreed to write one story per workday for TISG. My first day of work was 9 December 2013, the day after the Little India riots. My initial stories focused on the riots and the fallout. Soon after that, Mr. Pillai gathered everyone for a meeting. He wanted to change the way we do things. He wanted us to write one minor story in the morning and one major story by the evening. He also expected us to upload stories on the website, after obtaining editorial approval. It was a dramatic expansion of our job scope, but he did not offer any additional compensation. My colleague XXX told me that this was not what she had agreed to do. She claimed that during her job interview, Mr. Pillai asked her what she wanted to do instead of setting out clearly-defined responsibilities. When she brought up this issue with Mr. Pillai after he\u2019d changed the job scope, he told her to \u2018check the website\u2019. The recruitment page had been updated without our input. Now it listed our new responsibilities, including writing two stories a day and publishing content on the website. It seemed as if Mr. Pillai had unilaterally increased our job scope without consulting us or offering us greater compensation. Salary was another sticking point. I worked for the month of December without payment. Our salary was constantly deferred through the month of January. I was concerned that I would not be paid at all. As the weeks proceeded, Mr. Pillai started asking me, in private, about how I felt about my coworkers. Colleague XXX told me the same thing. She wondered if he was trying to dig up dirt on the rest of us, and shared with me stories about the journalists who came before me. Mr. Pillai had hired a former mainstream media reporter to work for TISG. However, the reporter had a habit of leaving the office early when the day\u2019s work was done and there was nothing left to do. Mr. Pillai fired him for this behaviour. Mr. Pillai had also brought in an intern. His job was to manage the website and upload stories. One day he fell sick, but volunteered to work from home even though he had a one week medical certificate. Colleague XXX coordinated with him to ensure the stories would be uploaded. When he returned in mid-November, Mr. Pillai fired him for lack of enthusiasm for the job. With this history, Colleague XXX felt that Mr. Pillai was playing office politics against everyone, and grew increasingly suspicious of his behaviour. Her last straw came when she discovered that he did not pay her CPF contributions. My last straw was when I worked through most of January without seeing payment for December. I joined TISG so that I could earn a steady income. Mr. Pillai offered no explanations about our late paychecks. When I finally received my salary, just three days before Chinese New Year, I quit. While I was fortunate to have been paid in full, Colleague XXX said that Mr. Pillai had not paid her CPF contribution. I transitioned to becoming a freelance writer. In mid-2014, I decided to contribute articles to TISG again. On 6 June, the then-editor, NAME CENSORED, offered to pay me $100 per article. I felt that I could trust NAME CENSORED more than Mr. Pillai, and agreed to this arrangement. In June 2014, I wrote 5 pieces for TISG. I wrote 2 more stories in both July and August. Mr. Pillai did not pay for them. On 3rd and 6th August 2014, Mr. Pillai personally replied to stories I sent, demonstrating that he was aware that I was sending in articles to TISG on a freelance basis. He further claimed he would process my invoices \u2018next week\u2019. He did not. On 25th August 2014, he said, \u201cI can drop the check into your account if you can give me the details.\u201d He requested the invoices and a breakdown of the articles. I furnished the requested information. Again, he did not pay me. In September I followed up with him again. He said he was \u2018out of town\u2019 and that he would settle it with me when he returned. Previously he did not mention that he was leaving Singapore, or that there was any other issue with payment. I said that him refusing to pay was a breach of terms described in my invoices. In 2013, my invoice stated that payment should be made within 30 days. No one had any objections to that. I re-used those terms in 2014. His lawyer, NAME CENSORED, advised him to \u2018stop payment\u2019 because \u2018A person can\u2019t just introduce terms in invoices and expect it to be binding on us.\u2019 NAME CENSORED said he would review the contract. Three weeks later, in October, I followed up with the two of them. Since then, I have received no response. When I visited TISG\u2019s website, I discovered that they had taken down almost all of the articles I had written for them. The only ones that remained were published under the author name \u2018The Independent\u2019, with my name listed as the byline in the body of the text. In addition, my official TISG email was closed. If you search for \u2018AUTHOR'S NAME CENSORED' on the TISG website, you will find the articles I wrote during my freelance period, as well as the articles I wrote during my employment period in December 2013 and January 2014, that were published under \u2018The Independent\u2019 instead of my name. I have retained copies of the articles I wrote and my correspondence with Mr. Pillai, NAME CENSORED, and NAME CENSORED, and printed the surviving TISG articles of my website. You can find the articles here and my correspondence here. The story pitches, and the articles, demonstrate a business relationship existed between myself and The Independent Singapore. The emails concerning the invoices and payment show that Mr. Pillai has consistently and repeatedly failed to pay me for my work. I have lost all faith and confidence in Mr. Pillai. He has not demonstrated the integrity Singapore expects from her elected leaders. Singapore deserves better than this.

The Hong Kong-born actor and director had just passed a white, female pedestrian in her early 30s at a safe distance when she barked at him to \x93F*** off back to China.\x94 When Tse turned back in dismay and replied, \x93I\x92m British. How dare you?\x94, she yelled, \x93Take your f***ing virus home with you. \x93The UK was incredibly racist when I grew up here in the 70s and 80s,\x94 he recalls of his boyhood in the West Midlands town of Leominster. \x93We lived in a small market town and my parents ran a fish-and-chip shop and Chinese takeaway. Every Friday and Saturday night we used to get racist behaviour from drunken customers. They would come in to be served and at the same time abuse us. \x93I think people here are still racist towards Chinese and East Asians, although there was a grudging respect because of the way China has advanced and become an economic superpower.\x94 The threat was most vividly illustrated in early March by a vicious attack on Singaporean student Jonathan Mok, who was left with a black eye, a broken bone below his eye and a swollen face after being attacked by a two teenagers in Oxford Street, just a few minutes\x92 walk from where Tse would later be verbally abused. \x93They are playing the racecard and scapegoating. They have racialised a disease and they are promoting Sino*phobic propaganda, echoing what the Nazis did in Germany against the Jews. People are angry. It\x92s like the 1930s in the sense that the economy is going to tank and people are listening more to extremist voices.\x94 At the root of the problem, Tse believes, is the fact that while Asian countries have handled the coronavirus effec*tively, Britain\x92s approach has been marred by \x93complacency, negligence and incompetence\x94. He says, \x93It shows the resi*dual colonialism, arrogance and the notion they knew better because they were more advanced and more civil*ised. \x93They started swearing about the coronavirus and using the worst expletives you can imagine,\x94 she says. \x93I told them they were being ignorant and that the virus doesn\x92t discriminate.\x94 Minutes later, as she spoke on her phone to the British Transport Police to report the incident outside the station, Tan was subjected to a second assault. \x93A well-dressed couple came towards me and the man walked right up to me and coughed in my face,\x94 she says. \x93I\x92m living in fear for my children and me because of the rising hate crimes,\x94 wrote one. \x93I\x92m very worried about my future as a British Chinese living in the UK,\x94 wrote another."

The Hong Kong-born actor and director had just passed a white, female pedestrian in her early 30s at a safe distance when she barked at him to \x93F*** off back to China.\x94 When Tse turned back in dismay and replied, \x93I\x92m British. How dare you?\x94, she yelled, \x93Take your f***ing virus home with you. \x93The UK was incredibly racist when I grew up here in the 70s and 80s,\x94 he recalls of his boyhood in the West Midlands town of Leominster. \x93We lived in a small market town and my parents ran a fish-and-chip shop and Chinese takeaway. Every Friday and Saturday night we used to get racist behaviour from drunken customers. They would come in to be served and at the same time abuse us. \x93I think people here are still racist towards Chinese and East Asians, although there was a grudging respect because of the way China has advanced and become an economic superpower.\x94 The threat was most vividly illustrated in early March by a vicious attack on Singaporean student Jonathan Mok, who was left with a black eye, a broken bone below his eye and a swollen face after being attacked by a two teenagers in Oxford Street, just a few minutes\x92 walk from where Tse would later be verbally abused. \x93They are playing the racecard and scapegoating. They have racialised a disease and they are promoting Sino*phobic propaganda, echoing what the Nazis did in Germany against the Jews. People are angry. It\x92s like the 1930s in the sense that the economy is going to tank and people are listening more to extremist voices.\x94 At the root of the problem, Tse believes, is the fact that while Asian countries have handled the coronavirus effec*tively, Britain\x92s approach has been marred by \x93complacency, negligence and incompetence\x94. He says, \x93It shows the resi*dual colonialism, arrogance and the notion they knew better because they were more advanced and more civil*ised. \x93They started swearing about the coronavirus and using the worst expletives you can imagine,\x94 she says. \x93I told them they were being ignorant and that the virus doesn\x92t discriminate.\x94 Minutes later, as she spoke on her phone to the British Transport Police to report the incident outside the station, Tan was subjected to a second assault. \x93A well-dressed couple came towards me and the man walked right up to me and coughed in my face,\x94 she says. \x93I\x92m living in fear for my children and me because of the rising hate crimes,\x94 wrote one. \x93I\x92m very worried about my future as a British Chinese living in the UK,\x94 wrote another. Is this the best that China-HK-and-CCP can retaliate against Trump's trumpcard??? 7-early-8-early have to chutt victim card and claim discrimination, means that China-HK-CCP has no more cards in their hands. It simply reveals who are the loser in this trade-war plus HK democracy war. HaHaHaHa HaHaHaHa"

Singaporeans thinks African - Americans are the only victims of racism, that we, as Asians, are safe from the onslaught of racism? These are the attitude that would breed another generation of Asian males who are whimps. Spoiler! Not expert but think alot to do with culture and values difference bah. Asian typically tend lean toward more tolerance and less violence. Thus may be deemed easy push over by the ang-mor who tend grow up on more aggression, confrontation and violence. Just look at the amount of violence in the western society in general, just among the ordinary people. Its later the younger Asian generation, being influenced by western culture, more tend be more outspoken and confrontational in a way. Spoiler! But think one thing not so good about Asian culture (in the west that is, not say the culture no good, but think have to adapt to the more violent west), may be that because of Asian silence and tendency to mind their own business, the older generation tend keep to themselves and seldom get involve in the community and place affair. Thus end up they sort of alienate themselves in the very place they set up home. Put themselves in the position where when craps happen, they can often be helpless and easy target, cause they don't have enough powerful people of their own in high places to speak up for them and help them. Contrast that to other races, once they move to a new place, many often tend start to get involve in the community and play politics, start to climb to high places within the system. Thus not so easy touch them, touch them also have to think abit is it worth it or not, as they have quite some people in high places to speak up for them. Spoiler! In that aspect, the irony is many Asian from other places (usually none the wiser) often think they can be treated quite fairly in the west like other races, when in fact, from certain perspectives see, think Asian often can be far worse off than any others in the west, cause they tend have less people in high places to represent and speak up for them. Thus perhaps its a reason why they are often seen as easy target and bullied, cause they often got nowhere to cry grievance. That's why think to certain extend, those Asian who chose to settle down in the west, should be more united in showing more support for more of their own kind in high places, if they wish for more fair treatment. The way west work, think its often only when they have more of their own kind representing them in high places, then they got more voice or say in things. Just look at the other non-ang-mor, see how much representation they have in high places can know. And even that they also still get the short end some times, don't say Asian who have far less representation."

There is no one else to blame but themselves. The hong Kongers resist Chinese rule not because they wanted freedom. They never had universal suffrage under the British but they never mentioned this yet they fly the colonial flags. It is this insufferable disdain for the Chinese race they call mainlanders that's propelling their hatred to be under their rule. Otherwise why are they exhibiting all the racist acts like refusing to serve anyone speaking putonghua but welcomes Taiwanese who speak guoyu, chants the slogan of ""fu(k back to mainland"" like a racist trump supporter, beats up defenceless Chinese students but never dare to attack the PLA barracks? And when they get overwhelmed by the HK police,  these terrorists cower and play victims instead or flee leaving their fellow terrorists too be arrested unlike those who emancipated against apartheid ready to spend the rest of their lives incarcerated."

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has assessed the situation and decided to exit the Circuit Breaker when it ends on 1 June 2020 . When we say a Sale ends on 1 June 2020 - the sale is still on on 1 June 2020. By the same logic, the last day of CB should be 1 June 2020. Also my sister is working in essential professional services and is going back to work on June 2 2020, so I think the answer is clear! Hope this helps."
