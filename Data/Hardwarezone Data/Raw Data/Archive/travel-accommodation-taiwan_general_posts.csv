Think i articulated wrongly, i felt real safe right there. Most of the malls or sights do required temperate check and having our hands sanitized.  Typically in crowded area like train station, you can spotted 90% of the people wearing masks. Somehow, i felt Taipei is a lot more cleaner than i was there 6-7 years back twosix wrote: the issue with taiwan is everyone is wearing masks, whereas in singapore, 1 out of 20 wear masks. also, they are unfriend with china, so immediate ban china from entering taiwan when the virus escalated. singapore friendly with china, cannot immediate ban all chinese visitors. Yeah, unfortunately their retail and tourism sector are taking a beating when they curb the number of chinese tourists. I was in Yilan and i can see a lot of Taxi line-up waiting for customers. My Airbnb accommodation are also facing empty rooms for this and next coming month."
