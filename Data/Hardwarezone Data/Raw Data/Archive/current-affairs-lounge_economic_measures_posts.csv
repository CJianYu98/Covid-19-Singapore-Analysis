Thanks to Singaporeans working together to meet the challenges of COVID-19, the situation in Singapore has stabilised. Even as we stay vigilant, we must look ahead and plan for a post-COVID-19 future that will create better lives and opportunities for all Singaporeans. Do you have a view or suggestion on what kind of post-COVID-19 society we want, and ideas on how we can get there? Now is the time to share them with us! The national Budget is a strategic financial plan for Singapore\x92s future. It will address near-term issues and chart the way forward for the longer-term. It also reflects our collective needs and aspirations as a society, and every Singaporean can contribute in shaping this plan. We welcome Singaporeans from all walks of life to join us in this important conversation, and to share views on how we can work together to shape a better Singapore through Budget 2021. Individuals and businesses are welcome to provide suggestions on topics such as adapting our way of life to a post-COVID-19 world, emerging stronger from the pandemic, and building a green and sustainable future for Singapore.

The LHL's administration should demand that MNCs in Singapore that benefits from the ultra low corporate tax rates and other tax incentives to run these skills future courses for Singaporeans and employ them thereafter. Least that these MNCs could do after getting billions of profits from the corporate tax benefits they enjoyed in Singapore over the last decade under the LHL's administration."

Singapore today have REGRESSED after 16 years under LHL's vision and leadership or the lackthereof, if you have be observing carefully and doing meaningful global cross-borders comparison! A lot of Singaporeans who have not lived overseas for a meaningful period as a local can never understand the real issues that Singapore is facing today. Especially those with lesser critical thinking and constantly fed by half-truths unknowingly, of which the VAT is a very good example. In Singapore the 7% GST is applied across everything. In the western countries like Australia, UK etc. a LOT of things are GST/VAT-exempt. These include, if you do not already know - all education, insurance, medical and social services. So you do not need to pay any GST on the story books you buy from Popular or Kinokuniya. No GST on all your educational courses, tuition classes or university fees. No GST on medicines and when you are sick and have to visit the doctors or have a surgery procedure. When you buy insurance for yourself, your family or even your car, there's no need to pay any GST too. This goes for all medical and social welfare services from birth to burial - NO GST/VAT. In Singapore, you have to pay a goods and services tax on even your own coffin and funeral service!!!"

G\x92s policy of high cost of living coupled with low wage growth is also good. It helps the rich get richer, ensure the poor remain poor and an ever increasing sandwich class that is carrying the burden of our budget. With this policy, we can ensure that at least 95% of sinkies get owned by G, and we could have goodnight sleep everyday."

Think that stroke had impacted him more than he expected. You can feel it during his east coast speech. _________ ""Changes to thinking, memory and perception after stroke A stroke can change your thinking and memory, and also how you see, hear and feel the world. This can affect how you feel about yourself, your family and friends. Thinking and memory skills are also known as cognitive skills. Cognitive skills can be affected by your emotional state or tiredness, but a stroke can also cause different cognitive changes, including your: ability to learn new skills ability to plan ability to problem solve attention \x96 being able to concentrate and focus orientation \x96 knowing the day and time short-term memory \x96 knowing what happened recently. Perception is the term that describes how you see, hear and feel the world. After a stroke, your perception can include changes to: feeling contact, pain, heat or cold on the side of your body affected by stroke judging distance performing certain movements even without physical disability (apraxia) recognising shapes and objects, or even your own body seeing or feeling things only on one side \x96 which can cause you to bump into things watching TV or reading \x96 can become difficult vision \x96 some people lose half their vision in each eye (hemianopia)."" Communication after stroke For some people, the stroke affects the part of their brain that helps speaking, reading and communication. Symptoms of these strokes may include: difficulty in finding the right words or understanding what others are saying (aphasia or dysphasia) weakness in the muscles that help speech (dysarthria) dysfunction of the nerve connection between your brain and mouth, making speaking difficult (dyspraxia) reading and writing problems caused by a weak writing hand or problems thinking or seeing."

If u run a biz, and u cannot survive for next year because your industry is not profitable, it is best for u and for society that u just fold and do something else. We don't really care, u are business owner, and risk is part of doing business and u should have taken profits during good times.

Cash flow and profits are very differnet concepts. Simplified assumptions here so dont pick on details. Lets say your revenue 100 and your costs are 80 during normal years. So each year you earn 20. When covid strikes, your revenue falls off a clift, but you are facing 80 of costs. Do you think businesses would keep 4 years worth of profits around just as cash flow?  And mind you 20% margin is a healthy company. So should the business take up a loan of say 80 to tide things through?  Even in normal times, it takes 4 years to earn back that loan amount. An owner  might not take that loan. Might as well close the business. And so jobs are lost. How long can the employee last on that 20k if jobs are out of the economy? If we keep jobs, the employee  still got salary to pay for whatever they want.

We don't really care, u are business owner, and risk is part of doing business and u should have taken profits during good times. We care abt the employee who has kids and 55yo tan who has mother with cancer. So give the money from budget surpluses direct to the citizens, 20k 40k and give businesses interest free loans. Let the industries that are profitable grow and business by nature will adjust to where profit is. This is a better way imo. But of course now is too late already la money all spent already.

Another lie to cover another lie. WP please check!!!! I beginning to think so too. WP needs to have access to the data to double confirm. Reminded moi of this story; got a part abt swim with the tide: During a robbery in Guangzhou, China, the bank robber shouted to everyone in the bank: \x93Don\x92t move. The money belongs to the State. Your life belongs to you.\x94 Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. This is called \x93Mind Changing Concept\x94 Changing the conventional way of thinking. When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her: \x93Please be civilized! This is a robbery and not a rape!\x94 This is called \x93Being Professional\x94 Focus only on what you are trained to do! When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA-trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school): \x93Big brother, let\x92s count how much we got.\x94 The older robber rebutted and said: \x93You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!\x94 This is called \x93Experience.\x94 Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications! After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: \x93Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank\x94. This is called \x93Swim with the tide.\x94 Converting an unfavourable situation to your advantage! The supervisor says: \x93It will be good if there is a robbery every month.\x94 This is called \x93Killing Boredom.\x94 Personal Happiness is more important than your job. The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. The robbers were very angry and complained: \x93We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!\x94 This is called \x93Knowledge\x93 https://www.bhavinionline.com/2013/1...-bank-robbery/"

'Way beyond my budget': Malaysians entering Singapore for work under PCA scramble to find rental opt,24-08-2020 10:09 PM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/current-affairs-lounge-17/way-beyond-my-budget-malaysians-entering-singapore-work-under-pca-scramble-find-rental-opt-6360705.html,129236886,21-08-2020  05:34 PM,"By                 Amir Yusof             @AmirYusofCNA 7-9 minutes SINGAPORE: Ms Norashikin Rahman is worried she may not have a shelter over her head next month. The  29-year-old Malaysian, who lives in Johor Bahru, is scheduled to enter  Singapore via the Periodic Commutive Arrangement (PCA) scheme on Sep 1.  The scheme allows her to resume work for her company, a computer chip  manufacturing firm based in the north-eastern part of Singapore. As part of the PCA, she will serve a seven day stay-home notice (SHN)  upon arrival, at a facility paid for by her company, and undertake a  COVID-19 swab test. After she finishes her SHN and tests negative for COVID-19, Ms Norashikin would need to move to a place to stay. The  mother of two young children has been trying for weeks to secure a  suitable room that is close to her work place and within her budget, but  to no success. \x93My budget is only S$300, but for rooms in Yishun, the rent I have been quoted for are at least S$650. \x93The prices quoted are way beyond my budget. I won\x92t have enough  money for my family or my living expenses in Singapore,\x94 she said when  interviewed by CNA. Ms  Norashikin is one of many Malaysians who are heading to Singapore to  resume work under the ambit of the PCA, but are struggling to find  suitable homes on short notice, at the right price and with short rental  leases. Some of them are using social media groups to find rental  options and connect with other Malaysians looking to rent rooms at  similar locations. Vehicles and people can be seen crossing the Woodlands causeway linking  Malaysia and Singapore on Aug 17, 2020. For instance, the Facebook group Bilik Sewa Singapore  (Malaysian), or rooms for rent in Singapore for Malaysians, has been  abuzz with many posts in recent weeks, with people looking for roommates  and landlords posting rental opportunities. Although there are  options available, Ms Norashikin said many landlords are looking for  tenants who are willing to commit for between six months to a year. She  is not willing to do this as she plans to return home after three  months. Subsequently, she is hoping that the two governments can find a  solution to resume daily commuting across the border. \x93For the  long term, I don\x92t think I want to continue renting here. It\x92s important  for me to be close to my child and family and see them every day,\x94 she  said. Another  Malaysian who will also be entering Singapore to work via PCA in  September is Mr Fakhrul Adlee, who works in the western part of  Singapore. He told CNA that he has been looking for suitable  rental options on the Bilik Sewa Singapore Facebook group for a couple  of weeks but has found it \x93challenging\x94. He noted that there were limited options for rooms in the area he wants to stay in \x96 near Jurong East or Toh Guan. \x93Also,  the rent quoted is quite high. My budget is S$350, slightly flexible,  but so far nothing falls into the range I can afford,\x94 he said. Mr Fakhrul added that many of the options available were only for female tenants, and virtually none for males. According  to Mr Nicholas Mak, ERA Realty's research and consultancy head,  Malaysian workers who are looking for rental units are typically \x93more  budget conscious\x94. He also said that a total of six tenants would  usually share an entire HDB unit to lower costs. Moreover, there  has been an increase in demand for HDB rental units recently, especially  near industrial estates in Jurong, Tuas, Woodlands, Yishun and Kaki  Bukit, he said. \x93Malaysians who are coming here to work is a big  factor in driving up demand for these units. They are far from the city  centre and are popular among Malaysian workers, who prefer to live in a  place easily accessible to their places of work,\x94 added Mr Mak. He said that this has led to some landlords in these areas raising the prices. \x93For  example, the rent for a 4-room HDB unit in Joo Koon would typically  cost around S$2,300 but recently, the prices have spiked to around  S$2,700. This price is what you usually see for flats closer to the  city.\x94 Ms Christine Sun, head of research and consultancy at  OrangeTee & Tie, said that the increase in HDB rental demand can be  linked to Malaysians working in Singapore. \x93Anecdotally, we have  observed strong rental demand from Malaysians working in Singapore since  the start of the circuit breaker period. \x93Even now, with some of  the border lockdowns being eased recently, many are still reluctant to  travel back as they need to serve their stay-home-notice and have  continued to rent a unit in Singapore,\x94 she added. According to  SRX flash estimates released on Aug 12, the prices for the HDB rental  market in July increased by 1.4 per cent from June. Ms Sun said this was possibly due to landlords raising their rent after observing a sudden surge in demand. Malaysian  worker Imran Malik told CNA that he is due to enter Singapore via PCA  in two weeks but he is \x93feeling anxious\x94 because he believes the higher  demand has priced him out of the market. \x93It\x92s obvious, many of  the landlords have noticed an increase in demand for their units so they  upped their asking price. Some have even refused to reply to my queries  to negotiate price,\x94 he said. \x93And to share a room, they are  charging around S$700. It\x92s not worth it because some of them have no  air-con even,\x94 added Mr Imran. The  issue of Malaysian workers having difficulties finding temporary  shelter in Singapore first surfaced in March, after the Malaysia  government imposed the Movement Control Order to curb the spread of  COVID-19. Under the order, all Malaysians were barred from  travelling abroad, including around 300,000 Malaysians who travel across  the Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link every day for work. It  was then reported that some Malaysian workers who had crossed over to  Singapore before the travel restrictions kicked in were unable to find  accommodation. Subsequently, Singapore\x92s Ministry of Manpower  (MOM) said it found 14 Malaysian workers who were sleeping rough at  Kranji MRT station and took them to a ""temporary relief centre"" in  Jurong East. Ms Sun of OrangTee & Tie said if the landlords  and tenants can find an equilibrium now, it may help to prop up  Singapore's property market going forward. \x93We have quite a number  of Malaysians working in Singapore. Therefore, the PCA and some  lockdown restrictions that are still currently in place may deter  Malaysians from going back. This will continue to prop up the rental  market in Singapore,\x94 she said. However, she noted that the long  term future of these workers might not be secure given how COVID-19 has  impacted the Singapore economy. \x93There will also be other  considerations such as whether the economic uncertainties will impact  the job security and employment of Malaysian workers in Singapore,\x94 Ms  Sun noted."

The  29-year-old Malaysian, who lives in Johor Bahru, is scheduled to enter  Singapore via the Periodic Commutive Arrangement (PCA) scheme on Sep 1.  The scheme allows her to resume work for her company, a computer chip  manufacturing firm based in the north-eastern part of Singapore. As part of the PCA, she will serve a seven day stay-home notice (SHN)  upon arrival, at a facility paid for by her company, and undertake a  COVID-19 swab test. After she finishes her SHN and tests negative for COVID-19, Ms Norashikin would need to move to a place to stay. The  mother of two young children has been trying for weeks to secure a  suitable room that is close to her work place and within her budget, but  to no success. \x93My budget is only S$300, but for rooms in Yishun, the rent I have been quoted for are at least S$650. \x93The prices quoted are way beyond my budget. I won\x92t have enough  money for my family or my living expenses in Singapore,\x94 she said when  interviewed by CNA. Ms  Norashikin is one of many Malaysians who are heading to Singapore to  resume work under the ambit of the PCA, but are struggling to find  suitable homes on short notice, at the right price and with short rental  leases. Some of them are using social media groups to find rental  options and connect with other Malaysians looking to rent rooms at  similar locations. Vehicles and people can be seen crossing the Woodlands causeway linking  Malaysia and Singapore on Aug 17, 2020. For instance, the Facebook group Bilik Sewa Singapore  (Malaysian), or rooms for rent in Singapore for Malaysians, has been  abuzz with many posts in recent weeks, with people looking for roommates  and landlords posting rental opportunities. Although there are  options available, Ms Norashikin said many landlords are looking for  tenants who are willing to commit for between six months to a year. She  is not willing to do this as she plans to return home after three  months. Subsequently, she is hoping that the two governments can find a  solution to resume daily commuting across the border. \x93For the  long term, I don\x92t think I want to continue renting here. It\x92s important  for me to be close to my child and family and see them every day,\x94 she  said. Another  Malaysian who will also be entering Singapore to work via PCA in  September is Mr Fakhrul Adlee, who works in the western part of  Singapore. He told CNA that he has been looking for suitable  rental options on the Bilik Sewa Singapore Facebook group for a couple  of weeks but has found it \x93challenging\x94. He noted that there were limited options for rooms in the area he wants to stay in \x96 near Jurong East or Toh Guan. \x93Also,  the rent quoted is quite high. My budget is S$350, slightly flexible,  but so far nothing falls into the range I can afford,\x94 he said. Mr Fakhrul added that many of the options available were only for female tenants, and virtually none for males. According  to Mr Nicholas Mak, ERA Realty's research and consultancy head,  Malaysian workers who are looking for rental units are typically \x93more  budget conscious\x94. He also said that a total of six tenants would  usually share an entire HDB unit to lower costs. Moreover, there  has been an increase in demand for HDB rental units recently, especially  near industrial estates in Jurong, Tuas, Woodlands, Yishun and Kaki  Bukit, he said. \x93Malaysians who are coming here to work is a big  factor in driving up demand for these units. They are far from the city  centre and are popular among Malaysian workers, who prefer to live in a  place easily accessible to their places of work,\x94 added Mr Mak. He said that this has led to some landlords in these areas raising the prices. \x93For  example, the rent for a 4-room HDB unit in Joo Koon would typically  cost around S$2,300 but recently, the prices have spiked to around  S$2,700. This price is what you usually see for flats closer to the  city.\x94 Ms Christine Sun, head of research and consultancy at  OrangeTee & Tie, said that the increase in HDB rental demand can be  linked to Malaysians working in Singapore. \x93Anecdotally, we have  observed strong rental demand from Malaysians working in Singapore since  the start of the circuit breaker period. \x93Even now, with some of  the border lockdowns being eased recently, many are still reluctant to  travel back as they need to serve their stay-home-notice and have  continued to rent a unit in Singapore,\x94 she added. According to  SRX flash estimates released on Aug 12, the prices for the HDB rental  market in July increased by 1.4 per cent from June. Ms Sun said this was possibly due to landlords raising their rent after observing a sudden surge in demand. Malaysian  worker Imran Malik told CNA that he is due to enter Singapore via PCA  in two weeks but he is \x93feeling anxious\x94 because he believes the higher  demand has priced him out of the market. \x93It\x92s obvious, many of  the landlords have noticed an increase in demand for their units so they  upped their asking price. Some have even refused to reply to my queries  to negotiate price,\x94 he said. \x93And to share a room, they are  charging around S$700. It\x92s not worth it because some of them have no  air-con even,\x94 added Mr Imran. The  issue of Malaysian workers having difficulties finding temporary  shelter in Singapore first surfaced in March, after the Malaysia  government imposed the Movement Control Order to curb the spread of  COVID-19. Under the order, all Malaysians were barred from  travelling abroad, including around 300,000 Malaysians who travel across  the Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link every day for work. It  was then reported that some Malaysian workers who had crossed over to  Singapore before the travel restrictions kicked in were unable to find  accommodation. Subsequently, Singapore\x92s Ministry of Manpower  (MOM) said it found 14 Malaysian workers who were sleeping rough at  Kranji MRT station and took them to a ""temporary relief centre"" in  Jurong East. Ms Sun of OrangTee & Tie said if the landlords  and tenants can find an equilibrium now, it may help to prop up  Singapore's property market going forward. \x93We have quite a number  of Malaysians working in Singapore. Therefore, the PCA and some  lockdown restrictions that are still currently in place may deter  Malaysians from going back. This will continue to prop up the rental  market in Singapore,\x94 she said. However, she noted that the long  term future of these workers might not be secure given how COVID-19 has  impacted the Singapore economy. \x93There will also be other  considerations such as whether the economic uncertainties will impact  the job security and employment of Malaysian workers in Singapore,\x94 Ms  Sun noted. want to earn 3x that is the price to paid, if not , can jolly well f back home"

Due to the crisis situation, they are expecting sinkie to play them out again even though the ground sentiments are pro-OPP. And SK and EC will be hard to topple due to the well known ministers there. So, the deployment is just a training exercise for both WP teams. Coupled with the Khan incident, PS should be thinking GG after his press conference for Ms Khan. PS made a lot of huge gamble for this battle.

Assuming that it is a set up for the OPP to make a fool of themselves, there is no point for PS to send his senior players down to be shot. Not sure whether Jamus took up the challenge or he was arrowed to do it. Jamus is just a accidental hero in the turn of event. Dun think PS planned for it to happen.

I think EC was always hard because of the Cecas. Bloody lot of them stay there. 8000 votes is not a lot. Good gerrymandering could have solved this. For alj an increase of 13k registered voters, but I guess previous voters not impressed with Victor and Shamsul. In EC the increase in new voters must have helped. If 800 plus voters in each of the 5 switched, HSK bye bye. But I disagree, I think HSK was a good choice and prevented the 4000 switch over.

If 4000 voters flipped, HSK gg liao. So a win by 8000 votes in 5 wards, about say 1600 on average for each. But the actual figures will show the weaker wards. I think EC was always hard because of the Cecas. Bloody lot of them stay there. 8000 votes is not a lot. Good gerrymandering could have solved this. For alj an increase of 13k registered voters, but I guess previous voters not impressed with Victor and Shamsul. In EC the increase in new voters must have helped. If 800 plus voters in each of the 5 switched, HSK bye bye. But I disagree, I think HSK was a good choice and prevented the 4000 switch over.

I think Low wanted a well deserved break. 29 years is no joke, some who voted were not born when he won in Hougang or contested Brickworks in 1988. Actually he would have won in 1988 if it was SMC, then last minute GRC came in. Hougang simply put, 2 key criteria, I know because I go there - the main section of this ward - you must either speak Teochew or Hokkien. Dennis Tan could speak both although he not Teochew. I gather PAP's Lee wasn't so proficient in Teochew. Despite the fact he was walking the ground about 3 years ago. I met him about 3x. Always told him, I'll vote for him (hahaha, fat hope I stay in Marymount) There is also some remnants of the Catholic community here. Not gonna bring religion in here, but generally and historically lots of Catholics stayed here - got 3 churches nearby, Catholic homes, Youth Centre and other stuff. So a need to engage them, take part in their activities too. Also got a mosque, several other churches and temples here, Mr Low was very wise to engage with all these groups, religious and cultural events. 7 month, he made sure to attend as many events as possible or sent a rep. Funerals don't say, every effort was made without the fanfare of Victor Lye, to attend and send condolences. That loyalty was built and handed to Peh who carried on. That was a lot of work and energy to build this foundation.  I'm sure he did the same at Aljuneid. Then being party head, he had to go bring in people like Sylvia, Gerald and Pritan and convince them. Not easy. Guide them and ensure no slip ups. Of course there were mistakes, Yaw and GMS, who was the other guy who didn't get selected (John Tan?) Plus the old warhorses, also needed to be persuaded to retire. Not easy, look at WP in 1991 to today, a huge shift. Growth was stunted in the beginning too, a lot of hurdles had to clear. So maybe he kept people guessing, but I was panned for an earlier thread from my sources that confirmed he and CSM were retiring together with PEH. The only thing that was wrong in that thread was that Sylvia might be shifted out. That I believe was the surprise he said he had for EC. Send her to head the EC team, but I think last minute they decided to play safe and remain at Aljuneid. There was never any hint from my source that Low would contest elsewhere.

Don't think just because Heng fumbled once, he's weak. That can be turned into a trump card. Show he's human and if he does 2 very well, shows he truly cares. 4. For all his supposed faults, few have said he's been a bad Finance Minister. He's also improved his standing in Tampines, don't forget. The same can be done in EC. 5. A PM's ward is a very potent carrot. PM's GRC will be ahead of the queue. 6. You guys discount gerrymandering. Remember Najib in 1999, he won by 241 votes. Next election, by tens of thousands. Sitoh scraped home by 114 votes in 2011, in 2015 by 7000 (I think). If Heng re-contests EC in 2025, it'll be huge mistake for the WP to send their A or B team there. The reverse of how they succeeded this will occur. This election they talk wipeout, if they go after Heng in 2025, the PAP will defend Heng to the max. A wipeout of the PM, a nice guy. They guys who brought the economy back, they guy who gave you everything. Instead they should focus on MP or Jln Besar. Unless the PAP carves out an SMC from EC, to deflect the WP charge. That SMC can contest strongly. EC must be handled very delicately. Only if Heng truly fumbles as FM and PM. Few care like us, how he talks to world leaders etc. They care for themselves."

Who succeeds him depends on which ministries they get, but CCS is definitely in the driving seat, because he answers many of the big questions non-financial.

Actually he would have won in 1988 if it was SMC, then last minute GRC came in. Hougang simply put, 2 key criteria, I know because I go there - the main section of this ward - you must either speak Teochew or Hokkien. Dennis Tan could speak both although he not Teochew. I gather PAP's Lee wasn't so proficient in Teochew. Despite the fact he was walking the ground about 3 years ago. I met him about 3x. Always told him, I'll vote for him (hahaha, fat hope I stay in Marymount) There is also some remnants of the Catholic community here. Not gonna bring religion in here, but generally and historically lots of Catholics stayed here - got 3 churches nearby, Catholic homes, Youth Centre and other stuff. So a need to engage them, take part in their activities too. Also got a mosque, several other churches and temples here, Mr Low was very wise to engage with all these groups, religious and cultural events. 7 month, he made sure to attend as many events as possible or sent a rep. Funerals don't say, every effort was made without the fanfare of Victor Lye, to attend and send condolences. That loyalty was built and handed to Peh who carried on. That was a lot of work and energy to build this foundation.  I'm sure he did the same at Aljuneid. Then being party head, he had to go bring in people like Sylvia, Gerald and Pritan and convince them. Not easy. Guide them and ensure no slip ups. Of course there were mistakes, Yaw and GMS, who was the other guy who didn't get selected (John Tan?) Plus the old warhorses, also needed to be persuaded to retire. Not easy, look at WP in 1991 to today, a huge shift. Growth was stunted in the beginning too, a lot of hurdles had to clear. So maybe he kept people guessing, but I was panned for an earlier thread from my sources that confirmed he and CSM were retiring together with PEH. The only thing that was wrong in that thread was that Sylvia might be shifted out. That I believe was the surprise he said he had for EC. Send her to head the EC team, but I think last minute they decided to play safe and remain at Aljuneid. There was never any hint from my source that Low would contest elsewhere. He needed a break especially after that hospitalisation. Hello mr wp.... let\x92s just say u got only 25% correct. Either u guessing or Ur source beh zhun"

That was a good kick at the heart of who we should be as Singapore. Instead of fighting against that impulse, he states what he sees as fact instead of inspiring us to see beyond that. That is not leadership , that is resignation. We have a multi-racial society today because we have guarded against the worst of racism - this is giving in. As we have seen in other countries, the dangers of leaders who fail to inspire and unite a nation\u2019s people - especially during a crisis - are clear. Quote: My critique of Heng\u2019s leadership does not mean that he has been on the whole incompetent. From what I see, he was an excellent civil servant and was a decent politician. We should be thankful for his tireless commitment and service to Singapore. This is only right. But my point is that there are also other more compelling candidates who would make an equally viable or even stronger Prime Minister to lead and unite us during and after this crisis."

These have been formulated in consultation with all relevant Government agencies; and informed by MPs, who have worked with us on foreign worker issues. One example is that operators must develop quarantine plans, in the event of an infectious disease outbreak, and provide sufficient sick bay facilities, based on guidelines set by the Ministry of Health. Another is to require operators to establish Emergency Response Plans in consultation with SCDF and the Police to deal with fires or other potential public order incidents. To cater to residents\x92 social and recreational needs, we will require licensed dorms to have indoor and outdoor recreation areas; amenities like ATM machines, minimarts and mail collection points; as well as regular recreational events during Sundays and public holidays. These provide convenient options for workers to socialise. It also means that they do not have to travel far to run simple errands, which eats into their rest hours."

The fact that other people could see the risk then just rubbishes whatever MIW is claiming about not having the benefit of hindsight.

From time to time, a case, if it goes under the radar and someone with the virus is actively participating in social events - that person can spread. I think that is very clear. In fact, that is what has happened in this case. That is why we are taking additional precautions, as I said, on social distancing - cancelling or postponing some events, especially if it involves more senior citizens because they are more vulnerable. These measures need to be taken. The point I am trying to make is that this is going to be with us for one year. From time to time, cases will come in; and from time to time, a cluster will pop up. It is important to identify early, go into quarantine, contact trace. We can damp it down. But even when we damp down this cluster, keep a lookout for the next. We have to be in this position for quite some time. That is the point I am making.'

The NIRC is currently the largest contributor to the government\u2019s annual budget. This suggestion is intellectually flawed and irresponsible - it does not consider fiscal implications on the future. The NIRC has 2 components : up to 50 per cent of the Net Investment Returns (NIR) on the net assets invested by GIC, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Temasek Holdings; and up to 50 per cent of the Net Investment Income (NII) derived from past reserves from the remaining assets, according to the Ministry of Finance\u2019s website. The annual NIRC is published in the Government Budget. By increasing the rate of contributions from 50 to 75% from our net assets invested, the SDP is taking away 25% of investable funds - funds that are crucial in compounding the principal of our investments and ensuring that our NIRC grows at a steady pace each year. By doing this, the government\u2019s annual NIRC contributions will grow at a much slower pace than before. They\u2019re not touching the principal - but every investor will tell you that the real power in investing does not lie in the principal, but in the power of compound interest. By doing this, SDP is being intellectually dishonest and lazy in telling voters how they\u2019d fund their proposals. SDP has proven time and time and again that it is a profligate party with a simple motto of \u201craising taxes, raiding reserves\u201d, without proper justification of how it will finance its policies responsibly.

Ignoring MAS reserve (since it is foreign reserve and apart from returns, are dependent on our monetary pokic stance), GIC and Temasek waa estimated by SWF to have USD740bn in combined. Let's assume they achieve returns of 5% per annum, after 75% direct to NIRC, left with 1.25% per annum. That's lower than gdp growth which is upward of 3% before trade war and covid set in. However, we have proceed from land sales (technically lease) which average sgd $17bn per annum trom 2013 to 2019, abit over usd12bn or 1.6%. This brings growth of reserve close to 3% per annum. 75% might be a stretch but the idea is there. The numbers can be refined but it is necessary to discuss a trade off in investing in our society vs saving for the future.

When questioned on how the SDP will fund their programs, Tambyah suggested increasing the rate of the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) from 50% to 75%. The NIRC is currently the largest contributor to the government\u2019s annual budget. This suggestion is intellectually flawed and irresponsible - it does not consider fiscal implications on the future. The NIRC has 2 components : up to 50 per cent of the Net Investment Returns (NIR) on the net assets invested by GIC, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Temasek Holdings; and up to 50 per cent of the Net Investment Income (NII) derived from past reserves from the remaining assets, according to the Ministry of Finance\u2019s website. The annual NIRC is published in the Government Budget. By increasing the rate of contributions from 50 to 75% from our net assets invested, the SDP is taking away 25% of investable funds - funds that are crucial in compounding the principal of our investments and ensuring that our NIRC grows at a steady pace each year. By doing this, the government\u2019s annual NIRC contributions will grow at a much slower pace than before. They\u2019re not touching the principal - but every investor will tell you that the real power in investing does not lie in the principal, but in the power of compound interest. By doing this, SDP is being intellectually dishonest and lazy in telling voters how they\u2019d fund their proposals. SDP has proven time and time and again that it is a profligate party with a simple motto of \u201craising taxes, raiding reserves\u201d, without proper justification of how it will finance its policies responsibly. A vote for the SDP is not just a vote for dangerous fiscal policy, but also a vote for a dangerous future.

By themselves, they are as good as any other person in Singapore except perhaps for the ability to memorize a TYS and superb exam taking skills. The allocation of NIRC is irrelevant.

For that matter, I don\x92t agree with many of SDP\x92s social policies as well but that is not the focus of this election.

I was recently retrenched by my company and the official reason given was restructuring due to market uncertainty. Was on no pay leave after CB period for one month and saw this coming but of course when the news finally came, it is still a shock to me. I am currently in my 40s and this is the worst age to lose a job, too old to re-hire and train. And even if I do find a new job, my salary will be substantially lower. This Covid19 economic downturn will probably stretch through end of 2020 or early 2021. So I am not optimistic about the job market at all. Not only do we Singaporeans have to worry about our rice bowls but we have to fight with the army of foreigners who are working in Singapore or coming to find jobs in near future. As far back as 10 years ago or longer, I remember this was already a hotly debated topic among Singaporeans. PAP opened the floodgates wide open to attract practically every other country in the name of GDP growth. Many of us, including myself, knew that this is a time bomb waiting to blow. If the economy is doing well everyone gets paid and happy, but it is in times of crisis like now, that the impact of the open door policy will hurt us Singaporeans the most. And just FYI I do not support whites. Before we already had Malaysians, Indonesians, Indians, Thais, Filipinos and Chinese nationals coming to our tiny island to work, earning our high SGD. Today I can see more people from Taiwan, Burma, Vietnam and Eastern Europe working in Singapore. Even my current neighbor are Burmese tenants working as Draftsman (I can see their PC when I pass by their unit). And they are now not just working in low level unskilled jobs like construction or service F&B. Many are creeping into mid to high level positions that were once mostly done by locals. And worse of all, they don't mind getting paid lower just to work here. In fact I was having a conversation with this Vietnamese girl and she told me that she is paid lower than locals, but she don't mind it one bit cos it's still more than what she earns back home. She claims she is a graduate. When I saw that message I really very DL! I can only imagine how many more Singaporeans are displaced from their jobs due to this unfair competition from foreigners. We all know most of them come here to send money back so it's an advantage for them, or they will apply for PR or use SG as a platform to seek employment in other countries for better pay. Singapore companies only care about their bottom line so naturally when the time comes we are the first target. I seriously wonder if the foreign worker quota is actually enforced by MOM. I do not have the data to support but at this rate, our local unemployment rate will be much higher with most of the jobs going to foreigners, especially those in their middle age. As much as I hate Trump, he did do one thing right and that is to restrict work visas during this time to save jobs for Americans. We are now undergoing our own election but I don't hear anything from our politicians that can help protect jobs for Singaporeans. I have been actively sending out resumes and making calls to companies for the last three weeks and only gone for one interview. I am now seriously considering signing up to be food delivery to tide things through for now, or maybe even as a long term option until such I manage to find something permanent.

To add a relative of mine who is in IT was also recently retrenched from his job in Australia. Sadly its a globalised world today. Many jobs dont need a fixed address. You would be surprised at the opportunities available overseas even if you say you dont have the qualifications. There are many people around the world who are happy to stay and work where they born, however thats not the way of the world these days and they too are struggling.

Not only do we Singaporeans have to worry about our rice bowls but we have to fight with the army of foreigners who are working in Singapore or coming to find jobs in near future. As far back as 10 years ago or longer, I remember this was already a hotly debated topic among Singaporeans.

Before we already had Malaysians, Indonesians, Indians, Thais, Filipinos and Chinese nationals coming to our tiny island to work, earning our high SGD. Today I can see more people from Taiwan, Burma, Vietnam and Eastern Europe working in Singapore. Even my current neighbor are Burmese tenants working as Draftsman (I can see their PC when I pass by their unit). And they are now not just working in low level unskilled jobs like construction or service F&B. Many are creeping into mid to high level positions that were once mostly done by locals. And worse of all, they don't mind getting paid lower just to work here. In fact I was having a conversation with this Vietnamese girl and she told me that she is paid lower than locals, but she don't mind it one bit cos it's still more than what she earns back home. She claims she is a graduate. When I saw that message I really very DL! I can only imagine how many more Singaporeans are displaced from their jobs due to this unfair competition from foreigners. We all know most of them come here to send money back so it's an advantage for them, or they will apply for PR or use SG as a platform to seek employment in other countries for better pay. Singapore companies only care about their bottom line so naturally when the time comes we are the first target. I seriously wonder if the foreign worker quota is actually enforced by MOM. I do not have the data to support but at this rate, our local unemployment rate will be much higher with most of the jobs going to foreigners, especially those in their middle age. As much as I hate Trump, he did do one thing right and that is to restrict work visas during this time to save jobs for Americans. We are now undergoing our own election but I don't hear anything from our politicians that can help protect jobs for Singaporeans. I have been actively sending out resumes and making calls to companies for the last three weeks and only gone for one interview. I am now seriously considering signing up to be food delivery to tide things through for now, or maybe even as a long term option until such I manage to find something permanent. Again sorry for the long rant, please stay safe! I add another one to it. In my days getting into a local uni required top 5% in my poly cohort. So guess how many can be in the top 5%. The more dulan case is, one of the Burmese when come to interview, u ask him whatever vwr shiit, he also said know abit. But when come to really needed it. He said he doesnt know. This joker after working afew yrs went to enroll NTU for master. Knn he was accepted easily. Pui last time local Poly cant even get to local uni n need to take up distance learning. Then when this joker got his master, DLLM, he apply for PR n got it. Cb resign liao cos he ask for increment + promotion Lucki my boss dun give him. Cb a LOCAL master + a PR.

Not only within the job market in Singapore but globally.  Are you willing to work overseas? One point you wrote set my mind thinking once again, how in hell some restaurants hire so may foreigners? If you go to any DTF outlet, you will see lots and lots of atbs and jhb outside.  Inside where the kitchens are (hot kitchen and Dim Sum cold kitchen) there will be jhks and atgorgor and some atbs. Hardly any Singaporeans! Where is the quota??? The Govt here spent how long forcing Singaporeans down a path where they should not consider such jobs. You seen the cost of living , if you have a job , you should be able to live relatively OK. However the Govt has lost a handle on the cost of living.

I was recently retrenched by my company and the official reason given was restructuring due to market uncertainty. Was on no pay leave after CB period for one month and saw this coming but of course when the news finally came, it is still a shock to me. I am currently in my 40s and this is the worst age to lose a job, too old to re-hire and train. And even if I do find a new job, my salary will be substantially lower. This Covid19 economic downturn will probably stretch through end of 2020 or early 2021. So I am not optimistic about the job market at all. Not only do we Singaporeans have to worry about our rice bowls but we have to fight with the army of foreigners who are working in Singapore or coming to find jobs in near future. As far back as 10 years ago or longer, I remember this was already a hotly debated topic among Singaporeans. PAP opened the floodgates wide open to attract practically every other country in the name of GDP growth. Many of us, including myself, knew that this is a time bomb waiting to blow. If the economy is doing well everyone gets paid and happy, but it is in times of crisis like now, that the impact of the open door policy will hurt us Singaporeans the most. Before we already had Malaysians, Indonesians, Indians, Thais, Filipinos and Chinese nationals coming to our tiny island to work, earning our high SGD. Today I can see more people from Taiwan, Burma, Vietnam and Eastern Europe working in Singapore. Even my current neighbor are Burmese tenants working as Draftsman (I can see their PC when I pass by their unit). And they are now not just working in low level unskilled jobs like construction or service F&B. Many are creeping into mid to high level positions that were once mostly done by locals. And worse of all, they don't mind getting paid lower just to work here. In fact I was having a conversation with this Vietnamese girl and she told me that she is paid lower than locals, but she don't mind it one bit cos it's still more than what she earns back home. She claims she is a graduate. When I saw that message I really very DL! I can only imagine how many more Singaporeans are displaced from their jobs due to this unfair competition from foreigners. We all know most of them come here to send money back so it's an advantage for them, or they will apply for PR or use SG as a platform to seek employment in other countries for better pay. Singapore companies only care about their bottom line so naturally when the time comes we are the first target. I seriously wonder if the foreign worker quota is actually enforced by MOM. I do not have the data to support but at this rate, our local unemployment rate will be much higher with most of the jobs going to foreigners, especially those in their middle age. As much as I hate Trump, he did do one thing right and that is to restrict work visas during this time to save jobs for Americans. We are now undergoing our own election but I don't hear anything from our politicians that can help protect jobs for Singaporeans. I have been actively sending out resumes and making calls to companies for the last three weeks and only gone for one interview. I am now seriously considering signing up to be food delivery to tide things through for now, or maybe even as a long term option until such I manage to find something permanent.

I was recently retrenched by my company and the official reason given was restructuring due to market uncertainty. Was on no pay leave after CB period for one month and saw this coming but of course when the news finally came, it is still a shock to me. I am currently in my 40s and this is the worst age to lose a job, too old to re-hire and train. And even if I do find a new job, my salary will be substantially lower. This Covid19 economic downturn will probably stretch through end of 2020 or early 2021. So I am not optimistic about the job market at all. Not only do we Singaporeans have to worry about our rice bowls but we have to fight with the army of foreigners who are working in Singapore or coming to find jobs in near future. As far back as 10 years ago or longer, I remember this was already a hotly debated topic among Singaporeans. PAP opened the floodgates wide open to attract practically every other country in the name of GDP growth. Many of us, including myself, knew that this is a time bomb waiting to blow. If the economy is doing well everyone gets paid and happy, but it is in times of crisis like now, that the impact of the open door policy will hurt us Singaporeans the most. Before we already had Malaysians, Indonesians, Indians, Thais, Filipinos and Chinese nationals coming to our tiny island to work, earning our high SGD. Today I can see more people from Taiwan, Burma, Vietnam and Eastern Europe working in Singapore. Even my current neighbor are Burmese tenants working as Draftsman (I can see their PC when I pass by their unit). And they are now not just working in low level unskilled jobs like construction or service F&B. Many are creeping into mid to high level positions that were once mostly done by locals. And worse of all, they don't mind getting paid lower just to work here. In fact I was having a conversation with this Vietnamese girl and she told me that she is paid lower than locals, but she don't mind it one bit cos it's still more than what she earns back home. She claims she is a graduate. When I saw that message I really very DL! I can only imagine how many more Singaporeans are displaced from their jobs due to this unfair competition from foreigners. We all know most of them come here to send money back so it's an advantage for them, or they will apply for PR or use SG as a platform to seek employment in other countries for better pay. Singapore companies only care about their bottom line so naturally when the time comes we are the first target. I seriously wonder if the foreign worker quota is actually enforced by MOM. I do not have the data to support but at this rate, our local unemployment rate will be much higher with most of the jobs going to foreigners, especially those in their middle age. As much as I hate Trump, he did do one thing right and that is to restrict work visas during this time to save jobs for Americans. We are now undergoing our own election but I don't hear anything from our politicians that can help protect jobs for Singaporeans. I have been actively sending out resumes and making calls to companies for the last three weeks and only gone for one interview. I am now seriously considering signing up to be food delivery to tide things through for now, or maybe even as a long term option until such I manage to find something permanent. Again sorry for the long rant, please stay safe! Great points made TS. Wishing u the best in the next chapter of your life."

I was recently retrenched by my company and the official reason given was restructuring due to market uncertainty. Was on no pay leave after CB period for one month and saw this coming but of course when the news finally came, it is still a shock to me. I am currently in my 40s and this is the worst age to lose a job, too old to re-hire and train. And even if I do find a new job, my salary will be substantially lower. This Covid19 economic downturn will probably stretch through end of 2020 or early 2021. So I am not optimistic about the job market at all. Not only do we Singaporeans have to worry about our rice bowls but we have to fight with the army of foreigners who are working in Singapore or coming to find jobs in near future. As far back as 10 years ago or longer, I remember this was already a hotly debated topic among Singaporeans. PAP opened the floodgates wide open to attract practically every other country in the name of GDP growth. Many of us, including myself, knew that this is a time bomb waiting to blow. If the economy is doing well everyone gets paid and happy, but it is in times of crisis like now, that the impact of the open door policy will hurt us Singaporeans the most. Before we already had Malaysians, Indonesians, Indians, Thais, Filipinos and Chinese nationals coming to our tiny island to work, earning our high SGD. Today I can see more people from Taiwan, Burma, Vietnam and Eastern Europe working in Singapore. Even my current neighbor are Burmese tenants working as Draftsman (I can see their PC when I pass by their unit). And they are now not just working in low level unskilled jobs like construction or service F&B. Many are creeping into mid to high level positions that were once mostly done by locals. And worse of all, they don't mind getting paid lower just to work here. In fact I was having a conversation with this Vietnamese girl and she told me that she is paid lower than locals, but she don't mind it one bit cos it's still more than what she earns back home. She claims she is a graduate. When I saw that message I really very DL! I can only imagine how many more Singaporeans are displaced from their jobs due to this unfair competition from foreigners. We all know most of them come here to send money back so it's an advantage for them, or they will apply for PR or use SG as a platform to seek employment in other countries for better pay. Singapore companies only care about their bottom line so naturally when the time comes we are the first target. I seriously wonder if the foreign worker quota is actually enforced by MOM. I do not have the data to support but at this rate, our local unemployment rate will be much higher with most of the jobs going to foreigners, especially those in their middle age. As much as I hate Trump, he did do one thing right and that is to restrict work visas during this time to save jobs for Americans. We are now undergoing our own election but I don't hear anything from our politicians that can help protect jobs for Singaporeans. I have been actively sending out resumes and making calls to companies for the last three weeks and only gone for one interview. I am now seriously considering signing up to be food delivery to tide things through for now, or maybe even as a long term option until such I manage to find something permanent.

Do u know how many other Sporeans were displaced and replaced and had to resort to gig job like grab or deliver food ? Yes, these are jobs that can bring income. But dun forget, for every day that is on these kind of job, you will not get any meaningful OJT that other FTs are getting. You can work on these gig jobs for max 6 mths to a year. After that, it will be very difficult to join back the industry coz you've already lost 1 year of skillset to FT and fall far far behind. Good luck hor."

I have similar situation and experience the same plights as you too. I graduated from poly in 2002, my total GPA is 4.2 for the poly results. I have tried to apply for local uni from 2003, 2004 and 2005. ALL was rejected without any reasons. Then in 2005 with the help from a ex poly's lecturer. He requested his friend, who is also uni professor to help me to trace and find out why i can't get into the uni. To my shock, that professor told me to apply and study overseas. Coz the uni refused to accept poly graduate (even how good your result is). Then one day, i took a time off and take a walk at the NUS canteen (near faulty of Science and Computer Sc). From there i saw many foreigner students. From then onwards, i finally understood the 'open leg' policy which ""kill off"" the local students. Not only the current working PMETs...and the low wage salary workers too. Anyway, just keep applying other jobs and living simple life. Try to look for jobs overseas if u can. Don't give up. For me i have totally give up on sg. I have move on.... But is very sad and dishearted to see fellow singaporean facing this problem again and again... As said, the future is bleak in sg... Gear up yourself with new skill. Prepared to go overseas and work if you have connection. Becoz you can't totally change for a better fate in sg, as the system is already 'set' in such a way. sho sad friendly fire"

If the economy is doing well everyone gets paid and happy, but it is in times of crisis like now, that the impact of the open door policy will hurt us Singaporeans the most. Before we already had Malaysians, Indonesians, Indians, Thais, Filipinos and Chinese nationals coming to our tiny island to work, earning our high SGD. Today I can see more people from Taiwan, Burma, Vietnam and Eastern Europe working in Singapore. Even my current neighbor are Burmese tenants working as Draftsman (I can see their PC when I pass by their unit). And they are now not just working in low level unskilled jobs like construction or service F&B. Many are creeping into mid to high level positions that were once mostly done by locals. And worse of all, they don't mind getting paid lower just to work here. In fact I was having a conversation with this Vietnamese girl and she told me that she is paid lower than locals, but she don't mind it one bit cos it's still more than what she earns back home. She claims she is a graduate. When I saw that message I really very DL! I can only imagine how many more Singaporeans are displaced from their jobs due to this unfair competition from foreigners. We all know most of them come here to send money back so it's an advantage for them, or they will apply for PR or use SG as a platform to seek employment in other countries for better pay. Singapore companies only care about their bottom line so naturally when the time comes we are the first target. I seriously wonder if the foreign worker quota is actually enforced by MOM. I do not have the data to support but at this rate, our local unemployment rate will be much higher with most of the jobs going to foreigners, especially those in their middle age. As much as I hate Trump, he did do one thing right and that is to restrict work visas during this time to save jobs for Americans. We are now undergoing our own election but I don't hear anything from our politicians that can help protect jobs for Singaporeans.

I was recently retrenched by my company and the official reason given was restructuring due to market uncertainty. Was on no pay leave after CB period for one month and saw this coming but of course when the news finally came, it is still a shock to me. I am currently in my 40s and this is the worst age to lose a job, too old to re-hire and train. And even if I do find a new job, my salary will be substantially lower. This Covid19 economic downturn will probably stretch through end of 2020 or early 2021. So I am not optimistic about the job market at all. Not only do we Singaporeans have to worry about our rice bowls but we have to fight with the army of foreigners who are working in Singapore or coming to find jobs in near future. As far back as 10 years ago or longer, I remember this was already a hotly debated topic among Singaporeans. PAP opened the floodgates wide open to attract practically every other country in the name of GDP growth. Many of us, including myself, knew that this is a time bomb waiting to blow. If the economy is doing well everyone gets paid and happy, but it is in times of crisis like now, that the impact of the open door policy will hurt us Singaporeans the most. Before we already had Malaysians, Indonesians, Indians, Thais, Filipinos and Chinese nationals coming to our tiny island to work, earning our high SGD. Today I can see more people from Taiwan, Burma, Vietnam and Eastern Europe working in Singapore. Even my current neighbor are Burmese tenants working as Draftsman (I can see their PC when I pass by their unit). And they are now not just working in low level unskilled jobs like construction or service F&B. Many are creeping into mid to high level positions that were once mostly done by locals. And worse of all, they don't mind getting paid lower just to work here. In fact I was having a conversation with this Vietnamese girl and she told me that she is paid lower than locals, but she don't mind it one bit cos it's still more than what she earns back home. She claims she is a graduate. When I saw that message I really very DL! I can only imagine how many more Singaporeans are displaced from their jobs due to this unfair competition from foreigners. We all know most of them come here to send money back so it's an advantage for them, or they will apply for PR or use SG as a platform to seek employment in other countries for better pay. Singapore companies only care about their bottom line so naturally when the time comes we are the first target. I seriously wonder if the foreign worker quota is actually enforced by MOM. I do not have the data to support but at this rate, our local unemployment rate will be much higher with most of the jobs going to foreigners, especially those in their middle age. As much as I hate Trump, he did do one thing right and that is to restrict work visas during this time to save jobs for Americans. We are now undergoing our own election but I don't hear anything from our politicians that can help protect jobs for Singaporeans. I have been actively sending out resumes and making calls to companies for the last three weeks and only gone for one interview. I am now seriously considering signing up to be food delivery to tide things through for now, or maybe even as a long term option until such I manage to find something permanent. Again sorry for the long rant, please stay safe! Private companies CEO paid millions, median salary of working class paid 3rd world salaries. Ministers pegged their salaries to these CEO. Broken social contract on CPF withdrawal age. Every foreigner call themselves a talent, decades of over reliance of cheap labour without automation. And after decades, no Singaporean can learn their skillset and replace them? Foreigners earn SGD, enjoy currency exchange rates, go back buy land. Singaporeans serve NS and lease 99 years HDB. Buildings depreciate, land appreciate. HDB's Asset Enhancement Scheme is just to enrich government coffers. Work entire life only to wait for 99 years to lapse and don't benefit your offsprings.

You need to know and understand that the world and opportunity wait for no one. When opportunity comes, it will only benefits those that are prepared. Singapore needs to capture such opportunities supported by local or foreign talents regardless. If Singapore does not capture the opportunity just because Singapore wants to favored the locals, then some other country will come forward and capture the opportunity readily. You do not need to look far. Just across the causeway, any gov infrastructure projects should be awarded to a certain race. And you already saw how such policy pulling back the development across the causeway. Your proposal to favor only locals is no different. We need to develop our local talents regardless. But to say let's stop capturing the opportunity if we do not have local talents, it's the lost of Singapore. Don't compare SG to Bolehland. Their system is an unequal system that only favors a certain racial profile. Don't say a fair shake, other racial groups have so many doors closed to them. People in SG are not saying to have only sinkies have the first second third priority. Its that the whole system puts sinkies at a comparative disadvantage: - Cost A skilled sinkie worker with good aptitude will always lose out to an FT of similar skill and aptitude purely due to exchange rate differences. The FT can always undercut. Worse still if the FT is not real FT but ""FT"". So businesses are almost always gonna hire cheaper workers. Upskill and reskill is BS but you can only upskill or reskill so much, and still the fundamental cost problem exists even in the case of an upskilled sinkie worker. Cos FT themselves also upskill. - 2 years disadvantage + reservist 10 year cycle + IPPT The skilled male sinkie is further disadvantaged by having the ""privilege"" of 2 years stripped away, of forever being 2 years behind in both the skilled female sinkie and the skilled FT. Then got reservist. Then got IPPT."

That's why eh kan sinkies, with no family problems, no major familial obligations will just fast hand fast leg go overseas sua.

I was recently retrenched by my company and the official reason given was restructuring due to market uncertainty. Was on no pay leave after CB period for one month and saw this coming but of course when the news finally came, it is still a shock to me. I am currently in my 40s and this is the worst age to lose a job, too old to re-hire and train. And even if I do find a new job, my salary will be substantially lower. This Covid19 economic downturn will probably stretch through end of 2020 or early 2021. So I am not optimistic about the job market at all. Not only do we Singaporeans have to worry about our rice bowls but we have to fight with the army of foreigners who are working in Singapore or coming to find jobs in near future. As far back as 10 years ago or longer, I remember this was already a hotly debated topic among Singaporeans. PAP opened the floodgates wide open to attract practically every other country in the name of GDP growth. Many of us, including myself, knew that this is a time bomb waiting to blow. If the economy is doing well everyone gets paid and happy, but it is in times of crisis like now, that the impact of the open door policy will hurt us Singaporeans the most. And just FYI I do not support whites. Before we already had Malaysians, Indonesians, Indians, Thais, Filipinos and Chinese nationals coming to our tiny island to work, earning our high SGD. Today I can see more people from Taiwan, Burma, Vietnam and Eastern Europe working in Singapore. Even my current neighbor are Burmese tenants working as Draftsman (I can see their PC when I pass by their unit). And they are now not just working in low level unskilled jobs like construction or service F&B. Many are creeping into mid to high level positions that were once mostly done by locals. And worse of all, they don't mind getting paid lower just to work here. In fact I was having a conversation with this Vietnamese girl and she told me that she is paid lower than locals, but she don't mind it one bit cos it's still more than what she earns back home. She claims she is a graduate. When I saw that message I really very DL! I can only imagine how many more Singaporeans are displaced from their jobs due to this unfair competition from foreigners. We all know most of them come here to send money back so it's an advantage for them, or they will apply for PR or use SG as a platform to seek employment in other countries for better pay. Singapore companies only care about their bottom line so naturally when the time comes we are the first target. I seriously wonder if the foreign worker quota is actually enforced by MOM. I do not have the data to support but at this rate, our local unemployment rate will be much higher with most of the jobs going to foreigners, especially those in their middle age. As much as I hate Trump, he did do one thing right and that is to restrict work visas during this time to save jobs for Americans. We are now undergoing our own election but I don't hear anything from our politicians that can help protect jobs for Singaporeans. I have been actively sending out resumes and making calls to companies for the last three weeks and only gone for one interview. I am now seriously considering signing up to be food delivery to tide things through for now, or maybe even as a long term option until such I manage to find something permanent. Again sorry for the long rant, please stay safe! See your MP."

You need to know and understand that the world and opportunity wait for no one. When opportunity comes, it will only benefits those that are prepared. Singapore needs to capture such opportunities supported by local or foreign talents regardless. If Singapore does not capture the opportunity just because Singapore wants to favored the locals, then some other country will come forward and capture the opportunity readily. You do not need to look far. Just across the causeway, any gov infrastructure projects should be awarded to a certain race. And you already saw how such policy pulling back the development across the causeway. Your proposal to favor only locals is no different. We need to develop our local talents regardless. But to say let's stop capturing the opportunity if we do not have local talents, it's the lost of Singapore. As per my comments earlier, my ""so called plan"" in your words should have been done from the start. It does not favour only locals but ensures that locals are really fairly considered for a role. Some of what i had shared are subsequent policies and initiatives that are currently in place to address this but came too late and most importantly are half-heartly implemented and not really policed nor followed (lip service). A lot of these practices are also in place in many countries i.e. US where you must have tried finding a local for a role before you get a foreigner for a role. But ceacas being the schemers that they are have been abusing the H1b visa system in the US hence Trump recently and a couple of years ago threatened to do/ did something about this. Just ask any sg recruiter or HR person in a financial institution or in tech field if they really tried their best or even  made an effort to find a singaporean for a vacancy. Many of these recruiters/HR and headhunters themselves are also FTs from India as well. Do you really need india indians to do HR in singapore? On your point on opportunity waits for no one: From my personal experience, the floodgates opened back in the 2000s. I am only old enough to remember that back in the late 90s and very early 2000s. Bio medical science was the in thing that singaporeans went to study that only for the so called hub to not be as successful as it should be resulting in a lot of these graduates not going into their field of study. I was one of the many locals who started working in a foreign bank in the mid 2000s when sg was marketed as a banking and financial hub. What happend to our banking and financial hub in sg in just a span of 10+ years? Retrechment x3 with most departments (even HR) being outsourced to india. My point to your point on threads is that unlike that past, the upcoming threads to drive our economy can never be predicted or sustained if we dont ensure that locals are part of that thread."

Already projected for economy to shrink significantly, retrenchments, graduates no jobs, businesses cannot open etc. Use so much of money, also need to find ways to recover. Probably quickly secure and it will allow them to set some necessary but not so nice policies.

I know this because of my work Regionally and Globally. I am not a fan of the increase in population and frankly I voted against them in 2011.

Even if some of us are in a construction related industry and know that the FWs in their company live in a dorm, I doubt they had the exact number of them...which we now know is 323,000. That they have to be housed in a dorm shows that we have no capacity for 6.9 million people. It's a blessing in disguise that 400,000 jhks live in Malaysia, crossing the Causeway twice daily.  We may say that they are smart, earn money here, spend it there, one for three, three for one.  But if they had decided to live here, where do we find accommodation for them?  Also in dorms, and then that's another Wuflu cluster! Maybe we are on the way to building more and more 40 storey HDB flats to replace those built in 1975 or before, which are 10 storey high.  So, we expand our housing capacity fourfold. How about transportation?  Can the mrt take it?  Oh well, if WFH becomes fashionable, maybe mrt and bus congestion may not be a problem after all, that is, bosses do not outsource the work since WFH can be done by a foreigner in Vietnam, China, Malaysia, India. There are no easy solutions, and nobody knows which is the right ""model"". I hate it, I absolutely HATE it, when every time during rallies, the opposition candidates repeat what went wrong the last four to five years.  Why tell me what I already know???  What I want to hear from them is their model for the future, how they intend to navigate the country out of the current pandemic/depression and forward. When Pakatan Harapan asked M'sians to vote for them, they came up with an economic model...abolish GST (which they did), highway toll, university fees...many things promised, few delivered. So if the Oppo offers an alternative model, I hope it will be deliverable and not building castles in the air to fool people. tbh we already being placed on the castles in the air Our HDB from life asset during erection now is not ours after 99 years with 0 value Oh sorry I am wetting my balls only"

Far better is it to have a wealthy Singapore that can help the bottom 5% than to have one with a system which does not work, where the bottom is not 5% but 95%.  No need to look far for examples.

Whether in peace time, virus pandemic time and during war time too. The ruling government must accept criticism and judgement from the opposition party or parties and the people, that is politics. Unless the ruling government is run by 'Dictatorship' or 'Communist Party' then there are no oppositions and no people's voice to monitor and criticise the ruling Government's administration, credibility and performance. There is no Government without the People in democracy unless a monster like leadership reign the country with an 'Iron Fist.' Sometimes I wish there are only two parties system in Singapore. Easier for the People to understand the political arena, associate themselves with the party they want to see as the ruling government to administer their country and vote for.

Najib started it, Mahathir abolished it.......and read on..........revived SST. I was happy for a while, as a tourist, when my hotel bills, restaurant bills, suddenly did not have a 6% GST anymore, and only for a short while. Then, SST was added to my bills. My point is that the government cannot simply print money to pay for education, healthcare, defence, etc.. If it is not GST, then it will be higher Income Tax.  This was the case before GST was introduced.  Do you want to go back to taxing people on Income and not partly on Income and partly on Consumption? Whichever way you do it, taxes must be paid. But a tax on consumption spreads the tax net wider because tourists are also made to pay taxes.  It happened to me when I was in Malaysia, staying in their hotels and eating and shopping there. If Malaysia only taxes income (and not consumption), I would be getting away with paying taxes. 30% of our budget goes to defence. Can someone please name me the last time we went to war? So basically, other than producing tons of JLB generals and enslaving Singaporean sons for 2 years of their lives, the SAF has achieved nothing. I'm asking you why are we not relooking at adjusting our defence budget, instead we raise taxes. Taxes stifle the economy. Wah lau $10 ringgit per day and you making noise about the taxes, nobody ask you visit Malaysia also. What kind fo analogy is that?"

In this regard, Mr Heng commended Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh for having said in Parliament that partisan politics should take a backseat and that there should be a unity of purpose in battling Covid-19. Mr Singh had said last week that the WP took this position so that Singapore could single-mindedly overcome the challenge, adding: ""The Workers' Party has not come in to publicly criticise the Government on its handling of an unprecedented crisis in ways that would undermine the national effort."" Said Mr Heng: ""That is good, for a party to be responsible and take that view. Unfortunately, it's not the case for all parties because there are parties that are (saying) 'Well, look, this thing was not well done, that thing was not well done' and so on."" Mr Heng said there is a time and place to review policy decisions. But right now, Singapore is ""in the midst of a major battle on many fronts"". .. There is value, he acknowledges, in looking back to see if there is something that can be done better as Singapore goes forward in this fight, but calling for an accounting and fault-finding at this stage is a distraction from what needs to be done , he added. "" I welcome any good suggestions about how we might do better in this battle. I'm very open to good ideas.

You can't expect to force-feed customers to just give 'suggestions & ideas' and even commendations, SIAO. Else how to improve? This means the words are not going to sound so nice all the time to feed their 'scholarly' appetites but is wholly necessary to shake up any ruling party to prevent complacency, which is ironically PAP's mantra, LMAO. If the ruling party wants to escape from accountability when fault is found, means wat? What does this reveal about them? Total hypocrites. They profess not to be complacent and yet only wish to listen to wonderful tunes sang to them. Whether the criticisms and fault-findings are 'constructive' enough or not is debatable but as lng as it is legal for instance, not calling for hate or violence, this should be accepted as part of democracy which includes debates, arguments and not just 'suggestion and ideas', SIAO.

In this regard, Mr Heng commended Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh for having said in Parliament that partisan politics should take a backseat and that there should be a unity of purpose in battling Covid-19. Mr Singh had said last week that the WP took this position so that Singapore could single-mindedly overcome the challenge, adding: ""The Workers' Party has not come in to publicly criticise the Government on its handling of an unprecedented crisis in ways that would undermine the national effort."" Said Mr Heng: ""That is good, for a party to be responsible and take that view. Unfortunately, it's not the case for all parties because there are parties that are (saying) 'Well, look, this thing was not well done, that thing was not well done' and so on."" Mr Heng said there is a time and place to review policy decisions. But right now, Singapore is ""in the midst of a major battle on many fronts"". .. There is value, he acknowledges, in looking back to see if there is something that can be done better as Singapore goes forward in this fight, but calling for an accounting and fault-finding at this stage is a distraction from what needs to be done , he added. "" I welcome any good suggestions about how we might do better in this battle. I'm very open to good ideas.

"" My take: 1) Pritam Singh can jolly well join PAP already, LOL. Buay Gan, Mo Lan Yong. In fact, Lee Bee Wah's recent tirade in the parliament criticizing MOM's flawed policies makes her a much better 'opposition' than this new Mo Lan Yong WP leader. https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...mpliance-costs - After consulting with the Ministry of Health (MOH), the authorities will no longer require S-Pass and work permit holders in the construction sector who do not live in dormitories, work only in offices and do not visit work sites to be regularly tested for Covid-19, announced Mr Lee. On Thursday, Ms Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon GRC) had criticised a new requirement by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) as being too ""high-handed"". The MOM had said that employers will have to let the ministry move their foreign workers to different dormitories or work at another company in need of manpower, in order to get the foreign worker levy rebates announced in the Fortitude Budget. "" So if an opposition party can't even criticize as well as the ruling party's own MP means wat? Disgraceful. Let's call a spade a spade. Small no. of MPs is no excuse. In UK parliament, the Speaker even fought furiously for the minority MP's criticism from Scotland and Wales and constantly warned the ruling party that their voice must be heard, LOL. Here in our parliament is a total joke. 2) CECA Heng prata flip and contradicted himself when he says 'calling for an accounting and fault-finding at this stage is a distraction from what needs to be done' and yet says he "" welcome any good suggestions about how we might do better in this battle.

In what he described as an ""anti-pollution measure in cyberspace"", Yeo transferred censorship authority from the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS) to the Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA), which was to ""concentrate on areas which may undermine public morals, political stability or religious harmony in Singapore"". Yeo said the government would focus on monitoring internet communications that broadcast material to millions of users rather than the ""narrowcasting"" of private communications between individuals.[4] As Minister for Trade and Industry, Yeo led his team to successfully negotiate the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, Japan, Australia and other countries.[citation needed] Yeo proposed the idea of having Integrated Resorts (IRs) in Singapore, which would include casinos, which was intensely debated for a year.[5] This paved the way for the 2 IRs in Singapore, Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands at the Marina Promenade. (He later shared with a group of university students during a dialogue that his late father had a problem with gambling and the decision to push for the gaming resorts was personally a very difficult one. He said that policy making often involved a choice between 'evils'.)[citation needed] >- George Yeo was another paper general, he was the one who started the ball rolling on edmw's favourite ceca and supposedly staunch catholic but supported building casinos - he should've been the people's president ; On 10 May 2011, Yeo announced that he was retiring from active politics, and later on 5 October 2011, Yeo stepped down from the PAP's Central Executive Committee (the party's governing body).[11] During his announcement, Yeo stated that he declined running for presidency later that year, cited that he was a ""free spirit"" and he was not ""temperamentally suited for such a job"", despite being popular in online and have ""a flood of support"" on post-election.[12] He although stated on his Facebook page that he was ""thinking hard"" about the possibility of becoming a candidate on 1 June,[13][14][15] but however, on 15 June, Yeo confirmed that he declined standing for presidency. >- peasants get screwed over but still support ...

So as long as the system allows social mobility with joint effort from the government and people, I think its a good system.

Economists and political analysts keep saying tht income distribution has gotten worse globally, with the widening income gap creating social tensions. They wring their hands but nobody dare to point out tht the main reason why this is so is lthe reduction in progressive taxes like income tax, estate duty, etc. and the increase in regressive taxes like VAT and GST. Its like taking money from the poor to subsidise the rich. The Republicans are meant for the elite wealthy enterprises. The Democrats are for the People.

The answer is to upscale and upgrade themselves instead of waiting for more handouts. So as long as the system allows social mobility with joint effort from the government and people, I think its a good system. Having said that we still need the able to pay the taxes and more is always better than less as long as one can afford. However its a fine balance because we do not want to drive them away and end up not even having any GST revenue to help the poor. Regardless of the income level, everybody pays GST. The handouts aren't enough for some mainly because of the high cost of living. They just don't want to tell you that minimum income won't work because the high cost of living here will make it infeasible to stay competitive. They keep telling Singaporeans to up our productivity and take up courses offered through various upgrading schemes. Hard truth is Singaporeans especially from the middle to low education have little job security against foreigners who are younger and cheaper. If you don't stay highly productive then the chances of you getting replace by a foreigner is inevitable. They just don't say that in your face. We are talking a long drawn recession and these so called skills upgrading won't help much because there will be few opportunities, and that you have been given the heads up few days back. Reason is we are still high dependent on the services and financial sectors after years of seeing our investments go overseas. Money money and more GDP growth, that's what this government is about, when a pandemic strikes, there is every little to fall back on."

In case anyone hasn't realized this, we've wasted billions of dollars of hard earned taxpayers' money dealing with the dorm issue that became an issue only because they fcked it up spectacularly. We are paying for their mistakes. But we voted for a no blame culture directly."

So if they want to keep prices affordable for public housing, then cannot sell at open market at all. But must find some way to be equitable to those who have bought public houses before this as the will have effect on overall house prices. This also runs counter productive to the government needing to maximise returns on assets of the state so the key is how much land to be reserved for such houses and at what conditions? Having CPF balance at retirement and having a house at retirement are both serving the same outcome with the difference in which has better returns. Definitely having a tangible asset like house makes more sense than some number in the CPF statement but then it brings us back to the current state of affairs. How to maximise your retirement funds so that you have enough? Without ABSD and TDSR ppl also buy houses to flip, Singaporeans and foreigners alike.

Having CPF balance at retirement and having a house at retirement are both serving the same outcome with the difference in which has better returns. Definitely having a tangible asset like house makes more sense than some number in the CPF statement but then it brings us back to the current state of affairs. How to maximise your retirement funds so that you have enough? Without ABSD and TDSR ppl also buy houses to flip, Singaporeans and foreigners alike. So if the bubble burst then the normal Singaporean nest egg will disappear. having cpf balance is better because paying a stable 2.5-4% interest. if depending on hdb appreciation, it is bad because not only depend on flipping demand but also raise the cost of everything and need population ponzi to keep kicking down the can. leads to overcrowding too, leads to covid spread easily. probably gahment realise they cannot continue pay 2.5-4% so decided to tie sinkies to their ownself created housing bubble. which is less stable and hence less returns for retirement..but still looks good in absolute figures. bubble started from 2007, peak around 2012, if you fomo at the top, too bad, but outside this period, should not suffer as bad"

In noting that land prices have also risen faster than salaries, DTZ cautioned that if land costs keep soaring, the trend could push up selling prices of homes. https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/hdb-paid-2-000psm-land-115717164.html"

The responses in this thread have again vindicated that Kum gong kias are 1 cent a dozen in EDMW. The question asked by the interviewer and what Heng See Keat said can be found from the 47th minute in this video :  (Unfortunately, kum gong kias with poor English comprehension skills may not correctly grasp what he said). I am in for more laughs at EDMW kum gong kias. It is threads like this which justify the enactment of POFMA. Basically, Heng Swee Keat did not say that the General Election is not the time for accounting and fault finding. He did not say anything against accounting and fault finding taking place during General Election. He was only against opposition parties practising bipartisan politics which un-constructively ask for accounting and find fault now just to score political points when Singapore is in the midst of this huge crisis.  Indirectly, he said accounting and fault finding could take place later during the General Election if it was an appropriate time. State Times Review led Threadstarter at his nose and then Threadstarter led the EDMW kum gong kias at their noses."

Then have to go to new areas then same thing the new areas complain never see them before You want them walk entire region? Not to mention, if opposition hold, PAP still must have grassroots there and PA activities all they hold. They can still maintain huge presence. You think PAP all humble?

In fact, in the context of security and order, by China having executed and passing life-jail sentences to those involved in the 2008 milk poisoning, is it not a reflection of strong Chinese legal system over the years. Which is what they are doing now to HK. I let you to decide and think over this. It's not a problem of diary quality. For AMDK, it's a problem of lapses in safety protocols. Generally, the problem is negligence, not malice. For China, the problem is very much a result of malice, corruption, and a complete failure of the legal system. The perpetrators of the China incident were members of the Chinese Communist Party. It has to be; any company of any importance, needs to have Chinese Communist Party officials in control. Whistleblowers blew the whistle hard on the wrongdoing for years, but nothing came of it, because of corruption. For years, regulators looked the other way, and government bodies willfully chose to ignore or cover up reports and studies. There's a reason why incidents of this scale happen only in China, and why Mainland Chinese want to hop over to Hong Kong to buy their milk powder. Because the law in Hong Kong was actually working properly, and government officials wouldn't be able to hide and cover each other's wrongdoings to this extent.

For China, the problem is very much a result of malice, corruption, and a complete failure of the legal system. The perpetrators of the China incident were members of the Chinese Communist Party. It has to be; any company of any importance, needs to have Chinese Communist Party officials in control. Whistleblowers blew the whistle hard on the wrongdoing for years, but nothing came of it, because of corruption. For years, regulators looked the other way, and government bodies willfully chose to ignore or cover up reports and studies. There's a reason why incidents of this scale happen only in China, and why Mainland Chinese want to hop over to Hong Kong to buy their milk powder. Because the law in Hong Kong was actually working properly, and government officials wouldn't be able to hide and cover each other's wrongdoings to this extent. Seems like those days are numbered though. Errr...the charged criminals in the 2008 milk powder poisoning were ""members of the Chinese Communist Party"" ? Where did you go that infor from ? If you wanna use politics in your little argument defending the amdk, at least provide facts to back up. Else, you are just giving another unrelated excuse to post lame reasons against China for passing security law on a territory that is legally, historically and morally within their rights. The funny part is you even dare to claim HK law is ""working properly"" when it system had been bias towards protecting non-Chinese interests even after the Handover. Now this has been challenged by China's law on security. That is why amdk govs are crying foul now. Lately, the irony from your little stroll back to the milk scandal is you forget how HK fell into foreigners control when China once tried to stop their people from being poison by amdk. You have no sense of proportion nor awareness about this, do you ? How a Foreign Law turn HK into a colony - The largest known state-sponsored drug pusher in modern History..."

The US said on Friday it would ban trade with 33 Chinese companies in a move that could signal the start of a 'new cold war', according to Chinese media. An article in the state-controlled Global Times said that Australia should keep quiet like India and stay out of the spat to avoid becoming collateral damage. The article said that China will punish Australia more harshly than the US because it is less economically dependent on Australia. The US is China's number one export market whereas Australia is 14th. The article said: 'China will enjoy more room to fight back against Australia with countermeasures if Canberra supports Washington in a possible ""new Cold War"". 'It means Australia may feel more pain than the US.' The editorial said President Trump was targeting China to distract from his handling of the coronavirus pandemic which has killed 97,000 Americans. 'The Trump administration is fomenting trouble to deflect its woes over its mishandling of the coronavirus onto China,' it said. 'There is no need for other countries, such as Australia, to involve themselves in this ridiculous political play.' The Global Times believes Australia is merely a 'lap dog' being used to further American interests and last week claimed the US coerced Canberra into calling for an inquiry into the origins and spread of coronavirus. Last month Beijing became infuriated by Australia's calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus, believing that it was a 'malicious' attempt to blame and 'stigmatize' China. Prime Minster Scott Morrison had demanded a ban on wildlife wet markets, where the virus may have originated, and said inspectors should be able to enter a country suffering from a pandemic without the government's consent. Earlier this month China slapped an 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley and suspended imports from four Australian beef suppliers in apparent revenge. About one third of Australia's total exports - including iron ore, gas, coal and food - go to China, bringing in around $135billion per year and providing thousands of jobs. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/art...unishment.html"

China is China, and although yeye and nai nai came from there, we are not Chinese - they use this word to refer to the nationality that's called ""Chinese"". Then, there is another group which identifies with their race first, over anything else, and they use the word ""Chinese"" to refer to their race, and so for them, they must support anyone who is ""Chinese"".

Visitors from China, meanwhile, increased 0.5% from the previous year. Tourist numbers from China to Taiwan have never quite recovered to the highs of the pre-2016 years, when a government that espoused closer ties to Beijing was in power in Taipei. Nonetheless, Taiwan has made up for that shortfall by luring tourists from other markets, mostly Japan and Southeast Asia, and by relaxing visa requirements for some countries. Last year, the number of visitors from Japan exceed 2 million for the first time. https://qz.com/1780709/taiwan-touris...china-boycott/ They were saving Taiwan and HK from corona."

If you want to talk about long term projection it is clear that a black swarn event like CoVid - 19 must be removed from the equation. You and your talk about how CoVid - 19 will result in a post CoVid - 19 world of your imagination is purely mental masturbation.

This group don't seem to get any help. How could they be forgotten when they are probably one of the worst now with no income n who knows when they will ever get employed given the bleak outlook on many industries? They might b retrenched in 2019 or left their job for various reasons and unemployment is certainly not their choice... Did any MP raise this in Parliament?

But I believe this group is one of the worst hit group and hope they can apply for some financial aid since it\x92s even harder to get jobs since they are having a hard time to do so before covid.
