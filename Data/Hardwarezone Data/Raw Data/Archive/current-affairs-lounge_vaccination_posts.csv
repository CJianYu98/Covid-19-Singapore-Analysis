Delivering his wrap up speech in parliament, the minister noted that China is among the countries that are quite advanced in the development of vaccines. I have had a video conference with my counterpart in China to discuss the possibility of signing an MOU for Malaysia to have access to the vaccine immediately. \x93That is, if it is found to be safe and effective by the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) under the Ministry of Health,\x94 he said. He added that Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein will also be speaking with his Chinese counterpart on Wednesday, and the MOU as well as the vaccine will be on the agenda. Mr Khairy noted that the vaccine for COVID-19 is now sought after by the world, and this has resulted in what he called vaccine diplomacy. \x93The world is now hunting for a COVID-19 vaccine for us to return to the old normal because if we do not get a vaccine we will have to remain in the new normal. As a result, in the world there is now vaccine diplomacy where advanced countries are buying vaccines being developed by pharmaceuticals in the West. \x93For developing countries, this is an uncomfortable situation when countries like the United States and United Kingdom as well as European countries have already made advance purchases of the vaccines,\x94 he said. .... https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...uddin-12993038"

Related research and development of the COVID-19 inactivated vaccine was published by ""Cell"" on Saturday, one of the world's most respected life science academic journals. Top scientists from the National Vaccine & Serum Institutes, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences published their research paper, ""Development of an inactivated vaccine Candidate, BBIBp-CorV, with potent protection against SARS- COV-2"" to introduce their research on a COVID-19 vaccine in China to the world. Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, is one of the authors. According to the research paper, they reported the pilot-scale production of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, BBIBP-CorV that induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies titers in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and nonhuman primates (cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques) to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2. Two-dose immunizations using 2 \u03bcg/dose of BBIBP-CorV protected against SARS-CoV-2 intratracheal challenges in rhesus macaques, without detectable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. In addition, BBIBP-CorV exhibited productivity and strong genetic stability for vaccine manufacturing. The results support earlier evaluations of BBIBP-CorV during clinical trials, according to the paper. The Beijing Vaccine & Serum Institute completed the construction of the world's largest inactivated COVID-19 vaccine production facility capable of manufacturing over 3 million doses, with an annual output of 100-120 million doses after mass production, the Xinhua News Agency reported. In addition, the report also mentioned that the inactivated vaccine facility developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products is slated for completion within the next month. By then, China's two biological research institutes will have an annual capacity of more than 200 million doses to ensure the accessibility of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1190991.shtml"

In order to prevent and control the new corona epidemic, human beings urgently need vaccines. The new coronavirus vaccine, called BBIBP-CorV, developed by a Chinese research team, has shown great potential in animal experimentation: it is highly efficient and safe, and can induce high levels of neutralizing antibody titer in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and non-human primates (crab-eating monkeys and rhesus monkeys), providing high levels of neutralizing and antibody titer, and providing high protection against new coronavirus. At the same time, the candidate vaccine is the second most important inactivated vaccine developed in China, increasing the domestic vaccine candidate options. The results are from a critical paper published online in cell , an international authoritative academic journal , june 6 local time : Developing a candidate inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV to provide effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 ( Development of inactivated vaccine candidate , BBIBP-CorV with, protection of the potper SARS-CoV-2). The authors of this paper are academicianofer of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Director of the Chinese Academy of Medicine and Disease Control Gao Fu, Director of the Institute of Medical Experimental Animals of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Qin Chuan, Director of the Emergency Technology Center of the Virus Disease Institute of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Tan Wenjie, Professor of Tsinghua University, Li Zhiyong, Li Changgui Researcher of the China Food and Drug Inspection Research Institute, Chief Expert of Biosecurity of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Wu Guizhen, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Viral Disease Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medicine. The research team came from Beijing Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd., China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Center for Human Disease Animal Model Resource Center, the National Health and Health Commission\x92s Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Medical Experimental Animal Research Institute, beijing Concord Medical College Comparative Medical Center, the New Emerging Infectious Disease Storier Animal Model Research Beijing Key Laboratory, Tsinghua University, etc. The researchers detailed the experimental production of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated candidate vaccine (BBIBP-CorV), which induces high levels of neutralizing antibody titer in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and non-human primates (crab monkeys and rhesus monkeys) to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2. In intra-gash immunization in rhesus monkeys, the study of bbIBP-CorV using a dose of 2 ?g/dose provided effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 without detecting antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) infection. In addition, BBIBP-CorV exhibits high productivity and good genetic stability in vaccine production. SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread faster than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, leading to an urgent need for vaccines. To date, three candidate vaccines, including an inactivated vaccine, an adenovirus vector vaccine and a DNA vaccine, have been reported to protect rhesus monkeys against SARS-CoV-2 with different effects. Inactivated vaccine is widely used in the prevention of new infectious diseases, its development speed is faster, for the prevention of new coronavirus has a better development prospects. It is worth noting that emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV infection may have antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), suggesting that special safety evaluation should be given to the development of coronavirus vaccines. The first inactivated new crown vaccine in China came from China Bio, a pharmaceutical group. China Pharmaceutical Group China Bio announced on April 14 that the company\x92s new coronavirus inactivated vaccine has been clinically tested, the first phase of clinical has been carried out in the jiaozhu region of Henan. On the other hand, the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector vaccine, jointly developed by the team of Academician Chen Wei of the Institute of Bioengineering of the Institute of Military Medicine of the Academy of Military Sciences and CanSino of China, has also made significant progress. On the evening of May 22nd, local time, a paper published in the leading medical journal The Lancet entitled \x93The safety, tolerance and immunogenicity of the comorphic adenovirus type 5 vector COVID-19 vaccine: dose increase, open label, non-randomization, first human trial\x94. Chen Wei and other researchers reported 1 stage of clinical data on the Ad5 vector COVID-19 vaccine used in healthy adults in China within 28 days of vaccination to initially assess the vaccine\x92s safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. Vaccine design and production The team isolated three SARS-CoV-2 strains from bronchopulmonary irrigation samples and throat swabs from three new coronal patients to build a clinical pre-in vitro and venomous animal model of SARS-CoV-2 inactivated candidate vaccine. The three new cogens are: 19 ncov-cdc-tan-hb02 (HB02), 19 ncov-cdc-tan-strain03 (CQ01) and 19 ncov-cdc-tan-strain04 (QD01). The three strains were scattered in different locations of the system development tree, indicating that they were well representative of SARS-CoV-2 More on this link https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/www....ves/156704/amp"
