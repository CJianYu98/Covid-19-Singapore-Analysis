But its distributional effect on the rich and the poor differ hugely. For instance, both the rich and the poor have to consume food and other essentials. The income elasticity of demand of food is usually less than 1 (inelastic), which means they are necessity goods, and therefore as a household's income rises, the tax collected on the food remains almost the same. Therefore, as a proportion of available expenditure, the relative tax burden falls more heavily on households with lower incomes. The argument that GST is \x93fair\x94 when one is taxed more when he spends more did not take into consideration that the rich would have a lot more income that they can save while the poor are usually stretched to the maximum of their income."

The Budget was rated 6.9 out of 10 amongst respondents, up from 6.7 in 2020 and 5.8 in 2019, according to the findings released on Friday (19 February). Nearly half also expressed their belief that 2021 will be a better year economically, up from last year\x92s 26 per cent, with 85 per cent believing that Singapore is on the right track to post-pandemic recovery. The key announcement that Singaporeans are most aware of for Budget 2021 is the Community Development Council vouchers of $100 per household for use at heartland shops and hawkers (54 per cent). Tying at second place at 50 per cent are the special cash payment of $200 for those eligible for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) voucher and the $120-$200 in utility rebates for Housing & Development Board (HDB) households (GST Voucher U-save). Forty-nine per cent of respondents are aware of the GST increase scheduled for 2022-2025, while 45 per cent are aware of the GST to be applied on low-cost purchases from overseas, including items bought online.

Gaming wise Intel have upper hand, not because AMD is slow. Most games are better optimized on Intel PC than AMD. CPU is one thing, you have to consider the graphic whether is it MX250 or Geforce 1650. For light gaming recommend a laptop with Intel H/AMD H CPU and Geforce 1650. Intel U as well as AMD U series are ultra low wattage meant for normal use like surf net, do work etc. but not gaming. Your issue probably due to Windows update or something, you can try reinstall Windows 10 and try. (Reinstall is not reset, reinstall means wipe existing partition than install Windows from fresh.)"

Under your scenario at that budget since both are FH, the condo will always be a better choice (preferably high floors) as you just need to pay a small maintenance fees and let the BM maintenance your premises, which include pools, gym, jacuzzis etc. For landed would be nightmarish as all maintenance goes to the owner. That's why you can see many landed houses are left in a dilapidated state due to owner not enough budget, LOL. Another advantage of Condo is if you are able to find one unit with good unblock facing (best to face greeneries, river, lake or sea), the spectacular views from the balcony is something which landed can never achieve. My condo, though not at prime area is directly facing the sea (although quite a distance away, LOL) and unblock, can even see JB and last year's fireworks fireworks, LOL. Every morning I would stand there for 10 mins just to stretch and eat the wind. Not forgetting if your condo is at prime area, bound to have expats or even celebrities chionu in bikinis which you can bio from the pool area."

$870 million to keep wage subsidies at 50% for aviation industry from April to September,18-02-2021 03:12 AM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/%24870-million-keep-wage-subsidies-50%25-aviation-industry-april-september-6468056.html,132604716,17-02-2021  08:51 PM,"An $870 million support package for the hard-hit aviation sector will increase wage subsidies to 50 per cent for local workers for another six months,  the Ministry of Transport (MOT) said on Wednesday (Feb 17). The Jobs Support Scheme - which would be extended, as announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in his Budget speech on Tuesday - provides firms in the sector with wage support of 30 per cent from April to June, and 10 per cent from July to September. The Aviation Workforce Retention Grant, which will cost $330 million, will enhance that to 50 per cent of wages paid to Singaporeans and permanent residents from April to September, said MOT. This means that eligible firms will receive an additional 20 per cent of wages paid to each local employee from April to June, and an additional 40 per cent from July to September. The wage subsidy is subject to a cap of up to $4,600 of gross monthly wages. Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung noted that aviation has been one of the hardest-hit sectors during the pandemic, ""if not the hardest hit"", as Changi Airport and its stakeholders lost 97.5 per cent of its customers. As at end-January this year, total passenger movements in Changi were only about 2 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels. ""Yet for a city-state like Singapore, the air hub is essential to connect us with the rest of the world and continues to be our lifeblood,"" said Mr Ong. ""This support will help Changi tide through the crisis, while we explore ways to reopen borders safely."" In his Budget speech, Mr Heng emphasised the need to position the aviation sector for recovery as part of efforts to deepen Singapore's position as a global-Asia node. The remaining $540 million under the OneAviation Support Package will go to cost relief, said MOT. This includes extending existing rebates on fees and charges at Changi and Seletar airports for another year. The rebate on fees payable by pilots, air traffic controllers and aircraft maintenance engineers will also be extended for another year. ""The package will enable aviation companies to preserve core capabilities and tide over the crisis, and preserve Singapore's position as an aviation hub post-Covid-19,"" said MOT. The funding for the sector comes under the $11 billion Covid-19 Resilience Package announced in the Budget speech. MOT said that many aviation companies around the world had reduced their headcounts over the past year, pointing out that those in Singapore did likewise in ""a very judicious manner, mostly affecting foreign manpower"". ""We must avoid further reductions to the aviation workforce so that companies will not lose their core local capabilities, which have taken many years to build up. If the sector weakens its capabilities, this will hamper its ability to recover,"" added the ministry. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-september-mot"

The Jobs Support Scheme - which would be extended, as announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in his Budget speech on Tuesday - provides firms in the sector with wage support of 30 per cent from April to June, and 10 per cent from July to September. The Aviation Workforce Retention Grant, which will cost $330 million, will enhance that to 50 per cent of wages paid to Singaporeans and permanent residents from April to September, said MOT. This means that eligible firms will receive an additional 20 per cent of wages paid to each local employee from April to June, and an additional 40 per cent from July to September. The wage subsidy is subject to a cap of up to $4,600 of gross monthly wages. Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung noted that aviation has been one of the hardest-hit sectors during the pandemic, ""if not the hardest hit"", as Changi Airport and its stakeholders lost 97.5 per cent of its customers. As at end-January this year, total passenger movements in Changi were only about 2 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels. ""Yet for a city-state like Singapore, the air hub is essential to connect us with the rest of the world and continues to be our lifeblood,"" said Mr Ong. ""This support will help Changi tide through the crisis, while we explore ways to reopen borders safely."" In his Budget speech, Mr Heng emphasised the need to position the aviation sector for recovery as part of efforts to deepen Singapore's position as a global-Asia node. The remaining $540 million under the OneAviation Support Package will go to cost relief, said MOT. This includes extending existing rebates on fees and charges at Changi and Seletar airports for another year. The rebate on fees payable by pilots, air traffic controllers and aircraft maintenance engineers will also be extended for another year. ""The package will enable aviation companies to preserve core capabilities and tide over the crisis, and preserve Singapore's position as an aviation hub post-Covid-19,"" said MOT. The funding for the sector comes under the $11 billion Covid-19 Resilience Package announced in the Budget speech. MOT said that many aviation companies around the world had reduced their headcounts over the past year, pointing out that those in Singapore did likewise in ""a very judicious manner, mostly affecting foreign manpower"". ""We must avoid further reductions to the aviation workforce so that companies will not lose their core local capabilities, which have taken many years to build up. If the sector weakens its capabilities, this will hamper its ability to recover,"" added the ministry. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-september-mot No use spending so much money on them.

When used in everyday conversations today, the word seems to encapsulate an illustration of driven, hard-working millennials going against the grain to chase their dreams. The millennial demographic seems to take pride in being associated with the expression. On Instagram, the axis of millennial and Gen Z lives, images featuring the hashtag, #hustle, rack up more than 25 million posts. Amongst them, motivational quotes emphasing limitless possibilities and optimism are most commonly featured. Occasionally, we would come across the success stories of a 20-something or 30-something individual, who overcame the odds and made a mark in the industry. And since many of us are purveyors of motivational content, the success stories of these individuals, who don\x92t wear their harried lifestyles as badges, are exceptionally appealing in the inspirational sense; in many instances, these individuals have become role models, whose habits and successes are things we want to emulate. Back home, hoolah Singapore has had the opportunity to collaborate and interact with four such Singaporean hustlers. In the third piece of the four-part series, we feature  actress Naomi Yeo. Independent, unabashed and relentless, the young female trailblazer is setting herself to become the role models for both women (and men) to follow. Actress Naomi Yeo is a woman who wears many hats. Not in the literal sense, but metaphorically speaking of course. She is an actress who has appeared on both the silver screens and on TV, a radio deejay at contemporary hit radio station 987FM, a professional host (in the pre-COVID-19 era, of course), a singer, and most recently, a fianc\xe9e to local singer-songwriter Benjamin Kheng. Back in 2012, a young Yeo participated in the 987FM Radio Star competition and she was among the top five finalists. In the following year, she clinched a minor role in the Singaporean musical \x93That Girl in Pinafore\x94 by award-winning Singaporean director Chai Yee Wee. Her debut single, \x93\u7ec6\u6c34\u957f\u6d41\x94, which she had performed in the movie, hit number #1 on iTunes chart of that year. In the following years, Yeo had stints at 987FM radio station and appeared in several of video production company Butterworks\x92 short films. At present, she is represented by FLY Entertainment. In September last year, Yeo and Kheng went public with their relationship. And earlier this year in March, Kheng proposed to the 26-year-old actress while they were on holiday in New Zealand. On the topic of big weddings, she revealed in an interview with Singapore Brides that she prefers a practical, intimate wedding. \x93The magic of a wedding is the gathering of happy hearts and people that have known you through time. Setting up a wedding involves being practical about budgets and what you can achieve with the money you are willing to part with,\x94 she said. \x93Personally, extravagance and big budgets are not in my dictionary, and if it were up to me, I would like to marry the love of my life in a private and intimate setting.\x94 The bilingual host is also quite the fitness enthusiast. On Yeo\x92s Instagram, images of her doing yoga are aplenty. In one, she is seen hanging in mid-air on the harness and doing aerial yoga. And in another, she is seen calming doing the Trikanasana pose on the breakwater in Sydney, Australia. Interestingly, in an interview with The DC Edit, Yeo explains how she often introspects to confront herself and her insecurities. Such enlightening self-confrontation is perhaps what many people should learn and emulate in order to develop on a more personal level. She says, \x93It made me self-evaluate the kind of relationships I\x92ve been having and the kind I\x92d like to have in my future. It was tough confronting myself with some hard honest truths, but there is courage and total freedom when you wholeheartedly believe in your worth!\x94"

The Budget is traditionally presented in Parliament for debate in February, but preparation and consultation usually begin several months beforehand. In a Facebook post, Madam Halimah noted that Monday's discussions centred on Covid-19 and its impact. Apart from the near-term uncertainties brought on by the pandemic, she noted that a key question is whether Covid-19 has fundamentally changed the investment landscape. Other key issues that need to be studied are the structural shifts that Covid-19 has caused to the macroeconomic environment, and how these factors would impact Singapore's long-term investment returns. ""We need a good handle on these issues, as we are effectively spending from our reserves based on these assumptions,"" she said. ""These are tough questions that we need to grapple with. There are no easy answers, but it is my responsibility as custodian of Singapore's past reserves to raise them for discussion,"" added the president. ""I am glad that the Government has also been thinking hard about these same issues."" President Halimah was briefed by Mr Heng, as well as officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment company Temasek on their long-term macroeconomic outlook and the Government's proposed expected long-term real rates of return. The investment entities had earlier discussed these forward projections of the returns with their respective boards, and MOF has reviewed these projections, said Madam Halimah. ""With my concurrence, Government can later apply these rates to relevant assets to derive the Net Investment Return Contribution (NIRC) for use in Budget 2021,"" she added. The net investment returns framework allows the Government to spend up to 50 per cent of the expected long-term investment returns generated by Temasek, GIC and MAS - the three entities tasked to manage Singapore\x92s reserves. The NIRC is the top contributor to the government coffers. Mr Heng told Parliament in October that the design of the framework allows for a stable, sustainable source of income for the Budget, smoothed out over market cycles."

This was Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and National Development Indranee Rajah's assessment of the challenges planners face as they prepare next year's Budget. This year, close to $100 billion was dedicated to Covid-19 support measures over four Budgets - drawing up to $52 billion from the reserves, and leaving a hole of around $74 billion in the state coffers. But going forward, the focus must now be on how to emerge stronger from Covid-19 despite limited resources, said Ms Indranee on Wednesday (Dec 2). She said the Government's top priority is to get out of the crisis and keep everyone safe and healthy. But she noted that the fiscal road ahead will be a tough one. ""In previous years when we might have had budget surpluses, you could think in terms of goodies. ""But next year... it's more in terms of: 'With the resources that we have, how do we use them in the most careful and prudent way such that we get the most out of limited resources?'"" She was addressing 150 Singaporeans at a virtual Singapore Together Emerging Stronger Conversation (ESC) to seek their views and suggestions on next year's Budget. The two-hour session, organised by government feedback unit Reach and the Ministry of Finance, was co-hosted by Reach chairman and Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of National Development Tan Kiat How. Participants discussed how to manage the trade-off between strengthening the economy while keeping the public safe, and how to encourage social responsibility and ensure greater digital inclusion, among other issues. Ms Indranee told reporters a balanced Budget next year will be ""quite hard"" - echoing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's remarks last month that Singapore is unlikely to see a Budget surplus in 2021 given the ongoing economic crisis. She said the Government will have to be prudent, spend where necessary, and ensure good returns on the money that is put in. ""We have to make every dollar count and stretch the dollar."" But while cost management is important, she added that one must also look at the growth side of the equation and find revenue which comes from that growth. ""Growth will only come when you have the economic activity, and at the same time, we have got to balance this with the health and safety part of it,"" she said. This is why the Emerging Stronger Taskforce was formed to chart strategies for Singapore's post-pandemic recovery, she said. Under the task force are seven Alliances for Action (AfAs) - industry-led coalitions tasked to devise ideas and generate jobs in areas such as sustainability, robotics and education technology. Some growth areas she observed are logistics, mergers and acquisitions, and sustainability. In the afternoon, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat met business leaders to discuss how the Government can partner businesses to emerge stronger. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-2021-indranee"

He made the call on Wednesday (Dec 2) when he announced that he and his team had started work on it. This year was challenging for many nations because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which worsened the already grim economic outlook. Mr Heng delivered four Budgets to help Singaporeans cope with the health and financial crises in as many months. He presented the Unity Budget on Feb 18, the Resilience Budget on March 26, the Solidarity Budget on April 6 and the Fortitude Budget on May 26. Altogether, the Covid-19 support measures cost the Government S$93 billion. Of this sum, S$52 billion comes from past reserves. Mr Heng, looking back at the events of the year, exclaimed on Facebook on Wednesday: \x93Never in my life would I have imagined that I would have to present four Budgets in one year!\x94 He added that he had hosted a virtual gathering to thank his Ministry of Finance (MOF) Budget team for their hard work on the Budgets unveiled over the year. Highlighting the support his team gave him, he wrote: \x93They worked on the details of economic and social programmes to support our workers, families and businesses in Singapore in a most challenging year. \x93They have all been working non-stop since the beginning of this year, with the work becoming even heavier and more intense as the global Covid-19 pandemic situation worsened and disrupted life and businesses. My special thanks to my MOF team, and to all staff in our public agencies and partners who have been working so closely with us!\x94 Mr Heng, who added that he was working with fellow ministers Lawrence Wong and Indranee Rajah on the coming Budget, called on Singaporeans to join the effort and share their feedback with his Budget 2021 team. He said: \x93Everyone can play a role \x97 please join us in the Budget 2021 journey by sharing your ideas. The Budget reflects our collective needs and aspirations as a society, and charts our direction as a nation. \x93My team and I value your views and suggestions, so that we can shape Budget 2021 to support our people and businesses, and your hopes and wishes for Singapore. I look forward to everyone\x92s active participation, as part of our #SingaporeTogether movement.\x94 Those who wish to provide input for Budget 2021 may do so here."

There will be live television and radio coverage of the Budget statement, and a live webcast of the delivery will be available on the Singapore Budget website, said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in a press release on Thursday (Dec 31). The full Budget Statement will be published on the Singapore Budget website after delivery, and real-time updates of key Budget announcements can be found on MOF's Facebook page and Twitter account. ""We thank Singaporeans for providing their views, whether online through REACH\x92s Budget 2021 microsite, or in person at settings such as REACH\x92s Listening Points,"" said MOF. Singaporeans can continue to provide their views until Jan 8 next year via the website. MOF said that it is also partnering the People\x92s Association (PA) and its grassroots organisations in their virtual Ask Kopi Kakis #ShareYourViews initiative to seek public views and suggestions. Details of the virtual Ask Kopi Kakis #ShareYourViews engagement platforms can be found online. ""We continue to encourage Singaporeans to share their views and suggestions on issues relevant to Budget 2021,"" said MOF. Mr Heng said in a Facebook post on Thursday that preparations for Budget 2021 is ""well under way"". He added that even though the COVID-19 pandemic has been contained locally and vaccination is ongoing, the overall outlook remains ""highly uncertain""and will be for some time to come. ""Since several years ago, it is almost a 'tradition' to announce the date of the annual Budget around the turn of the year. This year is no different. ""But this year has been far from traditional. Instead of an annual Budget, we had four Budgets and two Ministerial Statements. To support our workers, companies and households through COVID-19, we introduced several rounds of support measures,"" he added. If the trajectory of economic recovery is on track, Mr Heng said Singapore will have a more ""traditional\x94 Budget year. ""But if the situation takes a turn for the worse, we are ready to respond and adapt,"" he said."

Mr Liang Eng Hwa, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance, Trade and Industry, told a pre-Budget round table yesterday: ""I'm a bit more realistic about what to expect for the upcoming Budget because there are only so much financial resources you can use to help."" The Government set aside a $100 billion war chest to tackle the pandemic last year, with most of the funds used to support businesses and save jobs. ""I expect this Budget to be a lot more targeted and differentiated than before, so we really channel and allocate funds to those businesses that need help, grow the economy and create jobs,"" said Mr Liang during the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants round table. ""We'll still have to help, but the numbers will taper off along the way."" Trade association and industry experts said at the virtual event that more can be done to help businesses access existing grants as applications can be cumbersome. Mr Ang Yuit, vice-president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said rental relief measures were a lifeline for firms but took a long time to reach small and medium-sized enterprises. Firms have also said they face a ""laborious and bureaucratic"" process to get support to reskill workers, he said, adding: ""We are concerned that with a slowness in getting that into effect, we'll have people that have to be let go because their skills don't match."" However, less government assistance could actually be a good thing, noted Singapore Retailers Association executive director Rose Tong. She said grants could distract companies from their business objectives as they tailor their goals to meet qualifying criteria: ""This could stifle their authentic growth. Some retailers have also gotten addicted to grants and subsidies such that they may be unwilling to embark on a much-needed transformation initiative should there not be a grant available."""

In the proposal, KPMG stressed the importance of 5G in Singapore's transformation into a smart nation. According to KPMG's partner and head of tax Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, 5G will be a key driver for data consumption and will create demand for innovation in the development of technological platforms. Sanganeria said there is a need for more government support to fast-track 5G development and adoption on a larger scale. KPMG has proposed a 5G technology and innovation fund that provides 50% of expenditure for prototyping and innovation of 5G enabled solutions and to extend the Market Readiness Assistance grant to provide funding for enterprises to explore solutions in 5G-ready markets. Aside from 5G, KPMG said the 2021 budget should also include a Digital Transformation Package that will consist of tax incentives to catalyse business transformation by supporting significant capital outlay and the workforce. Granting a 300% enhanced tax deductions for costs incurred by Singapore companies for the acquisition of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or upgrading of existing systems as well as expanding section 19B of the tax provision to allow writing down allowances on costs incurred on a broader range of intangible assets will help prevent supply chain disruption. The talent landscape should also focus on these technologies by introducing cloud technologies, AI, data analytics, robotics, and 5G at the secondary education level as well as re-skilling/up-skilling workforce in these technologies. Special tax rebates for local professionals in qualifying industries critical to Singapore's economy and ecosystem will also help in the transformation to a smart city. Job and food security The pandemic also showed several weaknesses in food supply chains. KPMG's proposal will encourage urban farming using existing real estate assets whilst maximising current land usage for vertical farming that will create more sustainable sources of protein. Sanganeria said an enhanced R&D Tax Incentive Scheme that includes extending the list of eligible expenditure to capital expenditure on plant and machinery, utilities, as well as to remove the deemed 60% rule on outsourced R&D expenditure will accelerate innovation in these industries. Sanganeria added that land intensification allowance should be extended to agri-tech and aqua-tech industries as well as introduce a new incentive for these industries like a tiered concessionary income tax rates of 5/10% that would be subject to conditions such as production capacity and nutrition value of the food produced. These measures will not only strengthen Singapore's food supply chain, it will also create additional jobs."

The Government will also continue to support workers and businesses, especially those in hard-hit sectors. But Singapore must press on with the economic transformation it started five years ago, he added. He said: ""Covid-19 has accelerated innovation, put a premium on resilience, and greater priority on sustainability. ""There is no turning back the clock. While we deal with the present, we must also prepare our workers and businesses for a different world post-Covid."" He was speaking during a visit to technology firm Durapower's research and development laboratories on Friday. Last year, the Government rolled out an unprecedented five Budgets, committed nearly $100 billion in Covid-19 support measures and drew up to $52 billion from past reserves in order to preserve jobs, support companies and help affected workers. According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry's advance estimates released on Jan 4, Singapore's gross domestic product contracted by 5.8 per cent for the whole of 2020 - an improvement over the ministry's earlier forecast of a contraction of 6.5 per cent to 6 per cent made in November. But while the worst of the fallout has been averted, the road to recovery will be uneven and highly uncertain, said Mr Heng. He added that he will share more on helping workers and businesses to adapt, innovate and grow in his Budget statement on Feb 16. He also outlined initiatives which were launched last year to help workers and businesses emerge stronger - from helping small and medium-sized enterprises and hawkers adopt digital solutions to support for promising start-ups and entrepreneurs. Over 100,000 opportunities have been created for workers through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, and more resources have been set aside to encourage job creation and train Singaporeans to work in new sectors, he said. Some $25 billion has also been committed over the next five years for research, innovation, and enterprise. Mr Heng observed that many companies are adapting and innovating to seek new opportunities during the crisis. ""It is not easy but we must persist. I am fully committed to support these companies through their journey of innovation and transformation,"" he said. ""Together, we can emerge stronger as an economy; together, we can create better jobs for our workers."" DPM Heng Swee Keat on S'pore's need for continued economic transformation post-Covid-19 DPM Heng Swee Keat being given a tour around Durapower's R&D labs There will be live television and radio coverage of the Budget, which will be unveiled in Parliament on Feb 16. A live webcast will also be available on the Singapore Budget website. On Monday, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu announced a Singapore Green Plan 2030 which will set ambitious green goals for each sector. She said that Mr Heng will speak more on the sustainability agenda during the Budget debate."

Ms Indranee, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for National Development, added that the strategy for Budget 2021 will be to make sure that resources are channelled to those who still need help, compared with the broad-based approach at the height of the crisis last year. ""So, some areas are doing well, they probably need less support, but some areas (like) aviation, tourism and so on, will still need some continued... support,"" she added. ""And then on the social side again, some people don't need as much support as others."" She was speaking to reporters after a visit to Kin@11, a programme space in York Hill under the Community Link (ComLink) initiative, which provides proactive and integrated support to an estimated 1,000 low-income families. Her comments come as early signs point to a steady recovery for Singapore, with gross domestic product contracting by a smaller-than-forecasted 5.8 per cent last year, and unemployment rate dropping for two months in a row in November and December last year. But the hardest-hit sectors such as aviation and tourism, for instance, are still in a slump and overall unemployment, at 3.2 per cent in December last year, is still higher than the 2.3 per cent recorded in the same month the year before. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat had said on Friday that a key priority for the Budget will be to continue to support workers and businesses, but that Singapore must press on with economic transformation. Giving a broad overview of the Budget on Saturday, Ms Indranee said it will cover the immediate healthcare issues and vaccination roll-out, social support for the needy, economic transformation and sustainability. ""One of the things about Covid-19 is that it has forced us to rethink how we've been doing things. It has also provided an opportunity to reshape the future. And this Budget will be looking exactly at that. Not just tackling existing problems, (but) how to position for the future and how to grow,"" she added. Ms Indranee also spoke about ComLink as a key strategic part of the Government's efforts to tackle inequality, adding that the initiative brings together government agencies and community partners to provide more comprehensive support to low-income families. ""There are many different partners; what we wanted to make sure was that there were no overlapping services, duplication, and then some people inadvertently left out,"" she said. She added that the Government will be working more closely with the private sector, civil society and social service agencies going forward. Mr Kelvin Chia, who oversees ComLink at Jalan Kukoh, said that since the programme space opened, many volunteer groups have come forward offering classes and services. One such group was Readable. The organisation run by volunteers, which focuses on teaching children in the Jalan Kukoh area to read and count, now holds classes at the premises. Ms Aprizen Yuliana, 37, an Indonsian married to a Singaporean, said her seven-year-old son and five-year-old daughter have benefited from the classes. Her son, who used to run away when asked to read, now enjoys storybooks and even got full marks for his spelling test, she said. \x93I don\x92t speak much English so I can\x92t teach my own children. The Readable classes have really helped them. They are also more confident now and have more friends,\x94 she said, speaking in Bahasa Indonesia. The assistant director of the Social Service Offices in Kreta Ayer and Bukit Merah said: ""That's the way we want it to be, more people joining in this effort to see how we can support a community together."""

On Sunday (Feb 14), Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat penned an appreciation post to his wife, who has had to put up with his busy schedule amid this festive Chinese New Year and Valentine\x92s Day season. Mr Heng, who is also Singapore\x92s Deputy Prime Minister, is in the middle of what for him may be the busiest time of the year, preparing the country\x92s annual budget. On most years, putting the budget together is serious business indeed. And during a pandemic, with all the stressors on the economy, we can only imagine that a great deal of hard work has been done behind the scenes by Mr Heng and his team at the Ministry of Finance (MOF), leading up to Budget Day on Tuesday, Feb 16. Last year, due to the pandemic, the Government rolled out five Budgets to boost the economy and extend aid to those affected. In January, Mr Heng quipped at the The Straits Times Global Outlook Forum that he wished that for this year, there will be only one Budget. And so, while the rest of us were likely celebrating (albeit more low-key this year) Chinese New Year, and enjoying romantic dinners with our significant others, the Minister wrote in a Facebook post that he enjoyed no such luxury. He thanked his wife for her \x93love, strength and support, and for walking the journey of life with me.\x94 And then added, \x93Thank you for your understanding \x97 no long, romantic dinner, as I have to work today \x96 for Budget Day is just two days away!\x94 However, the day did not go without a loving gesture from Mr Heng, who also posted a photo of the bouquet of flowers he sent his wife. \x93During one of my recent walkabouts, I met a second-generation stallholder selling flowers in the market. She showed me the beautiful roses she brought from overseas for Valentine\x92s Day. They were beautiful, and so I ordered some for my wife.\x94 He also thanked the MOF officers and those from other Government agencies who have also had to work over the long holiday weekend. \x93A big thank you to all and your loved ones!,\x94 he wrote. And this busyness during a festive time, apparently, happens regularly. \x93Budget Day usually takes place around mid-February, so that we can complete the entire process in time for the Financial Year, which starts on 1 April. But the consequence is that Budget preparations often overlap with Valentine\x92s Day, and Chinese New Year in some years,\x94 Mr Heng explained, before greeting everyone. \x93I hope that everyone can spend some time with your loved ones, and express your love for people in your life, today and every other day! Happy Valentine\x92s Day!\x94 Mr Heng, 59, has been married to Ms Chang Hwee Nee since 1988. Ms Chang is the CEO of the National Heritage Board. They have two children. /TISG"

Firms in Tier 1 will receive 30 per cent support for wages paid from April to June 2021, and 10 per cent support for wages paid from July to September 2021. For firms in Tier 2 sectors, which include retail, arts and culture, food services and built environment, the JSS payment will be extended for three months, covering 10 per cent of wages paid up to June 2021. Segments like supermarkets, classified as Tier 3B, have been excluded from this group.

As part of this Household Support Package, eligible households will also receive a*GST Voucher - U Save Special Payment that will give utilities rebates of between S$120 and S$200 in 2021.

Many are saying why do we still open up the border for allowing DP and LTVP to enter Singapore but not the ESSENTIAL WORKPASS HOLDERS. The fact is also some of the DP/LTVP not just doing it once, like the recent case in which a DP holder from Indian was allowed to leave once during the earlier period and then returned and not long after that she is again granted to leave and expected to return but unfortunately for her, this last time she was infected with Covid 19. So the question is why do we allow such NON ESSENTIAL foreigners who does not contribute to the country to have free access multiple times. The main concern of Singaporeans is more on why the authorities allow non essential workpass holders and especially the DP and LTVP to enter Singapore during this period. Especially those coming from country with very high infection rate like INDIA, INDIA, INDIA. We all are trying our best to abide by the Covid 19 measures with the CB, wearing mask, restricted gathering, social distancing, etc and play our part to keep Singapore safe but the Govt is the one which does not practice what they have preached. So in short, all DP, STVP and LTVP holders shall not allow to enter Singapore including those NON ESSENTIAL WORKPASS HOLDERS."

Of course, this has major implications at both the micro and macro economic levels. So what she can do is to take a look at economic indicators such as GDP, trade, inflation, purchasing power etc. IF she really wants a number, an indicator of SG's reserves is our official foreign reserves which are disclosed on MAS website (USD, RMB, gold, forex) which are worth a total of 300 billion USD."

Budget 2021: Petrol duty rates raised by up to 15 cents per litre,16-02-2021 06:40 PM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/budget-2021-petrol-duty-rates-raised-up-15-cents-per-litre-6467357.html,132579350,16-02-2021  06:40 PM,"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...cents-14209116 SINGAPORE: Petrol duty rates will be raised by 15 cents per litre for premium petrol from Tuesday (Feb 16), said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. The petrol duty rate for intermediate petrol will also be raised by 10 cents, he announced. Petrol duty was last increased in 2015 when the rates for premium grade petrol and intermediate grade petrol were increased by S$0.20 and S$0.15 per litre, respectively. \x93Usage based tax has helped shape consumer behaviour towards a more efficient use of fuel or environmentally friendly alternatives,\x94 he said in his Budget speech. To ease the transition for Singaporeans, especially those who rely on their vehicles for their livelihood, Mr Heng also announced a slew of road tax rebates. All motorcycles using petrol will receive a 60 per cent road tax rebate for one year, he said. Individual owners of smaller motorcycles of up to 400cc will receive either S$50 or S$80 in cash depending on engine capacity, he added. For active taxi and private hire car drivers using petrol and petrol hybrid vehicles, the budget provides petrol duty rebates of S$360 given out over four months, said Mr Heng. This is on top of a 15 per cent road tax rebate for one year for all taxis and private hire cars using petrol. Goods vehicles and buses using petrol will receive a 100 per cent one-year tax rebate, and cars using petrol will receive a one-year road tax rebate of 15 per cent, he added. All road tax rebates will take effect from August 1, 2021, and will be applicable for one-year until Jul 31, 2022. The additional petrol duty rebates for motorcycles, taxis and private hire cars will be introduced by the middle of 2021, with more details will be released by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in April, Mr Heng said. The road tax rebates and the additional petrol duty rebates will be disbursed automatically to those eligible, and there is no need to apply, said LTA in a separate press release on Tuesday. Taken together, all the road tax measures will offset about one year of petrol duty increases for taxis and motorcycles, and about two years for commercial vehicles and cars, he added. With the 15 per cent road tax rebate for cars, the minimum road tax payment for petrol and petrol-hybrid off-peak cars and revised off-peak cars will be reduced from S$50 to S$43 and from S$70 to S$60 respectively between Aug 1 and Jul 31, 2022, said LTA in the media release. The road tax payable for petrol and petrol-hybrid Classic cars will be reduced from $280 to $238. With the 60 per cent road tax rebate for motorcycles, the road tax payable for petrol and petrol-hybrid classic motorcycles will be reduced from $280 to $112. Most of the expected revenue increase from the petrol duty changes in the coming year will be given out through the offsets, estimated to cost S$113 million, said Mr Heng. \x93Climate change is real and urgent. We must act now. Behavioural changes take time.\x94 The COVID-19 pandemic has given Singapore an opportunity to change work and travel habits as remote working arrangements become more common, he added. \x93We must lock in these behavioural shifts. A car-lite society will continue to be our main goal. Public transport is, after all, the cleanest and most energy efficient mode of transport,\x94 said Mr Heng. The Government will be spending more than S$60 billion within this decade to expand and renew Singapore\x92s rail network, he added. \x93Overall, these measures will work towards reshaping our transport footprint, towards cleaner transport.\x94"

ERP rates at those gantries will be adjusted by S$1 with effect from Feb 22. ERP charges will be reintroduced at three gantries on the AYE after Jurong Town Hall towards the city, on the KPE (ECP) after Defu Flyover and on the southbound CTE auxiliary lane to PIE (Changi). Charges will also be adjusted by S$1 at the gantry on the southbound CTE before Braddell Road and the set of four gantries along the CTE after Braddell Road and PIE slip road into the CTE. The new rates will take effect during the specified time periods from Feb 22: Rates for other time periods at previously announced gantries will remain unchanged, LTA added. ""There continue to be no ERP charges on other expressways and arterial roads,"" the authority said. ERP charges were first suspended on April 6 on the expectation that traffic would be significantly reduced during the circuit breaker period. LTA reintroduced ERP charges at some gantries along the CTE in July and August, following the end of the circuit breaker. LTA said its monitoring of traffic conditions in January showed that traffic speeds have ""remained optimal on all arterial roads and most expressways, except for some time periods on the AYE, CTE and KPE"". ""As more people travel to and from their workplaces, traffic volume has been building up during weekday peak hours. This has led to congestion at specific locations along the AYE, CTE and KPE during peak periods,"" said LTA. LTA said it would continue to monitor traffic speeds and congestion levels closely and assess if ERP rates need to be further adjusted. CNA"

Naming Tuesday's Budget the Emerging Stronger Together Budget, Mr Heng said in a Facebook post that Singapore will need to find new ways to work together, innovate and \x93transform our economy\x94. \x93We must strengthen our social compact and support one another, especially those with greater needs. On this little red dot, we must strengthen efforts to tackle climate change, and build a sustainable home for generations to come,\x94 said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister. \x93Importantly, we must continue to be prudent in our spending, and leave a better future for our children.\x94 Singapore must continue to stay vigilant, even as the country has moved into Phase 3 of its reopening and vaccination is under way. \x93As COVID-19 has accelerated changes and created new ones, we must also navigate these shifts to thrive in a post-COVID world. Our ability to plan ahead, even in the midst of a crisis, has been the hallmark of the Singapore Story,\x94 said Mr Heng. After a pandemic-hit 2020, Singapore will be ending the financial year with a record Budget deficit. But thanks to past reserves that earlier generations have built up, the country has been able to fund the deficit by \x93opening the national safe three times\x94, said Mr Heng, adding that the country\x92s fiscal situation will \x93continue to be tight in the coming years"". The Government drew an unprecedented S$52 billion from the reserves last year. Mr Heng said he met an elderly man in his 70s during a visit to Bedok recently who told him that the Budget \x93should not be about goodies\x94, but that it was more important to invest in building up people\x92s abilities and enabling them to do better. \x93Shared values such as this \x96 the desire to build on what we inherit and pass on something better to the next generation \x96 are what bind us together as a people,\x94 said Mr Heng. \x93Indeed, we can take heart that through this crisis, we have built deeper social reserves \x97 united in purpose, standing in solidarity with one another, and facing difficulties with resilience and fortitude.\x94 The Government pushed out four Budgets last year as the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic became clear. Including two supplementary budgets, close to S$100 billion was spent on support measures for businesses and individuals, and to deal with the pandemic. The Budget Speech will be broadcast live on CNA\x92s YouTube channel, Facebook page and website, as well as on Channel 5, CNA938 and Mediacorp\x92s MeWatch interactive service on Tuesday. A live webcast of the Budget Speech will be available on the Singapore Budget website and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Facebook page. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...nding-14202278"

Naming Tuesday's Budget the Emerging Stronger Together Budget, Mr Heng said in a Facebook post that Singapore will need to find new ways to work together, innovate and \u201ctransform our economy\u201d. \u201cWe must strengthen our social compact and support one another, especially those with greater needs. On this little red dot, we must strengthen efforts to tackle climate change, and build a sustainable home for generations to come,\u201d said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister. \u201cImportantly, we must continue to be prudent in our spending, and leave a better future for our children.\u201d Singapore must continue to stay vigilant, even as the country has moved into Phase 3 of its reopening and vaccination is under way. \u201cAs COVID-19 has accelerated changes and created new ones, we must also navigate these shifts to thrive in a post-COVID world. Our ability to plan ahead, even in the midst of a crisis, has been the hallmark of the Singapore Story,\u201d said Mr Heng. After a pandemic-hit 2020, Singapore will be ending the financial year with a record Budget deficit. But thanks to past reserves that earlier generations have built up, the country has been able to fund the deficit by \u201copening the national safe three times\u201d, said Mr Heng, adding that the country\u2019s fiscal situation will \u201ccontinue to be tight in the coming years"". The Government drew an unprecedented S$52 billion from the reserves last year. Mr Heng said he met an elderly man in his 70s during a visit to Bedok recently who told him that the Budget \u201cshould not be about goodies\u201d, but that it was more important to invest in building up people\u2019s abilities and enabling them to do better. \u201cShared values such as this \u2013 the desire to build on what we inherit and pass on something better to the next generation \u2013 are what bind us together as a people,\u201d said Mr Heng. \u201cIndeed, we can take heart that through this crisis, we have built deeper social reserves \u2014 united in purpose, standing in solidarity with one another, and facing difficulties with resilience and fortitude.\u201d The Government pushed out four Budgets last year as the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic became clear.

Revenue declined nearly 18 per cent to S$270.8 million, because of the absence of a trade show and lower sales as a result of the restrictions on movement imposed by the government during the year to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, Challenger reported blowout earnings of 6.73 cents per share - up 32 per cent versus the 5.11 cents per share it reported for FY2019. Profit before tax from continuing operations increased by almost S$5.6 million to more than S$26.8 million. What accounted for the company' s sharply increased profitability? In a nutshell, it was the result of the government' s efforts last year to shield businesses and their employees from the fallout of the pandemic. Challenger reported "" sundry income"" of nearly S$5.1 million for FY2020, which is some S$4.8 million more than S$0.2 million it reported for the previous year. The company said this was mainly attributable to "" receipts of government grants"" . In its half-year financial report, Challenger indicated that these grants related to the Job Support Scheme (JSS) as well as the Wage Credit Scheme. Challenger also reported a more than S$4.7 million decline in "" premises expenses"" to slightly more than S$12.9 million in FY2020. The company said this was mainly the result of "" rental waivers and rebates"" . Shareholders of Challenger are directly benefiting from the Covid-19 subsidy and support windfall from the government. The company has said it will hike its dividend to 2.7 cents per share for FY2020, up from the 1.5 cents per share it paid out for FY2019. In absolute terms, Challenger will be paying out over S$9.3 million in dividends with respect to FY2020. This is S$4.1 million more than the nearly S$5.2 million it paid with respect to FY2019. Shares in Challenger have jumped 12.5 per cent since the company reported its full-year numbers and announced the higher dividend. The stock closed Friday at 54 cents. Big government support Challenger' s strong FY2020 earnings report is a cautionary tale about the dangers of trying to shield every corner of the economy from the Covid-19 fallout. It also underscores why the enormous fiscal measures the government rushed to introduce last year should not continue for much longer - besides being unsustainable, these measures may well be excessively benefiting some segments of the corporate sector. Unlike most recessions, which tend to be preceded by a period of excessive consumption or over-investment, the economic slump last year was caused by curbs on movement and human interaction to prevent the spread of Covid-19. So, rather than trying to jumpstart demand, the government focused on subsidising business costs. The idea was to help companies keep their doors open and their workers employed, so that business could restart quickly once Covid-19 was under control. The Ministry of Finance said in a report last week that grants received by firms in 2020 topped S$27.4 billion, up from S$1.5 billion in 2019. The biggest driver of this increase was the JSS, where the government co-funds 25 per cent to 75 per cent of the first S$4,600 of each local employee' s gross monthly pay. From April to December 2020, a total of S$22.6 billion was disbursed under the JSS, the report said. Attempted privatisation Challenger deserved the help it received from the government as much as any other consumer electronics retailer. When the pandemic hit last year, it would have been unclear to the company as well as the government exactly how badly its revenues and earnings would be affected. Moreover, the company was already struggling in the face of disruption in the retailing sector. In 2019, the controlling Loo family and a private equity fund run by Dymon Asia Capital attempted to take Challenger private at 56 cents per share, stating that the company needed to make changes to its business that might affect its dividends. The offer was rebuffed by minority shareholders who understood the value of the company. Challenger is arguably one of the most successful homegrown retailing companies in Singapore, and it has an impressive track record of profitability. Despite the retailing sector facing technological disruption, the company is hardly in financial straits. While the company has been struggling to grow its revenue, its return on equity (ROE) averaged 19 per cent during the five years to FY2019. For FY2020, with the Covid-19 support measures, its ROE came in at nearly 21 per cent. The healthy ROEs are all the more impressive given the huge - and increasing - amount of cash on its books. At the end of FY2018, Challenger had a net cash position of S$63.2 million. This cash pile expanded to nearly S$77.9 million at the end of FY2019, and to almost S$85.8 million at the end of FY2020. Challenger' s net cash holdings are now equivalent to more than 46 per cent of its market capitalisation. Fiscal pullback With governments around the world gradually learning to manage Covid-19 infection rates, many investors appear to be positioning themselves to ride a strong recovery in economic activity in 2021. Against that backdrop, analysts are expecting the Singapore government to adjust its Covid-19 measures in the Budget this week, narrowing direct fiscal support to only the most hard-hit segments of the economy - such as tourism and travel. Some analysts also see the government augmenting the social safety net for Singaporeans struggling to find work, as well as reinforcing efforts to drive industry transformation and staking out promising new fields for future economic growth. UOB Global Economics & Markets Research estimates that Budget 2021 will see an overall deficit of S$12.5 billion (or 2.5 per cent of GDP), versus a deficit of S$74.2 billion (or 15.3 per cent of GDP) last year. What will this fiscal pullback mean for the local corporate sector? Logically, as life gets back to normal in 2021, corporate revenues should rebound. The big question is whether these revenues will rise sufficiently to offset the negative impact of the expiry of enormous subsidies like the JSS on corporate earnings. *For Challenger, ironically, its earnings, even in the event of a very strong economic recovery ahead, might well not match what it achieved with the Covid-19 support measures last year.*"

"Covid-19 payouts helped Trans-Cab taxi driver feed family, pay bills",12-02-2021 11:28 AM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/covid-19-payouts-helped-trans-cab-taxi-driver-feed-family-pay-bills-6464419.html,132489784,12-02-2021  11:28 AM,"Trans-Cab taxi driver Steven Chua's daily earnings fell from $200 to $80 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, barely enough to cover his costs. But with assistance from several Covid-19 budget measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, the father of three managed to tide over the tough time. The help included the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, which provided self-employed people with three quarterly cash payouts of $3,000 each, and the Workfare Special Payment, a $3,000 cash payout for lower-income workers. Last April, at the start of the circuit breaker, the 54-year-old drove 14 hours a day, up from the 11 hours previously. The roads were empty, recalled Mr Chua, who once drove for three hours without any passenger. ""I just went round and round, hoping someone would board my taxi,"" said the taxi driver of 18 years. To get by, Mr Chua, who is also general secretary of the National Taxi Association, took on a temporary job to help manage operations at a migrant workers' dormitory from April to July. He had to don personal protective equipment when carrying out duties such as distributing meals. ""I was worried about getting the virus, but I had no choice because I needed to support my family,"" said Mr Chua, who returned to driving his taxi last July. His 36-year-old homemaker wife and three children aged 11 to 15 had to scrimp and save too. ""We cut down on the number of dishes at every meal and ate more rice,"" said Mr Chua, who lives in a five-room flat in Jurong West. ""We also used the fans at home instead of switching on the air-con."" With the payouts from the assistance schemes, he settled the family's outstanding bills and kept some money for the months ahead. ""If not for the help, we wouldn't even have food on the table,"" said Mr Chua. Now, he drives 11 hours daily and earns about $150 a day before deducting for costs like fuel. ""I am now just living day by day,"" he said. ""I hope that things will get better in the coming months."" https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...mily-pay-bills"

The interim assessment of the impact of key COVID-19 Budget measures found that the Singapore economy could have shrunk 12.4 per cent or more last year. Singapore's GDP fell by 5.8 per cent in 2020, based on advance estimates. Using a simulation model, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) estimated that last year's five Budgets costing about S$100 billion supported GDP growth by 5.5 percentage points. The easing of monetary policy pushed up the GDP by a further 1.1 percentage points - shaving 6.6 percentage points off GDP decline. ""The COVID-19 support measures have made a significant difference to keep our people safe and preserve our livelihoods,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Thursday at the Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa, where he spoke to hotel staff and some beneficiaries of COVID-19 Budget schemes. ""Job losses were averted and shocks were cushioned. More help went to supporting families in need, which went some way to mitigate inequality. ""The interim analysis is encouraging, as it showed that the schemes are achieving the outcomes that they were designed for."" The Budget measures, including the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), may have helped save or create about 155,000 jobs on average over 2020 and 2021, MOF said. From April to December last year, S$22.6 billion was paid out in wage support for Singaporean workers to firms under JSS. The payouts accounted for about 80 per cent of grants to businesses in 2020. The Government has also introduced measures to help create jobs and match jobseekers with work and training opportunities. The SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package placed nearly 76,000 local jobseekers in growth sectors such as ICT, healthcare and manufacturing, MOF said. The take-up rate for the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI), which was introduced later in the year, was encouraging, the ministry said. JGI supports firms that create new jobs by co-paying a portion of the salaries of new local hires for one year. In September and October, 110,000 jobseekers were hired under the scheme by 26,000 employers. In all, companies received S$27.4 billion in grants to stay afloat. Smaller firms and firms in sectors most affected by the pandemic received more support, MOF said. Singapore companies also benefitted from financing schemes, with around 20,000 firms accessing loans worth more than S$17 billion from March to December last year. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...onomy-14168694"

Man jailed for stealing Budget 2020 grocery vouchers from neighbour's unsecured letterbox,08-02-2021 04:20 PM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/man-jailed-stealing-budget-2020-grocery-vouchers-neighbours-unsecured-letterbox-6462209.html,132426359,08-02-2021  04:20 PM,"A man was jailed for seven days on Monday (Feb 8) for stealing his neighbour's Budget 2020 grocery vouchers after noticing that his letterbox was not closed properly. Zamri Mohamed Ali, 43, pleaded guilty to one charge of stealing 30 vouchers worth S$10 each, which were meant to offset household expenses for needy Singaporeans during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vouchers, announced as part of Budget 2020, are for needy adult Singaporeans living in one- and two-room HDB flats and who do not own more than one property. The court heard that Zamri lived with his 37-year-old girlfriend, co-accused Farahdillah Ibrahim, in a flat in Aljunied Crescent. Farahdillah and Zamri each received their allocated grocery vouchers via Zamri's letterbox sometime before early October last year. At about 7pm on Oct 9 last year, Zamri checked his letterbox at the void deck as he was expecting a delivery, but did not find anything. As he closed the flap to his letterbox, he saw that his neighbour's letterbox was not closed properly. He tapped the letterbox, opening it, and flipped through the letters inside, hoping to find some grocery vouchers as he knew the residents in his block of flats were likely to receive them. He saw two white envelopes with the words ""On Government Service"" and knew that they contained the vouchers as they were similar to his own. Zamri pocketed the two envelopes, which were addressed to two of his neighbours, and noticed that there were serial numbers on the vouchers. Knowing that he would get caught the moment he used the vouchers, Zamri decided to use his own vouchers on household items first. His girlfriend used six of the stolen vouchers at a supermarket on Oct 12, 2020, and closed-circuit television footage showed her returning to Zamri's home. The victim lodged a police report the next day, saying that he had not received his grocery vouchers and found out that they had already been used. When Farahdillah returned to the supermarket and tried to use two more vouchers, they were rejected. She was later nabbed along with Zamri, and 24 vouchers were recovered from Zamri's flat. Zamri is the latest to be jailed over a spate of grocery vouchers released as part of Budget 2020. A man was jailed for four weeks last month for similar crimes - he had used the stolen vouchers to buy groceries and burnt the remainder as offerings to his late wife. A woman admitted last month to using an improvised device made of a pen, a fishing hook and sticky tape to steal such vouchers from letterboxes. She is set to be sentenced later this month. For theft, Zamri could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, or both. CNA has contacted the Attorney-General's Chambers about the status of Farahdillah's case. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...ailed-14137736"

The survey of 916 citizens conducted by market research consultancy Blackbox Research shows that 75 per cent of respondents said they preferred Heng, while 25 per cent said they preferred Chan. Heng, 57, was appointed as the ruling People\x92s Action Party\x92s (PAP) first assistant secretary general, after a meeting of the party\x92s Central Executive Committee (CEC) on 23 November last year. Chan, 49, was also appointed as the PAP\x92s second assistant secretary general at the meeting. Following the appointments, Heng is now considered the leading candidate to succeed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who turns 67 in February. Speaking to Singapore media on 1 December 2018 on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) Leaders\x92 Summit in Buenos Aires, Lee said the 4G ministers have decided Heng is their leader, and PAP MPs have also endorsed the decision. Lee, however, didn\x92t confirm to the reporters that Heng would take over his post. But in a statement to The Economist more than two weeks later, Singapore\x92s High Commissioner to the UK Foo Chi Hsia made the first explicit official acknowledgement that Heng will be the country\x92s next leader. Foo said in the statement on 18 December 2018, \x93The ruling party has indeed settled on Heng Swee Keat as its next leader\x85 Provided the party wins the people\x92s support in the next general election, due by April 2021, Mr Heng will take over from Lee Hsien Loong as prime minister.\x94 The majority of those polled in the Blackbox survey \x96 62 per cent \x96 said they were happy with either Heng or Chan as the next prime minister. Just 38 per cent said they would prefer someone else. On their impressions of the two men, 60 per cent of respondents said they viewed Heng positively. In comparison, 44 per cent of them had either a \x93quite positive\x94 or a \x93very positive\x94 impression of Chan. Just 17 per cent had a negative view of Heng, while 27 per cent had a \x93quite negative\x94 or \x93very negative\x94 impression of Chan. About a quarter of respondents had no opinions of Heng and Chan, at 22 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. The Blackbox survey was conducted from 14 to 26 December last year. Those aged 50 and above accounted for 40 per cent of the respondents, 28 per cent came from the 35 to 49 age category, and 24 per cent were from the 25 to 34 age group. Those in the 15 to 24 age group comprised 8 per cent of the respondents. The poll also addressed further questions about Heng, as well as the legacy of Lee Kuan Yew. Yahoo News Singapore will release the findings over several days. https://sg.news.yahoo.com/three-time...230038543.html Like a boss."

A survey was conducted to guess who was the minister who had such empathy, many voted ccs. This shows that ccs was indeed viewed positively at that time. After lky's passing, both hotshots were pulled down immediately with targeted online campaigns against them, particularly ccs with many ""leaks"".

The Government will also continue to support workers and businesses, especially those in hard-hit sectors. But Singapore must press on with the economic transformation it started five years ago, he added. He said: ""Covid-19 has accelerated innovation, put a premium on resilience, and greater priority on sustainability. ""There is no turning back the clock. While we deal with the present, we must also prepare our workers and businesses for a different world post-Covid."" He was speaking during a visit to technology firm Durapower's research and development laboratories on Friday. Last year, the Government rolled out an unprecedented five Budgets, committed nearly $100 billion in Covid-19 support measures and drew up to $52 billion from past reserves in order to preserve jobs, support companies and help affected workers. According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry's advance estimates released on Jan 4, Singapore's gross domestic product contracted by 5.8 per cent for the whole of 2020 - an improvement over the ministry's earlier forecast of a contraction of 6.5 per cent to 6 per cent made in November. But while the worst of the fallout has been averted, the road to recovery will be uneven and highly uncertain, said Mr Heng. He added that he will share more on helping workers and businesses to adapt, innovate and grow in his Budget statement on Feb 16. He also outlined initiatives which were launched last year to help workers and businesses emerge stronger - from helping small and medium-sized enterprises and hawkers adopt digital solutions to support for promising start-ups and entrepreneurs. Over 100,000 opportunities have been created for workers through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, and more resources have been set aside to encourage job creation and train Singaporeans to work in new sectors, he said. Some $25 billion has also been committed over the next five years for research, innovation, and enterprise. Mr Heng observed that many companies are adapting and innovating to seek new opportunities during the crisis. ""It is not easy but we must persist. I am fully committed to support these companies through their journey of innovation and transformation,"" he said. ""Together, we can emerge stronger as an economy; together, we can create better jobs for our workers."" DPM Heng Swee https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ity-for-budget"

Military coup likely to damage Myanmar's economy Companies say the coup has already put billions worth of foreign investment at risk. The  US has already said it is considering imposing additional sanctions on  Myanmar, which is one of the region's poorest countries. However, the impact of US sanctions could be limited because most of the country's investment comes from Asia. According  to the World Bank, Singapore was the largest foreign investor in  Myanmar last year, accounting for 34% of overall approved investment. Hong Kong was the second largest investor with 26%."

Property owners will only cut when necessary and when they are forced to if there are no tenants. Why would a property owner cut if his rental is more or less secured due to contractual terms? Similarly, if rentals are going up year on year, would a tenant stupidly tell the owner that he is willing to pay more even though under contract he is only required to pay $X? Contract up then say."

Shares of commercial developers and real estate investment trusts have fallen since authorities announced last month that working from home will remain the default arrangement. The government is trying to minimize the risk of transmission at offices after some cases in the workplace led to community clusters. The move adds to headwinds for developers and REITs, amid questions over what the future holds for offices worldwide even after the pandemic. It will be harder to lease out vacancies and there will be pressure to lower rents if the work-from-home arrangement persists, said Terence Chua, an analyst at Phillip Securities Research Pte. \x93The new default will cast a pall over occupancies going forward,\x94 said Justin Tang, the head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. Mapletree Commercial Trust, which owns Singapore\x92s largest mall VivoCity and a nearby office building in its portfolio, has fallen 2.3% since the Jan. 22 announcement. Far East Hospitality Trust has dropped 3.3% while Frasers Hospitality Trust has slid 5.7%. Keppel REIT has gained less than 1%. Market sentiment has been further dampened by Singapore\x92s two largest listed developers -- CapitaLand Ltd. and City Developments Ltd. -- announcing they expect to report full-year losses. Both stocks fell more than 3% last week. A Mapletree spokesperson said the company is monitoring the situation and declined to comment further. A representative for Far East Hospitality Trust said that work-from-home arrangements have a greater impact on the office and retail sectors than hospitality, \x93which is more dependent on the recovery in inbound travel.\x94 Buildings are already facing lower rents. Prime grade office rents in the Raffles Place and Marina Bay precincts shrank about 10% in 2020, according to Knight Frank. The real estate consultancy expects Singapore office rents to decline around 5% in 2021 before bottoming out and recovering next year, it said in a quarterly report. Under Singapore rules, no more than half of an entity\x92s employees can be in the office at any point and employers must ensure their staff continue to work from home for at least half the working time. In a written parliamentary response on Monday, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said the long-term impact of work-from-home on office demand remains to be seen as the pandemic evolves. Occupied office space increased in the last quarter of 2020 from the previous three months, while vacancy rates fell slightly, he said. \x93The government will continue to monitor the market, and calibrate the supply of commercial properties if needed,\x94 Chan said. Downsizing Space Even as global tech behemoths expand their footprint in Singapore, its office market has already seen companies like Citigroup Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. trim space. Tenants are looking to downsize their hub spaces and are less willing to commit to longer-term leases, said Jennifer Chia, a partner at TSMP Law Corp. who heads the corporate real estate as well as banking and finance practices. Some remain optimistic that the market will pick up. Despite the lengthened work-from-home arrangement, CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust has seen more leasing inquiries over the past few months, largely from the financial sector, a spokesperson said. Companies may eventually adopt flexible or hybrid working solutions, and accommodating them will ensure the relevance of the office workspace, the CICT spokesperson said. Frasers Property Ltd. hasn\x92t seen any significant change to the performance of its Singapore commercial properties, as tenants progressively return to the office, a company spokesperson said. The firm aims to provide flexible solutions to complement physical spaces. Keppel REIT is looking at the potential for more flexible lease structures that would benefit both tenant and landlord, a spokesperson said. About 40% of its tenants are back in its Singapore office buildings and the company is seeing rental gains. Allowing more people to return to the workplace will boost business activity, support the economy and improve office demand, the spokesperson said. Major Singapore REITs could raise office rents for leases expiring this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Patrick Wong and Kristy Hung. An improving employment outlook and supply withdrawal for redevelopment could support a rental recovery, they wrote last week. \x93While office REITS and developers will feel the pinch in the short term, the innovative ones are using this opportunity to pivot to the office hub of the future,\x94 Chia said. \x93Industry players who are less able to reinvent themselves and those who do not have the resources to make the switch will be the biggest losers.\x94 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/artic...rnd=markets-vp"

Their politics ish very chaotic and also corrupt one so very hard for them to push through policies regardless ish good or bad. And since information ish harder to control in a democratic system, thus even if can manipulate small groups here and there but it make it very hard for them to brainwash the whole populace to make scarification for a common goal also since opponents can easily make use of the same system to spread the anti-propaganda message. So this fragmented their politics and supporters into many different factions even within a same party. Their caste system also limited their talent pools as opportunity tend to be given only to those with better status, those with lower social status really got mountains of knife to climb and sea of fire to swim just to seek success, be it financially or academic or career. This kind of elitist system maybe workable to maintain status quo but ish not very good in helping to progress their country one. Totalitarian system might be worst but usually this ish under a beh kan leadership then the system will up lorry. But if the leadership ish strong normally totalitarian system ish far more efficient and effective in pushing policies, regardless good or bad, and also brainwashing and controlling their populace. So when the leadership ish very strong and capable, a totalitarian country can grow very fast and furious one. So not really a surprise or abnormality for CCP under the previous few leaderships ish able to win India in the previous rat races. But going forward hard to say liao that India will lose the race again, as winnie ish not really a capable leaders. He ish just ruthless enough to secure his own power nia but so far his plan to achieve supremacy for himself had backfired and yet it seem that he cannot be removed from power despise his error so doubt the future of AT land ish looking good. So this ish definitely a chance for India to catch up, no matter who corrupt and inefficient the India current governing system and society ish. Cause as long as they can continue to attract AMDK $$$ to flow into India instead of AT land, then will see a lot of improvement\\reform for sure one in their politics, their infrastructure, their economy\\industry and also their education system as long as India govt allowed these changes to take place. Just not sure how much this can change their caste system nia."

Not to mentioned the west trying to hinder CN progress in many ways. So, would like to think CN have it even more challenging, even more obstacles for it than IN along the way, where IN have more support from the west, or ang-mor rather. Yet it didn't stop CN from progressing very fast. Thus would like to think that there is more to it than population control with CN success. CN have a way more efficient system than IN. Although CN have its fair share of mistakes also, but its able to overcome it fast, make changes and progress ahead."

Their politics ish very chaotic and also corrupt one so very hard for them to push through policies regardless ish good or bad. And since information ish harder to control in a democratic system, thus even if can manipulate small groups here and there but it make it very hard for them to brainwash the whole populace to make scarification for a common goal also since opponents can easily make use of the same system to spread the anti-propaganda message. So this fragmented their politics and supporters into many different factions even within a same party. Their caste system also limited their talent pools as opportunity tend to be given only to those with better status, those with lower social status really got mountains of knife to climb and sea of fire to swim just to seek success, be it financially or academic or career. This kind of elitist system maybe workable to maintain status quo but ish not very good in helping to progress their country one. Totalitarian system might be worst but usually this ish under a beh kan leadership then the system will up lorry. But if the leadership ish strong normally totalitarian system ish far more efficient and effective in pushing policies, regardless good or bad, and also brainwashing and controlling their populace. So when the leadership ish very strong and capable, a totalitarian country can grow very fast and furious one. So not really a surprise or abnormality for CCP under the previous few leaderships ish able to win India in the previous rat races. But going forward hard to say liao that India will lose the race again, as winnie ish not really a capable leaders. He ish just ruthless enough to secure his own power nia but so far his plan to achieve supremacy for himself had backfired and yet it seem that he cannot be removed from power despise his error so doubt the future of AT land ish looking good. So this ish definitely a chance for India to catch up, no matter who corrupt and inefficient the India current governing system and society ish. Cause as long as they can continue to attract AMDK $$$ to flow into India instead of AT land, then will see a lot of improvement\\reform for sure one in their politics, their infrastructure, their economy\\industry and also their education system as long as India govt allowed these changes to take place.
