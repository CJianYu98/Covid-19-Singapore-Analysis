Don\u2019t anyhow! https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-covid-19-task Singapore GE2020: Lawrence Wong refutes SDP chair Paul Tambyah's remarks on Covid-19 task force as 'baseless and false' SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has rebutted remarks by Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah that the multi-ministry Covid-19 task force did not rely on the advice of medical experts in its work. Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions. ""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."""

Don\x92t anyhow! https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-covid-19-task Singapore GE2020: Lawrence Wong refutes SDP chair Paul Tambyah's remarks on Covid-19 task force as 'baseless and false' SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has rebutted remarks by Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah that the multi-ministry Covid-19 task force did not rely on the advice of medical experts in its work. Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions. ""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."" In before PAP IBs reply Then can PAP Minister Lawrence Wong disclose the doctors names? How come PAP always practice no blame culture? No accountability at all. Dont hide behind anonymity. Like SGH Hepatitis C outbreak which caused 8 deaths, PAP Health Minister Gan Kim Yong refused to disclose the lapses in Parliament (so that deceased families cannot sue SGH for medical negligence). Gan Kim Yong also refused to disclose the names of SGH management and staff involved in the lapses (no blame culture)."

If we extrapolate from this, we don't need goverment and ministers at all, just expert panels. Ultimately, at the end of the day, even when experts give advise the  decision makers in the task force can override and implement their decisions.  This is why they have their roles to evaluate and balance out other non-field of  expertise considerations (economy, social impact etc...) In this case, the Task Force also picks and chooses what experts they want to listen to as well. It is not uncommon to have dissenting advise from experts in every field. There were at least 4 doctors' advice to mask up have also been deliberately refuted by the Task Force: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ld-wear-a-mask . That response by the Task Force was way back in Feb 12. They made a decision then and they acknowledge that decision made back then. Or perhaps they had expert advice when making the statement ""Coronavirus not as bad as SARS"" back in Jan. I'm speculating they made that masks for healthy decision not to create an even worse mask shortage as the manufacturing situation was dire then with China still under lockdown and it is more critical to supply medical staff. Just stand by your decision and we can move back on to fighting COVID pls."

This is why they have their roles to evaluate and balance out other non-field of  expertise considerations (economy, social impact etc...) In this case, the Task Force also picks and chooses what experts they want to listen to as well. It is not uncommon to have dissenting advise from experts in every field. There were at least 4 doctors' advice to mask up have also been deliberately refuted by the Task Force: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ld-wear-a-mask . That response by the Task Force was way back in Feb 12. They made a decision then and they acknowledge that decision made back then. Or perhaps they had expert advice when making the statement ""Coronavirus not as bad as SARS"" back in Jan. I'm speculating they made that masks for healthy decision not to create an even worse mask shortage as the manufacturing situation was dire then with China still under lockdown and it is more critical to supply medical staff.

""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."" Doctors just thrown under the bus.."

Right now we have to count on is common sense and best practices based upon what we know and info from similar past breakouts. I believe back then we were still in the 100% total isolation mode with limited testing capacity that's why they were adamant against flooding our hospital full just to keep public construction going. Earlier detection could have led to faster measures then to prevent explosion in so many dormitories. Again, this was not acknowledged and they could have decided to switch to dorm isolation. Furthermore, the seeds of this problem was planted even further way back with overcrowded dorms which already has seen past outbreaks.

Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."" This is even worse. Why are our ministers following medical experts and not make decision on its own? Just like the WHO. Say don't wear mask, then we don't wear mask."

Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions.

That would not be ideal,\x94 she said at the market in Jalan Besar GRC, where she is anchoring the People's Action Party's team. But LW says it was not a MOM decision. LW says ""doctors and experts (which I assume means MOH) requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers"".

LW should talk to JT and get their stories straight. Who is responsible for the decision? MOM or MOH? Anyway, to me, it doesn't matter. PAP is responsible. If JT is right, then PAP is so incompetent that they can't even manage testing FW safely. Instead, they left the FW - many of whom were infected - to further spread the infection for weeks. PAP couldn't come up with a plan to test all the FW safely? What? The ""great"" PAP couldn't manage this? How many FW are there anyway? 1 million? 5 million? 10 million? If you can't come up with a plan to manage and safely test all FW, then just resign and let someone competent do it. As for LW statement, I don't like people passing the buck. Instead of debating whether MOM or MOH is responsible, the minister should just accept responsibility on behalf of the multi-disciplinary task force. Or, GKY should have accepted responsibility.

Don\x92t anyhow! https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-covid-19-task Singapore GE2020: Lawrence Wong refutes SDP chair Paul Tambyah's remarks on Covid-19 task force as 'baseless and false' SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has rebutted remarks by Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah that the multi-ministry Covid-19 task force did not rely on the advice of medical experts in its work. Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions. ""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."" Pls name all these doctors and experts so we can avoid them in future and their descendants and ancestors will know who bring glory to them for all 18th generations! Lol"

Don\u2019t anyhow! https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-covid-19-task Singapore GE2020: Lawrence Wong refutes SDP chair Paul Tambyah's remarks on Covid-19 task force as 'baseless and false' SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has rebutted remarks by Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah that the multi-ministry Covid-19 task force did not rely on the advice of medical experts in its work. Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions. ""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts REQUESTED MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."" Doctors or experts can make recommendations, but it is the decision maker (in this case, MINISTER Josephine Teo) who decide whether to adopt the recommendations or not. Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making We don't pay minister millions for them to collate request (a secretary could do that). We pay minister millions for them to MAKE DECISION."

""If this portable device works, we may then distribute it to everyone in Singapore,"" he said. ""And I believe this will be more inclusive, and it will ensure that all of us will be protected."" Dr Balakrishnan was responding to a question by Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC Vikram Nair, who had asked if there were plans to make it mandatory for people to download the TraceTogether contact tracing app. The app sends Bluetooth signals to each other when in close proximity, making it easier for authorities to conduct contact tracing when a user tests positive for COVID-19. A total of 1.5 million users have downloaded the app, about one-fifth of Singapore's population. Dr Balakrishnan called this figure ""encouraging"", given that downloading the app is voluntary. However, Dr Balakrishnan said the Government has decided not to make the download of TraceTogether compulsory as it does not work equally well across different smartphone operating systems. Apple's iOS suspends Bluetooth scanning when the app is running in the background, meaning users have to leave it in the foreground, without using other apps. ""We've had repeated discussions at both the technical and policy level with Apple, but we have not yet been able to find a satisfactory solution,"" Dr Balakrishnan said. Wow...... 1/5 = 1.5m?"

From the app website: When phones with TraceTogether installed are nearby one another, they exchange anonymised proximity information using Bluetooth. This information is stored securely on the phone, and only shared with the Ministry of Health (MOH) if a user tests positive for COVID-19. as long as there is information exchange, that information can be exploited. for good or for bad. just because they put it that it is ""anonymized"" and ""only shared with the MOH"" does not mean the information will not be used for other purposes unknown to us.

Pretty sure the Bluetooth beacons will relay your identification info as it communicates with other beacons (other people). Else the contact tracing efforts are useless. And with the ability to form connections between who had come into contact with who, it is extremely easy to create a graph and identify all the connected beacons to this one beacon you investigate. Tbh, even in China there are people bending firewall regulations/ identity tracking with interesting solutions. Facial recognition can also be rendered useless with ""adversarial attacks"" this is something worth looking up because I see some of us have the fear of being recognized on cctv cams with the help of facial recognition software."

Seeing reply in this thread defending the wearable trouting wearable as safety, it ish evident that the wearable give false sense of safety. wearable does not prevent or stop the virus. Wearable like gahment initially said about mask, give false sense of safety and make ppl more complacent and increase risk of spread. 2. wearable only assist in contact tracing. does not impact much without agressive testing. from huat we know, not all on close contact are tested. so siting on the data without acting and agressive testing will not change situation much. 3. ish this wearable THE solution anot? $,time,resource was expended on tracetogether which was also trouted as solution. in the end, gahment had all but admit tracetogether had failed. $,time,resource, were wasted and not only on development but on testing, implementing, marketing, managing the app. $,time,resource which could better use on managing pandemic. how ish this wearable going be any different? point above would mostly be moot if gahment ish going for herd immunity. then yes, wearable ish the better solution. btw, not sure where and how data are stored and retrived. but ST Engineering subsidery just got hacked and 1.5TB of data was stolen and leaked online . go google it."

Unless you are going to mandate all to wear including those that are coming in to Singapore this projects wont work. Why ? 1) People on ground wont feel justified if only certain group of people needs to wear. 2) If you are a tourist coming in to Singapore .....will you want to be tagged ? Maybe some people feels safer.........i am sure alot amdk who sees privacy as very important wont want this ley. As a normal bystander ......just feels that is a money wasting initiative nia.

Even if they claimed it won't be used to track your location, your location can still be determined from the network of people you've interacted with. Basically, a graph can be formed from the list of people your device came into contact with. The probability of infection can then be calculated from the list of handshakes your device has made with others. Depending on that, they may contact you/ find out exactly when and where the device handshake occurred. Thus everyone who came into contact with you at that time can be assumed to be in the same location and that is how they can figure out your exact locations."

I'm sure Singaporeans will suddenly be very patriotic and start wearing the device to do their little bit to help the country get back on it's feet. Especially the 30k who signed the petition. Posted from PCWX using fingers, what else? I signed the petition.  Now let's put aside privacy and religious issues aside.  Religious is because whether u believe this is the fore runner of the mark of the beast - I think only Muslims, Christians and Judaists will be concerned on this. How does this work? Let's say there are 5 of these bands.  A B C D E and there are 5 people A B C D E so person A gets band A, B gets B and so on. They get it in 1 june 2020. On 14 June, person A gets tested positive for Covid 19.  So contact tracers get to work. My understanding now is they look at work place, family for close contacts.  So what benefit does this band do?  Cos the person was tested positive but he could have gotten it anytime from 1 june plus minus a few days.  And he would be asymptomatic and walking around until june 14 when he went to see the doctor.  So anyone with a band who was near him would be contacted as contact tracing? That would be thousands of people esp if he takes public transport.  And these thousands of people who have been contacted have also been walking around so should the tens of thousands of people who have been in contact with these thousands also be contacted?  You might as well lock down again. In my example I just say 5 bands but in reality its 5.5 million bands if its rolled out. Cos this device would be useful in detecting transient contact.  If it's close contact, normal scanning with QR code is sufficient. Let's say now person E is infected and you want to be warned if E is near you.  Fair enough.  But shouldnt E be in an isolation facility since he is infected? So how can this device be of use to you? I would agree if an infected person must wear a tracker while in isolation. And to say no govt assistance for medical help if you refuse the band... well first u need to convince the people it really helps in contact tracing. And to the religious, it seems like the fore runner to the mark of the beast.  Cos if you can withhold medical subsidy to a citizen who is really ill for not wearing something that amounts to a tracker (in laymen terms), then what is to stop the G from one day saying no buying or selling if you dont wear this or put a chip?  Yes only people from the three religions above would be concerned about this and not the majority but seeing that there are Christians and Muslims in parliament (Jewish community is small in Singapore), I am surprised that none of them voice this concern. And as mentioned above, the only way it helps is if contact tracers are interested in transient contacts and if that is so, then you might as well lock down the  country. My two cents."

Like you said it measures transient contact, but as revealed in the TraceTogether FAQ, it takes more than transient contact for them to be intereeted. They only log those that are in close proximity for a long period of time (predetermined by the app, forgot the timing, you have to check the documentation). So it is useful to know how many people were within 5m of you for 10 minutes say. And to alert these people quickly to SHN. It's not about whether they can do the contact tracing, which I assure you they can. But it's timeliness. Every second saved counts as the notifications to there potential infected people can be done quickly with TraceTogether and get them to SHN before they in turn infect more ppl. It's about all of us doing our little part to help the contact tracing team work faster. And lessen their load for more perplexing cases. Resources are limited.

Unless you are going to mandate all to wear including those that are coming in to Singapore this projects wont work. Why ? 1) People on ground wont feel justified if only certain group of people needs to wear. 2) If you are a tourist coming in to Singapore .....will you want to be tagged ? Maybe some people feels safer.........i am sure alot amdk who sees privacy as very important wont want this ley. As a normal bystander ......just feels that is a money wasting initiative nia. Who cares about tourists if they don't want to wear? This initiative benefits sinkies only. So that they can be immediately quarantined or receive our World class medical treatment. Govt should mandate if in the event the respective person kena the virus but found unable to contact trace due to not wearing the device than they should bear the full cost of treatment with no subsidy.

Impossible to trace. To figure out the location of the jammer while you're moving around with it is extremely difficult as there are a huge variety of devices out there transmitting BLE (Bluetooth low energy) on only 3 advertisement channels. They will need to first identify the jamming channel and BLE identifier and then triangulate on your position by placing multiple scanners around. Even so, it is not accurate as there is RF interference caused by walls and solid objects."
