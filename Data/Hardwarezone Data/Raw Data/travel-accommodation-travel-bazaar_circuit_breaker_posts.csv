WTS 1 night Mandarin Oriental hotel staycation voucher,06-09-2020 08:43 PM,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/travel-bazaar-346/wts-1-night-mandarin-oriental-hotel-staycation-voucher-6370754.html,129555232,06-09-2020  08:43 PM,"I have a voucher for a one (1) night weekend stay at mandarin oriental hotel. It also includes breakfast and the voucher has been extended by the hotel till 30th December 2020. Willing to let go at $400. Good deal for anyone looking to have a relaxing weekend away from home. Online rates with breakfast going for $480++, so this is a steal."
