Sg should not condone hiring practices where untalented locals are unfairly favored over talented foreign talents as this ish xenophobic and harmful to businesses and therefore the country. #sgunited for a better singapore. Then what for we have so many education institutions? To work part time in 7-11?

As you can see from the comments, it\x92s not one nationality that\x92s playing the nepotism game. It\x92s not the Indian dominated firms hiring only Indians or Shopee hiring PRCs or Google/Facebook hiring Ang mohs. It is that these companies are going the extra mile to not hire locals and Singaporeans should introspect the reasons why. Let me spew the truth here and say that life is super easy in Singapore. We have artificially low taxes, decent healthcare, best public transport, great infrastructure, cheap food, running water, good pension system.... and the list goes on. This cushioning has conditioned us and made us weak. We are constant complainers, the unhappiest country in the world, and expect the government to do everything for us, because we think it\x92s our right? Skills/Upskilling: First of all, locals do not have the skills to take on these jobs. Even if the employer, in the name of diversity, offers the job to a local, I have hardly seen any local upskilling himself to go for the next job. At my workplace, pretty much all the training budget is consumed by other nationalities whereas locals are constantly complaining that they do not have the time for all these things, yet they expect the promotion, bonuses and that new role that they know nothing about. I haven\x92t seen anybody using SkillsFuture either, except for some memes and complaints about it, nobody seems to give a ****. On the contrary, I have seen a lot of PRs using it and doing some certifications and upskilling courses and it has worked well for them. Attitude: This brings us to the attitude issue as the above alluded to the constant complaining culture and the \x91hardships\x92. What hardships are we talking about here? Hardship that the MRT is too expensive and how it was late by 15 mins or you had to stand all the way from your home to the office? People bring this attitude to work and go about their daily jobs, and it reflects. It reflects in their work, their persona and how they handle situations. Working until 6.30 instead of 6pm is not overtime, so do not complain. If you are going to work 9 to 6, then expect to get paid accordingly. If you are not adding anything extra to you day to day, then don\x92t expect the promotion or bonus. You are getting paid for the job that you were hired for, if you are not going over and above then do not have unrealistic expectations. Soft skills: Spoken communication is a really big issue here, especially in multinational corps. On paper, Singapore has the world\x92s best edu system but the communication needs a lot of work. And that\x92s one of the other reason that locals do not get hired for the roles they believe they should be hired for. \x93Of course foreigners steal your job, but may be, if someone without contacts, money or speaking the same language steals your job, then you\x92re shit\x94 - Louie CK https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/c...m_medium=web2x How is this discriminatory? Perhaps the foreigners are more competent than the locals. A tech company with Indians may be more efficient than one with mostly locals. Cheaper cost of hiring (no reservist) and willingness to work longer hours are factors to be considered. During my time here, many of the locals don't seem to express themselves well or instill confidence in the interviewer during job interviews. Singaporeans really have to buck up on their communication skills and confidence."

As you can see from the comments, it\u2019s not one nationality that\u2019s playing the nepotism game. It\u2019s not the Indian dominated firms hiring only Indians or Shopee hiring PRCs or Google/Facebook hiring Ang mohs. It is that these companies are going the extra mile to not hire locals and Singaporeans should introspect the reasons why. Let me spew the truth here and say that life is super easy in Singapore. We have artificially low taxes, decent healthcare, best public transport, great infrastructure, cheap food, running water, good pension system.... and the list goes on. This cushioning has conditioned us and made us weak. We are constant complainers, the unhappiest country in the world, and expect the government to do everything for us, because we think it\u2019s our right? Skills/Upskilling: First of all, locals do not have the skills to take on these jobs. Even if the employer, in the name of diversity, offers the job to a local, I have hardly seen any local upskilling himself to go for the next job. At my workplace, pretty much all the training budget is consumed by other nationalities whereas locals are constantly complaining that they do not have the time for all these things, yet they expect the promotion, bonuses and that new role that they know nothing about. I haven\u2019t seen anybody using SkillsFuture either, except for some memes and complaints about it, nobody seems to give a ****. On the contrary, I have seen a lot of PRs using it and doing some certifications and upskilling courses and it has worked well for them. Attitude: This brings us to the attitude issue as the above alluded to the constant complaining culture and the \u2018hardships\u2019. What hardships are we talking about here? Hardship that the MRT is too expensive and how it was late by 15 mins or you had to stand all the way from your home to the office? People bring this attitude to work and go about their daily jobs, and it reflects. It reflects in their work, their persona and how they handle situations. Working until 6.30 instead of 6pm is not overtime, so do not complain. If you are going to work 9 to 6, then expect to get paid accordingly. If you are not adding anything extra to you day to day, then don\u2019t expect the promotion or bonus. You are getting paid for the job that you were hired for, if you are not going over and above then do not have unrealistic expectations. Soft skills: Spoken communication is a really big issue here, especially in multinational corps. On paper, Singapore has the world\u2019s best edu system but the communication needs a lot of work. And that\u2019s one of the other reason that locals do not get hired for the roles they believe they should be hired for. \u201cOf course foreigners steal your job, but may be, if someone without contacts, money or speaking the same language steals your job, then you\u2019re ****\u201d - Louie CK https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/c...m_medium=web2x How is this discriminatory? Perhaps the foreigners are more competent than the locals. A tech company with Indians may be more efficient than one with mostly locals. Cheaper cost of hiring (no reservist) and willingness to work longer hours are factors to be considered. During my time here, many of the locals don't seem to express themselves well or instill confidence in the interviewer during job interviews. Singaporeans really have to buck up on their communication skills and confidence."

The first guy got many many axe to grind against locals. https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/c...m_medium=web2x 15 days ago Makes sense but what would the local talent going to offer in return? Do you think these MNCs are going to place cutting edge STEM jobs here when there is no local talent availability? Even if they do, they would hire from outside and then people would complain again. Corporates are not stupid to employee foreign talent even though they are expensive and there are legalities around bringing them in. https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/c...m_medium=web2x I think it\x92s more than the cultural bias that everybody blames here because it\x92s easy to shun personal responsibilities and blame external factors. Within MNC\x92s, there\x92s a tremendous pressure to have the right balance of ethnicities, sex, age while hiring candidates. The employment rules have changed in the favor of local talent as well and the HR has placed a lot of restrictions to hire people from outside, however, the fact of the matter is that it\x92s a herculean task to hire a local candidate that has the right skill set, personality, experience, soft skills and attitude. Recently, I had to keep a role open for almost 4 months and screened close to 120 CVs and conducted around 30 odd interviews to find a worthy one. In the end, it was not a local candidate. The other major gripe our international offices have with the local talent is lack of effective communication skills. It\x92s a combination of unclear thinking process and delivery. On paper, Singapore has the best education system and top schooling system with English being the chief mode of education, which raises the expectations quite high. In reality, the situation is starkly different. These are some other issues that we have seen repeatedly, lack of big picture thinking lack of follow up and ownership unable to take responsibility of their own actions for mid level managers, putting their interests before their staff regimental thought process, lack of out of the box thinking Having said all that, there are also some great employees that have proven them time and again and continue to do so.

BREAKING: MOM to raise salary criteria for EP & S Pass,5/1/2021 11:36,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/current-affairs-lounge-17/breaking-mom-raise-salary-criteria-ep-s-pass-6363638.html,129332394,26-08-2020  05:39 PM,"Abalone Zhup: https://mothership.sg/2020/08/ep-s-p...-salary-raise/ Quote: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) intends to help workers and companies tackle the economic disruptions brought about by the pandemic. One of the changes will be to adjust foreign workforce policies, including raising the salary criteria for Employment Passes (EP) and S Passes. EP & S Pass criteria In the addendum to the President's Address on Aug. 26, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that this adjustment is in response to the economic disruption caused by Covid-19, resulting in more slack in the labour market. Currently, the minimum monthly salary for foreign professionals to qualify for an Employment Pass is S$3,900 (with more experienced candidates needing higher salaries). The raised figure has yet to be stated by MOM, however. Teo said during the Budget debate earlier this year that the criteria takes reference from salaries of locals with similar experience and seniority, ensuring that EP holders do not undercut local PMET wages. Nearly six in 10 locals in the workforce today are employed in professional, managerial, executive and technician (PMET) jobs. For every Employment Pass (EP) holder, there are nearly seven locals employed in PMET roles, MOM said. Even as we stay open to the world, MOM said that businesses will be required to develop and strengthen their ""Singaporean core"". Fairness at work, meaningful employment The addendum further elaborated on the efforts the ministry intends to undertake in order to ensure fairness and inclusiveness at workplaces, and meaningful employment. This includes fair hiring and retrenchment practices by ensuring employers uphold the Fair Consideration Framework, and closely examining retrenchment exercises to make sure they are carried out fairly. Uplifting wages at the lower end also remains a key priority, and the progressive wage model (PWM) will be expanded to more sectors. There will also be regular reviews of the Workfare and Silver Support, and they will continue to look out for gaps in our social safety nets. To help persons with disabilities (PwDs), the Enabling Employment Credit (EEC) was introduced as a wage offset scheme to support employers to hire PwDs. Additional wage offsets are also provided for these employers when they hire PwDs who have not been working for at least six months. The EEC will be available from 2021 to 2025, and will undergo a review by MOM after two years to make any necessary adjustments. MOM will also aim to entrench more flexible work arrangements and create more ""family-friendly"" workplace practices, with the current ""new normal"" brought about by the pandemic. I think they felt the election pain lol. Doing this to salvage from further GRC loss."

We don\x92t discuss salary. Allowance, stock option, etc, may be discussed. So I really don\x92t know how much those on EPs are paid. Besides, most of the EP holders I know were moved from other countries to Singapore. Hence they were not recruited in Singapore. I can only remember one exception, who was recruited here in Singapore. The top guy for the business unit was changed, then all the available managerial roles were filled by his people. MNCs are business organizations that would be concerned about profitability. No doubt it is a number game and some things are controlled by HR. Over the years, I have seen allowances reduced then cut, so MNCs are concerned about cost. Still, the bar should be raised high enough to be painful. By today\x92s standard, $3.9K is too low for EP. Perhaps MOM can raise this to $8K."

I can only remember one exception, who was recruited here in Singapore. The top guy for the business unit was changed, then all the available managerial roles were filled by his people. MNCs are business organizations that would be concerned about profitability. No doubt it is a number game and some things are controlled by HR. Over the years, I have seen allowances reduced then cut, so MNCs are concerned about cost. Still, the bar should be raised high enough to be painful.

The false perception of higher cost to now employ a EP holder or SP holder, that is going to translate to more companies employing sinkies? The existing salary range is already considered low, especially for a EP holder, ($3900) whom is brought in to fill the middle management level. Even if they decide to raise the salary of EP to $4200 - $4500, it isn't going to make them more expensive, as compared to a sinkie in middle management (whom needs CPF + benefits). Furthermore, EP got no levy or quota, with the news, it is just going to make the whole EP scheme more appealing and marketable by the respective agents in the various countries. If the govt wants to show resolve in addressing the issue, make the whole EP scheme on par to the local scheme. Impose levy on all EP holders - Company to pay 17% EP levy and EP holder pay 20% EP levy, based on the declared salary of each EP holder in the company. EP holders are on a 2 years employment contract, with 1 renewal per EP holders. So maximum is 4 years and after that, must go back and cannot reapply for any form of employment pass for the next 1-2 years. Companies with a certain number of EP holders will not get any corporate tax rebate. The more EP holders, the lesser corporate tax rebate a company is entitled. The more local in a company, the higher corporate tax rebate."

Can we be so short sighted for unsustainable economics gains? @WoollyMammoth and others who are arguing the case for Globalization blindly without a valid basis, you would need to look at the both the historical and current facts and figures before regurgitating the SG mass media line that Globalization is the solution to all of SG's economic problems. It's a panadol temporary pain-relief at best. @SOS9112001. First, from the recent economic data and numbers, Globalization's no longer advantageous to Singapore. But You raised up a important point - that other countries will catch up with Singapore one day. Do you realize that by opening up Singapore economic borders unchecked, Singapore's actually training up our regional countries workforce to compete directly with Singapore one day? We have actually seen this happening when MNCs started to re-locate their Asia-Pacific business centres like operations centres to those former third-world country that has acquired more skilled labour who returned from Singapore after a couple of years? MNCs moved because Globalization or the mass influx of bodies into Singapore has increased the business cost of land for commercial, residential and leisure purposes. Coupled with the fact that our neighbouring countries' workforce has attained critical masses of skilled labour, MNCs are making the move that makes economic sense easily. What's the long-term impacts to Singapore as we accelerated the training and skill levels of our neighbouring competitors? The passe phenomenon of Globalization started in 2004 when LHL began his mass imports of FTs after he came into office in August, three days after SG39 National Day. Before LHL took over the premiership, Singapore always have had good and sustainable economic growth from the 70s, 80s throughout 90s and even early 2000s. Even before the word Globalization was coined, being a trading port-city, Singapore was always a free-port and open economy, resulting in our economy being well-correlated with the up and down movements of the global economy. After LHL opened the floodgates to the FTs from 2004 onwards, Singapore's economic cycles became extremely volatile. Just look at the abnormal high spikes in GDP after GFC from 2009 to 2011. And followed by prolonged trough periods of negative and low growths from 2011 till 2016, even when the rest of the world was enjoying healthy growth over the same period. LHL's use of FTs to boost economic growth is unsustainable and myopic. It's like using drugs such as cocaine - giving a super-short high, followed by a very bad and long slump. Worse, Singapore core economic capabilities and fundamentals were damaged during this period, characterised by high cost and low productivity. White-collared FTs replaced the highly educated Singaporeans in PMETs jobs at MNCs, not by meritocracy or better skills; but by their own countrymen networks. Blue-collared foreign workers were let in en-masse,  depressing the wages of Singaporean rank-and-file workers, whilst letting SME owners enjoy quick short-term profits without the need to invest into technology and machineries. All these lower quality FT workforce, together with their increasing numbers every year increased cost-pressure whilst lowering our national productivity. Consequently, Singapore's global competitiveness fell because of the higher cost and lower productivity. Just look at Singapore's prolonged economic under-performance against our regional neighbours ever since the high spikes. The spikes and troughs during LHL's administration are abnormal and unusual throughout Singapore's modern economic history. Look at the chart, before LHL took over in 2004, Singapore always had a healthy balance of economic growth. (falling within the two RED bands). Yes before 2004 and the word Globalization was invented, there were real and high-quality FTs too, coming in to complement Singapore's organic labour force, not replacing Singaporeans, making citizens under-employed in their own country after so much tax-dollars were spent on educating a typical Singaporean till tertiary levels. Singapore's economic development and balance in the last 12 years was severely disrupted and damaged by LHL's myopic FT policy. AFTERNOTE: Another thesis at the moment is that LHL, through his liberal immigration policy for short-term GDP spikes has unwittingly became the labour training school for ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asia (e.g. India). FTs who were allowed into Singapore got all the on-the-job trainings ahead of Singaporeans. FTs get all the relevant trainings in MNCs when jobless Singaporeans were asked to attend government-ran SkillsFuture that did not guarantee a job after the training. When the SG economy is good, these ASEAN & Indian FTs earned good money in Singapore, remit their earnings back to their home countries, whilst spending minimally to stimulate the domestic economy. Jobless or unemployed Singaporeans tighten their belt and spent lesser than before. Consequently, the wealth-creation effects in Singapore is diminished significantly even as the bodies packed in and the population grew to 5.7 million. Worse, when the SG economy is bad, FTs return to their home nations with the relevant skills-sets that MNCs desire to start their local operations. They become Singapore's strong regional competition for MNCs to set up base. These ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asian nations with their now skilled-labour and natural abundance of Land, easily wins these MNCs over at Singapore's expense. Singapore in a bad economy cannot re-build quickly because it is stucked with citizens with SkillsFuture skills that MNCs least require and hence Singapore and Singaporeans are losing the regional economic race, much less the global competition. Just go take a peek at the recent performance of the regional economies vis-a-vis Singapore's current state of economy. Pokka Green Tea wrote: Matter of time Singapore will be taken over by our ASEAN neighbours. I have said this before; Singapore cannot have an economy consisting of 40% foreign labour who accounts for 55% of the income tax paid year-on-year. Whilst, spin doctors under the LHL's Administration would declare proudly that HALF of Singaporeans DO NOT NEED to pay income taxes, it simply means 50% of Singaporeans are either jobless or earn less than S$20,000 per year (circa $1,700 per month). Last checked, compared to a Singapore citizen, foreigners in Singapore do not need to pay any extra income tax given the same earning power, nor do foreigners need to pay any National Service / National Defence taxes on their income earned in Singapore. Then why is it that foreigners in Singapore account for a much bigger percentage of the Singapore's total income taxes collected vis-a-vis local Singaporean income taxpayers? So if foreigners are earning more than Singaporeans (since they are paying proportionately more income tax than Singapore citizens); do they also spend more of their disposable income in Singapore to create a bigger wealth-creation effect in the larger domestic economy? Singaporeans as a whole need to think about the answers to such questions."

Only 127K cecas in SG !! https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/e...g-6185369.html deuxfla wrote: A United Nations report, which tracks migration patterns worldwide for the last 30 years, paints a picture of migrants in Singapore that debunks a few popular perceptions among Singaporeans. The cumulative estimates from 1990 to 2019, obtained by The Sunday Times, highlight two particularly misguided beliefs. Myth 1: Chinese nationals form the biggest pool of migrants in the country. Reality: Malaysians top the list, making up almost half of the migrants in the last three decades. Myth 2: Indian nationals are a close second to Chinese nationals. Reality: Indian nationals form just 5.9 per cent of the total migrant pool, with 5.1 per cent from Pakistan and 3.2 per cent from Bangladesh. Often, Singaporeans view citizens of the three nations synonymously as Indians. By mid-2019, they made up 14 per cent of the migrant pool, not far behind the 18 per cent of Chinese nationals. Beyond helping to disprove widely held notions about the composition of Singapore's migrant population, the figures from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs show that Singapore's immigration policy has stayed relatively consistent in the last 30 years. Those from neighbouring Malaysia form the biggest group, accounting for 44 per cent or almost half of the foreign-born population. Add the 18 per cent of Chinese nationals and together, both account for more than six out of 10 migrants in Singapore. Indonesia rounds up the top three on the migrants' list, followed by India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Macau and others. WHY DO SINGAPOREANS CLING TO THESE MISPERCEPTIONS? Researchers and social scientists say these popular misperceptions arise partly because Singaporeans have never really considered Malaysians to be migrants or foreigners, owing to the cultural similarities they share and the historically porous border between the two countries. With Malaysians being the ""silent majority"", foreigners like Chinese and Indian nationals stand out and appear overwhelmingly dominant even though actual numbers show otherwise. The lack of public data does not help combat such misperceptions. The situation is exacerbated by reports, online and offline, of isolated incidents of antisocial behaviour of foreigners. ""When someone comes here from another region and acts in a different way, the person stands out,"" said geographer and mapping consultant Mok Ly Yng. ""After a while, people start noticing them rather than the silent majority. It's more a perception thing rather than mathematical."" Recent examples include an Indian expatriate who berated his condominium's security guard over a parking incident. It drew wide coverage in the media as well as on social media. Amid questions about his citizenship status, the Ministry of Home Affairs later revealed that he is a Singaporean who obtained his citizenship under the Family Ties scheme. The UN defines a migrant as anyone who is foreign-born, a definition that includes permanent residents, foreigners who work here and their dependants, students, as well as naturalised citizens in Singapore. In the last three decades, the figures show the proportion of Malaysians has soared, from 27 per cent in 1990 to 44 per cent last year. As for China-born migrants, the proportion has hovered around 18 per cent for almost the entire 30 years, except in 1990, when it rose to 21 per cent. Indonesia has consistently been Singapore's third-biggest source of migrants, with 138,338 of its people making up 6.4 per cent of the foreign-born pool last year. They are followed by Indians (5.9 per cent), Pakistanis (5.1 per cent) and Bangladeshis (3.2 per cent). Those from Hong Kong and Macau together make up 3.3 per cent. MALAYSIANS AND CHINESE INTEGRATE MORE EASILY Social scientists say it is a no-brainer that Malaysia and China lead the pack, as their nationals are seen to integrate more easily into Singaporean society. ""Malaysians in many ways are culturally similar to Singaporeans and it is no wonder that labour policies favour their employment here,"" said Dr Mathew Mathews, senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies. Labour policies, for instance, allow a higher age limit of 58 for Malaysians applying for work permits, while it is capped at 50 for all other foreigners. Employers must also buy a $5,000 security bond for every foreign worker they employ, except Malaysians. Migrants from China, meanwhile, ""assumedly will find it easier to integrate in Singapore considering the ease of using Mandarin here and the fact that around three-quarters of our population are ethnically Chinese,"" Dr Mathews added. Nanyang Technological University sociologist Zhan Shaohua said the consistent mix of migrant source countries over 30 years reflects Singapore's policy of ensuring immigration numbers do not change or impact on the local ethnic proportions of Chinese, Malays, Indians and others. The UN data also reflects Singapore's policy of drawing workers from countries such as Bangladesh, the Philippines and Indonesia for jobs that Singaporeans shun, such as construction and domestic work. It also sources for workers from some countries for a particular industry, for example, construction workers from Bangladesh, domestic workers from the Philippines and Indonesia, Dr Zhan noted. A spokesman for the National Population and Talent Division said the Government has a list of source countries for work permit holders in construction, manufacturing, marine shipyard, process and services sector, as well as for foreign domestic workers. ""Regardless of country of origin, integration efforts between locals and foreigners continue to be important in order to strengthen our social cohesion and the vibrancy of our diverse and inclusive society,"" he added. TIGHTER IMMIGRATION RULES IN 2009, FEWER MIGRANTS IN 2019 The UN estimates show migrant numbers from all source countries dipped last year. The total shrank 15 per cent to 2,155,653 in 2019, from 2,543,638 in 2015. It was 2,164,794 in 2010. The UN office, when contacted, said the 2019 figures could be an underestimate and may be revised when more data is available. Singapore researchers said it may also partly reflect the tightening of immigration policies in 2009. The pace of growth of Singapore's population has slowed since. Between 2004 and 2009, total population grew by 164,000 on average each year. But between 2009 and 2015, the annual growth shrank to 91,000, and it decreased further to 48,000 each year between 2015 and mid-2019, said Dr Zhan. In 2004, the Government relaxed immigration rules to make up for falling birth rates, and from 2005 to 2009, around 400,000 people were made new Singaporeans and PRs. But the rules were tightened in 2009 after Singaporeans fretted over competition for jobs, school places and rising property prices. People were also frustrated with overcrowding in buses and trains. With Malaysians, however, such tensions seem almost non-existent. Historian and law professor Kevin Tan, 58, noted that Malaysians have always been a part of Singapore's social fabric, with shared languages, food and culture. ""When I was at NUS (1982-1986), one-third of my classmates were Malaysians,"" said Dr Tan, adjunct professor at the National University of Singapore's law faculty. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ar-perceptions Regardless of the composition of FTs, fact remains here: Singapore\u2019s total population in 2020 had increased by close to 40% over the last 16 years that LHL had been in office as the Prime Minister, from 4.17 million in 2004 to 5.85 million today according to the latest UN data.  The official Department of Statistics Singapore stated the total population to be 5.7 million correct as at June last year (2019). Given the current citizen population of 3.5 million, of which nearly 10% are new citizenships handed out liberally by the LHL\u2019s administration after the SARS-CoV-1 period, and taking the natural population replacement rate to be neutral during these 16 years (300,000 citizens deaths replaced by 300,000 citizens birth over 16 years); it can be safely estimated that more than 50% of Singapore\u2019s population today have not lived through SARS-CoV-1 in 2003. Under LHL\u2019s administration economic strategy via ponzi-like non-organic population growth, Singapore had seen its total population ballooned by 40% in just 16 years, with about 100,000 foreigners being added on the average in each of the last 16 years. At this rate, the LHL\u2019s administration is clearly on track to hit the legendary 6.9 million population \u2018planning parameter\u2019 by 2030, stated in Singapore\u2019s 2013 Population White Paper since another decade of adding 100,000 per year non-stop would add one million more people to Singapore current 2020\u2019s population."

But what if other cities catch up and we no longer the city of choice? Can our industries continue to support them? Or will we have over capacity infrastructure when they go en mass? Like the closure of schools? Can we be so short sighted for unsustainable economics gains? @WoollyMammoth and others who are arguing the case for Globalization blindly without a valid basis, you would need to look at the both the historical and current facts and figures before regurgitating the SG mass media line that Globalization is the solution to all of SG's economic problems. It's a panadol temporary pain-relief at best. @SOS9112001. First, from the recent economic data and numbers, Globalization's no longer advantageous to Singapore. But You raised up a important point - that other countries will catch up with Singapore one day. Do you realize that by opening up Singapore economic borders unchecked, Singapore's actually training up our regional countries workforce to compete directly with Singapore one day? We have actually seen this happening when MNCs started to re-locate their Asia-Pacific business centres like operations centres to those former third-world country that has acquired more skilled labour who returned from Singapore after a couple of years? MNCs moved because Globalization or the mass influx of bodies into Singapore has increased the business cost of land for commercial, residential and leisure purposes. Coupled with the fact that our neighbouring countries' workforce has attained critical masses of skilled labour, MNCs are making the move that makes economic sense easily. What's the long-term impacts to Singapore as we accelerated the training and skill levels of our neighbouring competitors? The passe phenomenon of Globalization started in 2004 when LHL began his mass imports of FTs after he came into office in August, three days after SG39 National Day. Before LHL took over the premiership, Singapore always have had good and sustainable economic growth from the 70s, 80s throughout 90s and even early 2000s. Even before the word Globalization was coined, being a trading port-city, Singapore was always a free-port and open economy, resulting in our economy being well-correlated with the up and down movements of the global economy. After LHL opened the floodgates to the FTs from 2004 onwards, Singapore's economic cycles became extremely volatile. Just look at the abnormal high spikes in GDP after GFC from 2009 to 2011. And followed by prolonged trough periods of negative and low growths from 2011 till 2016, even when the rest of the world was enjoying healthy growth over the same period. LHL's use of FTs to boost economic growth is unsustainable and myopic. It's like using drugs such as cocaine - giving a super-short high, followed by a very bad and long slump. Worse, Singapore core economic capabilities and fundamentals were damaged during this period, characterised by high cost and low productivity. White-collared FTs replaced the highly educated Singaporeans in PMETs jobs at MNCs, not by meritocracy or better skills; but by their own countrymen networks. Blue-collared foreign workers were let in en-masse,  depressing the wages of Singaporean rank-and-file workers, whilst letting SME owners enjoy quick short-term profits without the need to invest into technology and machineries. All these lower quality FT workforce, together with their increasing numbers every year increased cost-pressure whilst lowering our national productivity. Consequently, Singapore's global competitiveness fell because of the higher cost and lower productivity. Just look at Singapore's prolonged economic under-performance against our regional neighbours ever since the high spikes. The spikes and troughs during LHL's administration are abnormal and unusual throughout Singapore's modern economic history. Look at the chart, before LHL took over in 2004, Singapore always had a healthy balance of economic growth. (falling within the two RED bands). Yes before 2004 and the word Globalization was invented, there were real and high-quality FTs too, coming in to complement Singapore's organic labour force, not replacing Singaporeans, making citizens under-employed in their own country after so much tax-dollars were spent on educating a typical Singaporean till tertiary levels. Singapore's economic development and balance in the last 12 years was severely disrupted and damaged by LHL's myopic FT policy. AFTERNOTE: Another thesis at the moment is that LHL, through his liberal immigration policy for short-term GDP spikes has unwittingly became the labour training school for ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asia (e.g. India). FTs who were allowed into Singapore got all the on-the-job trainings ahead of Singaporeans. FTs get all the relevant trainings in MNCs when jobless Singaporeans were asked to attend government-ran SkillsFuture that did not guarantee a job after the training. When the SG economy is good, these ASEAN & Indian FTs earned good money in Singapore, remit their earnings back to their home countries, whilst spending minimally to stimulate the domestic economy. Jobless or unemployed Singaporeans tighten their belt and spent lesser than before. Consequently, the wealth-creation effects in Singapore is diminished significantly even as the bodies packed in and the population grew to 5.7 million. Worse, when the SG economy is bad, FTs return to their home nations with the relevant skills-sets that MNCs desire to start their local operations. They become Singapore's strong regional competition for MNCs to set up base. These ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asian nations with their now skilled-labour and natural abundance of Land, easily wins these MNCs over at Singapore's expense. Singapore in a bad economy cannot re-build quickly because it is stucked with citizens with SkillsFuture skills that MNCs least require and hence Singapore and Singaporeans are losing the regional economic race, much less the global competition. Just go take a peek at the recent performance of the regional economies vis-a-vis Singapore's current state of economy. Pokka Green Tea wrote: Matter of time Singapore will be taken over by our ASEAN neighbours. I have said this before; Singapore cannot have an economy consisting of 40% foreign labour who accounts for 55% of the income tax paid year-on-year. Whilst, spin doctors under the LHL's Administration would declare proudly that HALF of Singaporeans DO NOT NEED to pay income taxes, it simply means 50% of Singaporeans are either jobless or earn less than S$20,000 per year (circa $1,700 per month). Last checked, compared to a Singapore citizen, foreigners in Singapore do not need to pay any extra income tax given the same earning power, nor do foreigners need to pay any National Service / National Defence taxes on their income earned in Singapore. Then why is it that foreigners in Singapore account for a much bigger percentage of the Singapore's total income taxes collected vis-a-vis local Singaporean income taxpayers? So if foreigners are earning more than Singaporeans (since they are paying proportionately more income tax than Singapore citizens); do they also spend more of their disposable income in Singapore to create a bigger wealth-creation effect in the larger domestic economy? Singaporeans as a whole need to think about the answers to such questions."

Let me elaborate. 2-factors @play here. (1) The one-child policy which was carried out without much foresight and later went out of control. The aftermath effect of one-child policy coupled with the rising income of highly educated Singaporeans who favor career growth over starting a family nailed the coffin of prolonged low birth rates. (2) Over promotion of gender equality - female earning same or higher income than male coupled with traditional belief that female marry upward further killed off any birth rate growth. Time is finite, these female soon past the used-by dates and pregnancy is no longer possible/safe. So PAP foresee that they will not be able to sustain the economic growth of Singapore given such rapidly declining birth rate. What do they do next? They need something fast and ready-made, plus at the same time boast Singapore population & birth rates. Open-leg ultra liberal immigration policy is the answer. Bring in foreigners by the C130 load, be it real talent or massage masseuse. They are so desperate that they just bring in every foreigner who is willing to move here."

That 12 years-old Singaporean kid in 2004 grew up to be a 28-year-old struggling to make ends meet by delivering pizzas to FTs still working in the comfort and safety of their homes? What happened these 16 years from 2004 to 2020? Creating good paying jobs and training Singaporeans from scratch is not rocket science. It a matter of resolve and priorities. Fyi, US took just three years of training from scratch and preparation to send their first man into space.

Even our modern day iPhone in the pockets have 1,000,000 times more processing power and 10,000,000 times more RAM. And the Americans just took three years from zero to hero to send a man into space! The LHL's administration has 16 years and they cannot even train up sufficient Singaporean workers to work in those good and well-paid jobs created by giving tax incentives and rebates to foregn MNCs?"

How many Singaporeans would be excited to look for a job in India? And it is often observed that once an India national is hired for a senior role here, he will most likely have a preference to hire other Indian nationals. If you look at the staff of JPMorgan Singapore, it is very different from 10-15 years ago. There are way too many Indian nationals vs Singaporeans and other nationalities. The trend pretty much started after an Indian national was appointed as the head of Asia at JPMorgan and it accelerated with the adoption of CECA. At one stage, the authorities were concerned about the large proportions of Indian nationals being hired at the expense of locals and JPMorgan ramped up the hiring of locals but the new local hires were mainly for junior roles. If you look at the organizational chart, the Indian nationals are at the top of the chart and the locals are at the bottom. The situation is similar at other banks like Citi, Standard Chartered. India is a big country with a wide pool of smart and well-educated professionals but so is China among other countries. And China is a much bigger market to do business with. There are more Chinese companies operating in Singapore. There are more MNCs doing China-related business located in Singapore. Why do we have such a disproportionate number of Indian nationals in senior positions in banks and tech companies in Singapore? There is this anecdote of a minister who wanted to visit one of the American banks' trading floor in Singapore because of complaints from some local staff who felt they were disadvantaged and unfairly laid off in favour of Indian hires. When the bank management found out about the minister visiting in the afternoon, they told all the Indian nationals to go for early lunch and not to come back for the rest of the day! jt6118 wrote: Your reserves are assets for you to weather crisis, you still need earning and growth potential.

But what if other cities catch up and we no longer the city of choice? Can our industries continue to support them? Or will we have over capacity infrastructure when they go en mass?

Can we be so short sighted for unsustainable economics gains? @WoollyMammoth and others who are arguing the case for Globalization blindly without a valid basis, you would need to look at the both the historical and current facts and figures before regurgitating the SG mass media line that Globalization is the solution to all of SG's economic problems. It's a panadol temporary pain-relief at best. @SOS9112001. First, from the recent economic data and numbers, Globalization's no longer advantageous to Singapore. But You raised up a important point - that other countries will catch up with Singapore one day. Do you realize that by opening up Singapore economic borders unchecked, Singapore's actually training up our regional countries workforce to compete directly with Singapore one day? We have actually seen this happening when MNCs started to re-locate their Asia-Pacific business centres like operations centres to those former third-world country that has acquired more skilled labour who returned from Singapore after a couple of years? MNCs moved because Globalization or the mass influx of bodies into Singapore has increased the business cost of land for commercial, residential and leisure purposes. Coupled with the fact that our neighbouring countries' workforce has attained critical masses of skilled labour, MNCs are making the move that makes economic sense easily. What's the long-term impacts to Singapore as we accelerated the training and skill levels of our neighbouring competitors? The passe phenomenon of Globalization started in 2004 when LHL began his mass imports of FTs after he came into office in August, three days after SG39 National Day. Before LHL took over the premiership, Singapore always have had good and sustainable economic growth from the 70s, 80s throughout 90s and even early 2000s. Even before the word Globalization was coined, being a trading port-city, Singapore was always a free-port and open economy, resulting in our economy being well-correlated with the up and down movements of the global economy. After LHL opened the floodgates to the FTs from 2004 onwards, Singapore's economic cycles became extremely volatile. Just look at the abnormal high spikes in GDP after GFC from 2009 to 2011. And followed by prolonged trough periods of negative and low growths from 2011 till 2016, even when the rest of the world was enjoying healthy growth over the same period. LHL's use of FTs to boost economic growth is unsustainable and myopic. It's like using drugs such as cocaine - giving a super-short high, followed by a very bad and long slump. Worse, Singapore core economic capabilities and fundamentals were damaged during this period, characterised by high cost and low productivity. White-collared FTs replaced the highly educated Singaporeans in PMETs jobs at MNCs, not by meritocracy or better skills; but by their own countrymen networks. Blue-collared foreign workers were let in en-masse,  depressing the wages of Singaporean rank-and-file workers, whilst letting SME owners enjoy quick short-term profits without the need to invest into technology and machineries. All these lower quality FT workforce, together with their increasing numbers every year increased cost-pressure whilst lowering our national productivity. Consequently, Singapore's global competitiveness fell because of the higher cost and lower productivity. Just look at Singapore's prolonged economic under-performance against our regional neighbours ever since the high spikes. The spikes and troughs during LHL's administration are abnormal and unusual throughout Singapore's modern economic history. Look at the chart, before LHL took over in 2004, Singapore always had a healthy balance of economic growth. (falling within the two RED bands). Yes before 2004 and the word Globalization was invented, there were real and high-quality FTs too, coming in to complement Singapore's organic labour force, not replacing Singaporeans, making citizens under-employed in their own country after so much tax-dollars were spent on educating a typical Singaporean till tertiary levels. Singapore's economic development and balance in the last 12 years was severely disrupted and damaged by LHL's myopic FT policy. AFTERNOTE: Another thesis at the moment is that LHL, through his liberal immigration policy for short-term GDP spikes has unwittingly became the labour training school for ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asia (e.g. India). FTs who were allowed into Singapore got all the on-the-job trainings ahead of Singaporeans. FTs get all the relevant trainings in MNCs when jobless Singaporeans were asked to attend government-ran SkillsFuture that did not guarantee a job after the training. When the SG economy is good, these ASEAN & Indian FTs earned good money in Singapore, remit their earnings back to their home countries, whilst spending minimally to stimulate the domestic economy. Jobless or unemployed Singaporeans tighten their belt and spent lesser than before. Consequently, the wealth-creation effects in Singapore is diminished significantly even as the bodies packed in and the population grew to 5.7 million. Worse, when the SG economy is bad, FTs return to their home nations with the relevant skills-sets that MNCs desire to start their local operations. They become Singapore's strong regional competition for MNCs to set up base. These ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asian nations with their now skilled-labour and natural abundance of Land, easily wins these MNCs over at Singapore's expense. Singapore in a bad economy cannot re-build quickly because it is stucked with citizens with SkillsFuture skills that MNCs least require and hence Singapore and Singaporeans are losing the regional economic race, much less the global competition. Just go take a peek at the recent performance of the regional economies vis-a-vis Singapore's current state of economy. Pokka Green Tea wrote: Matter of time Singapore will be taken over by our ASEAN neighbours. I have said this before; Singapore cannot have an economy consisting of 40% foreign labour who accounts for 55% of the income tax paid year-on-year. Whilst, spin doctors under the LHL's Administration would declare proudly that HALF of Singaporeans DO NOT NEED to pay income taxes, it simply means 50% of Singaporeans are either jobless or earn less than S$20,000 per year (circa $1,700 per month). Last checked, compared to a Singapore citizen, foreigners in Singapore do not need to pay any extra income tax given the same earning power, nor do foreigners need to pay any National Service / National Defence taxes on their income earned in Singapore. Then why is it that foreigners in Singapore account for a much bigger percentage of the Singapore's total income taxes collected vis-a-vis local Singaporean income taxpayers? So if foreigners are earning more than Singaporeans (since they are paying proportionately more income tax than Singapore citizens); do they also spend more of their disposable income in Singapore to create a bigger wealth-creation effect in the larger domestic economy? Singaporeans as a whole need to think about the answers to such questions."

Ltd. (the \x93Company\x94), with 20 counts of submitting false information in work pass applications. The Accused faced another 16 charges for demanding a total of $34,500 in criminal kickbacks as a condition for the foreign employees\x92 continued employment with the Company, and six further charges of engaging in a conspiracy with another employer to hire foreign workers without valid work passes. The Company was also charged in court today for similar false declaration and kickback offences. In total, the Accused and the Company faced 42 charges and 36 charges respectively under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (\x93EFMA\x94). About the Case Investigations revealed that between November 2015 and March 2016, the Accused falsely declared on behalf of the company, the fixed monthly salaries of 20 foreign employees to be at least $4,800 so as to meet the Employment Pass minimum salary requirement. The accused allegedly knew that the foreign employees would be paid less than the declared salaries in their Employment Pass applications. Between September 2015 and February 2016, the accused demanded from 16 foreign employees, sums ranging from $1,500 to $2,200 as kickbacks. The demand for, or collection of kickbacks, or other benefits as a condition or financial guarantee for the employment or continued employment of a foreign employee, is prohibited under the EFMA. In addition, investigations also revealed that the the accused engaged in a conspiracy sometime in May 2014 with a Singapore PR , to employ six foreign workers to work without valid work passes. The kickbacks have since been returned to most of the affected workers. The case has been adjourned to 27 April 2017 in Court 23 at 9.00 am. can small space swear on her life they can catch ALL of these........."

But to even consider that, we have to first deal with the claim by DBS's Irving that we can't have quota for EP because our FTAs forbid it. None of the MIW have confirmed or denied it and it is because of such ambiguity that the discussion is starting from all over the place based on various assumptions. If the lack of control over EPs is due to the agreements, then we should be debating about the agreements first."

Jamus Lim: I appreciate the efforts by MOM to address PMET concerns. And that said, I would like to clarify if Minister Teo believes that simply slowing down the rate of EP and S Pass holders is sufficient to ensure that local PMETs do not get displaced. I say this in part because this strategy, while it\x92s a very blunt strategy, and for starters we need to take into account base effects. So, let me explain. Even if the rate of issuance has slowed, as Minister Teo has shared, it's misleading to actually compare the two. So for instance a 20% increase from 50 people, for example, is 10 people but a 10% increase from 200 people is in fact an increase of 20 people which is larger in absolute terms. Now, I understand that 35,000 people is larger than 9,000 but the point is that the slowdown in the rate of EP and S Pass issuance is less dramatic than Minister Teo claims. Moreover, we should be aware that of the effect of diminishing returns by which I mean, many PMET positions may already have been secured by foreign talent so it's no surprise that the number that is now required actually goes down. Josephine Teo: Thank you. Mr Speaker, I merely stated the facts. I did not say that one contribute, I did not say that one contributed to the other. I stated the facts, this is what they were. The facts. Are what they are. But I thought that I should perhaps address Dr Jamus Lim\x92s other questions. Are we satisfied with slowing down the rate of growth of EP and S Pass holders? The perspective that I'd like to share is this, ultimately, we have to ask ourselves, what does it take to help Singaporeans stay in employment; stay out of unemployment and over time, to achieve income growth to achieve retirement adequacy. Those are the four things that MOM is always looking at. Then we ask ourselves what is the best way to achieve these outcomes. If we can do so without adding to the number of EP, S Pass holders for that matter if we can do so continue to deliver good outcomes, help Singaporeans enjoy high employment, low unemployment, income growth and retirement adequacy without using more foreigners as complements to our workforce. If we can reduce the reliance on unproductive manpower-intensive methods of work in some of our business sectors today. If we can groom more Singaporeans, to take up the good jobs that we are creating, then of course, the answer is yes. But the important thing really is - what does it take to deliver and bring about these good outcomes for Singaporeans? And then we ask ourselves within the options that are available to us as a tiny red dot. How can we mitigate the difficulties, the shortcomings, and the worries that people have - legitimate worries that people have about a very sizable foreign workforce. We are aligned in that regard. I don't think that the destination that we want to head towards is a different one. But we have to ask ourselves, looking at the opportunities as well as the constraints we have as a tiny city-state which Mr Leong Mun Wai reminds us we\x92re a tiny city-state, we're not a tiny city and a tiny city-state has got its opportunities, but it also has its constraints - within those constraints what is the best way to help Singaporeans move forward. That has to be the answer and not some pre-determined ideas about what you bring it down to. Supposing we can bring it down to zero, even negative which is what has happened the first seven months of this year. I reported to members the first seven months of this year, total number of EP and S Pass holders have gone down by 22,000 - that's what it is. Suppose we can bring it down to a different number and so on but at the same time, the job opportunities for Singapore have shrunk. Your children, my children one day coming to us and say mom, dad, sorry, you know - can't find a decent job in Singapore anymore. And they really no longer have that opportunity of the six in ten jobs that we talked about - which many countries have found themselves similar in that sort of a situation, is that going to be better for us? Well we'll have to think very hard about whether the answer is yes, thank you."

It is short-sighted to only look at S pass and EP numbers. There is really no point. There must be a systemic change in terms of why our own people cannot secure jobs in those positions. Is low salary foreigners the cause? Then fix the salary gap. Is skill deficiency the cause? Then train and provide incentive for employers to groom its people. Protectionist stance will only weaken its people. Look at Malaysia, having quota for uni positions, government positions etc. It has caused their people to be lazy and complacent just because of birthright. I think you got it wrong. Malaysia protect a race and not their citizens. Even bangaladeshi has better rights than Malaysian Chinese. Secondly, companies always say Singaporeans got too much expectation. Need higher pay. Actually, the real reason is pay. Expectation is expected just like companies expect their staff to be a slave. If there is no MOM you think there is fairness in employment? There is always this tussle between employer and employee expectation. Just that employers are finding themselves losing hence need to find easier pray. Stop deluding yourself.

What if they can't get enough from this pool and no Singaporeans want those jobs? 1. Increase salary to a point where people will accept. 2. Close down or move out. It's important that we remove these low-paying jobs. The companies should really be asked to move overseas if they cannot accept our terms. Will Singaporeans get fewer jobs? Yes, but it's guaranteed that when they do get one it will be decent, and other things like productivity will increase because of how they need to pay more attention to what they're doing. We cannot allow the jobseeker's position to be disadvantageous by having much more supply than demand. That has been screwing us up very badly for the past decade. Now is year 2020, why do we still have $1.2k jobs? Those numbers are only acceptable if now is 1990."

Jamus Lim: I appreciate the efforts by MOM to address PMET concerns. And that said, I would like to clarify if Minister Teo believes that simply slowing down the rate of EP and S Pass holders is sufficient to ensure that local PMETs do not get displaced. I say this in part because this strategy, while it\x92s a very blunt strategy, and for starters we need to take into account base effects. So, let me explain. Even if the rate of issuance has slowed, as Minister Teo has shared, it's misleading to actually compare the two. So for instance a 20% increase from 50 people, for example, is 10 people but a 10% increase from 200 people is in fact an increase of 20 people which is larger in absolute terms. Now, I understand that 35,000 people is larger than 9,000 but the point is that the slowdown in the rate of EP and S Pass issuance is less dramatic than Minister Teo claims. Moreover, we should be aware that of the effect of diminishing returns by which I mean, many PMET positions may already have been secured by foreign talent so it's no surprise that the number that is now required actually goes down. Josephine Teo: Thank you. Mr Speaker, I merely stated the facts. I did not say that one contribute, I did not say that one contributed to the other. I stated the facts, this is what they were. The facts. Are what they are. But I thought that I should perhaps address Dr Jamus Lim\x92s other questions. Are we satisfied with slowing down the rate of growth of EP and S Pass holders? The perspective that I'd like to share is this, ultimately, we have to ask ourselves, what does it take to help Singaporeans stay in employment; stay out of unemployment and over time, to achieve income growth to achieve retirement adequacy. Those are the four things that MOM is always looking at. Then we ask ourselves what is the best way to achieve these outcomes. If we can do so without adding to the number of EP, S Pass holders for that matter if we can do so continue to deliver good outcomes, help Singaporeans enjoy high employment, low unemployment, income growth and retirement adequacy without using more foreigners as complements to our workforce. If we can reduce the reliance on unproductive manpower-intensive methods of work in some of our business sectors today. If we can groom more Singaporeans, to take up the good jobs that we are creating, then of course, the answer is yes. But the important thing really is - what does it take to deliver and bring about these good outcomes for Singaporeans? And then we ask ourselves within the options that are available to us as a tiny red dot. How can we mitigate the difficulties, the shortcomings, and the worries that people have - legitimate worries that people have about a very sizable foreign workforce. We are aligned in that regard. I don't think that the destination that we want to head towards is a different one. But we have to ask ourselves, looking at the opportunities as well as the constraints we have as a tiny city-state which Mr Leong Mun Wai reminds us we\x92re a tiny city-state, we're not a tiny city and a tiny city-state has got its opportunities, but it also has its constraints - within those constraints what is the best way to help Singaporeans move forward. That has to be the answer and not some pre-determined ideas about what you bring it down to. Supposing we can bring it down to zero, even negative which is what has happened the first seven months of this year. I reported to members the first seven months of this year, total number of EP and S Pass holders have gone down by 22,000 - that's what it is. Suppose we can bring it down to a different number and so on but at the same time, the job opportunities for Singapore have shrunk. Your children, my children one day coming to us and say mom, dad, sorry, you know - can't find a decent job in Singapore anymore. And they really no longer have that opportunity of the six in ten jobs that we talked about - which many countries have found themselves similar in that sort of a situation, is that going to be better for us? Well we'll have to think very hard about whether the answer is yes, thank you. How come only got excuses and no solutions. Waste of air time."

There's a reason why people suggest to implement quotas. It's to make numbers lesser by prohibiting NEW FTs from coming in like tsunami. So it will become 1 EP to 5,6,7 PMET jobs instead of making it 1 EP to 3/2/1 new PMET jobs. Not saying that implementing quotas is the best solution but it's something to consider right. Not using your brain is how Singapore gets destroyed by idiots. Or simpler Maths for u in Jamus's context: 4 EP holders holding PMET jobs minus 0 (no unemployment for them) = still 4 EP holders holding PMET jobs. Our 147,500 unemployed people how and our subsequent graduates from Universities how? Please la, you are crafting scenarios to suit your own arguments, of course you think you can never be wrong.

To me, that is an attempt to hide their lack of concern and action over the situation all these years. Folks are taking them to task over the supposed lack of any concern over the years in curbing FTs as well as giving more priority to EXISTING sinkies. Telling us how many locals fill those positions is only one side of the picture. For all we know, the ""increase"" in ""local employment"" could be more due to them converting PRs to citizens and thus quickly shoaring up the figure. But that does not indicate that they have made a concerted effort in curbing FTs or giving current sinkies more priorities. If you convert 35k PR to SC, that's another 35k added to ""singaporean"" headcount instantly. However, it doesn't change the fact that those jobs were never filled by sinkies in the first place nor was it because the gahment somehow found 35k new positions(especially pmet) for sinkies. That's to say, jobs that went to foreigners in the first place stayed with them till the end even if there is a change in residency status. It's that sort of obfuscation that irks us and makes us distrust them."

Since when did I say all Singaporeans can take the jobs currently held by EPs? Did I say to get rid of all EPs? You already have the mindset that this is what all Singaporeans want when you started this discussion and then you impose your opinions onto me? As for your ""statistics have shown that importing them led to positive job growth"", well it's true and Singaporeans have benefited from that. However going forward, as per what Dr Jamus said, will there be a diminishing returns if this importing of FTs keeps going on? We keep bringing in FTs to fill the PMET jobs but sooner or later most PMET jobs will be filled. What happens after that if nothing changes? Truth be told people are not angry because of them coming here to take on PMET jobs. Every country needs FTs because they possess certain skillsets (tech especially) which locals might not have (not to say all locals don't have it, just perhaps lesser). The real issue arises because the govt is not doing enough to limit them from coming in. If the situations remains as status quo, sooner or later we will not have enough PMET jobs to fill for both competent Singaporeans and FTs. Why are you being so defensive when Singaporeans are speaking up? It's just Singaporeans being concerned about their future. The problem might not be applicable to you or me (Lucky for me im not encountering the problem at the moment) but many people (both Singaporeans and PRs) are jobless now and even graduates from local Universities like NUS/NTU are not able to find jobs because the demand is simply not there anymore. Not to mention with more experienced FTs coming in, the career growth for Singaporeans fresh graduates are getting slower. How will people be able to secure a PMET job in the future? What I'm getting is that you want it to remain as per it is but you don't address the problems that people are starting to experience after the policy has been implemented for 15 years. But good for you I think you can be the next manpower minister."

She say until like this, machiam like assuming that sinkies behkan, all hopeless, cannot be groomed, cannot be developed. Don't give chance, how to groom? Maybe in high tech sector, in R&D, sinkies really no talent. Hire FTs is justified But other sectors? Singapore has been regional banking hub for centuries, don't have experienced bankers? Within companies, the laojiaos all no experience? Their years of experience within the company/industry less valuable than a FT who's parachuted in? Singapore's education system is always lauded as among world's bests, yet we are taking in FTs from 3rd world universities which don't even rank in the top 100, or maybe even top 1000. How is that a 'talent'? If all the FTs imported are satki harvard, MIT, oxbridge grads, llst. Can still argue that they are talents But on the other hand, these real talents probably won't need stoop so low to take up a measly $2k, $4k s-pass and EP job in SG"

Diminishing marginal utility is when the second and third stick of ice cream doesn\x92t taste as good as the first I dont major economics but i was a serveant major in world of warcraft and diminishing returns is a popular term in world of warcraft. I shall explain in layman term to you The diminishing return jamus referring is something like this: Say 10k foreigners created 20k jobs for Singaporeans in year 200x. Does 20k foreigners create 40k jobs for Singaporeans? Is there really 40k jobs created for Singaporeans? Jamus didnt think so. Infact he believes 20k foreigners only created at most another 20k jobs for Singaporeans. And with 30k foreigners now in Singapore, do we actually need 30k foreigners? And increasing or decreasing ep/sp every year at 10% compounding is actually not the same as increasing / decreasing ep/sp using a whole number. Percentages can be deceiving.

Jamus Lim: I appreciate the efforts by MOM to address PMET concerns. And that said, I would like to clarify if Minister Teo believes that simply slowing down the rate of EP and S Pass holders is sufficient to ensure that local PMETs do not get displaced. I say this in part because this strategy, while it\u2019s a very blunt strategy, and for starters we need to take into account base effects. So, let me explain. Even if the rate of issuance has slowed, as Minister Teo has shared, it's misleading to actually compare the two. So for instance a 20% increase from 50 people, for example, is 10 people but a 10% increase from 200 people is in fact an increase of 20 people which is larger in absolute terms. Now, I understand that 35,000 people is larger than 9,000 but the point is that the slowdown in the rate of EP and S Pass issuance is less dramatic than Minister Teo claims. Moreover, we should be aware that of the effect of diminishing returns by which I mean, many PMET positions may already have been secured by foreign talent so it's no surprise that the number that is now required actually goes down. Josephine Teo: Thank you. Mr Speaker, I merely stated the facts. I did not say that one contribute, I did not say that one contributed to the other. I stated the facts, this is what they were. The facts. Are what they are. But I thought that I should perhaps address Dr Jamus Lim\u2019s other questions. Are we satisfied with slowing down the rate of growth of EP and S Pass holders? The perspective that I'd like to share is this, ultimately, we have to ask ourselves, what does it take to help Singaporeans stay in employment; stay out of unemployment and over time, to achieve income growth to achieve retirement adequacy. Those are the four things that MOM is always looking at. Then we ask ourselves what is the best way to achieve these outcomes. If we can do so without adding to the number of EP, S Pass holders for that matter if we can do so continue to deliver good outcomes, help Singaporeans enjoy high employment, low unemployment, income growth and retirement adequacy without using more foreigners as complements to our workforce. If we can reduce the reliance on unproductive manpower-intensive methods of work in some of our business sectors today. If we can groom more Singaporeans, to take up the good jobs that we are creating, then of course, the answer is yes. But the important thing really is - what does it take to deliver and bring about these good outcomes for Singaporeans? And then we ask ourselves within the options that are available to us as a tiny red dot. How can we mitigate the difficulties, the shortcomings, and the worries that people have - legitimate worries that people have about a very sizable foreign workforce. We are aligned in that regard. I don't think that the destination that we want to head towards is a different one. But we have to ask ourselves, looking at the opportunities as well as the constraints we have as a tiny city-state which Mr Leong Mun Wai reminds us we\u2019re a tiny city-state, we're not a tiny city and a tiny city-state has got its opportunities, but it also has its constraints - within those constraints what is the best way to help Singaporeans move forward. That has to be the answer and not some pre-determined ideas about what you bring it down to. Supposing we can bring it down to zero, even negative which is what has happened the first seven months of this year. I reported to members the first seven months of this year, total number of EP and S Pass holders have gone down by 22,000 - that's what it is. Suppose we can bring it down to a different number and so on but at the same time, the job opportunities for Singapore have shrunk. Your children, my children one day coming to us and say mom, dad, sorry, you know - can't find a decent job in Singapore anymore. And they really no longer have that opportunity of the six in ten jobs that we talked about - which many countries have found themselves similar in that sort of a situation, is that going to be better for us? Well we'll have to think very hard about whether the answer is yes, thank you. JL ""would like to clarify if Minister Teo believes that simply slowing down the rate of EP and S Pass holders is sufficient to ensure that local PMETs do not get displaced. "" Just like Jo Two last time said slowing down the rate of traffic jam when more ERP r set up iirc. But does that help in congestion?....haha she got away last time with tis. She got away not answering too. Instead she juz said "" "" Are we satisfied with slowing down the rate of growth of EP and S Pass holders? "" Then started to distract with "" ask ourselves, what does it take to help Singaporeans stay in employment; stay out of unemployment and over time, to achieve income growth to achieve retirement adequacy. "" & distract everyone with Leong mun Leong........& say Sg has opportunities & constraints..."" Pay u million to tell moi something moi don't know? So the slowing down rate (although base has changed which is another point) is sufficient to to ensure enough jobs for sinkies or not? And why would reducing quota of SPass & EPs means less opportunities for sinkies? Wouldn't that be more choices for sinkies if there r vacancies to be filled?

It's a panadol temporary pain-relief at best. @SOS9112001. First, from the recent economic data and numbers, Globalization's no longer advantageous to Singapore. But You raised up a important point - that other countries will catch up with Singapore one day. Do you realize that by opening up Singapore economic borders unchecked, Singapore's actually training up our regional countries workforce to compete directly with Singapore one day? We have actually seen this happening when MNCs started to re-locate their Asia-Pacific business centres like operations centres to those former third-world country that has acquired more skilled labour who returned from Singapore after a couple of years? MNCs moved because Globalization or the mass influx of bodies into Singapore has increased the business cost of land for commercial, residential and leisure purposes. Coupled with the fact that our neighbouring countries' workforce has attained critical masses of skilled labour, MNCs are making the move that makes economic sense easily. What's the long-term impacts to Singapore as we accelerated the training and skill levels of our neighbouring competitors? The passe phenomenon of Globalization started in 2004 when LHL began his mass imports of FTs after he came into office in August, three days after SG39 National Day. Before LHL took over the premiership, Singapore always have had good and sustainable economic growth from the 70s, 80s throughout 90s and even early 2000s. Even before the word Globalization was coined, being a trading port-city, Singapore was always a free-port and open economy, resulting in our economy being well-correlated with the up and down movements of the global economy. After LHL opened the floodgates to the FTs from 2004 onwards, Singapore's economic cycles became extremely volatile. Just look at the abnormal high spikes in GDP after GFC from 2009 to 2011. And followed by prolonged trough periods of negative and low growths from 2011 till 2016, even when the rest of the world was enjoying healthy growth over the same period. LHL's use of FTs to boost economic growth is unsustainable and myopic. It's like using drugs such as cocaine - giving a super-short high, followed by a very bad and long slump. Worse, Singapore core economic capabilities and fundamentals were damaged during this period, characterised by high cost and low productivity. White-collared FTs replaced the highly educated Singaporeans in PMETs jobs at MNCs, not by meritocracy or better skills; but by their own countrymen networks. Blue-collared foreign workers were let in en-masse,  depressing the wages of Singaporean rank-and-file workers, whilst letting SME owners enjoy quick short-term profits without the need to invest into technology and machineries. All these lower quality FT workforce, together with their increasing numbers every year increased cost-pressure whilst lowering our national productivity. Consequently, Singapore's global competitiveness fell because of the higher cost and lower productivity. Just look at Singapore's prolonged economic under-performance against our regional neighbours ever since the high spikes. The spikes and troughs during LHL's administration are abnormal and unusual throughout Singapore's modern economic history. Look at the chart, before LHL took over in 2004, Singapore always had a healthy balance of economic growth. (falling within the two RED bands). Yes before 2004 and the word Globalization was invented, there were real and high-quality FTs too, coming in to complement Singapore's organic labour force, not replacing Singaporeans, making citizens under-employed in their own country after so much tax-dollars were spent on educating a typical Singaporean till tertiary levels. Singapore's economic development and balance in the last 12 years was severely disrupted and damaged by LHL's myopic FT policy. AFTERNOTE: Another thesis at the moment is that LHL, through his liberal immigration policy for short-term GDP spikes has unwittingly became the labour training school for ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asia (e.g. India). FTs who were allowed into Singapore got all the on-the-job trainings ahead of Singaporeans. FTs get all the relevant trainings in MNCs when jobless Singaporeans were asked to attend government-ran SkillsFuture that did not guarantee a job after the training. When the SG economy is good, these ASEAN & Indian FTs earned good money in Singapore, remit their earnings back to their home countries, whilst spending minimally to stimulate the domestic economy. Jobless or unemployed Singaporeans tighten their belt and spent lesser than before. Consequently, the wealth-creation effects in Singapore is diminished significantly even as the bodies packed in and the population grew to 5.7 million. Worse, when the SG economy is bad, FTs return to their home nations with the relevant skills-sets that MNCs desire to start their local operations. They become Singapore's strong regional competition for MNCs to set up base. These ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asian nations with their now skilled-labour and natural abundance of Land, easily wins these MNCs over at Singapore's expense. Singapore in a bad economy cannot re-build quickly because it is stucked with citizens with SkillsFuture skills that MNCs least require and hence Singapore and Singaporeans are losing the regional economic race, much less the global competition. Just go take a peek at the recent performance of the regional economies vis-a-vis Singapore's current state of economy. Pokka Green Tea wrote: Matter of time Singapore will be taken over by our ASEAN neighbours. I have said this before; Singapore cannot have an economy consisting of 40% foreign labour who accounts for 55% of the income tax paid year-on-year. Whilst, spin doctors under the LHL's Administration would declare proudly that HALF of Singaporeans DO NOT NEED to pay income taxes, it simply means 50% of Singaporeans are either jobless or earn less than S$20,000 per year (circa $1,700 per month). Last checked, compared to a Singapore citizen, foreigners in Singapore do not need to pay any extra income tax given the same earning power, nor do foreigners need to pay any National Service / National Defence taxes on their income earned in Singapore. Then why is it that foreigners in Singapore account for a much bigger percentage of the Singapore's total income taxes collected vis-a-vis local Singaporean income taxpayers? So if foreigners are earning more than Singaporeans (since they are paying proportionately more income tax than Singapore citizens); do they also spend more of their disposable income in Singapore to create a bigger wealth-creation effect in the larger domestic economy? Singaporeans as a whole need to think about the answers to such questions."

These are the base data that they need to have a meaningful statistic to show how good skills future is. . in the video just look at the first few seconds after jamus ended his question. She startled and a lot of ummms and errmmmms. looks to me she was totally flabbergasted by his question, which i feel is brilliant. Either she agree or disagree she is going to get screwed lol. This is the exact same type of question he asked Vivian during the GE dabate where he asked vivan how PAP evaluated the efficacy of it's policies and you see Vivan go one super big round making motherhood statements without using facts to answer the question lol. The thing is don't know if Jamus got follow up to question her more because the video ended there. the Full exchange was not shared which is the serious flaw with how our parliament sessions are made known.

But You raised up a important point - that other countries will catch up with Singapore one day. Do you realize that by opening up Singapore economic borders unchecked, Singapore's actually training up our regional countries workforce to compete directly with Singapore one day? We have actually seen this happening when MNCs started to re-locate their Asia-Pacific business centres like operations centres to those former third-world country that has acquired more skilled labour who returned from Singapore after a couple of years? MNCs moved because Globalization or the mass influx of bodies into Singapore has increased the business cost of land for commercial, residential and leisure purposes. Coupled with the fact that our neighbouring countries' workforce has attained critical masses of skilled labour, MNCs are making the move that makes economic sense easily. What's the long-term impacts to Singapore as we accelerated the training and skill levels of our neighbouring competitors? The passe phenomenon of Globalization started in 2004 when LHL began his mass imports of FTs after he came into office in August, three days after SG39 National Day. Before LHL took over the premiership, Singapore always have had good and sustainable economic growth from the 70s, 80s throughout 90s and even early 2000s. Even before the word Globalization was coined, being a trading port-city, Singapore was always a free-port and open economy, resulting in our economy being well-correlated with the up and down movements of the global economy. After LHL opened the floodgates to the FTs from 2004 onwards, Singapore's economic cycles became extremely volatile. Just look at the abnormal high spikes in GDP after GFC from 2009 to 2011. And followed by prolonged trough periods of negative and low growths from 2011 till 2016, even when the rest of the world was enjoying healthy growth over the same period. LHL's use of FTs to boost economic growth is unsustainable and myopic. It's like using drugs such as cocaine - giving a super-short high, followed by a very bad and long slump. Worse, Singapore core economic capabilities and fundamentals were damaged during this period, characterised by high cost and low productivity. White-collared FTs replaced the highly educated Singaporeans in PMETs jobs at MNCs, not by meritocracy or better skills; but by their own countrymen networks. Blue-collared foreign workers were let in en-masse,  depressing the wages of Singaporean rank-and-file workers, whilst letting SME owners enjoy quick short-term profits without the need to invest into technology and machineries. All these lower quality FT workforce, together with their increasing numbers every year increased cost-pressure whilst lowering our national productivity. Consequently, Singapore's global competitiveness fell because of the higher cost and lower productivity. Just look at Singapore's prolonged economic under-performance against our regional neighbours ever since the high spikes. The spikes and troughs during LHL's administration are abnormal and unusual throughout Singapore's modern economic history. Look at the chart, before LHL took over in 2004, Singapore always had a healthy balance of economic growth. (falling within the two RED bands). Yes before 2004 and the word Globalization was invented, there were real and high-quality FTs too, coming in to complement Singapore's organic labour force, not replacing Singaporeans, making citizens under-employed in their own country after so much tax-dollars were spent on educating a typical Singaporean till tertiary levels. Singapore's economic development and balance in the last 12 years was severely disrupted and damaged by LHL's myopic FT policy. AFTERNOTE: Another thesis at the moment is that LHL, through his liberal immigration policy for short-term GDP spikes has unwittingly became the labour training school for ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asia (e.g. India). FTs who were allowed into Singapore got all the on-the-job trainings ahead of Singaporeans. FTs get all the relevant trainings in MNCs when jobless Singaporeans were asked to attend government-ran SkillsFuture that did not guarantee a job after the training. When the SG economy is good, these ASEAN & Indian FTs earned good money in Singapore, remit their earnings back to their home countries, whilst spending minimally to stimulate the domestic economy. Jobless or unemployed Singaporeans tighten their belt and spent lesser than before. Consequently, the wealth-creation effects in Singapore is diminished significantly even as the bodies packed in and the population grew to 5.7 million. Worse, when the SG economy is bad, FTs return to their home nations with the relevant skills-sets that MNCs desire to start their local operations. They become Singapore's strong regional competition for MNCs to set up base. These ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asian nations with their now skilled-labour and natural abundance of Land, easily wins these MNCs over at Singapore's expense. Singapore in a bad economy cannot re-build quickly because it is stucked with citizens with SkillsFuture skills that MNCs least require and hence Singapore and Singaporeans are losing the regional economic race, much less the global competition. Just go take a peek at the recent performance of the regional economies vis-a-vis Singapore's current state of economy. I have said this before; Singapore cannot have an economy consisting of 40% foreign labour who accounts for 55% of the income tax paid year-on-year. Whilst, spin doctors under the LHL's Administration would declare proudly that HALF of Singaporeans DO NOT NEED to pay income taxes, it simply means 50% of Singaporeans are either jobless or earn less than S$20,000 per year (circa $1,700 per month). Last checked, compared to a Singapore citizen, foreigners in Singapore do not need to pay any extra income tax given the same earning power, nor do foreigners need to pay any National Service / National Defence taxes on their income earned in Singapore. Then why is it that foreigners in Singapore account for a much bigger percentage of the Singapore's total income taxes collected vis-a-vis local Singaporean income taxpayers? So if foreigners are earning more than Singaporeans (since they are paying proportionately more income tax than Singapore citizens); do they also spend more of their disposable income in Singapore to create a bigger wealth-creation effect in the larger domestic economy? Singaporeans as a whole need to think about the answers to such questions."

Just look at Singapore's prolonged economic under-performance against our regional neighbours ever since the high spikes. The spikes and troughs during LHL's administration are abnormal and unusual throughout Singapore's modern economic history. Look at the chart, before LHL took over in 2004, Singapore always had a healthy balance of economic growth. (falling within the two RED bands). Yes before 2004 and the word Globalization was invented, there were real and high-quality FTs too, coming in to complement Singapore's organic labour force, not replacing Singaporeans, making citizens under-employed in their own country after so much tax-dollars were spent on educating a typical Singaporean till tertiary levels. Singapore's economic development and balance in the last 12 years was severely disrupted and damaged by LHL's myopic FT policy. AFTERNOTE: Another thesis at the moment is that LHL, through his liberal immigration policy for short-term GDP spikes has unwittingly became the labour training school for ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asia (e.g. India). FTs who were allowed into Singapore got all the on-the-job trainings ahead of Singaporeans. FTs get all the relevant trainings in MNCs when jobless Singaporeans were asked to attend government-ran SkillsFuture that did not guarantee a job after the training. When the SG economy is good, these ASEAN & Indian FTs earned good money in Singapore, remit their earnings back to their home countries, whilst spending minimally to stimulate the domestic economy. Jobless or unemployed Singaporeans tighten their belt and spent lesser than before. Consequently, the wealth-creation effects in Singapore is diminished significantly even as the bodies packed in and the population grew to 5.7 million. Worse, when the SG economy is bad, FTs return to their home nations with the relevant skills-sets that MNCs desire to start their local operations. They become Singapore's strong regional competition for MNCs to set up base. These ASEAN and Sub-Continent Asian nations with their now skilled-labour and natural abundance of Land, easily wins these MNCs over at Singapore's expense. Singapore in a bad economy cannot re-build quickly because it is stucked with citizens with SkillsFuture skills that MNCs least require and hence Singapore and Singaporeans are losing the regional economic race, much less the global competition. Just go take a peek at the recent performance of the regional economies vis-a-vis Singapore's current state of economy. I have said this before; Singapore cannot have an economy consisting of 40% foreign labour who accounts for 55% of the income tax paid year-on-year. Whilst, spin doctors under the LHL's Administration would declare proudly that HALF of Singaporeans DO NOT NEED to pay income taxes, it simply means 50% of Singaporeans are either jobless or earn less than S$20,000 per year (circa $1,700 per month). Last checked, compared to a Singapore citizen, foreigners in Singapore do not need to pay any extra income tax given the same earning power, nor do foreigners need to pay any National Service / National Defence taxes on their income earned in Singapore. Then why is it that foreigners in Singapore account for a much bigger percentage of the Singapore's total income taxes collected vis-a-vis local Singaporean income taxpayers? So if foreigners are earning more than Singaporeans (since they are paying proportionately more income tax than Singapore citizens); do they also spend more of their disposable income in Singapore to create a bigger wealth-creation effect in the larger domestic economy? Singaporeans as a whole need to think about the answers to such questions. Brother, you should put your postings into a blog menz"

Savantrainmaker wrote: @WoollyMammoth and others who are arguing the case for Globalization blindly without a valid basis, you would need to look at the both the historical and current facts and figures before regurgitating the SG mass media line that Globalization is the solution to all of SG's economic problems. It's a panadol temporary pain-relief at best. @SOS9112001. First, from the recent economic data and numbers, Globalization's no longer advantageous to Singapore. But You raised up a important point - that other countries will catch up with Singapore one day. Do you realize that by opening up Singapore economic borders unchecked, Singapore's actually training up our regional countries workforce to compete directly with Singapore one day? We have actually seen this happening when MNCs started to re-locate their Asia-Pacific business centres like operations centres to those former third-world country that has acquired more skilled labour who returned from Singapore after a couple of years? MNCs moved because Globalization or the mass influx of bodies into Singapore has increased the business cost of land for commercial, residential and leisure purposes. Coupled with the fact that our neighbouring countries' workforce has attained critical masses of skilled labour, MNCs are making the move that makes economic sense easily. What's the long-term impacts to Singapore as we accelerated the training and skill levels of our neighbouring competitors? The passe phenomenon of Globalization started in 2004 when LHL began his mass imports of FTs after he came into office in August, three days after SG39 National Day. Before LHL took over the premiership, Singapore always have had good and sustainable economic growth from the 70s, 80s throughout 90s and even early 2000s. Even before the word Globalization was coined, being a trading port-city, Singapore was always a free-port and open economy, resulting in our economy being well-correlated with the up and down movements of the global economy. After LHL opened the floodgates to the FTs from 2004 onwards, Singapore's economic cycles became extremely volatile. Just look at the abnormal high spikes in GDP after GFC from 2009 to 2011. And followed by prolonged trough periods of negative and low growths from 2011 till 2016, even when the rest of the world was enjoying healthy growth over the same period. LHL's use of FTs to boost economic growth is unsustainable and myopic. It's like using drugs such as cocaine - giving a super-short high, followed by a very bad and long slump. Worse, Singapore core economic capabilities and fundamentals were damaged during this period, characterised by high cost and low productivity. White-collared FTs replaced the highly educated Singaporeans in PMETs jobs at MNCs, not by meritocracy or better skills; but by their own countrymen networks. Blue-collared foreign workers were let in en-masse,  depressing the wages of Singaporean rank-and-file workers, whilst letting SME owners enjoy quick short-term profits without the need to invest into technology and machineries. All these lower quality FT workforce, together with their increasing numbers every year increased cost-pressure whilst lowering our national productivity. Consequently, Singapore's global competitiveness fell because of the higher cost and lower productivity.

""So I wanted to clarify that that alone was a very blunt instrument, and it is insufficient. And more importantly, I also wanted to clarify that the numbers themselves are misleading."" He referred to Teo's statement that the growth rate of passes were reduced to almost zero this year, but said that everyone knew the reason, as overall unemployment rates have shot up. Therefore, it is not surprising that the number of passes fell dramatically, said Lim. ""So we shouldn't be looking at pure numbers in order to make our conclusions about whether PMETs are being displaced, or not,"" Lim said . SO Jamus not only pwned Jo Teo but Jessica Tan also."

Video not shown. https://mothership.sg/2020/09/jamus-...wilF_yv-m6Iis4 Jessica Tan seeks clarification from Jamus Lim Jessica Tan, People's Action Party (PAP) MP and Deputy Speaker of Parliament, later asked Lim for a clarification: ""What is his recommendation, and what is his proposal in terms of the approach or the numbers that we should take?"" Lim clarified that his stance was that reducing the growth rate of EP and S Passes is a ""blunt instrument"", and that thinking this would be sufficient is misleading. He said Teo already clarified that, in fact, the ministry was not aiming for a ""single number"" to reduce passes, and that he wanted to ""think more flexibly"" about how to approach this issue. But Tan did not stop there, rising again to ask Lim another question. She said that her colleagues in the House had not put forward the idea that reduction of the growth in passes was sufficient. ""It is not the only thing that needs to be watched,"" she said, and added that it has to be done in a balanced way. Tan seeks further clarification from Jamus Lim She again asked for Lim's approach: ""Are you suggesting that we stop the number of EPs completely, or S passes? What would the implications of that be, and what would that mean for companies... What would it mean for Singaporean jobs [that] need to be complemented by some of these foreign workers as well?"" Lim then clarified that he wasn't referring to the other members of the House, but specifically to Teo's speech: ""She had explicitly said that at the lower end, one instrument they were using was through the restriction of quotas of EP and S Pass."" ""So I wanted to clarify that that alone was a very blunt instrument, and it is insufficient. And more importantly, I also wanted to clarify that the numbers themselves are misleading."" He referred to Teo's statement that the growth rate of passes were reduced to almost zero this year, but said that everyone knew the reason, as overall unemployment rates have shot up. Therefore, it is not surprising that the number of passes fell dramatically, said Lim. ""So we shouldn't be looking at pure numbers in order to make our conclusions about whether PMETs are being displaced, or not,"" Lim said . SO Jamus not only pwned Jo Teo but Jessica Tan also. Jessica Tan wear mask upside down and queue for microphone when there were 5 microphones available.  How silly."

It didn't helped that many were projecting that India, with its higher population growth and absence of 'Stop@1' baby policy would take over China as the economic power by 2020-2030. Many including LHL bought into this economic thesis. LHL as DPM and Finance Minister in the early 2000s was thus very keen to push through co-operation with India on Temasek's behalf because it was also Ching's 'pet-project' as ED then transform Temasek's portfolio from Singapore-centric to a more regional and global portfolio. But the green-dragon couple's efforts in the early 2000 met with resistance from GCT (as the PM) and LKY (who was still SM in the cabinet). LKY has opined that India will never be as great as China as an economic power. LKY has an deep understanding of India since our common colonial times. He understood that the very 'glue' that is holding the various divisive states of India together - DEMOCRACY - is also the same source of trouble for such a big country. In short, LKY understood that India will have an ""Indian Chiefs"" problem because every state chief wanted a say and safeguard their home states and economic turfs in the Indian parliament. This is contrasted to the autocratic communist system in China where every provincial chief will align with Zhong Nan Ha's decisions or get their whole family 'executed'. So in this sense, LKY understood that China will be able to make country-unified economic decisions faster and be able to developed faster economically. And this is something that India can never achieve, even if they  have double the population of China. In fact, the more people India have, the messier their problems and slower their progress will be. This is a key strategic cross-cultural economic point that LHL nor his million-dollars yesmen cabinet never understood with his insistence to open up the Indian market."

Video not shown. https://mothership.sg/2020/09/jamus-...wilF_yv-m6Iis4 Jessica Tan seeks clarification from Jamus Lim Jessica Tan, People's Action Party (PAP) MP and Deputy Speaker of Parliament, later asked Lim for a clarification: ""What is his recommendation, and what is his proposal in terms of the approach or the numbers that we should take?"" Lim clarified that his stance was that reducing the growth rate of EP and S Passes is a ""blunt instrument"", and that thinking this would be sufficient is misleading. He said Teo already clarified that, in fact, the ministry was not aiming for a ""single number"" to reduce passes, and that he wanted to ""think more flexibly"" about how to approach this issue. But Tan did not stop there, rising again to ask Lim another question. She said that her colleagues in the House had not put forward the idea that reduction of the growth in passes was sufficient. ""It is not the only thing that needs to be watched,"" she said, and added that it has to be done in a balanced way. Tan seeks further clarification from Jamus Lim She again asked for Lim's approach: ""Are you suggesting that we stop the number of EPs completely, or S passes? What would the implications of that be, and what would that mean for companies... What would it mean for Singaporean jobs [that] need to be complemented by some of these foreign workers as well?"" Lim then clarified that he wasn't referring to the other members of the House, but specifically to Teo's speech: ""She had explicitly said that at the lower end, one instrument they were using was through the restriction of quotas of EP and S Pass."" "" So I wanted to clarify that that alone was a very blunt instrument, and it is insufficient. And more importantly, I also wanted to clarify that the numbers themselves are misleading."" He referred to Teo's statement that the growth rate of passes were reduced to almost zero this year, but said that everyone knew the reason, as overall unemployment rates have shot up. Therefore, it is not surprising that the number of passes fell dramatically, said Lim. ""So we shouldn't be looking at pure numbers in order to make our conclusions about whether PMETs are being displaced, or not,"" Lim said . SO Jamus not only pwned Jo Teo but Jessica Tan also."

Since we have given so many EPs and SPs to foreigners ALREADY , there are not many available PMET jobs left. Hence why the number of EPs/SPs are slowing, simply because there is not enough supply for EP/SP PMET applicants as they have already filled a large number of PMET jobs ."

I think you don't get his points. https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...met-jobs-issue Quote: ..The newly elected MP for Sengkang GRC sought to find out if this strategy \x97 which he described as a \x93very blunt instrument\x94\x97 was the Government\x92s only approach to prevent local PMETs from being displaced. In Mrs Teo\x92s speech, she said that in the past five years, the number of EP and S Pass holders had grown by less than 9,000 annually on average, compared to 30,400 in the 2009-2014 five-year period. At the same time, the number of locals in PMET jobs had grown on average by 35,000 a year in the past five years. But Assoc Prof Lim countered that it is misleading to draw conclusions from the two statistics, adding that the issue should be looked at not by how much the numbers have grown, but in absolute terms. \x93I understand that 35,000 people is larger than 9,000 but the point is that the slowdown in the rate of EP and S Pass issuance is less dramatic than Minister Teo claims,\x94 he said.. (Followed by Jo Teo's lengthy response) Quote: Ms Jessica Tan, a PAP MP for East Coast GRC, then jumped in to ask Assoc Prof Lim to elaborate on what he thought the best approach should be. Assoc Prof Lim reiterated his argument that simply decreasing the growth of EP and S Pass holders was insufficient. \x93What we want, ultimately, is the ability to think more flexibly about how we approach PMET issues and potential displacement by the foreign workforce.\x94 But Ms Tan replied that no member of the House had said that the only way to solve the PMET issue was to simply cut the number of work visa holders. \x93Are you suggesting that we stop the number of EPs or S Passes completely?\x94 she asked. Assoc Prof Lim said he had brought up his question because Mrs Teo had, in her speech, said that the Government\x92s raising of the qualifying salary for foreign PMETs to get EPs would, in effect, push foreign PMETs at the lower end of the salary range to the mid-skilled S Pass level, where there are quota controls."

The king held up a jug full of milk - signifying that India is full. The wise zororastians elder put a pinch of sugar inside the milk, sweetening the milk. He then told the king that if zororastians are allowed in India, zororastians will not convert his people and will contribute to his kingdom as seen in tne sweeten milk.

Hi PAP IB 1) On what basis do you claim Jamus Lim had no experience to teach? As an Assistant Professor teaching international economics, how would his experience in private sector not be relevant? 1999-1999 JPMorgan (analyst, emerging markets sales, trading research) 2000- 2002 ISAS (research assoc, regional economic studies) 2) On what basis do you claim that Assoc Professor must have prior teaching experience? Pure academics are not sought after by schools to teach international economics. How come you dont even know this fact? Private sector experience is very much sought after by universities to teach students. Students are the customers that provide revenue to the school. Students want to learn from people that successfully compete and succeed in the real world Students do not want some pure academic that teach from textbook with zero private sector experience. Pure academics have never compete in their life before and shown that they can succeed in corporate world.

This will help to mitigate the cost of living which many residents are concerned with. dream on. elites buddies-buddies with their land, properties and businesses, want the population ponzi to drive their assets up! now you realise pap win-win is they win, average sinkies lose or win tiny. the law of win, is someone must lose.."

It will very soon crash and Singapore will go bankrupt. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...-wage-13079634 Tharman Shanmugaratnam is another idiot who does not agree on wage increase for the lower tier society. He is hell bent on suppressing the lower wage workers and making them live without dignity on a low wage. Wages should be evenly spread out and government should mandate companies not awarding their high ranking staffs with millions in wages. This will only widen wage gap and only benefit only a few people making them ultra rich.

Some jobs, like the one i have, is so ruined because of how easy it is to replace people. It is so bad, bosses do not care at all. They don't bother to retain people, or give them a fair salary, because someone cheaper is always available to replace staff. Companies can always complain cannot find locals willing to take up these jobs, then hire foreigners, but they never ask themselves why locals don't want to do these jobs. her words are contradicting in the first place if dont want discrimination. just impose quota on foreigners. impose quota on EP. end of story. ask companies not to discriminate, but still allow unlimited EP and foreigners, which indirectly encourages discrimination. then what is the point ? the 2 seems to contradict each other ?"

Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo turned emotional on Sep. 1 in Parliament, as she wrapped up a speech on job anxieties among Singaporeans. In the conclusion of her speech, Teo cited the stories of three workers whom she had interacted with, who had either received help from various job-related schemes, or shared their concerns with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). This drew her subsequent statement, delivered in a teary tone: ""Please know that you too are always in our hearts. However long this storm lasts, MOM will walk the journey together with you. However tough it may be, we will help you bounce back."" MOM hears the concerns of PMETs in their 40s and 50s Acknowledging that the Covid-19 pandemic had placed stress on Singapore's workforce, Teo added that the government understood the anxieties of PMETs in their 40s and 50s, as well as their concerns about fair treatment and opportunities. She added, ""We also appreciate the need to keep supporting workers who earn less to grow their incomes over time and address income inequality."" She then stated that the three workers ""remind the MOM team what our work is about."" ""We are always here, listening to their struggles, thinking deeply about the support they need, recognising the constraints, adjusting policies in their best interests, finding better ways to protect them against unfair practices and ultimately, helping them get onto the path of growth in their work lives that they so deserve."" https://mothership.sg/2020/09/josephine-teo-parliament-cry/"

Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo turned emotional on Sep. 1 in Parliament, as she wrapped up a speech on job anxieties among Singaporeans. In the conclusion of her speech, Teo cited the stories of three workers whom she had interacted with, who had either received help from various job-related schemes, or shared their concerns with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). This drew her subsequent statement, delivered in a teary tone: ""Please know that you too are always in our hearts. However long this storm lasts, MOM will walk the journey together with you. However tough it may be, we will help you bounce back."" MOM hears the concerns of PMETs in their 40s and 50s Acknowledging that the Covid-19 pandemic had placed stress on Singapore's workforce, Teo added that the government understood the anxieties of PMETs in their 40s and 50s, as well as their concerns about fair treatment and opportunities. She added, ""We also appreciate the need to keep supporting workers who earn less to grow their incomes over time and address income inequality."" She then stated that the three workers ""remind the MOM team what our work is about.""

Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo turned emotional on Sep. 1 in Parliament, as she wrapped up a speech on job anxieties among Singaporeans. In the conclusion of her speech, Teo cited the stories of three workers whom she had interacted with, who had either received help from various job-related schemes, or shared their concerns with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). This drew her subsequent statement, delivered in a teary tone: ""Please know that you too are always in our hearts. However long this storm lasts, MOM will walk the journey together with you. However tough it may be, we will help you bounce back."" MOM hears the concerns of PMETs in their 40s and 50s Acknowledging that the Covid-19 pandemic had placed stress on Singapore's workforce, Teo added that the government understood the anxieties of PMETs in their 40s and 50s, as well as their concerns about fair treatment and opportunities. She added, ""We also appreciate the need to keep supporting workers who earn less to grow their incomes over time and address income inequality."" She then stated that the three workers ""remind the MOM team what our work is about."" ""We are always here, listening to their struggles, thinking deeply about the support they need, recognising the constraints, adjusting policies in their best interests, finding better ways to protect them against unfair practices and ultimately, helping them get onto the path of growth in their work lives that they so deserve."" https://mothership.sg/2020/09/joseph...arliament-cry/"

Even if they resigned today to take responsibility of their mishandling will not redeem their failure and atone for their ""sin"" for not taking care of the people who had entrusted their lives to them believing that they will help them to make their life better but on the contrarily, they suffered more and affected their whole family."

So many tiongs fleeing china every year and throwing away their tiong citizenship to acquire western citizenship especially american green card. They are willing to work in this kind of jobs because their motherland pay them significantly lesser for the same amount of work. Even tiongs discriminate each other, go see how they treat those workers from rural areas doing manual labour. LMAO!

Due to differing ideology,  compliance and enforcement becomes difficult.  In jurisdictions where the law makes mask mandatory,  some don't wear.   In a democracy,  if the law is deemed faulty,  challenge the law.  However,  the non-mask wearers did not challenge the law in courts.  Instead they contracted and spread Covid throughout the community.   Causing greater harm to others.  A feature of the underlying behaviour is: Defiance Non-compliance with laws promulgated by others whom the non-wearers deemed to disagree or are from a different class. In Singapore,  who are the major violators of mask rule and social distancing?   From anecdotal examples, one can already tell where they come from. Actually,  it is defiance,  non-respect and self-centredness. We can dwell into Legal Net and analyse the background of violators in Singapore since circuit breaker started."

Lee Kuan Yew and S Rajaratnan respectfully sought India's help during early days of our independence but SG was turned down.

However, he remained relatively inactive within the party until 2015, when the then Secretary-General Hazel Poa resigned in protest over the party\x92s policy regarding multi-cornered contests.[17] Just a week before the 2015 General Elections, the National Solidarity Party approached Lim Tean and asked if he would serve as the new Secretary-General. Despite the relatively short time before the election, Lim Tean accepted and along with a team of candidates contested Tampines GRC, receiving 24.9% of the votes cast. He is the only person to ever be appointed to the post of Secretary-General without having held any party office in Singapore.[18] In May 2017, Lim Tean resigned as Secretary-General of the NSP, citing disagreements with the party.[19] [20][21] He was from NSP, the same party Nicole came from, and both left."

She is one of the key architects behind three 5-year Enabling Masterplans for the Disabled in Singapore.[11] Phua is also the co-founder[12] and former acting principal[9] of Pathlight School, the first special school for autistic children in Singapore.[9] The school offers mainstream curriculum and life skills education to its students.[8][13] A believer in helping autistic people realise their potential and integrate into society,[8][14] Phua helped develop many of the school's programmes.[15] These include employability skills training through a student-run caf\xe9,[16] specialised vocational training,[14] and satellite classes where Pathlight students mix with mainstream students.[15] In four years, enrolment increased tenfold[17] and the school attracted media attention for its impact on students.[13][14] Continuing her volunteer efforts, Phua continues to supervise two charities \u2013 Autism Resource Centre (Singapore) and Autism Association (Singapore), and two special schools \u2013 Pathlight School and Eden School.[11]"

And the only thing they can do at this moment will be to take down his details and forward it to NTUC or IRAS for clarifications. MPs also cannot bend the rules if the uncle didn't qualify for the grant and after being rejected a few times, there must be some criteria he dint meet. He is also feeling unbalanced because 'others' got it but not him. If it is the Opposition member, they will also be doing the same thing .. take down his details and help him write emails.

During the 1991 General Election, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong brought up the hand-washing incident at an election rally by saying: ""After shaking hands with a fishmonger, she washed her hands. But she has not done this since."" After Goh did that, Seet's supporters intuitively knew she was going to lose and were reportedly angry that the incident was brought up again. Ling won 12,037 votes (51.4%) to Seet's 11,383 (48.6%). She also said Goh could have clarified with her before making those remarks at the rally. ""Did the press ask me why I washed my hands? No. Did the then Prime Minister ask me? No. Had both asked for an explanation, I would've told them. I didn't know about the issue until the PM spoke about it at the General Election rally."""

The dorm outbreak obviously has done great damage to our reputation and probably our economy as well.

Don\u2019t anyhow! https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-covid-19-task Singapore GE2020: Lawrence Wong refutes SDP chair Paul Tambyah's remarks on Covid-19 task force as 'baseless and false' SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has rebutted remarks by Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah that the multi-ministry Covid-19 task force did not rely on the advice of medical experts in its work. Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions. ""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."""

Don\x92t anyhow! https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-covid-19-task Singapore GE2020: Lawrence Wong refutes SDP chair Paul Tambyah's remarks on Covid-19 task force as 'baseless and false' SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has rebutted remarks by Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah that the multi-ministry Covid-19 task force did not rely on the advice of medical experts in its work. Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions. ""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."" In before PAP IBs reply Then can PAP Minister Lawrence Wong disclose the doctors names? How come PAP always practice no blame culture? No accountability at all. Dont hide behind anonymity. Like SGH Hepatitis C outbreak which caused 8 deaths, PAP Health Minister Gan Kim Yong refused to disclose the lapses in Parliament (so that deceased families cannot sue SGH for medical negligence). Gan Kim Yong also refused to disclose the names of SGH management and staff involved in the lapses (no blame culture)."

If we extrapolate from this, we don't need goverment and ministers at all, just expert panels. Ultimately, at the end of the day, even when experts give advise the  decision makers in the task force can override and implement their decisions.  This is why they have their roles to evaluate and balance out other non-field of  expertise considerations (economy, social impact etc...) In this case, the Task Force also picks and chooses what experts they want to listen to as well. It is not uncommon to have dissenting advise from experts in every field. There were at least 4 doctors' advice to mask up have also been deliberately refuted by the Task Force: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ld-wear-a-mask . That response by the Task Force was way back in Feb 12. They made a decision then and they acknowledge that decision made back then. Or perhaps they had expert advice when making the statement ""Coronavirus not as bad as SARS"" back in Jan. I'm speculating they made that masks for healthy decision not to create an even worse mask shortage as the manufacturing situation was dire then with China still under lockdown and it is more critical to supply medical staff. Just stand by your decision and we can move back on to fighting COVID pls."

If we extrapolate from this, we don't need goverment and ministers at all, just expert panels. Ultimately, at the end of the day, even when experts give advise the  decision makers in the task force can override and implement their decisions.  This is why they have their roles to evaluate and balance out other non-field of  expertise considerations (economy, social impact etc...) In this case, the Task Force also picks and chooses what experts they want to listen to as well. It is not uncommon to have dissenting advise from experts in every field. There were at least 4 doctors' advice to mask up have also been deliberately refuted by the Task Force: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ld-wear-a-mask . That response by the Task Force was way back in Feb 12. They made a decision then and they acknowledge that decision made back then. Or perhaps they had expert advice when making the statement ""Coronavirus not as bad as SARS"" back in Jan. I'm speculating they made that masks for healthy decision not to create an even worse mask shortage as the manufacturing situation was dire then with China still under lockdown and it is more critical to supply medical staff.

Don\x92t anyhow! https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-covid-19-task Singapore GE2020: Lawrence Wong refutes SDP chair Paul Tambyah's remarks on Covid-19 task force as 'baseless and false' SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has rebutted remarks by Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah that the multi-ministry Covid-19 task force did not rely on the advice of medical experts in its work. Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions. ""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."" Doctors just thrown under the bus.."

Right now we have to count on is common sense and best practices based upon what we know and info from similar past breakouts. I believe back then we were still in the 100% total isolation mode with limited testing capacity that's why they were adamant against flooding our hospital full just to keep public construction going. Earlier detection could have led to faster measures then to prevent explosion in so many dormitories. Again, this was not acknowledged and they could have decided to switch to dorm isolation. Furthermore, the seeds of this problem was planted even further way back with overcrowded dorms which already has seen past outbreaks.

Don\x92t anyhow! https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-covid-19-task Singapore GE2020: Lawrence Wong refutes SDP chair Paul Tambyah's remarks on Covid-19 task force as 'baseless and false' SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has rebutted remarks by Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah that the multi-ministry Covid-19 task force did not rely on the advice of medical experts in its work. Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions. ""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."" This is even worse. Why are our ministers following medical experts and not make decision on its own? Just like the WHO. Say don't wear mask, then we don't wear mask."

That would not be ideal,\x94 she said at the market in Jalan Besar GRC, where she is anchoring the People's Action Party's team. But LW says it was not a MOM decision.

LW should talk to JT and get their stories straight. Who is responsible for the decision? MOM or MOH? Anyway, to me, it doesn't matter. PAP is responsible. If JT is right, then PAP is so incompetent that they can't even manage testing FW safely. Instead, they left the FW - many of whom were infected - to further spread the infection for weeks. PAP couldn't come up with a plan to test all the FW safely? What? The ""great"" PAP couldn't manage this? How many FW are there anyway? 1 million? 5 million? 10 million? If you can't come up with a plan to manage and safely test all FW, then just resign and let someone competent do it. As for LW statement, I don't like people passing the buck. Instead of debating whether MOM or MOH is responsible, the minister should just accept responsibility on behalf of the multi-disciplinary task force. Or, GKY should have accepted responsibility.

Don\x92t anyhow! https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-covid-19-task Singapore GE2020: Lawrence Wong refutes SDP chair Paul Tambyah's remarks on Covid-19 task force as 'baseless and false' SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has rebutted remarks by Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah that the multi-ministry Covid-19 task force did not rely on the advice of medical experts in its work. Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions. ""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts requested MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."" Pls name all these doctors and experts so we can avoid them in future and their descendants and ancestors will know who bring glory to them for all 18th generations! Lol"

Don\u2019t anyhow! https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...-covid-19-task Singapore GE2020: Lawrence Wong refutes SDP chair Paul Tambyah's remarks on Covid-19 task force as 'baseless and false' SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Lawrence Wong has rebutted remarks by Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah that the multi-ministry Covid-19 task force did not rely on the advice of medical experts in its work. Saying the allegations were ""baseless and false"", Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said on Sunday (July 5) that it has always relied on scientific evidence and the advice of medical experts in coming up with decisions. ""They are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us,"" he said, adding that this has been the case since the outbreak started. Mr Wong also addressed Professor Tambyah's remarks that the Manpower Ministry (MOM) was to blame for an advisory that asked employers not to get workers tested. He noted that the advisory was issued in February after an infection at Seletar Aerospace Park. Many employers subsequently asked their workers to go to A&E departments in hospitals to get tested and certified Covid-19 negative so they could work. ""(Prof Tambyah) has got his facts wrong. It was not MOM that issued the advice unilaterally. Doctors and experts REQUESTED MOM to put out the advisory to employers,"" said Mr Wong, in an interview with reporters at the People's Action Party's Woodgrove branch in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. ""I fully respect (Prof) Tambyah as a leading expert in the field, but it is disappointing that he has chosen to distort facts just to score some political points,"" he added. The minister said he was fully prepared for the SDP to do such a thing, but he had ""expected better"" of Prof Tambyah. Singaporeans will ultimately ""see and judge what we have done"", said the minister, adding that Covid-19 infection rates have been kept low in the community, and major operations have been mounted in the foreign worker dormitories to test and clear all the workers. ""We are on track to completing this major task very soon...and importantly, we have kept our fatality rates in Singapore among the lowest in the world. These are the things we have focused on throughout this period."" When asked how much he is on the ground during the election campaign, Mr Wong replied that the work of the task force continues even during this period. ""So whatever spare time on top of that work, that's where I come in to the ground to meet my residents. That's the situation,"" he said. ""The work is important because we do not want to compromise at all, the work that we have done and the requirement to keep Singaporeans safe."" Doctors or experts can make recommendations, but it is the decision maker (in this case, MINISTER Josephine Teo) who decide whether to adopt the recommendations or not. Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making Request vs. Decision Making We don't pay minister millions for them to collate request (a secretary could do that).

All these contributed to our high rate of positive cases. If there weren't these mistakes, and if we handled as well as taiwan, hong kong, vietnam who closed off early and were strict in their measures, maybe we wouldn't have to dig into our reserve by so much to ""tide the nation through covid 19"". There were various inexpensive methods to minimize the impact of covid, which developing country like vietnam could implement without paying their ministers millions annually. Now the pap refused to be accountable for their performance, and say that assessment of their performance should be done when the pandemic is all over, saying that the next election is the check and accountability.

Lim Tean is one of the more visible opposition figures and it naturally follows he will have a big following among opposition supporters. I think the risk of PAP losing Jalan Besar GRC is not low.

One of the applications, filed by DBS Bank in October last year over a debt of $549,378, was heard in the High Court on Monday (June 22) in chambers via video conference. The case has been adjourned for three weeks. DBS declined to comment, as the case is still ongoing in court. Mr Lim, who represented himself, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. The other application was filed by a trading company, Sing Wing (I & E), in May this year. Records show that the company is seeking to make Mr Lim a bankrupt over a debt of about $905,000. A hearing for this application is scheduled on July 16. Mr Lim is founder and secretary-general of Peoples Voice party, which had its registration approved in October 2018. Last Friday, he announced on Facebook that his party would be contesting Jurong GRC in the upcoming election. The Singapore Constitution disqualifies an undischarged bankrupt from being a Member of Parliament. In February last year, Mr Lim avoided bankruptcy in proceedings brought by a Shanghai businessman over a US$150,000 ($209,000) loan. Mr Huang Min, who had lent Mr Lim the money, filed a bankruptcy application in 2018 when the sum remained unpaid even after the Chinese national won a court judgment to recover it. Mr Lim appealed against the court order to repay the sum, but eventually withdrew his appeal. Mr Huang withdrew his bankruptcy application after Mr Lim submitted two cheques - one day ahead of a scheduled hearing - to settle the debt and legal costs"

Especially those PMETs who have lost their jobs. Jos Teo has already screwed up so many things under her charge and how bad can it be if Lim Tean is voted into Parliament. Since it is already at the bottom, what is there to lose. If Lim Tean is not good as well, then he will be kicked out by the next Election.

We should not die die have to appoint a woman to be a minister for the sake of having one, to please women.

One should not automatically be appointed to office just because he is LKY's son or grandson,  however one should not be denied a fair chance either, that's based on meritocracy just because he is LKY's son or grandson.  If LHY thinks he can do a better job than his brother, he should contest and become our PM.  Just like putting only women who are of ministerial calibre in ministerial positions, we also only put men and women in office based on merit, and not deny them based on their gender or who their father is."

Facts...(let's not play masak masak politics) 1.  US-China trade war has damaged the world economy 2.  Wuflu made it worse, and precipated a world depression not seen since the 1930s 3.  Singapore's economy is badly affected.  Business closures, job losses. 4.  Political instability is the last thing we need. I am prepared to kick PAP out if any oppo party can show me a candidate who has PM material.

The new regulations appear to give many employers \x93almost unfettered power over workers\x92 movement\x94, and leave workers with no immediate recourse under the law, said the two non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME) and Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), in a joint statement last week. The rules allow workers to leave a dormitory to seek help in an emergency, but employers\x92 view of \x93emergency help\x94 may be significantly narrower than the workers\x92 actual needs, the NGOs said. Even if the workers call the police for help, the new laws lack \x93clear objective criteria for first responders to evaluate and override employers\x92 views\x94, they noted."

With this current poor state, especially with Jo Teo as the weakest link, it is high time now for WP or any other strong alternative Party to launch a full assault and remove this PAP GRC team (especially Jo Teo) for good in the coming Erection. There will be never be a better time than now. It's ALL IN, or never. Josephine Teo must be booted OUT. And you're suggesting that WP go vie for it? All PAP needs to do is: - Hand to heart, ... don't come say 'eh PAP also got similar case w AIM' etc. Just judge and assess this WP-FMSS incident by itself. And you tell me if WP acted in the interest of the constituency, and nothing at all for the owners of FMSS (who happen to be WP's friends / supporters)? ""The Workers' Party (WP) leaders, Mr Low Thia Khiang and Ms Sylvia Lim, had put their own political interests over that of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) and residents in Aljunied GRC in the way they handled the appointment of a managing agent, said a High Court judge. This is evidenced by the great lengths they went to keep the town council's incumbent managing agent CPG in the dark while the takeover by FM Solutions & Services (FMSS) was being planned without a tender being called , added Justice Kannan Ramesh, as he found the two MPs liable for damages suffered by the town council. Later on, Ms Lim and Mr Low had also asked the owners of FMSS to prepare a ""sanitised"" report on its appointment for a meeting with AHTC's other town councillors, painting a misleading narrative of why a tender was waived. This story was later repeated in a release sent out to the press, said the judge in a much-anticipated judgment released on Friday (Oct 11). ""It is particularly unsatisfactory that this misleading narrative was conveyed to the public, and specifically the very constituents that the elected MPs were elected to serve,"" he added."" https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...mages-suffered In particular, the appointment of former managing agent FM Solutions and Services (FMSS) without tender by party chairman Sylvia Lim, former chief Low Thia Khiang and current chief Pritam Singh and the subsequent \x93concerted attempt\x94 to cloak it \x93with a veneer of truth and credibility collectively\x94, came in for harsh criticism by the judge in his 329-page written judgment released on Friday (Oct 11). \x93It was an attempt to mislead, and a clinical demonstration of the disregard Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang had for the requirements in the Town Councils Financial Rules,\x94 said Justice Ramesh, who also chided the pair for putting political interests above that of AHTC and its residents. Adding that the actions of Mr Low and Ms Lim were driven by \x93politics and a misguided sense of loyalty\x94, the judge said they had engineered a plan with the bosses of FMSS \x97 both loyal WP supporters \x97 to ensure that the company would be appointed AHTC\x92s managing agent. \x93They did this by deliberately delaying the calling of tender so that time for doing so would be compressed,\x94 he wrote. \x93This in turn served, as intended, as a convenient excuse and purported justification for the waiver of tender on the ground of exceptional circumstances, thereby facilitating the appointment of FMSS as managing agent under the first managing agent contract.\x94 He added: \x93Their motivations for doing so had nothing to do with the best interests of AHTC.\x94 https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...ead-says-judge http://theindependent.sg/heng-swee-k...irman-of-ahtc/"

All PAP needs to do is: - Hand to heart, ... don't come say 'eh PAP also got similar case w AIM' etc. Just judge and assess this WP-FMSS incident by itself. And you tell me if WP acted in the interest of the constituency, and nothing at all for the owners of FMSS (who happen to be WP's friends / supporters)? ""The Workers' Party (WP) leaders, Mr Low Thia Khiang and Ms Sylvia Lim, had put their own political interests over that of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) and residents in Aljunied GRC in the way they handled the appointment of a managing agent, said a High Court judge. This is evidenced by the great lengths they went to keep the town council's incumbent managing agent CPG in the dark while the takeover by FM Solutions & Services (FMSS) was being planned without a tender being called , added Justice Kannan Ramesh, as he found the two MPs liable for damages suffered by the town council. Later on, Ms Lim and Mr Low had also asked the owners of FMSS to prepare a ""sanitised"" report on its appointment for a meeting with AHTC's other town councillors, painting a misleading narrative of why a tender was waived. This story was later repeated in a release sent out to the press, said the judge in a much-anticipated judgment released on Friday (Oct 11). ""It is particularly unsatisfactory that this misleading narrative was conveyed to the public, and specifically the very constituents that the elected MPs were elected to serve,"" he added."" https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...mages-suffered In particular, the appointment of former managing agent FM Solutions and Services (FMSS) without tender by party chairman Sylvia Lim, former chief Low Thia Khiang and current chief Pritam Singh and the subsequent \x93concerted attempt\x94 to cloak it \x93with a veneer of truth and credibility collectively\x94, came in for harsh criticism by the judge in his 329-page written judgment released on Friday (Oct 11). \x93It was an attempt to mislead, and a clinical demonstration of the disregard Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang had for the requirements in the Town Councils Financial Rules,\x94 said Justice Ramesh, who also chided the pair for putting political interests above that of AHTC and its residents. Adding that the actions of Mr Low and Ms Lim were driven by \x93politics and a misguided sense of loyalty\x94, the judge said they had engineered a plan with the bosses of FMSS \x97 both loyal WP supporters \x97 to ensure that the company would be appointed AHTC\x92s managing agent. \x93They did this by deliberately delaying the calling of tender so that time for doing so would be compressed,\x94 he wrote. \x93This in turn served, as intended, as a convenient excuse and purported justification for the waiver of tender on the ground of exceptional circumstances, thereby facilitating the appointment of FMSS as managing agent under the first managing agent contract.\x94 He added: \x93Their motivations for doing so had nothing to do with the best interests of AHTC.\x94 https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...ead-says-judge http://theindependent.sg/heng-swee-k...irman-of-ahtc/ No benefit of hindsight at that time when they were being pulled the rug out from under their feet after winning the Aljunied GRC. What are best choice available at that short period of time to keep them on the balance? CPG and AIM were no angel and if they were not to do it, they will also face with a different BIG problem of failing in the management of the AHTC as well as for the residents there. Either way they will be in the fixed not forgetting, as CPG and even AIM are somehow affiliated with the incumbent. The fact is that there weren't any criminal intent whatsoever if not they would have been interrogated and charged for it by CAD or CPIB. They may have failed in the fiduciary duties in carrying out the responsibility but if they have had done it in good faith under that kind of extreme circumstances then this may diminish their liability and can only be faulted for their bad judgement call. I reckon this is one of the main reasons for the appeal after the initiate judgement by the High Court. I suppose this is the political price they are expected to ""pay"". Whether or not, they will lose out in the next GE, it is anybody's guess. Not forgetting the saying "" what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"""

And we also know that Mahathir does not like us.  As soon as he became PM, instead of WORKING HARD to deliver on his promises made to the jhks who voted for him, he thought Malaysia's most important thing, the first order of business, was to start a quarrel with Singapore over some water, so he parked his sampans there, or talked about  the other one that was sold to us at ""3 sen"". I don't know why Malaysians show so much respect for this man who was PM for 22 years, and still could not take Malaysia from Third World to First.  Even if they wanted to boot Najib out, don't the jhks have anyone who can take over?  The population of Malaysia is 32 million, and they cannot even find ONE capable person and have to bring an old freaking useless fox back?  Damn sia suay man.  That country is really screwed man. Good lessons to learn from them. None of their talents want to stay to make the country stronger. In the end who is worse for it? Same if we vote in mediocre opposition who will be worse for it? We need the best ppl to lead the country. Being normal and status quo is not good enough. So as Singaporeans we also have to be exceptional and not always stay at the bottom and complain why the country has let you down. You are lucky the government whom you did not vote for cares for you. Because on an international stage, nobody cares for Singapore and nobody owes us a living"

All PAP needs to do is: - Hand to heart, ... don't come say 'eh PAP also got similar case w AIM' etc. Just judge and assess this WP-FMSS incident by itself. And you tell me if WP acted in the interest of the constituency, and nothing at all for the owners of FMSS (who happen to be WP's friends / supporters)? ""The Workers' Party (WP) leaders, Mr Low Thia Khiang and Ms Sylvia Lim, had put their own political interests over that of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) and residents in Aljunied GRC in the way they handled the appointment of a managing agent, said a High Court judge. This is evidenced by the great lengths they went to keep the town council's incumbent managing agent CPG in the dark while the takeover by FM Solutions & Services (FMSS) was being planned without a tender being called , added Justice Kannan Ramesh, as he found the two MPs liable for damages suffered by the town council. Later on, Ms Lim and Mr Low had also asked the owners of FMSS to prepare a ""sanitised"" report on its appointment for a meeting with AHTC's other town councillors, painting a misleading narrative of why a tender was waived. This story was later repeated in a release sent out to the press, said the judge in a much-anticipated judgment released on Friday (Oct 11). ""It is particularly unsatisfactory that this misleading narrative was conveyed to the public, and specifically the very constituents that the elected MPs were elected to serve,"" he added."" https://www.straitstimes.com/politic...mages-suffered In particular, the appointment of former managing agent FM Solutions and Services (FMSS) without tender by party chairman Sylvia Lim, former chief Low Thia Khiang and current chief Pritam Singh and the subsequent \u201cconcerted attempt\u201d to cloak it \u201cwith a veneer of truth and credibility collectively\u201d, came in for harsh criticism by the judge in his 329-page written judgment released on Friday (Oct 11). \u201cIt was an attempt to mislead, and a clinical demonstration of the disregard Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang had for the requirements in the Town Councils Financial Rules,\u201d said Justice Ramesh, who also chided the pair for putting political interests above that of AHTC and its residents. Adding that the actions of Mr Low and Ms Lim were driven by \u201cpolitics and a misguided sense of loyalty\u201d, the judge said they had engineered a plan with the bosses of FMSS \u2014 both loyal WP supporters \u2014 to ensure that the company would be appointed AHTC\u2019s managing agent. \u201cThey did this by deliberately delaying the calling of tender so that time for doing so would be compressed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis in turn served, as intended, as a convenient excuse and purported justification for the waiver of tender on the ground of exceptional circumstances, thereby facilitating the appointment of FMSS as managing agent under the first managing agent contract.\u201d He added: \u201cTheir motivations for doing so had nothing to do with the best interests of AHTC.\u201d https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...ead-says-judge http://theindependent.sg/heng-swee-k...irman-of-ahtc/ Never mind AIM, what about the outright corruption of AMKTC (no need to POFMA, Wong Chee Meng was charged with 55 counts of corruption, convicted of 3)?

It also resolved that the matter between China and the ROC being a domestic issue that need to be solved peacefully between themselves and that the PRC and the ROC should not change the status quo other than to resolve the matters amicably between themselves. Obviously when the UN representations went to PRC and the ROC beame a pariah state, countries would want to switch their alignment to the PRC so as to derive at better economic gains. Well, there are member states that still stuck to the ROC as the ROC pledged economic and infrastuctural supports. These member states are usually poor and in need of aids and with it, the milking of the cows came into place. Member States would try to get the best deals from the one that can offer them the best deals. So, when the ROC deals were inferior to that of the PRC and when the member state switches alignment, it is because of the PRC pressure. What NONSENCE. For the PRC, it is simple, any state that wanted ties with them, the pre-condition is that there is only ONE CHINA and the China representation in the United Nations is the PRC. Member states can opt to or opt not to be aligned to Beijing. They don't have a missile landing on their courtyard if they decided not to align to Beijing. It is the will and freedom of choice of the member state. So, What pressure? Pressure by the PRC is an excuse by the ROC when they fail to beat the deals offered to poor member state or when the benefits each can offer to the member state that seek alignment to. Take Singapore for example, if the economic and political benefits far outweigh that with the alignment to the ROC, Jiang Jing Guo can be a good buddy of Senior Lee but Singapore would still switch alignment to the PRC. For WHO, it was started by the United Nations Member States whereby the ROC was represented at its founding in 1948. However, with your American master taking down the ROC and giving the legitimacy of representation in the United Nations to the PRC, ROC's position at the WHO had since then been replaced by the PRC. Who has been shouting hoarse about wanting the ROC to be present in the WHO - the biggest voice is from your American Master. But yet again, your American master had not move the motion. Do you believe it is because of the PRC pressure on the US that Trump didn't push ahead with the motion. Monday's motion is nothing more than wasting time to vote for whether the ROC is allowed an observer seat on the gallery in WHA and not whether the ROC is gaining its place in the WHO. Even then, it is highly likely that the member states would vote in line with their diplomatic alignment. It is not that China is pressuring other member states to vote the ROC out. It is founded upon the pre-condition set when the member states opted alignment with the PRC. The ROC was represented in the WHA from 2009 to 2016 under the Ma Ying Jeou leadership without the PRC having to stoop to a Taiwan, China status. It went in as Chinese Taipei, a name that the ROC participates in intrnational games or events of national representations. This time around, with the ROC under a different leadership that is walking away from Beijing, obviously Beijing would put in tougher stance like the ROC attendence in the WHA should be labelled as Taiwan, China if the ROC wanted to be present as Taiwan ( to regain their WHA observer seat ) It all bolis down to the management and the handling of the relationship with the PRC. If the ROC seek a tougher stance in its positioning of themselves with the PRC, obviously they would expect a tougher stance from the PRC too - reciprocal treatment. So, it is all down to how the ROC handles its relationship with Beijing. So, all these cry of victimisation is nothing more than the leaders of the ROC managin their wisedom."
