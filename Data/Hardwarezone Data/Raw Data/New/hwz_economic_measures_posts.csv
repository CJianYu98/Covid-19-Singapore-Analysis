He told an audience at Enterprise Singapore's (ESG) annual review that while the Government has responded swiftly and decisively to support firms and workers amid the pandemic, Singapore's resources are ultimately finite and must be used judiciously. ""This means that while we will continue to support our businesses, we will not be able to do so indiscriminately,"" he said. ""The weight of our efforts going forward must increasingly be targeted and shift towards helping our enterprises seize new opportunities in new markets, through new products and services. ""It is not sufficient to play defensive by trying to preserve existing enterprises and current jobs. It is even more important for us to create new opportunities for enterprises and job opportunities for our workers."" Sectors that continue to do well include those in infocommunications, precision manufacturing and biomedical. But others such as mass market tourism and aviation are still facing challenges and have to be helped to pivot to new areas, he said. The Government also wants to spur innovation among local firms regardless of size, added Mr Chan. This will be done through supporting the creation of new innovative start-ups, encouraging more private sector investment in deep-tech start-ups, boosting apprenticeship initiatives and tapping key global innovation nodes. There is also much potential for firms in the green economy. ""We will support them in areas including developing sustainability-related standards such as carbon verification, growing capabilities in sustainability and accessing new business opportunities in this space,"" said Mr Chan. ESG chairman Peter Ong agreed, and said: ""In the midst of current volatilities, enterprises will need to be highly agile to pivot as the situation affords. We will need to pick out the pockets of growth whenever and wherever we find them. ""Enterprises will need to harness innovation to meet new needs, and compete beyond pricing. ""We encourage them to develop new business models and intellectual property, or innovative products and solutions."" Besides innovation, going international is also important despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus, Mr Chan said, noting: ""Covid-19 has also emphasised the limitations of Singapore's small domestic market and the need to continue to push ahead with our internationalisation efforts. ""While internationalisation activities slowed in 2020, we maintained a positive mo-mentum."" To this end, Singapore must also build its own strong core of local firms that can compete globally in niche areas, while companies can also tap international agreements to access new markets. Mr Ong added that companies need to prepare themselves so they can quickly capture demand, with markets such as China and South-east Asia presenting new opportunities. ""While travel restrictions remain, overseas expansion will always remain a key growth driver."" Companies can go global by building capabilities, such as by increasing brand awareness through virtual platforms, he said. https://www.straitstimes.com/busines...irms-transform"

But first you decided which activities you want. Can choose from Klook, Changi Recommends, trips.com etc. The list of so-called approved agents are in the link. If your total amount for X number of people for the activity is say $72, just redeem $70. A code will be provided. Just key in the code when making payment. Since it is $72, you will have to pay $2.

$870 million to keep wage subsidies at 50% for aviation industry from April to September,18/2/2021 3:12,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/%24870-million-keep-wage-subsidies-50%25-aviation-industry-april-september-6468056.html,132604716,17/2/2021 20:51,"An $870 million support package for the hard-hit aviation sector will increase wage subsidies to 50 per cent for local workers for another six months,  the Ministry of Transport (MOT) said on Wednesday (Feb 17). The Jobs Support Scheme - which would be extended, as announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in his Budget speech on Tuesday - provides firms in the sector with wage support of 30 per cent from April to June, and 10 per cent from July to September. The Aviation Workforce Retention Grant, which will cost $330 million, will enhance that to 50 per cent of wages paid to Singaporeans and permanent residents from April to September, said MOT. This means that eligible firms will receive an additional 20 per cent of wages paid to each local employee from April to June, and an additional 40 per cent from July to September. The wage subsidy is subject to a cap of up to $4,600 of gross monthly wages. Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung noted that aviation has been one of the hardest-hit sectors during the pandemic, ""if not the hardest hit"", as Changi Airport and its stakeholders lost 97.5 per cent of its customers. As at end-January this year, total passenger movements in Changi were only about 2 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels. ""Yet for a city-state like Singapore, the air hub is essential to connect us with the rest of the world and continues to be our lifeblood,"" said Mr Ong. ""This support will help Changi tide through the crisis, while we explore ways to reopen borders safely."" In his Budget speech, Mr Heng emphasised the need to position the aviation sector for recovery as part of efforts to deepen Singapore's position as a global-Asia node. The remaining $540 million under the OneAviation Support Package will go to cost relief, said MOT. This includes extending existing rebates on fees and charges at Changi and Seletar airports for another year. The rebate on fees payable by pilots, air traffic controllers and aircraft maintenance engineers will also be extended for another year. ""The package will enable aviation companies to preserve core capabilities and tide over the crisis, and preserve Singapore's position as an aviation hub post-Covid-19,"" said MOT. The funding for the sector comes under the $11 billion Covid-19 Resilience Package announced in the Budget speech. MOT said that many aviation companies around the world had reduced their headcounts over the past year, pointing out that those in Singapore did likewise in ""a very judicious manner, mostly affecting foreign manpower"". ""We must avoid further reductions to the aviation workforce so that companies will not lose their core local capabilities, which have taken many years to build up. If the sector weakens its capabilities, this will hamper its ability to recover,"" added the ministry. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-september-mot"

The package includes vouchers that each household can use to defray expenses and support local businesses, as well as service and conservancy Charges (S&CC) rebates and goods and services tax (GST) vouchers. About 1.3 million households will receive $100 Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers that can be used at participating heartland shops and hawker centres . More details on this will be announced by the CDCs later. To fund this, an additional grant of $150 million will be provided to the CDCs. Mr Heng said the move is not only to thank all Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity but to continue supporting heartland businesses and hawkers. ""Singaporeans' sense of unity and discipline in observing the precautionary measures such as safe distancing and mask wearing has enabled our progress so far in combating the pandemic. The discipline and understanding of our local merchants and hawkers have also been important. However, they have been quite affected by the safety measures, especially during the circuit breaker,"" he noted. Eligible Singaporean households in Housing Board flats will also receive rebates to offset between 1.5 and 3.5 months of S&CC charges over the year, said Mr Heng. About 950,000 Singaporean households will be able to receive these rebates over four quarters - in April, July, October and January next year (2022). About 1.4 million lower-income Singaporeans will also get an additional GST Voucher-Cash Special Payment of $200 in June, on top of the regular GST Voucher cash payout. About 950,000 households will also get additional utilities rebates of between $120 and $200 under the GST Voucher-U-Save Special Payment that will be credited in April and July. This means they will receive 1.5 times their usual annual rebate. Singaporean children below the age of 21 will also get a $200 top-up to their Child Development Account, Edusave account, or Post-Secondary Education Account which can help fund education-related expenses. This will benefit about 780,000 children. Mr Heng said the package comes on top of immediate relief and support measures introduced for families and workers over five Budgets in 2020, including the Solidarity Payment, Covid-19 Support Grant, Temporary Relief Fund and grocery vouchers for lower-income groups. ""This Household Support Package provides some support to all families, with lower- to middle-income families receiving more,"" he said. Mr Heng also said Singaporeans have supported one another amid the pandemic, and stayed united in the face of adversity. ""Social cohesion does not happen naturally. Even before Covid-19, many societies were facing sharp divisions due to widening inequalities, increasing diversity of interests and voices, and growing distrust. The pandemic has deepened the cracks in many societies,"" said Mr Heng, adding that Singapore is not immune to these challenges. ""We must continue to strengthen our social fabric, and reject forces of division and discord."""

The package includes vouchers that each household can use to defray expenses and support local businesses, as well as service and conservancy Charges (S&CC) rebates and goods and services tax (GST) vouchers. About 1.3 million households will receive $100 Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers that can be used at participating heartland shops and hawker centres . More details on this will be announced by the CDCs later. To fund this, an additional grant of $150 million will be provided to the CDCs. Mr Heng said the move is not only to thank all Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity but to continue supporting heartland businesses and hawkers. ""Singaporeans' sense of unity and discipline in observing the precautionary measures such as safe distancing and mask wearing has enabled our progress so far in combating the pandemic. The discipline and understanding of our local merchants and hawkers have also been important. However, they have been quite affected by the safety measures, especially during the circuit breaker,"" he noted. Eligible Singaporean households in Housing Board flats will also receive rebates to offset between 1.5 and 3.5 months of S&CC charges over the year, said Mr Heng. About 950,000 Singaporean households will be able to receive these rebates over four quarters - in April, July, October and January next year (2022). About 1.4 million lower-income Singaporeans will also get an additional GST Voucher-Cash Special Payment of $200 in June, on top of the regular GST Voucher cash payout. About 950,000 households will also get additional utilities rebates of between $120 and $200 under the GST Voucher-U-Save Special Payment that will be credited in April and July. This means they will receive 1.5 times their usual annual rebate. Singaporean children below the age of 21 will also get a $200 top-up to their Child Development Account, Edusave account, or Post-Secondary Education Account which can help fund education-related expenses. This will benefit about 780,000 children. Mr Heng said the package comes on top of immediate relief and support measures introduced for families and workers over five Budgets in 2020, including the Solidarity Payment, Covid-19 Support Grant, Temporary Relief Fund and grocery vouchers for lower-income groups. ""This Household Support Package provides some support to all families, with lower- to middle-income families receiving more,"" he said. Mr Heng also said Singaporeans have supported one another amid the pandemic, and stayed united in the face of adversity. ""Social cohesion does not happen naturally. Even before Covid-19, many societies were facing sharp divisions due to widening inequalities, increasing diversity of interests and voices, and growing distrust. The pandemic has deepened the cracks in many societies,"" said Mr Heng, adding that Singapore is not immune to these challenges. ""We must continue to strengthen our social fabric, and reject forces of division and discord."" ntuc and ss cannot use??"

The Budget is traditionally presented in Parliament for debate in February, but preparation and consultation usually begin several months beforehand. In a Facebook post, Madam Halimah noted that Monday's discussions centred on Covid-19 and its impact. Apart from the near-term uncertainties brought on by the pandemic, she noted that a key question is whether Covid-19 has fundamentally changed the investment landscape. Other key issues that need to be studied are the structural shifts that Covid-19 has caused to the macroeconomic environment, and how these factors would impact Singapore's long-term investment returns. ""We need a good handle on these issues, as we are effectively spending from our reserves based on these assumptions,"" she said. ""These are tough questions that we need to grapple with. There are no easy answers, but it is my responsibility as custodian of Singapore's past reserves to raise them for discussion,"" added the president. ""I am glad that the Government has also been thinking hard about these same issues."" President Halimah was briefed by Mr Heng, as well as officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment company Temasek on their long-term macroeconomic outlook and the Government's proposed expected long-term real rates of return. The investment entities had earlier discussed these forward projections of the returns with their respective boards, and MOF has reviewed these projections, said Madam Halimah. ""With my concurrence, Government can later apply these rates to relevant assets to derive the Net Investment Return Contribution (NIRC) for use in Budget 2021,"" she added. The net investment returns framework allows the Government to spend up to 50 per cent of the expected long-term investment returns generated by Temasek, GIC and MAS - the three entities tasked to manage Singapore\x92s reserves. The NIRC is the top contributor to the government coffers. Mr Heng told Parliament in October that the design of the framework allows for a stable, sustainable source of income for the Budget, smoothed out over market cycles."

This was Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and National Development Indranee Rajah's assessment of the challenges planners face as they prepare next year's Budget. This year, close to $100 billion was dedicated to Covid-19 support measures over four Budgets - drawing up to $52 billion from the reserves, and leaving a hole of around $74 billion in the state coffers. But going forward, the focus must now be on how to emerge stronger from Covid-19 despite limited resources, said Ms Indranee on Wednesday (Dec 2). She said the Government's top priority is to get out of the crisis and keep everyone safe and healthy. But she noted that the fiscal road ahead will be a tough one. ""In previous years when we might have had budget surpluses, you could think in terms of goodies. ""But next year... it's more in terms of: 'With the resources that we have, how do we use them in the most careful and prudent way such that we get the most out of limited resources?'"" She was addressing 150 Singaporeans at a virtual Singapore Together Emerging Stronger Conversation (ESC) to seek their views and suggestions on next year's Budget. The two-hour session, organised by government feedback unit Reach and the Ministry of Finance, was co-hosted by Reach chairman and Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of National Development Tan Kiat How. Participants discussed how to manage the trade-off between strengthening the economy while keeping the public safe, and how to encourage social responsibility and ensure greater digital inclusion, among other issues. Ms Indranee told reporters a balanced Budget next year will be ""quite hard"" - echoing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's remarks last month that Singapore is unlikely to see a Budget surplus in 2021 given the ongoing economic crisis. She said the Government will have to be prudent, spend where necessary, and ensure good returns on the money that is put in. ""We have to make every dollar count and stretch the dollar."" But while cost management is important, she added that one must also look at the growth side of the equation and find revenue which comes from that growth. ""Growth will only come when you have the economic activity, and at the same time, we have got to balance this with the health and safety part of it,"" she said. This is why the Emerging Stronger Taskforce was formed to chart strategies for Singapore's post-pandemic recovery, she said. Under the task force are seven Alliances for Action (AfAs) - industry-led coalitions tasked to devise ideas and generate jobs in areas such as sustainability, robotics and education technology. Some growth areas she observed are logistics, mergers and acquisitions, and sustainability. In the afternoon, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat met business leaders to discuss how the Government can partner businesses to emerge stronger. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-2021-indranee"

He made the call on Wednesday (Dec 2) when he announced that he and his team had started work on it. This year was challenging for many nations because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which worsened the already grim economic outlook. Mr Heng delivered four Budgets to help Singaporeans cope with the health and financial crises in as many months. He presented the Unity Budget on Feb 18, the Resilience Budget on March 26, the Solidarity Budget on April 6 and the Fortitude Budget on May 26. Altogether, the Covid-19 support measures cost the Government S$93 billion. Of this sum, S$52 billion comes from past reserves. Mr Heng, looking back at the events of the year, exclaimed on Facebook on Wednesday: \x93Never in my life would I have imagined that I would have to present four Budgets in one year!\x94 He added that he had hosted a virtual gathering to thank his Ministry of Finance (MOF) Budget team for their hard work on the Budgets unveiled over the year. Highlighting the support his team gave him, he wrote: \x93They worked on the details of economic and social programmes to support our workers, families and businesses in Singapore in a most challenging year. \x93They have all been working non-stop since the beginning of this year, with the work becoming even heavier and more intense as the global Covid-19 pandemic situation worsened and disrupted life and businesses. My special thanks to my MOF team, and to all staff in our public agencies and partners who have been working so closely with us!\x94 Mr Heng, who added that he was working with fellow ministers Lawrence Wong and Indranee Rajah on the coming Budget, called on Singaporeans to join the effort and share their feedback with his Budget 2021 team. He said: \x93Everyone can play a role \x97 please join us in the Budget 2021 journey by sharing your ideas. The Budget reflects our collective needs and aspirations as a society, and charts our direction as a nation. \x93My team and I value your views and suggestions, so that we can shape Budget 2021 to support our people and businesses, and your hopes and wishes for Singapore. I look forward to everyone\x92s active participation, as part of our #SingaporeTogether movement.\x94 Those who wish to provide input for Budget 2021 may do so here."

There will be live television and radio coverage of the Budget statement, and a live webcast of the delivery will be available on the Singapore Budget website, said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in a press release on Thursday (Dec 31). The full Budget Statement will be published on the Singapore Budget website after delivery, and real-time updates of key Budget announcements can be found on MOF's Facebook page and Twitter account. ""We thank Singaporeans for providing their views, whether online through REACH\x92s Budget 2021 microsite, or in person at settings such as REACH\x92s Listening Points,"" said MOF. Singaporeans can continue to provide their views until Jan 8 next year via the website. MOF said that it is also partnering the People\x92s Association (PA) and its grassroots organisations in their virtual Ask Kopi Kakis #ShareYourViews initiative to seek public views and suggestions. Details of the virtual Ask Kopi Kakis #ShareYourViews engagement platforms can be found online. ""We continue to encourage Singaporeans to share their views and suggestions on issues relevant to Budget 2021,"" said MOF. Mr Heng said in a Facebook post on Thursday that preparations for Budget 2021 is ""well under way"". He added that even though the COVID-19 pandemic has been contained locally and vaccination is ongoing, the overall outlook remains ""highly uncertain""and will be for some time to come. ""Since several years ago, it is almost a 'tradition' to announce the date of the annual Budget around the turn of the year. This year is no different. ""But this year has been far from traditional. Instead of an annual Budget, we had four Budgets and two Ministerial Statements. To support our workers, companies and households through COVID-19, we introduced several rounds of support measures,"" he added. If the trajectory of economic recovery is on track, Mr Heng said Singapore will have a more ""traditional\x94 Budget year. ""But if the situation takes a turn for the worse, we are ready to respond and adapt,"" he said."

Mr Liang Eng Hwa, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance, Trade and Industry, told a pre-Budget round table yesterday: ""I'm a bit more realistic about what to expect for the upcoming Budget because there are only so much financial resources you can use to help."" The Government set aside a $100 billion war chest to tackle the pandemic last year, with most of the funds used to support businesses and save jobs. ""I expect this Budget to be a lot more targeted and differentiated than before, so we really channel and allocate funds to those businesses that need help, grow the economy and create jobs,"" said Mr Liang during the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants round table. ""We'll still have to help, but the numbers will taper off along the way."" Trade association and industry experts said at the virtual event that more can be done to help businesses access existing grants as applications can be cumbersome. Mr Ang Yuit, vice-president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said rental relief measures were a lifeline for firms but took a long time to reach small and medium-sized enterprises. Firms have also said they face a ""laborious and bureaucratic"" process to get support to reskill workers, he said, adding: ""We are concerned that with a slowness in getting that into effect, we'll have people that have to be let go because their skills don't match."" However, less government assistance could actually be a good thing, noted Singapore Retailers Association executive director Rose Tong. She said grants could distract companies from their business objectives as they tailor their goals to meet qualifying criteria: ""This could stifle their authentic growth. Some retailers have also gotten addicted to grants and subsidies such that they may be unwilling to embark on a much-needed transformation initiative should there not be a grant available."""

In the proposal, KPMG stressed the importance of 5G in Singapore's transformation into a smart nation. According to KPMG's partner and head of tax Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, 5G will be a key driver for data consumption and will create demand for innovation in the development of technological platforms. Sanganeria said there is a need for more government support to fast-track 5G development and adoption on a larger scale. KPMG has proposed a 5G technology and innovation fund that provides 50% of expenditure for prototyping and innovation of 5G enabled solutions and to extend the Market Readiness Assistance grant to provide funding for enterprises to explore solutions in 5G-ready markets. Aside from 5G, KPMG said the 2021 budget should also include a Digital Transformation Package that will consist of tax incentives to catalyse business transformation by supporting significant capital outlay and the workforce. Granting a 300% enhanced tax deductions for costs incurred by Singapore companies for the acquisition of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or upgrading of existing systems as well as expanding section 19B of the tax provision to allow writing down allowances on costs incurred on a broader range of intangible assets will help prevent supply chain disruption. The talent landscape should also focus on these technologies by introducing cloud technologies, AI, data analytics, robotics, and 5G at the secondary education level as well as re-skilling/up-skilling workforce in these technologies. Special tax rebates for local professionals in qualifying industries critical to Singapore's economy and ecosystem will also help in the transformation to a smart city. Job and food security The pandemic also showed several weaknesses in food supply chains. KPMG's proposal will encourage urban farming using existing real estate assets whilst maximising current land usage for vertical farming that will create more sustainable sources of protein. Sanganeria said an enhanced R&D Tax Incentive Scheme that includes extending the list of eligible expenditure to capital expenditure on plant and machinery, utilities, as well as to remove the deemed 60% rule on outsourced R&D expenditure will accelerate innovation in these industries. Sanganeria added that land intensification allowance should be extended to agri-tech and aqua-tech industries as well as introduce a new incentive for these industries like a tiered concessionary income tax rates of 5/10% that would be subject to conditions such as production capacity and nutrition value of the food produced. These measures will not only strengthen Singapore's food supply chain, it will also create additional jobs."

The Government will also continue to support workers and businesses, especially those in hard-hit sectors. But Singapore must press on with the economic transformation it started five years ago, he added. He said: ""Covid-19 has accelerated innovation, put a premium on resilience, and greater priority on sustainability. ""There is no turning back the clock. While we deal with the present, we must also prepare our workers and businesses for a different world post-Covid."" He was speaking during a visit to technology firm Durapower's research and development laboratories on Friday. Last year, the Government rolled out an unprecedented five Budgets, committed nearly $100 billion in Covid-19 support measures and drew up to $52 billion from past reserves in order to preserve jobs, support companies and help affected workers. According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry's advance estimates released on Jan 4, Singapore's gross domestic product contracted by 5.8 per cent for the whole of 2020 - an improvement over the ministry's earlier forecast of a contraction of 6.5 per cent to 6 per cent made in November. But while the worst of the fallout has been averted, the road to recovery will be uneven and highly uncertain, said Mr Heng. He added that he will share more on helping workers and businesses to adapt, innovate and grow in his Budget statement on Feb 16. He also outlined initiatives which were launched last year to help workers and businesses emerge stronger - from helping small and medium-sized enterprises and hawkers adopt digital solutions to support for promising start-ups and entrepreneurs. Over 100,000 opportunities have been created for workers through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, and more resources have been set aside to encourage job creation and train Singaporeans to work in new sectors, he said. Some $25 billion has also been committed over the next five years for research, innovation, and enterprise.

Ms Indranee, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for National Development, added that the strategy for Budget 2021 will be to make sure that resources are channelled to those who still need help, compared with the broad-based approach at the height of the crisis last year. ""So, some areas are doing well, they probably need less support, but some areas (like) aviation, tourism and so on, will still need some continued... support,"" she added. ""And then on the social side again, some people don't need as much support as others."" She was speaking to reporters after a visit to Kin@11, a programme space in York Hill under the Community Link (ComLink) initiative, which provides proactive and integrated support to an estimated 1,000 low-income families. Her comments come as early signs point to a steady recovery for Singapore, with gross domestic product contracting by a smaller-than-forecasted 5.8 per cent last year, and unemployment rate dropping for two months in a row in November and December last year. But the hardest-hit sectors such as aviation and tourism, for instance, are still in a slump and overall unemployment, at 3.2 per cent in December last year, is still higher than the 2.3 per cent recorded in the same month the year before. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat had said on Friday that a key priority for the Budget will be to continue to support workers and businesses, but that Singapore must press on with economic transformation. Giving a broad overview of the Budget on Saturday, Ms Indranee said it will cover the immediate healthcare issues and vaccination roll-out, social support for the needy, economic transformation and sustainability. ""One of the things about Covid-19 is that it has forced us to rethink how we've been doing things. It has also provided an opportunity to reshape the future. And this Budget will be looking exactly at that. Not just tackling existing problems, (but) how to position for the future and how to grow,"" she added. Ms Indranee also spoke about ComLink as a key strategic part of the Government's efforts to tackle inequality, adding that the initiative brings together government agencies and community partners to provide more comprehensive support to low-income families. ""There are many different partners; what we wanted to make sure was that there were no overlapping services, duplication, and then some people inadvertently left out,"" she said. She added that the Government will be working more closely with the private sector, civil society and social service agencies going forward. Mr Kelvin Chia, who oversees ComLink at Jalan Kukoh, said that since the programme space opened, many volunteer groups have come forward offering classes and services. One such group was Readable. The organisation run by volunteers, which focuses on teaching children in the Jalan Kukoh area to read and count, now holds classes at the premises. Ms Aprizen Yuliana, 37, an Indonsian married to a Singaporean, said her seven-year-old son and five-year-old daughter have benefited from the classes. Her son, who used to run away when asked to read, now enjoys storybooks and even got full marks for his spelling test, she said. \x93I don\x92t speak much English so I can\x92t teach my own children. The Readable classes have really helped them. They are also more confident now and have more friends,\x94 she said, speaking in Bahasa Indonesia.

On Sunday (Feb 14), Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat penned an appreciation post to his wife, who has had to put up with his busy schedule amid this festive Chinese New Year and Valentine\x92s Day season. Mr Heng, who is also Singapore\x92s Deputy Prime Minister, is in the middle of what for him may be the busiest time of the year, preparing the country\x92s annual budget. On most years, putting the budget together is serious business indeed. And during a pandemic, with all the stressors on the economy, we can only imagine that a great deal of hard work has been done behind the scenes by Mr Heng and his team at the Ministry of Finance (MOF), leading up to Budget Day on Tuesday, Feb 16. Last year, due to the pandemic, the Government rolled out five Budgets to boost the economy and extend aid to those affected. In January, Mr Heng quipped at the The Straits Times Global Outlook Forum that he wished that for this year, there will be only one Budget. And so, while the rest of us were likely celebrating (albeit more low-key this year) Chinese New Year, and enjoying romantic dinners with our significant others, the Minister wrote in a Facebook post that he enjoyed no such luxury. He thanked his wife for her \x93love, strength and support, and for walking the journey of life with me.\x94 And then added, \x93Thank you for your understanding \x97 no long, romantic dinner, as I have to work today \x96 for Budget Day is just two days away!\x94 However, the day did not go without a loving gesture from Mr Heng, who also posted a photo of the bouquet of flowers he sent his wife. \x93During one of my recent walkabouts, I met a second-generation stallholder selling flowers in the market. She showed me the beautiful roses she brought from overseas for Valentine\x92s Day. They were beautiful, and so I ordered some for my wife.\x94 He also thanked the MOF officers and those from other Government agencies who have also had to work over the long holiday weekend. \x93A big thank you to all and your loved ones!,\x94 he wrote. And this busyness during a festive time, apparently, happens regularly. \x93Budget Day usually takes place around mid-February, so that we can complete the entire process in time for the Financial Year, which starts on 1 April. But the consequence is that Budget preparations often overlap with Valentine\x92s Day, and Chinese New Year in some years,\x94 Mr Heng explained, before greeting everyone. \x93I hope that everyone can spend some time with your loved ones, and express your love for people in your life, today and every other day! Happy Valentine\x92s Day!\x94 Mr Heng, 59, has been married to Ms Chang Hwee Nee since 1988. Ms Chang is the CEO of the National Heritage Board. They have two children. /TISG"

Last week, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030. This is an ambitious long-term plan that builds on ongoing efforts to secure a green, liveable, and sustainable home for generations of Singaporeans to come. Technology, capital, and the actions of our people are key enablers of this Plan. For transportation, we will accelerate the development of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, narrow the cost differential between electric cars and internal combustion engine cars, and raise petrol duty rates. I will be providing support to ease the transition for Singaporeans impacted by the rise in petrol duty, especially for those who rely on their vehicles for their livelihood.

Yet so far, they are surprisingly among our lowest contributors. When was the last time before the recent truck driver case that we saw a positive case from bolehland? Much less in significant(relative to those from cecaland) numbers. Even figures from Indonesia have been relatively low until we opened up to FDWs from there.

Additional $870m to help battered aviation sector,16/2/2021 18:58,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/additional-%24870m-help-battered-aviation-sector-6467258.html,132576617,16/2/2021 16:46,"The aviation sector will get additional support and extended cost relief to the tune of $870 million, given that the volume of international air travel remains a tiny fraction of what it was. The sector is expected to remain badly affected this year, and recovery will take some time, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday (Feb 16). The funding for the sector will come under the $11 billion Covid-19 Resilience Package. Additional funding drawn from a separate $24 billion fund to help firms and workers emerge stronger will be invested in on-arrival testing and biosafety systems, said Mr Heng. This will help to secure Singapore's position as a key aviation hub that both travellers and employees trust in. ""Airports will be differentiated by their capabilities in securing public health and enabling safe travel,"" Mr Heng added. ""They will need digitalised systems and the ability to effectively reroute people and goods."" One example of work on this front is GovTech's collaboration with Temasek-founded start-up Affinidi. The two organisations are working together to develop software that can quickly verify digital Covid-19 test result certificates and vaccination records. An app developed by Affinidi is now being trialled by Singapore Airlines to verify health documents produced by travellers. But Mr Heng cautioned that Covid-19 has reshuffled the global web of connectivity. For example, the total number of passengers passing through Changi remains at about 2 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels as at end-January. ""I expect the aviation sector to use this lull to sustain and upgrade its capabilities, and to prepare for the recovery,"" he added. The land transport sector was also flagged for additional support by Mr Heng. He said $133 million has been set aside to continue the earlier announced Covid-19 Driver Relief Fund. Eligible drivers will get $600 per month from January to March, and $450 per month from April to June. Additional support for arts and culture, sports The arts and culture, as well as the sports sector, have also been ""deeply affected by the pandemic"", said Mr Heng on Tuesday. Hence, the Government will extend the Arts and Culture Resilience Package and Sports Resilience Package to support businesses and self-employed people in these sectors. A sum of $45 million will be allocated to extend and enhance the support packages, said Mr Heng. He said the enhancement will support capability development and sector transformation, among other goals. ""We look forward to activities resuming, with greater vibrancy,"" said Mr Heng. More details will be disclosed next week when debate starts on each ministry's budget. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...land-transport"

ERP rates at those gantries will be adjusted by S$1 with effect from Feb 22. ERP charges will be reintroduced at three gantries on the AYE after Jurong Town Hall towards the city, on the KPE (ECP) after Defu Flyover and on the southbound CTE auxiliary lane to PIE (Changi). Charges will also be adjusted by S$1 at the gantry on the southbound CTE before Braddell Road and the set of four gantries along the CTE after Braddell Road and PIE slip road into the CTE. The new rates will take effect during the specified time periods from Feb 22: Rates for other time periods at previously announced gantries will remain unchanged, LTA added. ""There continue to be no ERP charges on other expressways and arterial roads,"" the authority said. ERP charges were first suspended on April 6 on the expectation that traffic would be significantly reduced during the circuit breaker period. LTA reintroduced ERP charges at some gantries along the CTE in July and August, following the end of the circuit breaker. LTA said its monitoring of traffic conditions in January showed that traffic speeds have ""remained optimal on all arterial roads and most expressways, except for some time periods on the AYE, CTE and KPE"". ""As more people travel to and from their workplaces, traffic volume has been building up during weekday peak hours. This has led to congestion at specific locations along the AYE, CTE and KPE during peak periods,"" said LTA. LTA said it would continue to monitor traffic speeds and congestion levels closely and assess if ERP rates need to be further adjusted. CNA"

Naming Tuesday's Budget the Emerging Stronger Together Budget, Mr Heng said in a Facebook post that Singapore will need to find new ways to work together, innovate and \x93transform our economy\x94. \x93We must strengthen our social compact and support one another, especially those with greater needs. On this little red dot, we must strengthen efforts to tackle climate change, and build a sustainable home for generations to come,\x94 said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister. \x93Importantly, we must continue to be prudent in our spending, and leave a better future for our children.\x94 Singapore must continue to stay vigilant, even as the country has moved into Phase 3 of its reopening and vaccination is under way. \x93As COVID-19 has accelerated changes and created new ones, we must also navigate these shifts to thrive in a post-COVID world. Our ability to plan ahead, even in the midst of a crisis, has been the hallmark of the Singapore Story,\x94 said Mr Heng. After a pandemic-hit 2020, Singapore will be ending the financial year with a record Budget deficit. But thanks to past reserves that earlier generations have built up, the country has been able to fund the deficit by \x93opening the national safe three times\x94, said Mr Heng, adding that the country\x92s fiscal situation will \x93continue to be tight in the coming years"". The Government drew an unprecedented S$52 billion from the reserves last year. Mr Heng said he met an elderly man in his 70s during a visit to Bedok recently who told him that the Budget \x93should not be about goodies\x94, but that it was more important to invest in building up people\x92s abilities and enabling them to do better. \x93Shared values such as this \x96 the desire to build on what we inherit and pass on something better to the next generation \x96 are what bind us together as a people,\x94 said Mr Heng. \x93Indeed, we can take heart that through this crisis, we have built deeper social reserves \x97 united in purpose, standing in solidarity with one another, and facing difficulties with resilience and fortitude.\x94 The Government pushed out four Budgets last year as the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic became clear. Including two supplementary budgets, close to S$100 billion was spent on support measures for businesses and individuals, and to deal with the pandemic. The Budget Speech will be broadcast live on CNA\x92s YouTube channel, Facebook page and website, as well as on Channel 5, CNA938 and Mediacorp\x92s MeWatch interactive service on Tuesday. A live webcast of the Budget Speech will be available on the Singapore Budget website and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Facebook page. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...nding-14202278"

Naming Tuesday's Budget the Emerging Stronger Together Budget, Mr Heng said in a Facebook post that Singapore will need to find new ways to work together, innovate and \u201ctransform our economy\u201d. \u201cWe must strengthen our social compact and support one another, especially those with greater needs. On this little red dot, we must strengthen efforts to tackle climate change, and build a sustainable home for generations to come,\u201d said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister. \u201cImportantly, we must continue to be prudent in our spending, and leave a better future for our children.\u201d Singapore must continue to stay vigilant, even as the country has moved into Phase 3 of its reopening and vaccination is under way. \u201cAs COVID-19 has accelerated changes and created new ones, we must also navigate these shifts to thrive in a post-COVID world. Our ability to plan ahead, even in the midst of a crisis, has been the hallmark of the Singapore Story,\u201d said Mr Heng. After a pandemic-hit 2020, Singapore will be ending the financial year with a record Budget deficit. But thanks to past reserves that earlier generations have built up, the country has been able to fund the deficit by \u201copening the national safe three times\u201d, said Mr Heng, adding that the country\u2019s fiscal situation will \u201ccontinue to be tight in the coming years"". The Government drew an unprecedented S$52 billion from the reserves last year. Mr Heng said he met an elderly man in his 70s during a visit to Bedok recently who told him that the Budget \u201cshould not be about goodies\u201d, but that it was more important to invest in building up people\u2019s abilities and enabling them to do better. \u201cShared values such as this \u2013 the desire to build on what we inherit and pass on something better to the next generation \u2013 are what bind us together as a people,\u201d said Mr Heng. \u201cIndeed, we can take heart that through this crisis, we have built deeper social reserves \u2014 united in purpose, standing in solidarity with one another, and facing difficulties with resilience and fortitude.\u201d The Government pushed out four Budgets last year as the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic became clear. Including two supplementary budgets, close to S$100 billion was spent on support measures for businesses and individuals, and to deal with the pandemic. The Budget Speech will be broadcast live on CNA\u2019s YouTube channel, Facebook page and website, as well as on Channel 5, CNA938 and Mediacorp\u2019s MeWatch interactive service on Tuesday. A live webcast of the Budget Speech will be available on the Singapore Budget website and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Facebook page. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...nding-14202278 time to write to minister to increase taxes, increase interest rates to forge a better SG and be more financially sustainable Sent from the future using GAGT"

Revenue declined nearly 18 per cent to S$270.8 million, because of the absence of a trade show and lower sales as a result of the restrictions on movement imposed by the government during the year to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, Challenger reported blowout earnings of 6.73 cents per share - up 32 per cent versus the 5.11 cents per share it reported for FY2019. Profit before tax from continuing operations increased by almost S$5.6 million to more than S$26.8 million. What accounted for the company' s sharply increased profitability? In a nutshell, it was the result of the government' s efforts last year to shield businesses and their employees from the fallout of the pandemic. Challenger reported "" sundry income"" of nearly S$5.1 million for FY2020, which is some S$4.8 million more than S$0.2 million it reported for the previous year. The company said this was mainly attributable to "" receipts of government grants"" . In its half-year financial report, Challenger indicated that these grants related to the Job Support Scheme (JSS) as well as the Wage Credit Scheme. Challenger also reported a more than S$4.7 million decline in "" premises expenses"" to slightly more than S$12.9 million in FY2020. The company said this was mainly the result of "" rental waivers and rebates"" . Shareholders of Challenger are directly benefiting from the Covid-19 subsidy and support windfall from the government. The company has said it will hike its dividend to 2.7 cents per share for FY2020, up from the 1.5 cents per share it paid out for FY2019. In absolute terms, Challenger will be paying out over S$9.3 million in dividends with respect to FY2020. This is S$4.1 million more than the nearly S$5.2 million it paid with respect to FY2019. Shares in Challenger have jumped 12.5 per cent since the company reported its full-year numbers and announced the higher dividend. The stock closed Friday at 54 cents. Big government support Challenger' s strong FY2020 earnings report is a cautionary tale about the dangers of trying to shield every corner of the economy from the Covid-19 fallout. It also underscores why the enormous fiscal measures the government rushed to introduce last year should not continue for much longer - besides being unsustainable, these measures may well be excessively benefiting some segments of the corporate sector. Unlike most recessions, which tend to be preceded by a period of excessive consumption or over-investment, the economic slump last year was caused by curbs on movement and human interaction to prevent the spread of Covid-19. So, rather than trying to jumpstart demand, the government focused on subsidising business costs. The idea was to help companies keep their doors open and their workers employed, so that business could restart quickly once Covid-19 was under control. The Ministry of Finance said in a report last week that grants received by firms in 2020 topped S$27.4 billion, up from S$1.5 billion in 2019. The biggest driver of this increase was the JSS, where the government co-funds 25 per cent to 75 per cent of the first S$4,600 of each local employee' s gross monthly pay. From April to December 2020, a total of S$22.6 billion was disbursed under the JSS, the report said. Attempted privatisation Challenger deserved the help it received from the government as much as any other consumer electronics retailer. When the pandemic hit last year, it would have been unclear to the company as well as the government exactly how badly its revenues and earnings would be affected. Moreover, the company was already struggling in the face of disruption in the retailing sector. In 2019, the controlling Loo family and a private equity fund run by Dymon Asia Capital attempted to take Challenger private at 56 cents per share, stating that the company needed to make changes to its business that might affect its dividends. The offer was rebuffed by minority shareholders who understood the value of the company. Challenger is arguably one of the most successful homegrown retailing companies in Singapore, and it has an impressive track record of profitability. Despite the retailing sector facing technological disruption, the company is hardly in financial straits. While the company has been struggling to grow its revenue, its return on equity (ROE) averaged 19 per cent during the five years to FY2019. For FY2020, with the Covid-19 support measures, its ROE came in at nearly 21 per cent. The healthy ROEs are all the more impressive given the huge - and increasing - amount of cash on its books. At the end of FY2018, Challenger had a net cash position of S$63.2 million. This cash pile expanded to nearly S$77.9 million at the end of FY2019, and to almost S$85.8 million at the end of FY2020. Challenger' s net cash holdings are now equivalent to more than 46 per cent of its market capitalisation. Fiscal pullback With governments around the world gradually learning to manage Covid-19 infection rates, many investors appear to be positioning themselves to ride a strong recovery in economic activity in 2021. Against that backdrop, analysts are expecting the Singapore government to adjust its Covid-19 measures in the Budget this week, narrowing direct fiscal support to only the most hard-hit segments of the economy - such as tourism and travel. Some analysts also see the government augmenting the social safety net for Singaporeans struggling to find work, as well as reinforcing efforts to drive industry transformation and staking out promising new fields for future economic growth. UOB Global Economics & Markets Research estimates that Budget 2021 will see an overall deficit of S$12.5 billion (or 2.5 per cent of GDP), versus a deficit of S$74.2 billion (or 15.3 per cent of GDP) last year. What will this fiscal pullback mean for the local corporate sector? Logically, as life gets back to normal in 2021, corporate revenues should rebound. The big question is whether these revenues will rise sufficiently to offset the negative impact of the expiry of enormous subsidies like the JSS on corporate earnings. *For Challenger, ironically, its earnings, even in the event of a very strong economic recovery ahead, might well not match what it achieved with the Covid-19 support measures last year.*"

SIA Group said this in a statement on Thursday (4 Feb), adding that its passenger carriage shrank by 97.6 per cent as international air travel demand remained severely constrained in the quarter. It also noted that its revenue fell by 76.1 per cent \x96 from S$3,404 million to S$1,067 million \x96 during the third quarter, as all three passenger airlines within the Group recorded a sharp drop in passenger flown revenue due to low traffic. In line with Singapore\x92s progressive re-opening, the Group is expecting to see a measured expansion of the passenger network over the coming months. \x93We will continue to monitor the status of travel restrictions and adjust our capacity accordingly to meet the traffic demand,\x94 it added. Over on social media, netizens were quick to call out SIA for its financial prudency during a time of crisis, particularly in regards to those in the higher-up earning hefty compensations. One commenter asserted that these losses faced by the airline are just a scratch compared to \x93fat pay cheques\x94 earned by shareholders and people in the higher management. Many others lamented the lack of leadership in the Group, as they called out the Group\x92s CEO for profiting millions while the lower staff are retrenched. SIA CEO received S$4.2m in remuneration despite company losing S$212m in previous FY ending 31 March 2020 Last year, it was disclosed in SIA\x92s annual report for FY19/20 that its chief executive officer (CEO), Goh Choon Phong, received a total of S$4,223,274 in remuneration for the financial year ending on 31 March. Despite SIA Group reporting its first net loss of S$212 million in its 48-year history for the 12 months ending 31 Mar 2020, Mr Goh continues to receive bonuses of S$1,046,967 and shares valued S$1,643,940. Meanwhile, in September last year, SIA Group announced its decision to lay-off 4,300 positions across its airlines \x96 Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, and Scoot \x96 as losses mounted. Mr Goh blamed the pandemic over the massive retrenchment initiated by SIA, saying that \x93none of us could have predicted its devastating impact on the global aviation industry\x94 and went on to say that his priority was \x93to ensure survival and save as many jobs as possible\x94. \x93Having to let go of our valuable and dedicated people is the hardest and most agonizing decision that I have had to make in my 30 years with SIA. This is not a reflection of the strengths and capabilities of those who will be affected, but the result of an unprecedented global crisis that has engulfed the airline industry,\x94 he added. https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/202...on-in-q3-2020/"

PeanutButtor wrote: Netizens call out SIA\x92s higher management for earning \x93fat pay cheques\x94 after the airline reported net loss of S$142 million in Q3 2020 Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group reported a net loss of S$142 million in the third quarter of 2020 \x96 compared with the prior year\x92s S$315 million profit \x96 as border controls and travel restrictions continued to be in place in many countries amid new waves of the COVID-19 infection. SIA Group said this in a statement on Thursday (4 Feb), adding that its passenger carriage shrank by 97.6 per cent as international air travel demand remained severely constrained in the quarter. It also noted that its revenue fell by 76.1 per cent \x96 from S$3,404 million to S$1,067 million \x96 during the third quarter, as all three passenger airlines within the Group recorded a sharp drop in passenger flown revenue due to low traffic. In line with Singapore\x92s progressive re-opening, the Group is expecting to see a measured expansion of the passenger network over the coming months. \x93We will continue to monitor the status of travel restrictions and adjust our capacity accordingly to meet the traffic demand,\x94 it added. Over on social media, netizens were quick to call out SIA for its financial prudency during a time of crisis, particularly in regards to those in the higher-up earning hefty compensations. One commenter asserted that these losses faced by the airline are just a scratch compared to \x93fat pay cheques\x94 earned by shareholders and people in the higher management. Many others lamented the lack of leadership in the Group, as they called out the Group\x92s CEO for profiting millions while the lower staff are retrenched. SIA CEO received S$4.2m in remuneration despite company losing S$212m in previous FY ending 31 March 2020 Last year, it was disclosed in SIA\x92s annual report for FY19/20 that its chief executive officer (CEO), Goh Choon Phong, received a total of S$4,223,274 in remuneration for the financial year ending on 31 March. Despite SIA Group reporting its first net loss of S$212 million in its 48-year history for the 12 months ending 31 Mar 2020, Mr Goh continues to receive bonuses of S$1,046,967 and shares valued S$1,643,940. Meanwhile, in September last year, SIA Group announced its decision to lay-off 4,300 positions across its airlines \x96 Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, and Scoot \x96 as losses mounted. Mr Goh blamed the pandemic over the massive retrenchment initiated by SIA, saying that \x93none of us could have predicted its devastating impact on the global aviation industry\x94 and went on to say that his priority was \x93to ensure survival and save as many jobs as possible\x94. \x93Having to let go of our valuable and dedicated people is the hardest and most agonizing decision that I have had to make in my 30 years with SIA. This is not a reflection of the strengths and capabilities of those who will be affected, but the result of an unprecedented global crisis that has engulfed the airline industry,\x94 he added. https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/202...on-in-q3-2020/"

The rewards came even at banks where poor results last year foretold the economic crisis that sent them to Washington for a government rescue. Some trimmed their executive compensation due to lagging bank performance, but still forked over multimillion-dollar executive pay packages. Benefits included cash bonuses, stock options, personal use of company jets and chauffeurs, home security, country club memberships and professional money management, the AP review of federal securities documents found. The total amount given to nearly 600 executives would cover bailout costs for many of the 116 banks that have so far accepted tax dollars to boost their bottom lines. Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services committee and a long-standing critic of executive largesse, said the bonuses tallied by the AP review amount to a bribe ""to get them to do the jobs for which they are well-paid in the first place. ""Most of us sign on to do jobs and we do them best we can,"" said Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. ""We're told that some of the most highly-paid people in executive positions are different. They need extra money to be motivated!"" Trending News Fewer Americans might get a $1,400 stimulus check Eager for a stimulus check? Early tax filing might help Pharmacies offering COVID-19 vaccines: What you need to know When might you get Biden's $1,400 stimulus check? The AP compiled total compensation based on annual reports that the banks file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The 116 banks have so far received $188 billion in taxpayer help. Among the findings: The average paid to each of the banks' top executives was $2.6 million in salary, bonuses and benefits. Lloyd Blankfein, president and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs, took home nearly $54 million in compensation last year. The company's top five executives received a total of $242 million. This year, Goldman will forgo cash and stock bonuses for its seven top-paid executives. They will work for their base salaries of $600,000, the company said. Facing increasing concern by its own shareholders on executive payments, the company described its pay plan last spring as essential to retain and motivate executives ""whose efforts and judgments are vital to our continued success, by setting their compensation at appropriate and competitive levels."" Goldman spokesman Ed Canaday declined to comment beyond that written report. The New York-based company on Dec. 16 reported its first quarterly loss since it went public in 1999. It received $10 billion in taxpayer money on Oct. 28. Even where banks cut back on pay, some executives were left with seven- or eight-figure compensation that most people can only dream about. Richard D. Fairbank, the chairman of Capital One Financial Corp., took a $1 million hit in compensation after his company had a disappointing year, but still got $17 million in stock options. The McLean, Virginia-based company received $3.56 billion in bailout money on Nov. 14. John A. Thain, chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch, topped all corporate bank bosses with $83 million in earnings last year. Thain, a former chief operating officer for Goldman Sachs, took the reins of the company in December 2007, avoiding the blame for a year in which Merrill lost $7.8 billion. Since he began work late in the year, he earned $57,692 in salary, a $15 million signing bonus and an additional $68 million in stock options. Like Goldman, Merrill got $10 billion from taxpayers on Oct. 28. Your Tax Dollars At Work: Chauffeurs, Club Dues The AP review comes amid sharp questions about the banks' commitment to the goals of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), a law designed to buy bad mortgages and other troubled assets. Last month, the Bush administration changed the program's goals, instructing the Treasury Department to pump tax dollars directly into banks in a bid to prevent wholesale economic collapse. The program set restrictions on some executive compensation for participating banks, but did not limit salaries and bonuses unless they had the effect of encouraging excessive risk to the institution. Banks were barred from giving golden parachutes to departing executives and deducting some executive pay for tax purposes. Banks that got bailout funds also paid out millions for home security systems, private chauffeured cars, and club dues. Some banks even paid for financial advisers. Wells Fargo of San Francisco, which took $25 billion in taxpayer bailout money, gave its top executives up to $20,000 each to pay personal financial planners. At Bank of New York Mellon Corp., chief executive Robert P. Kelly's stipend for financial planning services came to $66,748, on top of his $975,000 salary and $7.5 million bonus. His car and driver cost $178,879. Kelly also received $846,000 in relocation expenses, including help selling his home in Pittsburgh and purchasing one in Manhattan, the company said. Goldman Sachs' tab for leased cars and drivers ran as high as $233,000 per executive. The firm told its shareholders this year that financial counseling and chauffeurs are important in giving executives more time to focus on their jobs. JPMorgan Chase chairman James Dimon ran up a $211,182 private jet travel tab last year when his family lived in Chicago and he was commuting to New York. The company got $25 billion in bailout funds. Banks cite security to justify personal use of company aircraft for some executives. But Rep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, questioned that rationale, saying executives visit many locations more vulnerable than the security-conscious U.S. commercial air terminals. Sherman, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said pay excesses undermine development of good bank economic policies and promote an escalating pay spiral among competing financial institutions - something particularly hard to take when banks then ask for rescue money. He wants them to come before Congress, like the automakers did, and spell out their spending plans for bailout funds. ""The tougher we are on the executives that come to Washington, the fewer will come for a bailout,"" he said. By Associated Press Writers Frank Bass and Rita Beamish"

Seems like shareholders feel that depending on a few superstar to steer the ship is more important for their ROI than raising the standards of the collective company.

But with assistance from several Covid-19 Budget measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, the father of three managed to tide over the tough time. The help included the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, which provided self-employed people with three quarterly cash payouts of $3,000 each, and the Workfare Special Payment, a $3,000 cash payout for lower-income workers. In April last year, at the start of the circuit breaker period, the 54-year-old drove a demanding 14 hours a day, up from 11 hours previously. The roads were empty, recalled Mr Chua, who once drove a three-hour stretch without any passenger. ""I just went round and round, hoping someone would board my taxi,"" said the cab driver of 18 years. To get by, Mr Chua, who is also general secretary of the National Taxi Association, took on a temporary job to help manage operations at a migrant worker dormitory from April to July last year. He had to don personal protective equipment (PPE) when carrying out duties such as distributing meals. ""I was worried about getting the virus but I had no choice because I needed to support my family. I could only take the necessary precautions,"" said Mr Chua, who returned to driving his cab in July. At home, his 36-year-old homemaker wife and three children aged 11 to 15 had to scrimp and save too. ""We cut down on the number of dishes we eat every meal and ate more rice,"" said Mr Chua, who lives in a five-room flat in Jurong West. ""We also used the fans at home instead of switching on the air-con."" With the payouts from the assistance schemes, he settled the family's outstanding bills and kept some money for the months ahead. ""I didn't know what would happen tomorrow,"" Mr Chua admitted. ""If not for the help, we wouldn't even have food on the table."" For now, his situation has improved slightly. He drives 11 hours daily and earns about $150 a day. ""I am now just living day by day,"" he said. ""I hope that things will get better in the coming months."""

But with assistance from several Covid-19 budget measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, the father of three managed to tide over the tough time. The help included the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, which provided self-employed people with three quarterly cash payouts of $3,000 each, and the Workfare Special Payment, a $3,000 cash payout for lower-income workers. Last April, at the start of the circuit breaker, the 54-year-old drove 14 hours a day, up from the 11 hours previously. The roads were empty, recalled Mr Chua, who once drove for three hours without any passenger. ""I just went round and round, hoping someone would board my taxi,"" said the taxi driver of 18 years. To get by, Mr Chua, who is also general secretary of the National Taxi Association, took on a temporary job to help manage operations at a migrant workers' dormitory from April to July. He had to don personal protective equipment when carrying out duties such as distributing meals. ""I was worried about getting the virus, but I had no choice because I needed to support my family,"" said Mr Chua, who returned to driving his taxi last July. His 36-year-old homemaker wife and three children aged 11 to 15 had to scrimp and save too. ""We cut down on the number of dishes at every meal and ate more rice,"" said Mr Chua, who lives in a five-room flat in Jurong West. ""We also used the fans at home instead of switching on the air-con."" With the payouts from the assistance schemes, he settled the family's outstanding bills and kept some money for the months ahead. ""If not for the help, we wouldn't even have food on the table,"" said Mr Chua. Now, he drives 11 hours daily and earns about $150 a day before deducting for costs like fuel. ""I am now just living day by day,"" he said. ""I hope that things will get better in the coming months."" https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...mily-pay-bills"
"MOH welcomes insurers?? move to adjust terms for full-rider IPs, require co-payment of hospital bills",12/2/2021 11:25,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/moh-welcomes-insurers%92-move-adjust-terms-full-rider-ips-require-co-payment-hospital-bills-6464397.html,132489199,12/2/2021 10:51,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) has welcomed the latest measures by private insurers to adjust the terms for those on existing Integrated Shield Plans (IP) with riders that cover hospital bills in full. NTUC Income has begun informing policyholders on such plans that they will soon have to co-pay part of their bills when their policies are renewed. Four other insurers having IPs with such riders say they are moving policyholders to co-payment riders, or considering doing so. MOH said on Thursday (Feb 11) that these changes, together with other efforts by the Government such as the publication of fee benchmarks, ""will further encourage prudent use of healthcare services, and keep healthcare costs sustainable for all Singaporeans"". ""IP policyholders can continue to tap on their MediSave to pay for their co-payment amounts under all riders, subject to the MediSave withdrawal limits,"" the ministry told The Straits Times. MOH also said that it had been kept informed by the individual private insurers on their independent reviews of existing IP riders, which were purchased before March 8, 2018. ""We welcome and are supportive of the changes that have been announced, as they support MOH's overall healthcare cost management efforts."" NTUC Income had, from Feb 3, started informing around 160,000 policyholders of IPs with riders covering hospital bills in full that their plans will have a new co-payment feature for renewals from April 1. They will have to pay at least 5 per cent of the hospital bill, capped at $3,000 a year, subject to conditions such as prior approval from NTUC Income for the procedure. Otherwise, the cap does not apply. However, their premiums will be reduced by up to about 50 per cent, depending on the policy and the policyholder's age, the insurer added. And those with serious medical conditions will start co-payment only from next year. NTUC Income's switch comes after the average premiums of its Plus Rider increased between 14 per cent and 41 per cent from 2018 to last year. Meanwhile, Aviva Singapore said its 100,000 customers who are on existing full-coverage riders will have to co-pay part of their bills from April. However, they will see a reduction in their premiums on the next renewal if they are within the same premium age bands. Prudential Singapore says slightly over 10 per cent of its customers on full riders will move to co-payment riders upon policy renewals, from April. Its head of product management Stanley Ng said the insurer will keep an eye on medical inflation and find ways to ensure healthcare remains accessible to the community. In its reply on Thursday, MOH reiterated why it backs the shift away from full riders. It noted that in past years, there have been concerns over rising healthcare costs and the impact of these on the sustainability and affordability of health insurance premiums. ""In particular, full riders that cover the entire co-payment required under IPs have contributed to the over-consumption, over-servicing and over-charging by doctors and policyholders which in turn impacts healthcare costs,"" the ministry added. ""This is why MOH had worked with insurers to introduce a minimum 5 per cent co-payment for new IP riders sold from April 1, 2019."" Those who had bought IP riders between March 8, 2018 and April 1, 2019 will also need to transition to the new IP riders from April 1 this year. MOH said this was an important move to preserve the principle of co-payment in Singapore's healthcare financing system. It also explained why it did not mandate the 5 per cent co-payment for existing rider policies purchased before March 8, 2018. ""We recognised that these were commercial contracts between insurers and their policyholders,"" it said. ""However, we welcome the latest changes by private insurers."" Added the ministry: ""We also urge all stakeholders, including patients and medical practitioners, to continue to exercise responsibility when choosing and recommending appropriate and necessary care."" https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...and-require-co"

NTUC Income has begun informing policyholders on such plans that they will soon have to co-pay part of their bills when their policies are renewed. Four other insurers having IPs with such riders say they are moving policyholders to co-payment riders, or considering doing so. MOH said on Thursday (Feb 11) that these changes, together with other efforts by the Government such as the publication of fee benchmarks, ""will further encourage prudent use of healthcare services, and keep healthcare costs sustainable for all Singaporeans"". ""IP policyholders can continue to tap on their MediSave to pay for their co-payment amounts under all riders, subject to the MediSave withdrawal limits,"" the ministry told The Straits Times. MOH also said that it had been kept informed by the individual private insurers on their independent reviews of existing IP riders, which were purchased before March 8, 2018. ""We welcome and are supportive of the changes that have been announced, as they support MOH's overall healthcare cost management efforts."" NTUC Income had, from Feb 3, started informing around 160,000 policyholders of IPs with riders covering hospital bills in full that their plans will have a new co-payment feature for renewals from April 1. They will have to pay at least 5 per cent of the hospital bill, capped at $3,000 a year, subject to conditions such as prior approval from NTUC Income for the procedure. Otherwise, the cap does not apply. However, their premiums will be reduced by up to about 50 per cent, depending on the policy and the policyholder's age, the insurer added. And those with serious medical conditions will start co-payment only from next year. NTUC Income's switch comes after the average premiums of its Plus Rider increased between 14 per cent and 41 per cent from 2018 to last year. Meanwhile, Aviva Singapore said its 100,000 customers who are on existing full-coverage riders will have to co-pay part of their bills from April. However, they will see a reduction in their premiums on the next renewal if they are within the same premium age bands. Prudential Singapore says slightly over 10 per cent of its customers on full riders will move to co-payment riders upon policy renewals, from April. Its head of product management Stanley Ng said the insurer will keep an eye on medical inflation and find ways to ensure healthcare remains accessible to the community. In its reply on Thursday, MOH reiterated why it backs the shift away from full riders. It noted that in past years, there have been concerns over rising healthcare costs and the impact of these on the sustainability and affordability of health insurance premiums. ""In particular, full riders that cover the entire co-payment required under IPs have contributed to the over-consumption, over-servicing and over-charging by doctors and policyholders which in turn impacts healthcare costs,"" the ministry added. ""This is why MOH had worked with insurers to introduce a minimum 5 per cent co-payment for new IP riders sold from April 1, 2019."" Those who had bought IP riders between March 8, 2018 and April 1, 2019 will also need to transition to the new IP riders from April 1 this year. MOH said this was an important move to preserve the principle of co-payment in Singapore's healthcare financing system. It also explained why it did not mandate the 5 per cent co-payment for existing rider policies purchased before March 8, 2018. ""We recognised that these were commercial contracts between insurers and their policyholders,"" it said. ""However, we welcome the latest changes by private insurers."" Added the ministry: ""We also urge all stakeholders, including patients and medical practitioners, to continue to exercise responsibility when choosing and recommending appropriate and necessary care."" https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...and-require-co while their agents continue to milk millions, our voted incumbent decided to hand more to them. how wonderful."

Sure u can continue no co pay... but ur premium will just increase a lot year n year... Cos e premiums are not guaranteed... So for a healthy policy owner... u can keep this buffet... but u may not get to eat cos being healthy is better den going to hospital like a hotel... They started with the newer policies on the co pay... Old policies was a matter of when change only... Another thing that could have made it less desirable is that some insurers sell such hospital plans to foreigners also... at a high premium of course. But my guess is their hospital bills are very expensive.

Singapore economy could have contracted 12.4% if not for COVID-19 Budget measures,11/2/2021 17:24,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/singapore-economy-could-have-contracted-12-4%25-if-not-covid-19-budget-measures-6464041.html,132480064,11/2/2021 17:14,"Without the support measures rolled out by the Government to cushion the blow of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy would likely have contracted by twice as much last year, according to a paper released by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Thursday (Feb 11). The interim assessment of the impact of key COVID-19 Budget measures found that the Singapore economy could have shrunk 12.4 per cent or more last year. Singapore's GDP fell by 5.8 per cent in 2020, based on advance estimates. Using a simulation model, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) estimated that last year's five Budgets costing about S$100 billion supported GDP growth by 5.5 percentage points. The easing of monetary policy pushed up the GDP by a further 1.1 percentage points - shaving 6.6 percentage points off GDP decline. ""The COVID-19 support measures have made a significant difference to keep our people safe and preserve our livelihoods,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Thursday at the Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa, where he spoke to hotel staff and some beneficiaries of COVID-19 Budget schemes. ""Job losses were averted and shocks were cushioned. More help went to supporting families in need, which went some way to mitigate inequality. ""The interim analysis is encouraging, as it showed that the schemes are achieving the outcomes that they were designed for."" The Budget measures, including the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), may have helped save or create about 155,000 jobs on average over 2020 and 2021, MOF said. From April to December last year, S$22.6 billion was paid out in wage support for Singaporean workers to firms under JSS. The payouts accounted for about 80 per cent of grants to businesses in 2020. The Government has also introduced measures to help create jobs and match jobseekers with work and training opportunities. The SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package placed nearly 76,000 local jobseekers in growth sectors such as ICT, healthcare and manufacturing, MOF said. The take-up rate for the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI), which was introduced later in the year, was encouraging, the ministry said. JGI supports firms that create new jobs by co-paying a portion of the salaries of new local hires for one year. In September and October, 110,000 jobseekers were hired under the scheme by 26,000 employers. In all, companies received S$27.4 billion in grants to stay afloat. Smaller firms and firms in sectors most affected by the pandemic received more support, MOF said. Singapore companies also benefitted from financing schemes, with around 20,000 firms accessing loans worth more than S$17 billion from March to December last year. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...onomy-14168694"

I m sure big chunk of the 100B went to benefit the fts here which in turn got transferred back to their home cuntry. This is called outflow of capital i.e. hollowing out effect. May Day wrote: How did it benefit Singaporeans? That $700 and the subsequently $100 billions spent on COVID actually benefited many foreigners who are PR and treated many foreigners on work passes in Singapore. Some of my foreign colleagues on work passes got 14 days free SHN last year when they returned to Singapore after returning to their home countries for extended leave and holidays. And these people are not doing jobs that Singaporeans do not want to do.

A statement was posted on the club\x92s Facebook page yesterday evening (Feb 10). \x93It is indeed sad to say that we have to announce the curtain call for this amazing nightlife journey with you,\x94 co-owners Roy Ng and Mahen Nathan wrote. \x93It wasn\x92t easy, and our team has been battling back and forth with the pandemic to keep things afloat. We had that little ray of hope of operating again, but as our funds were almost depleted after holding on for 9 months we had to face reality and move on \x96 to learn, and accept the changes, and embrace it.\x94 Canvas Club opened in July 2014 at Upper Circular Road, taking over the space that was previously inhabited by Home Club, another beloved venue that had been a home and incubator for Singapore\x92s alternative and independent rock music scene. Eschewing typical nightlife concepts that existed in the area, Canvas hosted events that spanned art exhibitions, music-themed parties, comedy nights, corporate affairs, and concerts. Regular music nights at the venue included .Wav(y), a hip-hop night, and the trance-themed Transitions. As the pandemic forced all venues to shut their doors temporarily, Canvas turned Transitions into a series of podcasts and livestreams in April, before restarting food and beverage operations in September. Canvas\x92 closure is the latest example of the pandemic\x92s detrimental impact on event spaces in Singapore, with arts-and-F&B venues Kult Kafe and Telok Ayer Arts Club leaving their brick-and-mortar premises in recent months. A government-planned pilot programme to temporarily reopen selected nightlife venues was deferred indefinitely in January due to a recent increase in community cases of COVID-19. https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/mus...ndemic-2876794"

The number of enterprises that benefited remained constant at 14,000, SSG said on Tuesday (Feb 9) in a statement on its annual yearly review. Introduced in 2015, the SkillsFuture national movement aims to build a culture of skills development and lifelong learning. Measures in response to Covid-19 ""SSG's efforts over the years to build up a robust and sizeable continuing education and training ecosystem have enabled us to respond rapidly to the impact of Covid-19 on individuals and enterprises,"" said the agency. New measures were quickly implemented, and existing initiatives were adjusted to support individuals and enterprises affected by the pandemic, it added. The SGUnited Skills Programme and SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme were launched with the aim of providing individuals with training opportunities to upskill themselves and enhance their employability for transition to new careers or roles. Both programmes are part of the national SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. As of December last year, about 9,800 individuals had enrolled in those programmes - 7,200 under the SGUnited Skills Programme and 2,600 under the company training track of the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme. The infocomm technology and media, professional services, manufacturing and healthcare sectors reported high enrolment, SSG said. Enterprises in severely affected sectors also received aid through the Enhanced Training Support Package, which was rolled out in March last year to provide enhanced absentee payroll support and enhanced course fee subsidies for eight sectors, including air transport and tourism. These two sectors had a strong take-up rate, with more than 59,000 training places and 44,000 training places filled respectively, out of a total of about 155,000 training places. Some of the skills that employees took up under this support package include data analytics, digital commerce and customer service, as well as soft skills in communication and adapting to change. In total, more than 72,000 employees across 1,300 enterprises benefited. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ture-singapore"

The median monthly household income from work fell by 2.5 per cent in nominal terms to S$9,189 last year from S$9,425 in 2019, the Department of Statistics (DOS) said on Monday (8 February) in its yearly \x93Key Household Income Trends, 2020\x94 report. After adjusting for inflation, this works out to a 2.4 per cent drop in real terms. The last decline, which was also 2.4 per cent, happened in 2009 after the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, median monthly household income from work of resident employed households \x96comprising citizens and permanent residents with at least one working person \x96 rose over the last five years by 5.2 per cent cumulatively, or 1.0 per cent per annum in real terms. Median monthly household income from work per household member dropped to S$2,886 last year from S$2,925 in 2019. This marks a decline of 1.3 per cent in nominal terms or 1.2 per cent in real terms. From 2015 to 2020, the median income per household member grew by 14.6 per cent cumulatively, or 2.8 per cent per annum in real terms. The report found that lower income households were the hardest hit, with those in the bottom 10 per cent seeing a 6.1 per cent real decline in income. In contrast, households in the top 90 per cent income groups recorded real income declines of 1.4 to 3.2 per cent. Government transfers and taxes significantly reduced the Gini coefficient to 0.375 from 0.452 in 2020, larger than the reduction to 0.398 from 0.452 in 2019. The Gini coefficient measures income inequality from 0 to 1, with 0 being most equal. The reduction arose from the significant amount of government support provided during the COVID-19 crisis last year, especially for households staying in the smaller HDB flats, the DOS said. Resident households, including those with no working persons, received S$6,308 per household member on average from various government schemes last year, higher than the S$4,684 received in 2019, the DOS added. In particular, resident households in HDB 1-room and 2-room flats received S$13,670 per household member on average, almost double the transfers received by resident households in HDB 3-room flats."

The median monthly household income from work fell by 2.5 per cent from S$9,425 in 2019 to S$9,189 in 2020, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. After adjusting for inflation, it was a 2.4 per cent drop. However, from 2015, when the median monthly household income was S$8,666, there was a cumulative increase of 5.2 per cent or 1 per cent per annum in real terms, said DOS. To account for different household sizes, DOS also provided figures for the median monthly household income from work per household member. This fell from S$2,925 in 2019 to S$2,886 in 2020, a decline of 1.3 per cent, or 1.2 per cent after adjusting for inflation - the first decline since 2008/2009, a result of the Global Financial Crisis. But from 2015 to 2020, the number grew by 14.6 per cent, or 2.8 per cent per annum in real terms. This trend held true for households across income groups, it said. DOS said that households in the 1st to 60th percentile saw a S$37 to S$49 drop in their average household income per member, whereas households in the 61st to 100th percentile had their income fall between S$96 and S$337. After adjusting for inflation, households in the top 90 per cent income groups recorded real income declines of 1.4 to 3.2 per cent, while incomes for households in the bottom 10 per cent declined 6.1 per cent. However, their incomes all grew in the five years from 2015 to 2020, with increases ranging from 0.6 to 2.9 per cent a year. INCOME GAP REDUCED AFTER GOVERNMENT TRANSFERS The income divide as measured by the Gini coefficient was the lowest in two decades, as government transfers closed the gap. The Gini coefficient is equal to zero in the case of total income equality, and is one in the case of total inequality. Singapore's Gini coefficient was 0.452 in 2020, unchanged from 2019 but fell to 0.375 after government transfers and taxes. The Gini coefficient was 0.398 in 2019 after transfers, a record low then. ""This can be attributed to the significant amount of government support provided during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, especially for households staying in the smaller HDB flats,"" said DOS in a media release. Resident households received S$6,308 per household member on average from various Government schemes in 2020, which was higher than the S$4,684 received the year before Those in HDB 1- & 2-room flats received S$13,670 per household member on average, close to double the transfers received by resident households in HDB 3-room flats. The report noted that its analyses focused on resident households with at least one working person, which constituted 86.7 per cent of all resident households in 2020.

In a new report released on Monday afternoon, the Department of Statistics(DOS) found that lower income households were the hardest hit, with those in the bottom 10 per cent seeing a 6.1 per cent real decline in income. In contrast, the rest of the households recorded real declines of 1.4 to 3.2 per cent. But Government transfers and taxes also significantly reduced the Gini coefficient from 0.452 to 0.375. The Gini coefficient measures income inequality from 0 to 1, with 0 being most equal. ""This can be attributed to the significant amount of government support provided during the Covid-19 crisis in 2020, especially for households staying in the smaller Housing Board flats,"" said the DOS in a statement. Resident households - including those with no working persons - received $6,308 per household member on average from various Government schemes last year, compared with the $4,684 received in 2019. The DOS also noted that median household income from work has increased over the last five years, at a rate of 1 per cent per year in real terms or 5.2 per cent cumulatively since 2015. Median monthly household income from work per household member dropped from $2,925 in 2019 to $2,886 in last year, a decline of 1.3 per cent in nominal terms or 1.2 per cent in real terms. In comparison, this figure grew by 14.6 per cent cumulatively or 2.8 per cent per year in real terms, from 2015 to 2020. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...5%20to%202020."

While a presidential memorandum is largely symbolic, Biden campaigned on a pledge to pass LGBTQ rights legislation known as the Equality Act in the first 100 days of his administration and to make LGBTQ rights a top priority. The memo directs U.S. agencies working abroad to work harder to combat the criminalization by foreign governments of LGBTQ status or conduct, and directs the State Department to include anti-LGBTQ violence, discrimination and laws in its annual human rights report. It calls for increased efforts to ensure that LGBTQ asylum seekers have equal access to protection, expanded training for U.S. federal personnel, and potential increased use of priority referrals to expedite resettlement of vulnerable people. And it instructs agencies to consider appropriate responses, including the full range of diplomatic tools, and potentially financial sanctions and visa restrictions , when foreign governments restricted the rights of LGBTQ people. Biden announced the push during a forceful speech at the State Department, vowing to rebuild U.S. credibility worldwide. \x93To further repair our moral leadership, I\x92m also issuing a presidential memo to agencies to reinvigorate our leadership on the LGBTQI issues and do it internationally,\x94 he said. \x93We\x92ll ensure diplomacy and foreign assistance are working to promote the rights of those individuals, included by combating criminalization and protecting LGBTQ refugees and asylum-seekers.\x94 Biden\x92s campaign pledge included protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, ensuring fair treatment in the justice system and advancing LGBTQ rights globally. Biden has already issued an executive order that extends existing federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ people. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday said Biden \x93stands by\x94 his pledge to sign the Equality Act in his first 100 days but noted that Congress would need to take action to pass a bill first."

Nothing wrong with that except the positions were SP and EP holders with a minimum salary criteria higher than the average sinkies. The consequences are employers have to employ them as PMETs to justify the high pay, some of which with dubious qualifications from home countries. How would one feel if you have to report to a foreigner less qualified and capable when you are in your own country? The sad part is we ended up helping to develop the SP & EP holders as they hold PMETs positions. The WSQ certifications have no bearing as FTs are hired even though they don't possess these qualifications. Whether it is hinghtsight or not, it is Time to reverse the situation and give sinkies what they deserve in their own countries. The quota for SPs should be reduced. Those who are developing countries such as Philippines, India, Vietnam and Myanmar should be considered for work permit instead of SP which commands higher salaries.

Well, so answer this question. 16 years time not sufficient to train up good programmers and develop a strong IT industry in Singapore for Singaporeans to work in? Just so you know, 16 years ago, Alipay have not even started their online platform.  Today in the same amount of time that the LHL's administration wasted and let in 1.5 millions additional foreigners to pursue his GDP-growth via population ponzi, China had developed its contactless payment industry from scratch and is leading the world in this future high-growth industry. Same 16 years. China had moved from the backwaters with low internet penetration and patchy 2G/3G signal coverage to leading the world in IT fields like contactless payment and 5G technology. So much so that the Trump's administration felt the threat and need to set embargoes on Huawei's 5G technology around the world for the American firms to catch up. Where did the LHL""s administration lead Singapore's economy and the Singaporean workers to after these 16 years? Yes, 16 years is not enough. You are comparing China to SG, China has 1.3 billion people. Alibaba alone hires 100k employees. Singapore has barely 2.3m workforce.

So is it still the same situation as in 2012 when Foreigner PMETs consist of 38% of the workforce but were paid higher salaries than all of Singaporean workers that they could be paying more than 50% of all of the income taxes collected in Singapore? In 2012, there was a question asked by the Opposition MPs in the parliament to forced the LHL's Administration to reveal this piece of data. The Ministerial answer should be captured in the Hansard. Since then, this piece of information published in the Straits Times no less, in 2012 - that 38% of foreigners paid in excess of 50% of the income tax collected in Singapore - was scrubbed clean from ST's own websites. Now, this piece of fact that foreigners in Singapore earned more income and paid more income tax in Singapore (than even the likes of new citizens such as DBS' Piyush Gupta) is only easily accessible in academic pieces from that era. The LHL's Administration had not published this piece of information since their first mistake in 2012."

Singaporeans are already serving foreigners by being PHV drivers and pizza delivery to serve foreigners who are in cushy jobs and could WFH in their nice condominium living. Jobs that many Singaporeans can and want to do are taken by foreigners over the last 10-15 years. Singaporeans would have been trained to do those jobs if given the opportunities to enter those companies 10-15 years ago.

Last time this kind of stuff happen President ong teng cheong sanction a strike for marine workers Even lky kpkb also have to give way..... Either halimah do one more term of presidency or Sinkie wake up their idea. Singaporeans are highly educated by international standards and are more than capable to perform any junior, middle, senior or even top roles at any MNCs. 16 years ago when LHL's administration started his FT policy in 2004, the claims was that no Singaporeans had those high level skills to be paid high salary. 16 years later, now in 2020; the LHL's administration is still perpetuating the strawman argument that in order to attract foreign investments, MNCs need to bring in FTs because Singaporeans do not have the necessary skills; while asking Singaporeans to go for WDA and internships to ""upskills"". That 12 years-old Singaporean kid in 2004 grew up to be a 28-year-old struggling to make ends meet by delivering pizzas to FTs still working in the comfort and safety of their homes? What happened these 16 years from 2004 to 2020? Creating good paying jobs and training Singaporeans from scratch is not rocket science. It a matter of resolve and priorities. Fyi, US took just three years of training from scratch and preparation to send their first man into space. And we are talking about the Yanks working with the constraints of 1960s/70s technology, when a whole computer had to be built and house in large buildings. Even our modern day iPhone in the pockets have 1,000,000 times more processing power and 10,000,000 times more RAM. And the Americans just took three years from zero to hero to send a man into space! The LHL's administration has 16 years and they cannot even train up sufficient Singaporean workers to work in those good and well-paid jobs created by giving tax incentives and rebates to foreign MNCs?"

If u run a biz, and u cannot survive for next year because your industry is not profitable, it is best for u and for society that u just fold and do something else. We don't really care, u are business owner, and risk is part of doing business and u should have taken profits during good times. We care abt the employee who has kids and 55yo tan who has mother with cancer. So give the money from budget surpluses direct to the citizens, 20k 40k and give businesses interest free loans. Let the industries that are profitable grow and business by nature will adjust to where profit is. This is a better way imo. But of course now is too late already la money all spent already.

We don't really care, u are business owner, and risk is part of doing business and u should have taken profits during good times. We care abt the employee who has kids and 55yo tan who has mother with cancer. So give the money from budget surpluses direct to the citizens, 20k 40k and give businesses interest free loans. Let the industries that are profitable grow and business by nature will adjust to where profit is. This is a better way imo. But of course now is too late already la money all spent already.

Another lie to cover another lie. WP please check!!!! I beginning to think so too. WP needs to have access to the data to double confirm. Reminded moi of this story; got a part abt swim with the tide: During a robbery in Guangzhou, China, the bank robber shouted to everyone in the bank: \x93Don\x92t move. The money belongs to the State. Your life belongs to you.\x94 Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. This is called \x93Mind Changing Concept\x94 Changing the conventional way of thinking. When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her: \x93Please be civilized! This is a robbery and not a rape!\x94 This is called \x93Being Professional\x94 Focus only on what you are trained to do! When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA-trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school): \x93Big brother, let\x92s count how much we got.\x94 The older robber rebutted and said: \x93You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!\x94 This is called \x93Experience.\x94 Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications! After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: \x93Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank\x94. This is called \x93Swim with the tide.\x94 Converting an unfavourable situation to your advantage! The supervisor says: \x93It will be good if there is a robbery every month.\x94 This is called \x93Killing Boredom.\x94 Personal Happiness is more important than your job. The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. The robbers were very angry and complained: \x93We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!\x94 This is called \x93Knowledge\x93 https://www.bhavinionline.com/2013/1...-bank-robbery/"
