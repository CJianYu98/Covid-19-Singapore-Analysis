You are already wishing for people to die when you hope that such an act of murder was to happen just to prove your point through emotional appeals.

Even if anyone hacks into TT and get all the data inside I also don't care. You just killed your own point of argument. You are saying TT data are not sensitive compared to CCTVs and various other forms of survellance. This means that the TT data is comparatively useless in light of CCTV. In that case, there is no point using the TT data when the CCTV data provides everything that TT data provides, plus much more. Also, a person carrying out premeditated murder will also be logical enough to not carry or activate his/her TT token/app. This renders TT data useless most of the time."

Second, the Bluetooth data collected is stored locally in the user\x92s App/Token in an encrypted form. The data is not accessible unless uploaded. Any data shared with the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be used for contact tracing persons possibly exposed to COVID-19. Only authorised public officers will be able to use the data. Third, user personal information, including their unique identification number and mobile number, is not revealed to other TraceTogether users. They are substituted by a random permanent ID. This information is stored in a secured server. As an added layer of protection, TraceTogether also creates temporary IDs that change regularly. Only these temporary IDs are exchanged between phones. These measures protect users from malicious actors who may seek to eavesdrop and track interactions over time. Lastly, once contact tracing ceases, we will prompt users to disable TraceTogether's functionality. Your privacy is important to us. You can see our Privacy Statement at www.tracetogether.gov.sg/common/privacystatement for more details on how we protect your privacy."

Yesterday I saw it flash red so I went to exchange. CC is near my place. Received a brand new one. Flatter, rectangular one. The one I originally got, they pulled out a plastic tab before giving me. I believe the battery started working only when they pulled out the tab. Lasted about 4 months. I like the new one. Flat, easier to keep in pocket. I intend to change the battery myself when the time comes. The old one can change battery yourself also, but the new one is easier. So they gave u a brand new one which is slimmer? How u gonna change the battery for this new flat token? Is there an instruction or user manual or something?"

One less thing to bring out Yes. That's my preference as well. I have a very well practised routine to access the TT app on my smartphone. The QR scanner on the TT app is *very* quick and accurate. Don't have to place your phone right in front of the QR code to scan, like what I see many do. You can scan from behind and at angle and there is a good chance that it will also register.

Flash your SafeEntry pass and walk through the entrance check point without stopping. Except that you have to use the TT app instead of the SingPass app once TT is made mandatory. But the TT app also has a favourites feature which you can use."

It can include a simple backdoor that uploads the data whenever it receives a certain command. The first few version of the token may be innocent/harmless. The goverment also not completely stupid. But once people are used to carrying it, replacing it with new ones, who guarantees new version won't have added ""features""? Some features can also be intentionally made known, to give some benefit ( use as EZLink, electronic payment ) to justify adding components to support other undisclosed functionality. Lastly, the benefits/protection that this token supposedly provides to Singaporeans, is practically non-existent. There are so many situations it can miss out. Plus way too costly compared to better alternatives like simply banning some countries from coming in. We've almost stamped out community cases so no imported cases = no need to trace."

It can include a simple backdoor that uploads the data whenever it receives a certain command. The first few version of the token may be innocent/harmless. The goverment also not completely stupid. But once people are used to carrying it, replacing it with new ones, who guarantees new version won't have added ""features""? Some features can also be intentionally made known, to give some benefit ( use as EZLink, electronic payment ) to justify adding components to support other undisclosed functionality. Lastly, the benefits/protection that this token supposedly provides to Singaporeans, is practically non-existent. There are so many situations it can miss out. Plus way too costly compared to better alternatives like simply banning some countries from coming in. We've almost stamped out community cases so no imported cases = no need to trace. that makes sense..."

Methinks what you said is true of all diseases, and you're right tt will not covid because the incubation period is long. Maybe it helps to think tt doesn't stop covid, but applies a brake to slow down the transmission.

You can't prevent the spread to those that have already been in contact, but you can avoid further spread. Until a quick test or vaccine appears, this is probably one of the better mechanisms to manage thee disease. It doesn't do anything to slow down transmission. Even assuming perfect 100% adoption, the time lapse between infection, detection of infection, gathering of TT data, sifting for high risk contacts, to finally contacting the potential infected people is way too big.

When they encourage others to avoid being tracked ostensibly for privacy reasons, they become safer that they won\x92t stick out due to safety in numbers. Singapore like a lot of other countries already tracks the following. EZ-Link data can easily be cross referenced with the security cameras monitoring all mrt and lrt access points. Carparks with security cameras can be cross referenced with all the street cameras. When you carry a phone with signal, your location is being tracked based on the nric used to register that SIM card. Telcos almost everywhere have to turn over that data with a search warrant. Unless you like walking around without a phone and pay for everything in cash, you are already tracked."

Your presence in the mall is already known when you scan in, but if you're even worry about them knowing which shop you are near to, well that's your concern and not up to me to say correct or wrong. The problem with many TT defenders is the blindness or reluctance to think of the bigger picture, potential repercussions of allowing this to get a foothold and possibly propagate and evolved into something else together in the years to come. Maybe we're worry too much, but maybe it is our vocal protests that make the government rethink quietly what they had planned to do. There are many examples in history of countries/people who think ""don't worry lah, won't happen that way one lah, XYZ only"". Now TT may only be used for contact tracing, it might only be possible to get the data only if you hand over the token. But there is no guarantee it really can't be extract by government with backdoor, or some versions down the road won't be expanded with additional capabilities. At some point, TT may become so widespread, people generally overlook it. They may believe it is accurate and reliable despite tech savvy people pointing out how it can be broken/spoofed/misused. One day when police turns up to arrest you for a crime, say murder, you know you didn't commit, but TT from the victim ""proved"" that you were the only person near the victim at the estimated time of crime. Then it would be too late to protest about it. With the recent case of how the police handled the Indian maid vs CEO, you think they will rely on the ""proven"" and ""reliable"" TT data or make the extra effort to verify your claims and prove you not in the area? How about if you were actually in the area but didn't see the crime while the criminal didn't have an active TT token? So you gg as the last and only known contact before victim was murdered"

The problem with many TT defenders is the blindness or reluctance to think of the bigger picture, potential repercussions of allowing this to get a foothold and possibly propagate and evolved into something else together in the years to come. Maybe we're worry too much, but maybe it is our vocal protests that make the government rethink quietly what they had planned to do. There are many examples in history of countries/people who think ""don't worry lah, won't happen that way one lah, XYZ only"". Now TT may only be used for contact tracing, it might only be possible to get the data only if you hand over the token. But there is no guarantee it really can't be extract by government with backdoor, or some versions down the road won't be expanded with additional capabilities. At some point, TT may become so widespread, people generally overlook it. They may believe it is accurate and reliable despite tech savvy people pointing out how it can be broken/spoofed/misused. One day when police turns up to arrest you for a crime, say murder, you know you didn't commit, but TT from the victim ""proved"" that you were the only person near the victim at the estimated time of crime. Then it would be too late to protest about it. With the recent case of how the police handled the Indian maid vs CEO, you think they will rely on the ""proven"" and ""reliable"" TT data or make the extra effort to verify your claims and prove you not in the area? How about if you were actually in the area but didn't see the crime while the criminal didn't have an active TT token? So you gg as the last and only known contact before victim was murdered"

Furthermore. let's say if I install a bluetooth device at Tampines Mall entrance and record every single device it pairs with and how long. Isn't that also collecting location data via bluetooth means? You can tell me that is not doable? Our government explicit says that Quote: The TraceTogether App does not collect or use physical location data (e.g. GPS, WiFi fingerprinting, cell ID). It only records proximity via Bluetooth. So if they have a bluetooth device installed at entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth? Proximity to entrance so they can track your location. To pinpoint a person's location you just need 3 fixed bluetooth transponders to triangulate your exact location. Then you have it, how to get a person's location based on proximity data. Tell me isit possible anot lo."

Let's say if I install a bluetooth device at a shopping mall, let's say, Tampines Mall entrance and record every single device it pairs with and how long. Our government explicit says that Quote: The TraceTogether App does not collect or use physical location data (e.g. GPS, WiFi fingerprinting, cell ID). It only records proximity via Bluetooth. So if they have a bluetooth device installed at all entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth? Proximity to entrance so they can track your location. To pinpoint a person's location you just need 3 fixed bluetooth transponders to triangulate your exact location.

Our government explicit says that So if they have a bluetooth device installed at all entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth? Proximity to entrance so they can track your location. To pinpoint a person's location you just need 3 fixed bluetooth transponders to triangulate your exact location.

Let's say we are able to do do immediate mass-testing It can only tell you who has covid now, and isolate those people. but viruses can spread/be imported/test negative at first then turn positive therefore mass testing will not eradicate covid19. if it is feasible, govt would have done it already; no need you to suggest, you are not smarter than govt. it is more sensible to trace where the virus spreads, and apply measures to contain the spread. that is why we have SAFE ENTRY - to track location of spread and TRACE TOGETHER - to track spreading clusters amongst the people plus the device is free, and safe. why people so against it, is really due to lack of understanding."

If they embed rfid in NRICs, then there would be no more need for the tokens. We just need to amend the legislation to make carrying NRICs mandatory like Hong Kong. That would be real tracking.

He gives an example in which a government struggling against Covid-19 might want to enforce quarantine control. It could do so, he says, by fitting Bluetooth sensors to public spaces to identify dongle users who are out and about when they should be self-isolating at home. ""All you have to do is install physical infrastructure in the world and the data that is collecting can be mapped back to Singapore ID numbers,"" he explains.

Poomer wrote: Scenario 1: Let's say if government install a bluetooth device at Tampines Mall entrance and record every single device it pairs with and how long. Isn't that also collecting location data via bluetooth means? You can tell me that is not doable? Our government comments on the TT initiative. Quote: The TraceTogether App does not collect or use physical location data (e.g. GPS, WiFi fingerprinting, cell ID). It only records proximity via Bluetooth. So if they have a bluetooth device installed at entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth? Proximity to entrance so they can track your location. To pinpoint a person's location you just need 3 fixed bluetooth transponders to triangulate your exact location. Then you have it, how to get a person's location based on proximity data. Can be done anot? A university professor also mentioned the same thing: Quote: Dr Michael Veale, a digital rights expert at University College London, warns of the potential for mission creep. He gives an example in which a government struggling against Covid-19 might want to enforce quarantine control. It could do so, he says, by fitting Bluetooth sensors to public spaces to identify dongle users who are out and about when they should be self-isolating at home. ""All you have to do is install physical infrastructure in the world and the data that is collecting can be mapped back to Singapore ID numbers,"" he explains. ""The buildability is the worrying part."" is this concept too big for you coern? dun have a mind of your own just say dun have a mind of your own la."

Otherwise, higher chance I will lose my job Plus, as a CT, I would also know for the past six months, our government already reached agreement with the very smart ( as stated by government appointed expert) COVID virus that it will not infect people in public as long as their north/south/east/west only got 1 direct person. This is why groups of up to 5 is allowed and that's why no need social distancing in public transport even though people can be in direct contact with each other for extended periods. Our low to zero community spread is testament to how effective our government's deal with the very smart COVID virus is. So from a CT POV, TT is just for show and increases risk of retrenchment."

At the end of the day its still a numbers game and a stalemate or a coalition government will be formed. When that happens can we say its best for the people? There will be populism and we all know what that leads too. Much like minimum wage, the vote goes to the highest bidder. How can the electorate ensure that it does not happen? the answer is we cant. We want the cake and eat it. But in reality there is no such thing. You rightly pointed out, tracking is already a possibility. the key is the intent. Why are ppl doubtful of the intent? I think the answer is fairly obvious. But judging by the performance of the ruling party, I will say the minority who reject that do it out of their own malicious intent."

Very simple, the TT scheme and now with this TT token is to streamline the contact tracing process to make it more efficient. Previously they have to utilize hige amount of resources and manpower to conduct contact tracing, which is the initial flaw as it took too long for them to trace each contact that had close contact with the infected person.

There can be no deviations from this in the tokens else it will not work with other mobile devices since BLE is a standard . There's some treachery from the antenna maker.

Anyway, I been explaining way too many times liao. So this will be the last. Tracking does not prevent you from getting infected. Neither does it prevent you from passing it to your family members if you have it. Carrying the TT token is just for them to perform contact tracing more easily. TT token will not prevent the virus from spreading. So it will not prevent a lockdown if it comes to that.

I must admit that I'm not an expert on this particular chipset and I've not scrutinized the entire datahsheet yet. I'm also by no means an electrical engineer, but I can guarantee that the jammer mentioned in the medium article works especially since not every TT device has an output power of 20dBm. I doubt that TX power of these tokens go anywhere near 8dBm since all they need is a proximity of 10m. They're more likely to have a transmit power of 0dBm or less. I'm just here to discuss and provide the tools for people to protect their own privacy.

But as the old saying goes, it's better then nothing. For the token, the flaws are pretty layman knowledge and comes as no surprise. But the idea that Government can use it to track people's movement for no reason whatsoever is all conspiracy theories that have no credibility whatsoever. The idea of privacy is moot too. If government really want to track your movements for whatever reason they don't need this TT to do it. Nowadays cameras are everywhere, from HDB lift landings to MRT stations and lamp posts etc. If they want they can start tracking you the moment you step out of your house. The main point is that this TT token requires the public to corporate with goodwill. Anyone that seeks to undermine the functionality of the TT token could be deemed malicious and should be prosecuted. Anyway once it's made mandatory to be used in public spaces let's see how many people will really put the tokens in faraday pouches or whatever mods ""discussed"" here. Don't be surprised if the authorities have a way to check if your token is active or not. And lastly don't have to argue with the other fella lah.

Again I'm still waiting for someone to disprove me that the jammer doesn't work. I got this http://www.green-antenna.com/web/sit...3416BL02_S.pdf by looking at the label on the TT token as well. It's in the breakdown. As for the transmitter I've already stated my case earlier on Quote: Welp if you insist, I manage to dig up this datasheet by looking at a teardown and the chip label https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/bluenrg-2.pdf it has a max transmit power of 8dBm. I must admit that I'm not an expert on this particular chipset and I've not scrutinized the entire datahsheet yet. I'm also by no means an electrical engineer, but I can guarantee that the jammer mentioned in the medium article works especially since not every TT device has an output power of 20dBm. I doubt that TX power of these tokens go anywhere near 8dBm since all they need is a proximity of 10m. They're more likely to have a transmit power of 0dBm or less. I'm just here to discuss and provide the tools for people to protect their own privacy. I've not heard of anyone offering a good solution for mitigation against BLE replay attacks or BLE jamming yet.

Exactly, as I pointed out and rightly so. the current tracking system has it's limitations. That's where TT comes in. Just because police able to track 1-2 person or 100 person a day. Doesnt mean they have the capabilities to track 1 million at a go. So that's why I dont get the oh SPF can track us anyway ior our smartphone/laptop is already being tracked so we should let the government use TT to track us instead argument. I use those same arguments they offer back at them, since they claim government/companies already can track us, then use current solutions, no need TT then. Oh suddenly, the current solutions got limitations. Exactly lo, now you know why they need a more invasive programme to track us. And when I mean track us is not tha I'm claiming they track us for some dubious reason right off the bat. But let's be very honest here, nobody can promise we wont get there eventually. We have to look at the entire situation from a holistic point of view, it is not 1 person or 10 person's privacy being trodden. But an entire nation of 3 million+++ people. MikeDirnt78 wrote: SPF is quite efficient in solving most of the crimes. They certainly don't need the help of a token. Does that put your claim to rest? TLDR: All the simplistic argument about they already can track us through our laptop smartphone so TT is nothing. Simple answer. Then can explain why they dont use those to track? Like that wont need TT what. I guarantee plus chop nobody can give a satisfactory answer that explain if the government already has all that data at their fingertips, why do they even need to implement TT. Furthermore, what kinda logic is since the government is able to track us on our smartphone/laptop, we should give up all our privacies and let them track us.

I believe it is better to define that line now instead of giving in and letting them know that they can implement all sorts of draconian measures. Although you argue that SPF can already scrutinise CCTV footage and telephone lines, these are things which have a proper system in place to deter misuse. In fact, the SPF has to issue a warrant to obtain CCTV data on private premises. The resolution provided by cell phone towers isn't high either as cell phone towers need not be too close to a mobile phone user and a mobile phone is only connected to one cell tower at any point in time. That makes triangulation of the phone's exact location much harder through dead reckoning. There's still some degree of obfuscation here. TT provides a much greater resolution in pinpointing who you've interacted with and where you've been as gathers multiple data points among multiple users in the vicinity."

When government ownself say 70% takeup rate for the entire TT programme already very good. I try my best not to put people down, but man you are really asking for it. Can you at least comeback with something logical. Please I beg you. We want 100%. Not your 95%. Whats the point of doing anything when the 5% just go about freely untraced? All it takes is 1 to spread. And you are saying 5% of sg population is ok to roam freely while we trace on phones alone? And you want to downplay the numbers? 1%? How many is 1% of 5million? 50k? Tell me your brain is working please. Are they forcing you to get the token? Why are you saying 100% have to use the token because of this 1% which is misleading. You can use the app without the token. Why arent you answering my questions when I am busy answering your dumb questions? You made a big hoo haa telling ppl that this token can trace ppl after the whole sg is being bluetooth'ed which sounds totally BS.

Yes, I agree it cannot be control. But you cant put that into gov's account when its the ppl doing the mischief. Gov tried doing 100%, ppl do not want to cooperate, try to be funny, what can they do right? Given that this will not be a perfect solution, those ppl should stop inserting their imginary agenda to make things worse. Whats more contradicting is that these imaginary ideas came out from someone who first started claiming that a NRIC can do what a token can do but now twisted his story to the token being the mother of all evils now."

While on the other side, they just have to do simple things like ""remove the battery, put in RFID pouch"". That's gonna contribute to your >5% at least, you'll never get a 100% take up rate. Everything's hackable. Even gps signals can be jammed but does that stop anyone from using it? To be honest, jamming is really easy but putting one together is not what majority of people can do. My friends and I could build one but we've never thought of using it. What for? It's only done by senseless and childish people and it's not as if they are able to get money out of it. So I think jamming is possible but very unlikely."

I don't think any of the above mentioned can give you the accuracy BLE can give. There's a reason why indoor positioning is possible with BLE. GPS loses its accuracy when you're shielded from GLONASS signals. CCTV will be extremely painful to piece together as you'll have to obtain footage from different vendors (e.g. transitioning from condos to malls to public transport), contrary to many speculations, they're not actually connected. Safe entry and ezlink only provide temporary tracking as it leaves a timestamp on where you last tapped in, there is no periodic/ constant tracking here. Credit card and data at bank is an entirely different thing, they do not track location or are not supposed to, unless you're talking about ATMs in which case it is about as good as ezlink cards/ safeentry in offering location tracking. Another myth-busting fact is that cell towers can't track you with that degree of accuracy as well, especially since you do not have to be that close to a cell tower and any form of interference (from buildings or people walking) would cause significant changes to the signal strength. You also won't be connected to 2 let alone 3 cell towers concurrently or switch between them rapidly. Triangulation would be extremely painful. There's a reason why BLE was picked instead of using cell towers or CCTVs to track, BLE does have a higher degree of accuracy in location tracking. BLE can connect and disconnect with nearby devices in a matter of milliseconds while cell towers or WiFi are still negotiating handshakes. The lifetime of a BLE device is very very short, it does not remain connected to another device for long as all it needs is to send a ~30 bytes packet. Combine this with existing tech like CCTVs/ safe entry/ EZlink taps and many more, we get sensor fusion. They can technically narrow down the probability of your exact location and time. FYI: BLE is the primary protocol used for both the TT app and token. This is not a matter of arguing that TT was preferred instead of using cell tower tracking because not many people have phones. There is huge a limitation in cell tower tracking."

Without the token, you cant even trace the 500 whats more the 5 infected and for not just weeks, they can roam about freely spreading the virus for months. Then you start asking where the unlink cases came from. Of cos you can argue that much more already spread within the weeks, but at least they got the 5. But you choose to argue since there might be much more spread, adding another 5 is ok. You see, 1 rat poop like you is already spoiling the whole pot. Now 1 infected person,can get us back to square 1. You dont need alot. Just 1. So when ppl are doing and finding all means to trace even 1, you are telling the world since you cant trace all, might as well dun trace at all.. Will you say since crooks cannot catch finish, want police for what? Stick head in sand means nothing happening. Trace 1 is 1. But you prefer it to be zero instead. You sound so donald trump."

Mate, if you just glance through the website, what is the takeaway from it? Basically the TTs ability to protect us is streneous at best. But that is what the government is posting big big on the website. the protect they use is the very same protect that are using. it is clear as day, so stop claiming otherwise. so first the argument is that im claiming that TT protect us and nobody else is saying so, and when i post ss from TT website, suddenly its different kind of protect. knn so am i the only one claiming Tt is supposed to protect us anot. dun come bs here lei. even your argument is that tt protects us a lil as it contains the spread. Faster and efficient tracing only translate to minimal improvement in containment. based on moh track record, they are only able to track cases on avg weeks after onset of symptoms. there is no protection for anyone between getting the virus and before moh tracks them with tt, neither does it stop the infected from spreading during this duration. so lemme ask u what protection they talking about. and never mind hor, still say we should allow gov to intrude into everyones privacy for this sort of minimal protection. unbelievable."

I believe if such measures were used on a day to day basis, their citizens would be against it too. Tracking IMEI is pretty pointless IMO, but I guess it's good deterrent against the general users. https://www.gadgetcouncil.com/free-a...umber-changer/ I would have no issues if they were tracking you while you have to stay home for SHN cause you'll know it'll just be for 14 days."

His 'period' likely means menses, not full stop. https://sg.news.yahoo.com/trace-toge...080806396.html During a Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) press conference in June last year, MTF co-chair Lawrence Wong and Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan both emphasised that the TT app and token are not meant to be used to detect offences and breaches of rules, but rather for effective contact tracing. Wong said, \u201cThere is no intention to use a TraceTogether app, or TraceTogether token, as a means of picking up breaches of existing rules. The app and the device, plus SafeEntry combined, are meant to provide us with information in a timely manner so that we can do speedy, fast, and effective contact tracing.\u201d Echoing this, Dr Balakrishnan said, \u201c(The) TraceTogether app, TraceTogether running on a device, and the data generated (are) purely for contact tracing.

And if somebody wants to track your location, why don't they use handphone towers? Isn't that better than TT data that supposedly expires after a few weeks. A lot of people, if not all adults, are already aware that phones can be tracked. If even movie criminals know they need to turn off phone, remove battery or don't carry phone, obviously real criminals would know as much if not better. With TT, since they need to have it to enter buildings and other places, it offers another possible channel of tracking. So the persons would either need to have a shielded box to keep their TT when needed, or conduct their activity in isolated location. In which case other methods of tracking becomes more effective. Also of importance is the proximity information, reasonable case can be established that two persons were in close contact, i.e. X cannot say he was simply passing by Y if TT information showed they were within 1m proximity for more than a minute. Lastly, TT is likely more useful for unplanned crimes like a spur of the moment robbery or rape than pre-mediated crimes like drug trafficking."

It only tracks people around with TT on phones or tokens, based on duration and distance (strong or weak signals). If anyone is infected, they download all the IDs of those who have been near the infected person for a specific period of time via the TT token/phone, and start contacting those individually that they have been in close contact with an infected person. There will be a request for swab test, quarantine and health monitoring. From this group of people who is in close proximity with the infected person, they will also try to identify the original carrier.

Before this TT police have to scour through CCTV footages of the places these infected people visited, do facial recognition and then find out the address. Wasted so many time. Government's handling of the virus is not good i agree, at least they did something right with this TT thing to make contact tracing more efficient. And here we have people saying it's an invasion of privacy. It's either the government isolate only those infected or lock down entire block or estate the infected person is staying. See which one you all choose lor. Token is not transmitting location data. There is no inbuilt GPS receiver inside. It's only broadcasting the ID of your token so if any token comes within a said distance (1m ish) it will detect each other and log the handshaking between two TT tokens. Nobody said anything about transmitting location data other then those spreading fake news here. That's discrimination, not prevention; you still need someone to be infected first. And the whole process is based on SARS-like virus and not the long incubation and asymptomatic characteristics of covid19. The only way to keep track of the covid19 virus is mass test the population, not some copypaste idea that they think will work by gambling with people's lives. It will be an intrusion of privacy the moment TT is abuse and misuse by the PAP, and there are no legal binding claus that states TT won't be abused or misused."

But again he is paid millions to push this narrative right? I wont expect him to come out and blast the SPF for it's misuse of the data. It is being used to track our movement what. If SPF uses your TT data, if they dont track your movement and who you are in proximity with, why do they need your data for? Already pointed out the potential for misuse from day 1 and till today you still cant concile with this fact even when government admitted they are doing so? And the underlying concern that has still not been addressed by you or anyone here is how effective is the TT programme, taking into consideration that an infected person is usually only detected 7-14 days after infection, by then, it would have spread, so how effective is contact tracing actually in curbing the spread? Nobody has come out with any figures showing it's effectiveness, community cases still continue to appear even with 78% of Singaporeans onboard. Really brings the purpose of TT into question doesnt it? Especially in light of how the government mismanages the data, quietly providing it to SPF for investigations(contrary to what they promised) and which was only informed to Singaporeans only when someone asked in parliament. And your dont use smart phone argument is moot. The smartphone and appmakers have access to the data, but the government cant access it one. They have to request for access and the companies can choose not to give to protect your data. Did MOH even make a sound when they hand your data to SPF? Why dont you try to think further for once. If government had access to all that data, why would they even need to bother with getting your TT data?"

I do not have a duty of protection to that person at my own risk unless the person is related to me (friend, family, etc). That would be an outright intrusion of my right to reasonable self-preservation. By your reasoning I can also say I am ""sabo'ed"" by whoever is the culprit, or whoever may be ""wrongfully accused"", by their performing the crime or for being embroiled in the investigation while I was in the vicinity, because I am then put at risk or inconvenience for their benefit. Not forgetting that I can also become ""wrongfully accused"" in the process.

It is only relevant to those who stand to benefit from it.

Like someone above said earlier, you might walk past a hidden corpse and pick up some of the blood, etc from the nearby foliage on your shoes, clothes, etc. Not barring the absence of any other evidence to your innocence, say, if the culprit conceals his trail extremely well or was just lucky - boom, you're convicted based on circumstantial evidence. The Singapore law does not require direct or physical evidence to convict as far as I remember, i.e. convicting can be based on pure inference as long as the judge(s) feels it is reasonable. And obviously there is yet to be any precedent on whether the courts regard TT data to be valid to support circumstantial evidence beyond reasonable doubt, so it could end both ways."

I have to restart both devices to establish link again. Notice this happened after I went to super crowded places with 100+ TT devices nearby. Maybe there is a cap on how many bluetooth devices can be connected at one time?

Not all phones with TT installed will have interference with other bluetooth devices such as smartwatch and wireless earphones. I am using iphone 11 paired with airpods pro and apple watch series 4. TT keep interfering my bluetooth devices at crowded places. On the other hand my sister doesn't face such issues on her Galaxy S10 Lite paired with her Galaxy buds and Galaxy Watch Active 2. There are no random disconnections even at crowded places with TT installed.

And i use TT constantly for SafeEntry too. What i do get (long time liao) is occasional reminders from TT to keep bluetooth on when its already on \U0001f644 Irritating but nothing major.
