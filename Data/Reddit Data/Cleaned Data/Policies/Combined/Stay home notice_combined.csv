> SINGAPORE: ""Fast lane"" travellers returning to Singapore may appeal for swab tests in place of the mandated 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) they would have to serve when they are back in the country, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Jun 15).

> 

> A ""fast lane"" arrangement was set up by Singapore and China to facilitate essential travel between the two countries for business and official purposes.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""While many have welcomed the establishment of the Singapore-China fast lane arrangements, some have asked if it is possible to have alternate arrangements to the 14-day SHN,"" said Mr Chan in a Facebook post.

> ""On a case-by-case basis, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) is prepared to consider appeals for swab test arrangements in place of the 14-day SHN for returning fast lane users.""

> Appeals can be made via email to MTI, he added.

> CNA has reached out to MTI to ask about the criteria under which such exceptions may be made.

> Advertisement

> The ""fast lane"" arrangement was launched on Jun 8, and involves Singapore and six Chinese provinces or municipalities: Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

> 

> Approved travellers must take a COVID-19 swab test within 48 hours before departure as well as upon arrival, after which they need not be quarantined, but must remain isolated for one to two days while waiting for COVID-19 test results.

> 

> Travellers must also stick to a controlled itinerary that is supervised by the host company or government agency for the first 14 days.

> 

> Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from China will be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice.

> 

> On Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that all travellers entering Singapore from Thursday will be tested for COVID-19 before the end of their stay-home notice.

> The ministry also said that travellers from 10 countries or territories, who stayed in the said place for the 14 days prior to their entry, will be allowed to serve their stay-home notice at home instead of a designated facility.

> ""In line with the progressive re-opening of our economy and society, the MTF (COVID-19 multi-ministry task force) has also reviewed the border measures we had put in place earlier to manage the risks of importation and will progressively implement changes as part of our resumption of international travel,"" said Mr Chan.

> 

> Earlier this month, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat said in Parliament that travel will be restarted on a limited scale, focusing first on “essential travel for businesses to function and for purposes such as maintaining critical infrastructure and providing needed services”.

> SINGAPORE: A man was charged on Friday (Apr 17) with breaching his stay-home notice to meet a friend.

> Foo Ching Guan, 32, is accused of one count under the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 - Stay Orders) Regulations 2020 of leaving his residence two days before his stay-home notice expired.

> Advertisement

> He told the court that he intends to plead guilty and was given a date to do so later this month.

> Foo returned to Singapore from Thailand on Mar 17 and was issued a stay-home notice for the period between Mar 17 and Mar 31.

> However, Foo allegedly left his home at Kreta Ayer Road on Mar 29 and took a private-hire car to Sengkang Central. According to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), he did so to meet a friend to settle some personal matters.

> The charge sheet stated that he left his home at about 4am that day and went to Sengkang to look for a Lee Quan Hui, before going home.

> ICA launched an investigation and Foo was charged. If convicted, he faces a jail term of up to six months, a maximum fine of S$10,000, or both.

> 

> Foo is the third man to be charged over stay-home notice breaches - a newspaper vendor is accused of doing so to deliver newspapers, while another man has pleaded guilty to breaching his notice to run errands and eat bak kut teh with his girlfriend.

> 

> The Government had announced that all residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with travel history to ASEAN countries entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Mar 16 would be issued a stay-home notice.

> Under the notice, they must remain in their homes at all times for two weeks. These requirements were extended to all residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore from all countries from Mar 20.

> From Apr 9, the requirement switched to one of 14-day self-isolation at dedicated facilities.

> SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) will put in place more stringent border measures to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases, including on-arrival testing for travellers.

> From 11.59pm on Jan 24, all travellers, including Singaporeans and permanent residents, will need to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon arrival in Singapore, said MOH in a media release on Saturday (Jan 16).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Existing stay-home notice requirements, including a PCR test at the end of the stay-home notice period, will continue, said the ministry.

> 

> To facilitate the testing process, travellers are ""strongly encouraged"" to register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test before departing for Singapore, said MOH.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Currently, travellers who are not Singaporeans or permanent residents who have a recent travel history to high-risk countries or regions are required to take a PCR test within 72 hours before departure. They are then tested at the end of their stay-home notice period.

> MOH said that the new measures will be implemented given the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and the worsening coronavirus situation around the world.

> 

> FURTHER PRECAUTIONS FOR TRAVELLERS FROM UK AND SOUTH AFRICA

> From 11.59pm on Jan 18, all Singaporeans and permanent residents returning from the UK and South Africa will be subject to an additional seven-day self-isolation at their place of residence, following their 14-day stay-home notice period at dedicated facilities.

> Advertisement

> They will be tested at the end of their stay-home notice, as with the current requirement, and again after they have completed their seven-day self-isolation period, said MOH.

> These further precautions will apply to travellers who are currently serving their stay-home notice, and they will be in place until further notice.

> Singapore authorities had earlier restricted entry and transit for all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with a recent travel history to the UK and South Africa, due to concerns of a more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus circulating in those countries.

> INSURANCE COVERAGE

> With effect from 11.59pm on Jan 31, visitors applying to enter Singapore under the Air Travel Pass (ATP) and Reciprocal Green Lanes (RGLs) will need to have travel insurance for their COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000.

> ""The travel insurance will help them pay for the costs of their medical treatment in Singapore. The visitors can purchase the travel insurance from Singapore-based or overseas insurers,"" said MOH.

> Currently, short-term visitors entering Singapore under the ATP and RGLs are required to bear the full costs of medical treatment, should they be suspected of being infected with the coronavirus or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore.

> 

> ""As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community,"" said MOH.

> ""The Ministry of Health will also continue to review the data and evidence on any new viral strains and update the measures accordingly.""

> Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website.

> Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, tests and treatment.

> SINGAPORE - The man who allegedly breached his stay-home notice (SHN) conditions to have bak kut teh will likely be charged.

> Responding queries from The Straits Times (ST), the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said it has, together with the Ministry of Health, consulted the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) on the matter. The AGC has indicated that it is likely to charge the man.

> Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam had highlighted a Facebook post by the man, Mr Alan Tham, 33. He had posted on social media photos of his bak kut teh meal while he was supposed to be at home serving his 14-day notice.

> Mr Shanmugam said he had asked for the case to be investigated, and added that stern action will be taken against those who breach such notices, which are issued to all travellers returning from abroad since March 20.

> Those issued SHN must remain in their residences at all times from the day they return, and are not allowed visitors. They are not allowed to go out, even if it is to purchase daily necessities.

> Mr Tham had said he thought the 14-day notice started the day after he returned from a three-day holiday to Myanmar.

> Others who have got into trouble for allegedly flouting the stay-home notice include film producer Mike Wiluan, a permanent resident.

> Upon his return to Singapore from the United States on March 20, Mr Wiluan did not declare a recent trip to Indonesia, which would have subjected him to the stay-home notice.

> The authorities subsequently found out that he had flown to Singapore from Jakarta on March 7, a day before his flight to Los Angeles. Mr Wiluan was then issued an SHN. The authorities also shortened the validity of his re-entry permit.

> It is not clear if further action will be taken against him.

> Those found guilty of breaching the stay-home notice can be fined up to $10,000 and jailed for up to six months. Pass holders may have their passes revoked or the validity shortened.

Many decent jobs have unions. Also, what do you mean by ""have that much more control over you?"" Like, telling you when to show up to work and what to do when you do so? What a novel concept. 

>Also, don't retail workers and mcdonalds employees and shit deserve decent healthcare

---------|----------|----------|
Do you get to eat room service food? If not how do you get food delivered to you?|We kinda get boxed food delivered to our rooms. So really we cannot leave the place at all.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzgjui/)
Why did you travel?|Am a sponsored international student in the US and my sponsor keeps 'highly encouraging' me to go back even though the risk of getting COVID-19 is probably higher if I travel :(|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flze6cz/)
Why in god's green earth would you go to Singapore, RIGHT NOW???|Because I'm Singaporean? And I'm asked to go back! Plus our cases are actually pretty well contained as a whole. And I wont have help financially if I do happen to get COVID if I'm back in the US|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzpcl2/)
Do you live in Singapore?|Just previously(a couple days go), I lived in the US as I was studying but I guess I'm back for good in Singapore right now|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzgg7o/)
What are some cool things one might not expect about Singapore?|The popular one is that chewing gums are banned in Singapore since the early 2000s as the government wanted to reduce incidence of vandalism. HAHA. In addition, Singapore is a super young country, just under 60 years old!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzi3bl/)
How packed is the hotel?|Honestly, I dont know! When we first arrived we were kinda ushered through the secret backdoor in order to segregate us from the normal population and were sent straight to our rooms and confined. So honestly, no idea!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzlr72/)
Do you have a balcony? Can you access fresh air?|Nope! :( I do have a window tho at least. But sadly, it cannot be opened.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzq43x/)
Who’s paying for your hotel?|The Singapore government. IMO I think its pretty smart of them. Cos the hotels would all probably die and shut down without tourists. It's kinda like giving the hotels business.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzey9s/)
How many other countries have you been to?|At least 12 I think??? Cant exactly recall. But I know that within my few years of studying in the US I have been to at least 30 states!!! Hhehe mildly proud about it 😝|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzldp6/)
What are you doing to pass the time?|Reddit, phone, using my computer, some homework and doing jumping jacks lol. Honestly, it is stifling to be confined. It is like living in a high end prison with no yard time at all in 14 days.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzm7hk/)
I'm a Citizen of Singapore. What is it like? I'm still going to school normally so...|Though I'm staying at a hotel for free it gets pretty stifling and sucks being confined. It's like being in a luxurious prison without anytime to go to the yard to exercise.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/fm046e8/)

In a press release, MOH said this supercedes the advisory issued on Sunday to defer all non-essential travel abroad. The expansion of the travel advisory is ""to reduce the risk of Singaporeans being infected with the virus when abroad and spreading it to other Singaporeans when they return"", the ministry added. 

In addition, all Singaporeans, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Friday will be issued a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

For Singapore residents and long-term pass holders entering from the Hubei province in China, they will serve a 14-day quarantine.

They will have to provide proof of the place where they will serve the SHN, for example, a hotel booking covering the entire period or a place of  residence that they or their family members own. 

People under SHN will have to stay at their place of residence at all times for 14 days after entering Singapore.

As announced previously, short-term visitors with recent travel history to mainland China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Spain are not allowed to enter or transit in Singapore.

""Globally, there has been a sharp increase in cases and widening spread across the world. To date, there are close to 200,000 COVID-19 cases across 159 countries, with more than 7,900 deaths,"" said MOH. 

""Many countries have seen an exponential rise in cases recently, and more than 40,000 new cases have been reported in the past three days. 

""Globally, the number of cases and deaths has surpassed those in China since the beginning of the outbreak. 

""The World Health Organization has urged its member states to take urgent and aggressive measures to stop the transmission of COVID-19.""

The authorities also announced 47 new cases of the coronavirus in Singapore on Wednesday, bringing the total figure to 313.",18/3/20 21:23,319,Stay Home Notice,337,4,-11.405182814036525,53,12,0,0.3249143853479761,0,0,1.0

> SINGAPORE: Travellers entering Singapore after 11.59pm on Sunday (Jul 19) with travel history to Victoria in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong within the last 14 days, including transit passengers, will have to serve their stay-home notices at dedicated facilities rather than their own home, announced National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday.

> They will also need to take a COVID-19 test before ending their stay-home notice, in line with current requirements.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Speaking at a multi-ministry taskforce press conference on Friday, Mr Wong noted a global resurgence of COVID-19 cases, even in countries which have successfully controlled the virus before.

> “The cases from overseas coming in through our borders represent another risk for us, even as we clear the dormitory cases and therefore we are monitoring the situation very carefully,” said Mr Wong.

> “Our overall advisory remains for everyone in Singapore not to travel or to avoid all travel - that remains the overall posture for now.”

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Previously, travellers entering Singapore from countries with a controlled number of COVID-19 cases were allowed to serve their 14-day stay-home notice in their place of residence rather than a dedicated facility.

> Mr Wong emphasised that this was “not something new”, as the Government has “repeatedly emphasised our border measures are not static”, adding that the taskforce is “constantly reviewing, updating” border measures based on their assessments of the viral situation around the world.

> “We really need to remain vigilant both at our borders, in terms of the measures we have in place at our borders, as well as within our community to continue to ensure that we control the infection and control the spread of the virus within our community,” he said.

> All travellers who have left Singapore from Mar 27 and travellers who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents will have to pay for their stay at dedicated stay-home notice facilities.

> Responding to a question on the task force's travel advisory for Singaporeans for the rest of the year, Mr Wong said that the Government's position - not to travel out of the country - is ""unlikely to change in the near term"".

> 

> While green lane discussions will continue with countries who have ""appropriate control measures"", Mr Wong said that this will only be applicable to essential business travel.

> He added: ""This will not apply to mass tourism travel. That I think will not happen any time soon.""

> SINGAPORE - A 45-year-old Singapore permanent resident (PR) who breached stay-home notice (SHN) requirements while he was in Singapore from Feb 20 to 23 has lost his PR status.

> He has also been barred from re-entering Singapore, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said on Wednesday (Feb 26).

> According to the ICA, the man was served with the notice on Feb 20 when he arrived at Changi Airport as he had travel history to mainland China in the past 14 days.

> These notices are issued to Singapore residents, long-term pass holders and foreign workers who have travelled to mainland China in the last 14 days.

> He was briefed on the requirements of the notice but failed to respond to phone calls, and was not at his declared place of residence when ICA officers conducted enforcement checks in the days after his return to Singapore.

> On Feb 23, he was spotted attempting to leave Singapore, and was warned that he had breached the requirements of his notice and could face penalties.

> But he still insisted on leaving.

> As a result, ICA said it has rejected his application for renewal of his Re-entry Permit, which allows a person to retain his or her PR status while outside of Singapore.

> This means that he has lost his PR status.

> ICA said: ""The Government will continue to conduct regular random checks through house visits and phone calls to ensure compliance with the SHN, so that the well-being of the community is not put at risk.""

> It highlighted that those who fail to comply with the notice may face stiff penalties, including prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act.

That is a ridiculous false equivalence.

If the aim is to stop the number of imported cases, it seems to be sensible to go after people who seem to have contracted it in the US -- which seem to pop up daily now (including today) -- rather than just the countries that supposedly might start exporting cases in the future.

This seems to have multiple aims: stop countries with repeated imported cases here and punish countries they feel aren't doing enough to stop the virus. Seems they're punishing countries, like Vietnam, that aren't guilty of either, and letting off a country, the US, that is guilty of one, and arguably both. It's bizarre.

> The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at two cases per week in the past two weeks.

> ""We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme,"" said MOH.

> Among the 163 confirmed cases reported from Feb 1 to Feb 7, 82 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 30 have tested negative and 51 test results are pending.

> The case is a 28-year-old Bangladeshi work permit holder who stays in a dormitory at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> He was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Apr 12 last year. He tested positive again on Jan 25 this year.

> ""He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH’s surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their postinfection immunity,"" said the ministry.

> SINGAPORE: All travellers entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Jun 17 will be tested for COVID-19 before the end of their stay-home notice, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Monday (Jun 15).

> The test will be scheduled a few days before the end of the 14-day stay-home notice period, at an allotted testing facility, MOH said in a press release.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Each person under a stay-home notice will receive information on the scheduled appointment slot and venue via an SMS notification.

> “It is an additional precautionary measure to detect the virus, especially given the risks of asymptomatic cases,” MOH said.

> “We will monitor the results of these tests and may make adjustments to the testing requirements over time.”

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> These individuals will have to travel from their place of residence to the designated testing facility, and return back immediately after the test, using their own private vehicle, taxi or a private hire car, and avoid commuting via public transport.​​​​​​​

> 

> SOME ALLOWED TO SERVE SHN AT HOME

> Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders entering Singapore from Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Mainland China, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam and who stayed in these countries in the last consecutive 14 days prior to their entry will be allowed to serve their SHN at home under the new norms, MOH said.

> Previously, they had to stay at dedicated facilities.

> All those who can serve their stay-home notice at home must remain in their place of residence at all times, MOH said, adding that their whereabouts will be closely watched, through electronic monitoring as well as physical spot-checks.

> However, travellers entering Singapore from countries not in the list will still need to serve their 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities, regardless whether they are residents or visitors.

> PAY FOR TESTS AND STAY AT SHN FACILITY

> All inbound and outbound travellers who enter or leave Singapore from 11.59pm on Jun 17 will also be required to pay for their COVID-19 tests, and those who are not Singaporeans or PRs entering the country will need to foot their own bill for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities.

> Previously, the Singapore Government paid for the costs of stay at stay-home notice facilities for travellers entering Singapore, except for those who left Singapore from Mar 27 onwards.

> It also bore the costs of the large majority of COVID-19 tests, MOH said.

> ""As we expand (and) reopen for more travel, we want to move to a more sustainable position,"" said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong at a press conference on Monday.

> According to MOH, a COVID-19 test for a person under stay-home notice costs up to S$200, while a 14-day stay at a dedicated facility costs S$2,000.

> APPROVAL TO ENTER SINGAPORE

> All long-term pass holders will still need prior approval before coming back to Singapore.

> MOH said the Government has “gradually increased” the number of entry approvals given to these pass holders, “especially those with deep roots to Singapore or have exigent circumstances”.

> “We expect to be able to facilitate the re-entry of more Long Term Pass holders in the coming weeks,” MOH said.

> “We will also study how to facilitate business travels, in particular for professionals based in Singapore who need to travel frequently as part of their work, with the necessary safeguards,” it added.

This has nothing to do with sacrificing the young for the old. You can appreciate and respect the elderly but still consider the very fact that the young is going to live through the next incoming generations.

A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they know they shall never sit. If societies sacrificed the young for their old, those societies would literally never grow - unless we find the means to immortality.

If the pensioners didn't volunteer themselves, we can't ask them. If they volunteered, great. They have done their duties and I think they deserve to rest. Young 20 year olds? You are on duty, so get in the suit and do your job. Likewise, with COVID pandemic: old retirees have done their part for society, now they deserve to be protected. Young people? You are on the line of fire, now take that bullet.

Disagree? Look at my username. Empires eat young men lives for breakfast and pay the butcher's bill for their glory.

Well, according to many people, especially Republicans, conservatives, and libertarians, that's not ""privilege"". It's hard work; perhaps not each individual's hard work only, but a collective hard work of myself and people in my support network who worked hard to build a good home environment for all of us.

Well, if you don't; you can start by blaming the parents, then pick up some Molotov's cocktails and start rioting, demanding for changes. That's the traditional way to resolve these kinds of grievances. To demand for better public housing, social safety nets, National Job Guarantee, etc ... If you don't have the courage for that kind of political violence, then you are at the whims of the people with privileges. Money is not a problem, because [war financing](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g26wwu/what_was_your_experience_during_the_20082009/fnk1s5i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) showed governments have no problem coming up with the money.

That's a secret to power and politics. People with privileges have quite a bit of political powers when everything is peaceful, and I will admit, from this point of view, I am perhaps a person of privilege. The moment violence starts, those power vanishes and it's the violence that holds real power. It's a secret because people with privileges desperately try to convince you to not exercise that power to violence to protect their own powers.

> MSF said there are “individuals who remain significantly affected by job or income loss” despite the previous Budget relief measures and various National Jobs Council initiatives.

> ""The Government has therefore decided to provide targeted support to help these individuals while they actively search for a new job or training opportunities,"" said the ministry.

> Under the scheme, eligible Singaporeans and permanent residents aged 21 years old and above will receive up to S$700 a month for three months.

> This will be for employees who have been retrenched or had their contract terminated, or placed on no-pay leave for at least three consecutive months.

> Those who are facing salary loss of at least 50 per cent on average for at least three consecutive months will receive up to S$500 for three months.

> Self-employed people facing an average loss in net trade income of at least 50 per cent over a period of at least three consecutive months, compared to their average monthly net trade income in 2019 or 2020, will also be eligible to receive up to S$500 for three months.

> The job loss, involuntary no-pay leave or income loss should have occurred after Jan 23 this year - when the first COVID-19 case was detected in Singapore - and must still be present at the point of application.

> From Jan. 1, 2021, returning Singapore citizens, permanent residents, and and long-term pass holders (LTPHs) who left Singapore before March 27, 2020 will have to bear the costs of staying at dedicated stay-home notice facilities if they develop Covid-19 symptoms within 14 days of their arrival here.

> The Ministry of Health announced on Oct. 27 that the Singapore government will no longer waive the costs of inpatient medical bills.

> Most have returned

> This is because the ""vast majority"" of Singapore citizens and PRs who last left Singapore within the past year have returned, the ministry said.

> “They will be able to tap on regular healthcare financial arrangements for their inpatient medical bills – SCs and PRs may access government subsidies and MediShield Life/ Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills, while LTPHs may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as private insurance,” the ministry said.

> Evolving measures

> MOH added that Singapore’s border measures will evolve as the global Covid-19 situation changes.

> “We will continue to monitor the global health situation closely and update our border measures in accordance with the public health risk assessment,"" said MOH.

> “If the situation in a country/ region deteriorates, more stringent measures will be put in place to limit the risk of importation and prevent community transmission from imported cases.”

> Meanwhile, all other incoming travellers have had to pay for these costs as part of their private expenses, subject to the applicable healthcare arrangements for their bills, MOH said.

> SINGAPORE — With the number of imported cases of COVID-19 continuing to rise, the risk of locally transmitted cases will also increase, making the threat of a widespread virus outbreak “very real”, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.

> Hence, practising safe distancing and minimising social activities is important in slowing down the spread of the virus, and public venues and roads are already less crowded, he noted during a press conference on Tuesday (24 March).

> However, the adjustments to Singaporeans’ daily lives are taking place too slowly, said Wong, who is also the co-chair of the multi-ministry taskforce to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

> “The virus isn’t going to wait for us. It is continuing to spread and circulate in our population, and anytime you can get an outbreak,” he said.

> “It is of great concern that you still hear stories of people gathering together. You still hear anecdotes of people gathering in clubs, in discos, where there are large social gatherings which can easily become super-spreader events, and then another cluster will break out after that.”

> On Tuesday, the taskforce announced a slew of measures to further minimise the spread of the new virus.

> Among other things, all bars and entertainment venues - including night clubs, discos, cinemas, theatres, and karaoke outlets - will be closed at least till end-April. All events will also be cancelled, while gatherings outside of work and school should be limited to 10 attendees or fewer.

> Centre-based tuition and enrichment classes, as well as religious services and congregations will also be suspended.

> Wong said the taskforce hopes Singaporeans will take the measures seriously as they are meant to minimise the risk of local transmission.

> “Our key message to all Singaporeans is stay at home as much as you can. Go out if you need to work, go to school, go out for essential tasks, but otherwise stay at home, reduce your social gatherings and all other activities for the next one month,” he said.

> “It is only by all of us reducing our activity level and the intensity of our contacts – that’s the only way where we can significantly reduce the chance of this virus spreading further in our community. And so this is a collective endeavour and we need Singaporeans to really take this task seriously.”

> As of Tuesday, Singapore confirmed 49 new cases of the virus, bringing the total to 558. 17 remain in the intensive care unit while two have died.

> Meanwhile, there are close to 396,000 COVID-19 cases globally as of Tuesday. More than 17,000 have died from the virus, with the death tolls in China and Italy accounting for more than half of the figure.

The government have been advised by numerous professors in epidemiology and doctors and have access to a much larger picture of how the country is performing in different facets than we do. I trust in their ability to calibrate measures accordingly.

Again, a testament to the adequacy of their decisions is that before Singaporeans started returning home, the situation was very much controlled. We have only started to see exponential growth and strain on our healthcare following the massive influx of returning Singaporeans and they are pushing out measures to attempt to keep ahead of the curve, e.g. those announced yesterday.

We can argue about the efficacy of their measures but it will always be post-factum and cannot compare to them making decision in the moment.",25/3/20 13:07,153,Stay Home Notice,155,4,-10.596732613211136,36,4,3,1.314060133892138,0,0,0.0

tbh, i feel like for b+ it was always like a disaster was gonna happen because there were no measures like temperature taking in place at all.

Perhaps if there were such measures in place, all cases linked to bouldering gym could have been prevented? 

I really feel it's poor on their part considering all the other gyms i've been to had some kind of temperature taking or assurance in place.",11/3/20 22:39,82,Stay Home Notice,85,3,-10.76221860961796,18,3,1,3.0439346680271204,0,0,1.0

E.g. Assuming this 142 guy went to a doctor and said ""I have a cough a fever"" and the doctor says ""when did you start coughing"", 142's imagination might then go into overdrive and think that every single cough in the last week is potentially Corona related.
