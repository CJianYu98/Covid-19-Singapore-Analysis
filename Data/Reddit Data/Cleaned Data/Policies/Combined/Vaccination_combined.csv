> SINGAPORE: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has granted interim authorisation for Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine to be used in Singapore for people aged 18 years and above, it announced on Wednesday (Feb 3).

> The vaccination regime submitted by Moderna requires two doses of the vaccine to be administered 28 days apart.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""HSA’s review of the available clinical data found that the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the known risks,"" said the agency in a press release.

> ""The vaccine demonstrated a high vaccine efficacy of 94 per cent.""

> The first shipment is expected to arrive around March, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

> Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is the second vaccine to be granted interim authorisation under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> As a precautionary measure, anyone with a history of anaphylaxis or severe or multiple allergies to medicines or food should not receive the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, said HSA.

> 

> Pregnant woman, severely immunocompromised people and those under the age of 18 should also not receive the vaccine as the safety and efficacy data for these groups are not available yet.

> ""Persons who develop anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine also should not receive the second dose,"" said HSA.

> Advertisement

> The authorities said it will actively review the data submitted by Moderna to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the known risks.

> When sufficient data is available for full registration, Moderna will be required to file an application to transit the status of the product from PSAR interim authorisation to full registration, said HSA.

> It may also terminate PSAR authorisation at any time; for example, if new data suggest that the benefits no longer outweigh the risks.

Sinovac on the other hand, has not been helpful in providing accurate data to fight off COVID. One example can be seen when they confused people with their efficacy of their vaccines and gave reasons like different countries like Indonesia and Brazil gave different two-dose regime (Thus, low % of efficacy compared to China's data). This is the result of a vaccine being rushed into public hands e.g. Sinovac. Without having a plan to provide an ideal two dose regiment timeframe (21 days for Pfizer, 28 for Moderna) from their experts, they publish data that contradicts each other which in turn, loses public confidence and more appropriately, Singaporeans are more wary of taking the Sinovac vaccine, creating much more vaccine hesitancy.",3/2/21,143,Vaccination,147,4,-11.62153546,27,6,0,0.761022611,0,0,1

> SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Friday (Jan 8), becoming the first member of Singapore's Cabinet to take the COVID-19 vaccine.

> 

> Mr Lee received the jab along with Singapore General Hospital (SGH) staff at the official launch of vaccinations for healthcare workers.

> Public healthcare institutions, including hospitals and polyclinics, will start vaccinations for their staff on Friday. SGH estimated about 90 of its employees will get vaccinated on the first day.

> 

> The official roll out comes after a small-scale test run at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, where 40 employees received their jabs on Dec 30.

> Speaking to reporters at SGH, Mr Lee said he was happy to see the start of inoculations for healthcare and frontline workers.

> ""So I took the opportunity to have my own jab this morning and now I'm done – 30 minutes waited, nothing happened,"" he said.

> ""I've got my card, and the appointment to come back in three weeks' time. It's painless, it's effective. And it's important.""

>

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said earlier that plans for the Cabinet to get vaccinated in batches were in the works.

> “My Cabinet colleagues and I, including the older ones, will be getting ourselves vaccinated early. This is to show you, especially seniors like me, that we believe the vaccines are safe,” Mr Lee said in a televised national address last month.

> The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was approved by Singapore late last year and the first shipment arrived on Dec 21. The vaccine requires two doses taken 21 days apart, and it will take up to 14 more days after the second dose to achieve maximum protection against the virus.

> 

> Vaccinations for the elderly and those at greater risk of severe COVID-19 will start in February, beginning with seniors aged 70 and above. Vaccinations will be free for all Singaporeans as well as long-term residents in Singapore.

> 

> After he received his jab on Friday, Mr Lee urged people to get inoculated when they can. He said there are ""ample vaccines coming in"" as Singapore ordered the vaccines early.

> ""It will make us safer, and it will make you and your loved ones safer. So please take it when you can,"" he said.

It's also very problematic if ppl end up downloading QR Scanning Apps that's bloated with ads or virus. QR scanning never took off in Singapore anyway, so ""enforcing"" it now is just kinda... backwards?

I was focusing on the QR scanning which is the deployment of ""SafeEntry Digital Check-In"" while neglecting that the existing NRIC Scanning for Supermarket is also called ""SafeEntry"".

> SINGAPORE: The SafeEntry digital check-in system, which logs employees' and visitors' entry into businesses to facilitate contact tracing, has been deployed to more than 16,000 venues to date, said the Ministry of Health and Smart Nation and Digital Government Office in a joint release on Saturday (May 9).

> Developed by the Government Technology Agency, SafeEntry requires visitors to scan their identification card so that the system can record their arrival and departure times. The system reduces the manual effort needed by businesses to track visitor movements and eases crowds at entry points, according to the SafeEntry website.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> On May 2, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said businesses allowed to operate from May 12 as part of the Government's easing of COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"" measures would be required to use the SafeEntry app.

> ""As a start, deployment will be made mandatory for places where individuals are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods or in enclosed spaces, or where there is higher traffic,"" said the Government in Saturday's joint release.

> ""To date, SafeEntry has been deployed at more than 16,000 premises,"" the authorities said, adding that a list of the facilities where SafeEntry must be deployed from May 12 can be found on the SafeEntry website and will be updated as more activities and services resume.

> Among these venues are workplaces including offices and factories, schools, healthcare facilities, community care facilities, hairdressers, supermarkets, popular wet markets, malls and hotels.

> SafeEntry will also be progressively rolled out to taxis from May 12 to better support contact tracing for street-hail trips.

> Retail outlets such as convenience stores and pharmacies, as well as take-out F&B outlets, are not required but encouraged to use SafeEntry.

> ""Employees and visitors should check in and check out of workplaces and other venues using SafeEntry to help our contact tracers establish cluster links and transmission chains.

> ""It is important that everyone plays their part and uses SafeEntry, so that we can collectively prevent new clusters from forming,"" the release added.

What you're looking up is a ""Good Class Bungalow"", which in laymen's terms is...a mansion. In the middle of a major city. To count as a GCB the lot (land, not interior) must be over 1400sqm, or 15,000 sqft, and on top of that it must be in one of a few select locations that are particularly desirable. For the record, Dyson (of vacuum fame) has a GCB in Singapore. So did the Saudi embassy, but they sold it. Might have been too rich for their blood./s I mean, look at who's selling the GCB you linked. It's Sotheby's. [The Sotheby's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby%27s).

Aerosols start out as tiny water droplets, they will dry in air in under 1 second and leave behind a sub micron husk of solid material which virus can stick to. These tiny solids, being so light can float in air for hours and can be easily carried by air movement. Almost anything you do, including breathing will release aerosol, but aerosol is particularly heavily released when doing things like intubation.

Large droplets like a spray or what people release when they cough are much larger and will land on the ground in several seconds due to gravity, they do not travel nearly as far and is not really considered ""airborne""",28/2/20,115,Vaccination,117,4,-11.47184905,22,7,2,1.481183105,0,0,1

Will Singapore succeed in containing the outbreak? Source: SG Ministry of Health,21/2/20 21:52,"Short answer: No.

Less-short answer: 

1. Singapore refuses to shutdown non-essential travel to, well, basically all other countries.  Assuming infections continue to occur in other countries (especially at a growing rate), Singapore is gauranteed to import more infections.

2. Singapore refuses to shutdown its schools, which may likely result in several huge, possibly uncontainable clusters.

3. Singapore is still encouraging people to physically leave home and visit clinics if/when they are ill.  Even a short amount of travel will increase infection vectors both for that individual as well as others, and may result in further infections.

I’m not sure who’s following whose example but Korea’s been putting out the same type of reports following cases and their whereabouts from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization. Can’t say the same so far of American media, maybe it’s the fact that both are relatively small countries but Korea’s been on top of tracking and reporting the information. 

On the other hand Korea’s still not yet blocked flights from China and there are some other complaints about giving foreign tourists money for quarantine compensation. Korean people are heavily criticizing the government but overall I feel like the response has been organized.

> SINGAPORE: A Singapore Airlines (SIA) cabin crew member on a turnaround flight was among the 11 new imported COVID-19 cases reported in Singapore as of noon on Tuesday (Feb 9).

> Of the 11 imported cases, 10 were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its preliminary daily update.

> The remaining case is the SIA cabin crew member who had not disembarked from the aircraft at the overseas destination. She developed symptoms a few days after returning to Singapore, said MOH.

> No locally transmitted cases were reported in the community or in foreign worker dormitories.

> 

> Details of the new cases will be released on Tuesday night, MOH said.

> BGC Group, which manages the deployment of some taggers, ushers and administrators at Changi Airport, will increase the frequency of temperature taking and disinfecting counters after an employee tested positive for COVID-19.

> The case involved a 43-year-old Singaporean man who works at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3. He was the sole community case reported on Sunday.

> His job involved issuing electronic monitoring devices to people who will be serving stay-home notice outside dedicated facilities. He also helped them put on the devices.

> While on duty, he wears a surgical mask, face shield and gloves, MOH said.

> Advertisement

> BGC Group told CNA on Monday that the infection was detected during a routine, bi-weekly swab, and that he had tested negative in the prior round of testing.

> “BGC Group will continue to closely monitor the health of 12 negatively tested employees who have been in contact with our affected employee,” said the firm.

> “We are treating this unfortunate first incident very seriously and BGC Group will be increasing the frequency of temperature taking to a three-hourly reporting. Our frequency of disinfecting our counters will also be strictly stepped up so to ensure an even safer environment for all employees under our care.”

> Since the man's positive test on Feb 5, BGC Group has reviewed its healthcare and safety standard operating procedures and found “no breaches”.

> The man’s identified close contacts, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period.

> As of Tuesday, Singapore has reported a total of 59,732 COVID-19 cases and 29 fatalities from the disease.

Too big a price to pay for Singapore to achieve ‘natural herd immunity’ against Covid-19: MOH official,12/5/20 18:46,"Yes and no. Our migrant workers (\*in the construction sector, i.e. those being isolated at the moment) make up \~5% of our entire population. Herd immunity is only possible once 70-90% of the population has been infected. With our healthcare capacity, that would mean many more deaths if we rush this. Do remember that we have migrant workers who have died due to non-covid19 reasons (even though they were diagnosed with it). The more our healthcare capacity is stretched, the more people will die or suffer. We can't just keep looking at the covid-19 related death toll.

If the foreign workers remain isolated, it's likely that they'll achieve herd immunity within that population. We can't tell, conclusively, if someone can get covid-19 more than once.

Here's a good article that explains herd immunity well  [https://www.healthline.com/health/herd-immunity#natural-immunity](https://www.healthline.com/health/herd-immunity#natural-immunity)

Sweden always gets brought up as a ""success story"", but they have 3000 deaths. People saying that this is a good price to pay don't realise that the lives of their parents or loved ones are the ones they're most likely to be gambling.

Too big a price to pay for Singapore to achieve ‘natural herd immunity’ against Covid-19: MOH official,12/5/20 18:46,"Not Singaporean but I hope you don't mind me chiming in. The wellbeing of most people are tied to the economy. Would you say you wouldn't be stressed out and uncertain about the future if you lost your job today and have no idea when you'll get another job? Now add an entire family to the mix, with multiple people you need to feed. This is going to add to the mental tolls of a lot of people. 

Moreover, we're already seeing a reversal of close to 20 decades of progress wrt to economic development. 1B people who we got out of abject poverty are about to re-enter poverty (there are defined levels for poverty if you were wondering). Not to mention the 130mm++ people who are now projected to be food insecure as a result of the lockdowns. 

Looking at this in a Singaporean context, Singapore is not big enough to sustain itself. My dad works in the O&G industry, and it is currently getting absolutely ravaged by lockdowns across the world. The O&G industry makes about 20% of Singapore's GDP. Now you have to understand that most industries are interconnected. If one fails, it'll drag down other industries along with it. For example, my bank is projecting a fair number of job listing portals to go bankrupt soon. Why? Lack of job postings. If the airline industry fails, it'll drag the entire hotel industry, car rental industry, tourism industry etc etc along with it.

Moreover, supply chains being ravaged is definitely not going to bode well for a tiny island that exports most of its food. 

This entire situation is not quite as simple as lives vs economy. We're on the verge of destroying the QOL for a large segment of the world population real soon for the next decade if things don't change. There is no script for a massive depression in this interconnected world. It's going to be real bad. Plus you gotta understand the the one thing that has prevented multiple countries from imploding or going to way with one another was money. Take that away and we're facing even more death and suffering.

There are fates worse than death. The best course would be to tell the old and vulnerable to quarantine and let the rest get on with their lives (especially given that fatality rates for those below 70 is 0.08% according to a Danish study and even lower for even younger people).

&#x200B;

First off, since you seem to have never done NS or is a foreigner, NS men goes through basic training, vocational training, operational readiness assessment and military exercises. All this takes up a good year or so of the NS life, after attaining operational readiness would be the guys on standby in times of war. By the time all that is over the unit is almost ready to ORD. Obviously since the training time has now been cut, our manpower 1.5 years from now would be compromised due to the delay training now. However assuming a delay of 3-4 months training, most of the recruits who had their training delayed today would still be operationally ready by that time. It's a crisis situation, a compromise of sorts is expected

3rd, there is good reason why we keep a huge reservist force and why we do ICT for so long. In the event where manpower is an issue, the reservist can be called up

The latest confirmed infected individual had visited gardens by the bay, marina bay sands, and orchard, which are all VERY CROWDED places. I believe there are infected individuals walking among us whom Sg can't find by tracing because how will they know who visited all those three places at the same time???

It's a critical period for Singapore. Let's play our part by taking extra precautions and going to the hospital when you have a fever. PLEASE do not assume you just have a cold and infect more people.

For those who have managed to buy the masks, please do share with others who couldn't buy them cuz some stores went out of stock. Sharing is caring :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: The reason why I said it has started spreading since there are a few of you questioning it, it's just my belief. I'm not trying to scare anyone. This is just my personal opinion, you can choose to disregard it. For those interested, here are my reasons why:

The first man to have been confirmed to have the virus, in Singapore did probably get infected in Wuhan, but his son didn't show any symptoms until his dad was tested and after he was quarantined, which could mean that he got it from his dad after arriving in singapore(honestly this point doesn't matter). What it means is the fact that there is a possibility people could get infected from him despite him staying inside the hotel this entire time(possibly the hotel staff or the cleaning staff who came in contact with their room. What about the people at the airport? At that time, he didn't have any fever so he could have had a few interactions with other people?). But I doubt this will be an issue since they were isolated soon after.

And the fact that the third case, a lady from Wuhan didn't show any symptoms till arriving in Singapore means that most who could have been possibly infected could show symptoms at a much later time from the time they were in contact with an infected person(in her case, probably a day or two since she left Wuhan). This just means that there is a high possibility someone could have been infected during the time she was strolling around Singapore and wouldn't know about it till a week or so later when he/she start showing the symptoms.

The fact that Singapore has disclosed the whereabouts of all three cases since they had arrived in Singapore could also mean they haven't excluded the possibility of Singaporeans/travellers getting infected from these people at the places they have been to. They want us to be careful and be aware.

If you all just want to believe in statistics, go ahead. I trust in Sg stats since they are openly telling us a lot of things. But if you are like me, you would probably think, stats are only showing reported cases. What about the unreported cases?

**If you know of anyone who has a fever or has similar symptoms to the virus, please do advise them to check it out at the hospital/a nearby clinic. All it takes is one person's negligence.**",24/1/20,528,Vaccination,541,4,-10.48741202,130,15,17,0.250727666,0,0,1

> SINGAPORE: Two more people have tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases to three, the Ministry of Health announced on Friday (Jan 24).

> The new patients include the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case, MOH said in media briefing on Friday afternoon.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The second new confirmed case is a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on a Scoot flight at 5.30am on Jan 21, and developed a fever, cough and chills in the afternoon, said MOH.

> She sought medical attention at Raffles Hospital the next day and was later taken to the emergency department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was immediately isolated.

> MOH was notified of a suspect case at 3am on Jan 23. The woman subsequently tested positive for the virus at midnight.

> The woman stayed at J8 Hotel and visited Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay, MOH said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> She is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and is in a stable condition.

> There have been a total of 44 suspect cases in Singapore; the patients are aged between 1 and 78 years old. Thirteen of them have tested negative.

> The latest update comes after Singapore announced on Thursday its first confirmed case, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Jan 20.

> He is in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and in a stable condition, authorities said.

> Contact tracing has been initiated to identify about 30 people seated near the man during his flight to Singapore. His nine travel companions have also been identified. One of them was his 37-year-old son, who is now confirmed as having the virus. The other eight have left Singapore.

> The man stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa and indicated that he kept within the hotel vicinity.

> The news of Singapore's first confirmed case came a day after Health Minister Gan Kim Yong announced the formation of a multi-ministerial task force to deal with the situation.

> Authorities also announced on Thursday that border screening will be expanded to all land and sea checkpoints, while a travel advisory has been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located.

> Earlier on Thursday, schools in Singapore sent out a notice to parents asking that they declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend beginning on Friday.

> Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines' budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan as a precautionary measure.

> Singapore businesses with a presence in Wuhan have also taken measures. ST Engineering, which has rail projects in Wuhan, has stopped all business commutes there.

> On Friday, China reported that the number of people infected by the SARS-like virus had exceeded 800, with 25 deaths.

> The National Health Commission said authorities were also examining 1,072 suspected cases of the virus that first emerged in central city of Wuhan.

> The markedly higher numbers were released just hours after the World Health Organization called the outbreak ""an emergency in China"", but stopped short of declaring the situation a global health emergency.

> China has effectively quarantined more than 20 million people across Wuhan and some nearby cities in response to the virus, and announced measures to curb its spread nationwide as hundreds of millions of people began travelling across the country this week for the Chinese New Year holiday.

> Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan, a major industrial and transport hub, are now eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the city of 11 million, where most of the cases have been identified.

> The virus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. That market has since been shut down.

> The virus has spread to Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, as well as provinces in northeastern, central and southern China.

> Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

> “As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient.

> “In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.”

> The deadly virus has killed 81 people in China so far, with more than 2,700 confirmed cases.

> Earlier on Monday, a newly formed multi-ministry task force announced Singapore will have a new set of stringent measures in an effort to contain the Wuhan coronavirus. These measures include enhanced temperature screening and leave of absence for some.

> Banning visitors is pretty much a middle finger to China, and for a country of our size we really can’t afford to do that.

I really don't get this sentiment eh. China itself has been willing to lockdown entire cities to prevent the virus from spreading. Why would they be offended by us parroting the CCP's behaviour? 

So many Asian countries are doing this, if Carrie Lam is willing to do it for even Hong Kong, of all places, surely that means most of these governments do not perceive border-shutting as something that might incite CCP wrath?

1. Even Singapore doesn't get 100% of the cases, so there could be some mild cases that slip under the radar, making whatever ""found"" cases seem lower, but the severe cases as a % may be higher. 
2. The numbers on most websites show total cases. Some might recover faster, or are in the process of recovery before they are found, and others might have recovered but still be counted as an infected case. 

Thus, it may be 10% based on total patients at a quick glance, but may be higher. That said, I'm not a medical professional, just someone who's too free and keep looking at the numbers daily.

> Another patient could be discharged in the next few days, the ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak told a press conference yesterday.

> The patient discharged yesterday is a 35-year-old Chinese national who arrived in Singapore on Jan 23 and stayed at Marina Bay Sands.

> He developed symptoms the next day and was later warded at the NCID. He tested positive for the virus on Jan 27 and became the seventh case to be confirmed here. He is the first to be discharged.

> ""The patient was discharged well. All symptoms had fully resolved and he had tests over three consecutive days that were all negative,"" Associate Professor Mak said.

> ""We're quite confident that he's no longer got any infection.""

> Prof Mak noted that there are a number of other patients who have the virus but are well, including at least three who are not showing any symptoms. Many continue to make good progress, he added.

> Two of the patients without symptoms were among the six new confirmed cases announced yesterday. There were 24 confirmed cases in Singapore as of last night.

> Prof Mak said five patients required oxygen and breathing support, but added that this is ""not surprising"", given that they had pneumonia.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Get latest updates

> ""None of the patients are in the intensive care unit and none are critically ill at this point in time,"" he said.

> MOH's chief health scientist Tan Chorh Chuan, who was also at the press conference yesterday, said a ""small number"" of coronavirus patients in Singapore have been treated with a combination of antiretroviral drugs, namely lopinavir and ritonavir.

> The drug cocktail is usually used to treat patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes Aids. It is unclear if the patient who was discharged yesterday was given the drugs.

> Professor Tan said clinical trials are under way in China to test the efficacy of the drugs in treating patients with the new coronavirus.

> Related Story Wuhan virus: China using HIV drugs in treatment plan for patients

> On Sunday, Thailand's health ministry said Thai doctors who gave the drugs to coronavirus patients have reported promising initial results.

> ""We are waiting to see how the trials are proceeding and we hope, in the weeks ahead, we will have some indication,"" Prof Tan said.

> ""In the meantime, among the different drugs that have been tested, these agents appear to be effective, but we can't be certain at the moment. They appear promising and the trials will help us understand how effective they can be.""

> SINGAPORE: Health Minister Gan Kim Yong has instructed that a correction direction be issued to Singapore States Times over a Facebook post about his ministry's reporting of COVID-19 cases, said the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office on Saturday (Apr 18).

> The Facebook post, published on Saturday, contained ""multiple false statements"", said the POFMA Office.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> It alleged that the number of new COVID-19 cases in Singapore on Friday was 1,146, and that the total number of confirmed cases was 5,573.

> 

> It also claimed that Mr Gan ordered the reported numbers to be halved to minimise public panic by reporting numbers in the afternoon instead of later at night, alleging a ""cover up"" by authorities.

> The Health Ministry on Friday confirmed 623 new cases of the virus, publishing the numbers in the evening instead of later at night as it usually does.

> The allegations made by Singapore States Times are false, said the POFMA Office.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Government website Factually said: ""There was no instruction given by the Minister for Health or the Government to halve or under-report the number of cases. For the purpose of updating the number of new cases of COVID-19 per 24-hour period, MOH has always used 12pm as the cut-off time since the onset of COVID-19.

> ""There is no cover-up by the Government or MOH.""

> 

> Authorities also explained that the Health Ministry will now release ""top line numbers"" in the afternoon of new COVID-19 cases, and share further updates later that same night.

> ""Contact tracing is a rigorous and time-intensive process, especially as case numbers increase,"" stated the Factually website.

> ""As there is significant public interest particularly in the number of new COVID-19 infections daily, MOH has started releasing top line numbers (i.e. the gross number of new cases which have been preliminarily confirmed) in the afternoon of each day, even as contact tracing and investigations continue.""

> 

> It advised members of the public not to speculate and spread unfounded rumours.

> Mr Gan also ordered that a targeted correction direction be issued to Facebook - meaning the social media site will be required to communicate a correction notice to all Singapore users who access the falsehood on its platform.

> 

> Earlier this month, a correction direction was ordered against a post on the Singapore States Times Facebook page claiming that foreign workers quarantined for COVID-19 will not be paid their salaries.

> 

> A similar order was ordered against the Temasek Review on Friday over a post alleging that a GrabFood driver was fined by police officers for wearing a cloth as a mask and for illegal parking.

SINGAPORE - In an ""utopian situation"" with an infinite supply of masks, everyone wearing one regardless of their health status will help contain the coronavirus swiftly.

But as this is not possible, and given the Covid-19 outbreak is a ""marathon"", healthy people under the age of 60 should not wear masks on a daily basis, infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam told The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 1).

The day before,The New York Times reported that the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was reviewing its guidelines on who should wear masks.


On Monday, Austria made the wearing of masks in supermarkets mandatory in a bid to stem the spread of the virus. The Czech Republic went a step further, making mask-wearing mandatory outside of the house.

Readers had also written in to ST asking that people be advised to wear masks despite not showing symptoms.

At a media conference on Tuesday, the Health Ministry's (MOH) Director of Medical Services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said the ministry was looking at evidence ""very carefully"" and conducting a review of its stance on masks, as it does with its other policies.

""As far as masks are concerned, we are in fact in the process of continuing to review the data that's available, both in the literature as well as the international experience,"" he said.


He added that recommendations would be made after the review is completed.

Dr Leong, who practices at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said on Wednesday the need for everybody to wear a mask regardless of their health might eventually be a requirement if Singapore is unable to control the spread of the virus here.

But, he noted, masks are still in short supply around the world.

"" I think it's a moot point to get people to wear masks when they're still in scarcity. It's like telling the poor, the way to get out of poverty is to get more money - but I don't tell you how to get that money,"" he said.

""The mask situation has improved, but we're not seeing endless supplies of masks. If all of us had to mask up today for one week, we might finish all our stock of masks immediately.

""The real science of it is, if everyone maintains their 2m distance, watches their hand hygiene, doesn't go out when they're sick, then we may not even need the mask. By keeping 2m away, I would have done what the mask can do,"" he added.


Those older than 60 can use a mask when they go outdoors as they are more vulnerable, he said, adding that they also have to bear in mind the need to conserve their own supply of masks as the outbreak may last for another six to nine months.

Infectious diseases expert Paul Tambyah from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine said at the moment, data on mask use is not entirely clear.

He noted that new data suggests the receptor for the virus which causes the Covid-19 disease, may be present in the nose and not just in the lungs.

""If this is confirmed, then (using) something which covers our noses may turn out to be important,"" he said, adding that more information would likely be available in a week or so.

Dr Wong Tien Hua, family physician at Mutual Healthcare Medical Clinic, said there is a need for ""situational usage"" of masks at the moment.

""On the bus, on the MRT... when you're queuing up or in a crowded place, wearing a mask is the smart thing to do,"" he said.

He noted, however, that Singapore has taken a multi-pronged approach to fight the virus, including using social distancing measures and closing down entertainment outlets.

""If you tell everybody to wear masks, it's kind of missing the point, because we have other measures,"" he said.

Another family physician, Dr Leong Choong Kit of Mission Medical Clinic, felt that getting everyone to a mask up might backfire.

""If mass wearing of masks is advised, the cost of masks will rise again and the public will buy them from unreliable sources. If they are of dubious quality, they will not serve their function. So it will end up as a futile attempt to control the virus,"" he said.

There is no need for a blanket call to mask up unless there is more community spread here, he added.

A growing number of people online had also called for people to make their own face masks from improvised materials.

Dr Leong Hoe Nam noted that cloth masks have proven to be less effective than proper surgical masks. However, he added: ""But I believe it confers some advantage rather than none, so if I couldn't get a decent surgical mask, I'd use at least a cloth mask.""

Dr Wong said: ""Wearing any kind of barrier is better than no barrier, especially for those who are talking or sneezing.""

But Prof Tambyah and Dr Leong Choong Kit disagree.

""Wearing an ineffective mask is far worse than not wearing one,"" said Dr Leong.

""If I do not have a mask at all, I will consciously avoid certain places, but i f I were to wear one, I may be less conscious and put myself at risk.""

Prof Tambyah said very few studies had tested different types of masks in clinical settings, and he did not know of any that involved patients coughing or sneezing.

""I don't think we should be specifically encouraging people to make their own masks, until there is good objective data on how effective such masks are under clinical conditions,"" he added.

No data exist yet that suggest asymptomatic transmission should be a concern, said the infectious disease experts.

Prof Tambyah said that while epidemiological data may suggest that people could be infectious the day before their onset of symptoms, more detailed molecular evidence had not yet been publicised on these cases.

Dr Leong Hoe Nam said that while asymptomatic cases of transmission may exist, they play a ""very, very small"" role in the transmission of the virus.

""If the epidemic were driven by many asymptomatic transmitters, the Chinese authorities wouldn't have been able to control it so quickly,"" he added.",1/4/20,1040,Vaccination,1065,4,-11.02419315,204,40,15,-0.566715511,0,1,1

>To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination.

And here's the Moderna one:

>The interim analysis included a concurrent review of the available Phase 3 COVE study safety data by the DSMB, which did not report any significant safety concerns. A review of solicited adverse events indicated that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Grade 3 (severe) events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first dose included injection site pain (2.7%), and after the second dose included fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), headache (4.5%), pain (4.1%) and erythema/redness at the injection site (2.0%).

You usually expect any safety signals to manifest themselves with 7-21 days from the last dose received and from a safety perspective, they appear to be well tolerated.

I am still on the fence because there are so many conflicting information that I am picking up all over.

Given that both Pfizer & Moderna are mRNA-based vaccines and their phase 3 results / data are released at about the same time with similar effectiveness, it gave me a bit more confidence initially.

However I am really a bit alarmed with how UK managed to approve the Pfizer one so quickly. Am interested to see how they roll it out starting from next week, if what they claim is true. And how they botched their response (have some colleagues in the UK) plus the errors with initial results and data from AstraZeneca undermines confidence in them recently.

I sure hope that other countries that do not have the virus under control are now not under pressure (especially looking at USA) to quickly approve vaccines without going through all the necessary processes.

Locally, virus situation considered calm (and I hope it remains that way for a long time), HSA will not be under pressure to confirm quickly.

Singapore has handled the situation well after initial blunders. Let the world show if the vaccine is effective and whether it's the silver bullet to solve the crisis.

I fail to see what benefits I get out of it unless I'm working in a healthcare front-line job.

I see people online (not specifically here) commenting about how desperate they are for the vaccine so they can travel. That kind of reasoning just irks me. Even once vaccine rolls out, it will take months to a year before we can assess if the virus is under control.

Will you take the covid vaccine immediately when it comes to Singapore or will you wait a while?,4/12/20 14:03,"Honestly I'll wait for a few months or so first, ok idk if I'll get flamed but I feel that as compared to the development of other vaccines I feel like this one is relatively more rushed hence if there were to be additional side effects, it may not be visible till say maybe a year later for example? I myself have a weaker immune system though I should be considered young and healthy for my age group, but because of this I'll wait and seek a doctor's opinion first. 
I know how vaccines are tested, manufactured and all and that there's volunteers who go to take the jab and they're fine, but with cases such as dengvaxia in Philippines for example, I guess this is why people are quite concerned about the potential effects hence they aren't willing to go for the jab. ( it's really not about anti vaxxers or what, everybody's body is made different and there are also health conditions that people may have which may induce even worse side effects hence they may have to rely on herd immunity) 
With that being said I acknowledge such incidences are like minority, most vaccines are quite safe and I would very much rather have people who are at higher risk of infection such as health-care workers and the elderly have the injection (of course, subjected to MOH's advisory too).

Firstly, there is no such thing as a perfect vaccine or a perfect drug. There will always be side effects and people  that will be allergic to or not responsive to it. One of the worlds most common drug - Paracetamol (Panadol) has an efficacy rate of 97%. Are you going to stop taking it? The decision to take them are often weighed by side effects against benefits. The side effects at the moment seem to be pretty manageable.

Even if there is a ""perfect"" drug, no one in science will come out claim that it is because that is no such thing as 100% in science. Are you even in healthcare or pharm? Your claim of Pfizer marketing ploy 90%-95% also falls flat because of you don't understand the matric that determines the results. Numbers in this are tied heavily to the number of individual tested. When they released the 90% efficacy rates, testing was probably on-going because you cannot immediately determine the 43000 individuals results at the same time. Testing are probably done at staggered times. You can't expect results to flow in at a uniformed rate.

Thalidomide was a new drug a few decades ago and was recommended as a drug for hyperemesis gravidarium. Turns out it took them a few months to realise it actually caused birth defects. 

In recent history the dengue vaccine from Sanofi actually was associated with the deaths of over 600 phillippine children despite having been trialled extensively. It is believed that the mechanism was due to antibody dependent enhancement, or an overly exuberant immune reaction to the dengue virus if u will.

Mrna vaccines don't have that tried and tested safety record unlike inactivated virus vaccines.

There are concerns that the lipid nano particles used to encase the mrna can end up in unintended places and trigger off unhelpful inflammatory responses in certain organs.

COVID-19 vaccine stirs rare hesitation in nearly virus-free Singapore,23/12/20 11:58,"Mechanically speaking, mRNA vaccines seem very safe.

Ideally, they prefer specific immune cells, make virus proteins using the host cell machinery using a natural and quickly degraded information carrying molecule.

mRNA cannot integrate into the DNA, neither can it propagate itself. All it can do is tell your protein making machinary to make proteins based on the information encoded on it. The carriers of these mRNA are not viral particles, but rather bubbles of fat molecules, and I read some paper somewhere that says it can be designed to concentrate on the lymphatic system (important in generating immune response).

There’s no chance for the virus to reactivate itself, which is rare but not impossible for weakened virus vaccines, since there is no virus involved. There’s no risk of finding small amounts of intact virus like in inactivated vaccines with poor quality control, because there is no virus involved. Unlike a weakened virus vaccine, the mRNA fat bubbles aren’t going to go into the usual tissues or organs that the virus targets and risk provoking unwanted immune reactions there, since it contains no virus specfic proteins or receptors on the bubble, the proteins that help to direct the virus to its target, because once again, *no virus involved*.

It is synthetic. It’s not harvested using virus particles.

However, its not entirely without risk. One risk I came across was that apparently some COVID viral protein resembles the body’s own proteins, and in some severe covid cases, the body overreacted and was tricked into targeting friendly cells. If the mRNA vaccine manufacturer chose the right protein target, then this is unlikely. Also, if they unluckily chose that allegedly troublesome protein, you would have seen much more cases of severe effects as compared to placebo in trials. If they get it right, you won’t ever come across that unlucky protein. In comparison, you can’t guarantee that in vaccines using destroyed virus fragments or weakened versions of it, because one can be that unlucky.

Some drugs can cause long term side effects because you take it long term and it targets a certain important function in the body, which may be important in some way that wasn’t predicted. But the Pfizer one which we have right now does not do that. It doesn’t target any cellular function and it is unlikely to do so, and the most likely consequences are immune related ones.

COVID-19 vaccine stirs rare hesitation in nearly virus-free Singapore,23/12/20 11:58,"Long term side effects usually comes from long term use of a medication. It happens because the way modern medicine works. 

The body has lots of natural processes going on. Some of this processes, when out of “balance”, can lead to disease. Drugs target aspects of such biological processes to bring it back to “balance”, sometimes by blocking it, sometimes by enhancing it. 

Drugs are *small* molecules. The body doesn’t care about the atoms making up the molecule, the body cares about the *shape*. These specially designed drug molecules go into the protein (or other molecules) and do its “magic”, affecting the natural biological processes and bring it into balance.

One problem with this is that the body sometimes likes to reuse the same protein (or family of similar proteins) in different places to control different processes. A drug may unintentionally affect an otherwise unintended process(es) and cause long term unforseen problems.

Another problem is that a drug can target some completely unexpected target. As I said earlier, the shape is important. While a drug can be designed to fit a certain protein, there is chance that by coincidence, it can also hit some unrelated protein elsewhere and affect other processes and cause problems in the long term.

Also, ultimately, all drugs are poison and the only thing that differentiate medicine from poison is the dosage. Too much of an effect can be bad. There are drugs that can cause damage to organs at higher dosages, for example. 

Sometimes, the drug molecule itself can be chemically reactive, and can cause damage. Keep using it and you get long term damage. Rarely, if such chemically reactive drug damage the DNA enough over the years, people can even get cancer. Fortunately, people know some of the common reactive features and avoid those.

To complicate things, the body tends to do things to a drug molecule to make it easier to get rid of it. That thing can be inherently toxic (such as one of paracetamol/panadol’s metabolite), or it can have effects of its own.

There are a lot of ways for a drug to cause long term problems and side effects. However, does this mean mRNA vaccines can do so too? There are differences between mRNA and drug molecules and that makes things different.

Ultimately, mRNA is a naturally occuring information carrying molecule. You have it in your body and it comes in many different lengths. The mRNA in the vaccine is not going to be any more reactive than those you already have!

Compared to drug molecules, mRNA are huge. Things bind to sites on the mRNA, not really the other way around. It’s not very likely to trigger things you wouldn’t expect a normal mRNA to trigger.

Inherently, mRNA are not toxic, so that is one safe part.

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the viral product it encode for can target unwanted processes and cause effects, it isn’t something very likely. Given that mRNA is not very stable, it doesn’t stay for long and you are only exposed to the amounts injected. Even if the product is not harmless, it is transient and shouldn’t cause too much of an effect, and unlikely to cause a long-term one. Your body can take a bit of damage. You go out under the sun? Damage. Eat or touch stuff too hot? Damage. Etc etc.

It would be *far worse* to get the real deal, since the actual virus can replicate and make much much more potentially harmful viral proteins that a mRNA vaccine can cause your body to produce, on top of other problems associated with the actual covid virus.

To be honest, the most likely reactions are immune related ones and those most side effects are short term and not likely to be very harmful.

If you react very negatively to the mRNA in the vaccine and the protein it produces, I don’t think you would fare any better with the real virus.

The chances of the vaccine working as intended safely is high, probably better odds with that then the odds between mild and serious covid.",24/12/20,697,Vaccination,690,4,-10.95510977,117,27,10,0.098918636,0,0,1

COVID-19 vaccine stirs rare hesitation in nearly virus-free Singapore,23/12/20 11:58,"Your source is completely misinterpreted. Perhaps your UOU (or UOY) lecturer never teach you enough.

It talks about the RNA world, which is about evolution of life before DNA existed, hypothetically many billions of years ago. An RNA world must no doubt contain specialised proteins/RNA-based molecules to copy and make more of the RNA, make proteins out of it, etc. However, those genes and their associated proteins/special RNA molecules would have long been gone, since it no longer has a use in the DNA world.

Without the machinery to do so, your body cannot turn mRNA in the vaccine to viable hereditary information carrying molecules. And the vaccine *will not* contain any instruction to do so either.

>	The cells of the RNA world would presumably have been much less complex and less efficient in reproducing themselves than even the simplest present-day cells, since catalysis by RNA molecules is less efficient than that by proteins. They would have consisted of little more than a simple membrane enclosing a set of self-replicating molecules and a few other components required to provide the materials and energy for their replication.

DNA and RNA can only direct the cell machinery to do what the information on it tells them to. Even if you put an ancient RNA genome in the body and somehow give it all the cellular machinery to get it working, all you are going to get is what’s on that genome, and as the source had said, its just some simple lifeform that’s nothing like a fucking human cell. It’s not even comparable to a bacteria, and bacteria can be considered less complex!

COVID-19 vaccine stirs rare hesitation in nearly virus-free Singapore,23/12/20 11:58,"Stop and think of just one thing.

Consider that this hypothetical RNA baby is even possible, *where the fuck are you even getting the genome from?*

You have *no* cellular machinery in your body capable of turning your entire DNA genome into a consistent hereditary RNA genome. You can’t get a human or some weird human mutant out of it using RNA.

No one placed the code for this completely hypothetical RNA baby into the vaccine. No one placed the code to give the body the ability to turn DNA into RNA.

Furthermore, RNA is inherently less stable than DNA, even in a similar double-helix form. It is fragile in single-stranded form. While possible to carry information in some RNA double-helix, its fragility meant that it requires upkeep and maintenance to repair it, just like DNA. *Unlike DNA*, you don’t have those specialised RNA repairing molecules lying around, because the vaccine doesn’t contain it and we don’t have it in our body because we don’t need it.

Regardless of whether it is even possible, there is no way that your far-fetched concerns would ever materialise. How is it even possible to get an RNA baby? Simple logic and biology knowledge would have precluded such possibilities. You can’t create something out of *nothing*.",24/12/20,214,Vaccination,212,4,-11.45433457,38,5,6,0.881971398,0,0,1

At this moment in Singapore, the benefits of inoculation don't exactly outweigh the risks. Covid-19 isn't ravaging our hospitals (unlike in the United States), so there isn't an urgent need to protect oneself with a vaccine. In addition, there are [valid concerns regarding long-term side effects](https://www.jpost.com/health-science/could-an-mrna-vaccine-be-dangerous-in-the-long-term-649253) of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Healthcare workers may perceive themselves to be guinea pigs, rather than beneficiaries, of this novel and untested mRNA technology.

It ultimately boils down to personal choice and agency. After all, no one likes to be told what to do. People may feel more comfortable with inoculation if they have a say on when they get vaccinated and which vaccine they take.

I'm hopeful things will change over the coming months.

Previous roll-outs are much slower because not the whole world is affected by a pandemic and there is no lack of finances and brains this time round.

Many things are also moving in parallel instead of one after another.

A valid concern are the long term side effects, which is impossible to know because all the vaccines have just been developed. And there is no way around this besides continued studies & observations.

However weighing the pros and cons, the long term effects of the virus are also unknown, and there are many reports of long Covid.

If both are also unknown, I would think the potential side effects are less serious (looking at the \~30m people who have gotten the vaccine, obviously it's short-term details we can get for now) than actually catching the virus.

Because of the nano lipid particle used to encase the mrna itself, it is theorised that the vaccine may potentially be able to cross the blood brain barrier and enter into immunologically privileged sites. Where does the vaccine go? 

Not much study on that for now. 

And currently Pfizers phase 3 data was collected over a period of 2 months. Safety and efficacy cannot be established beyond that period of time but we generally assume it to be safe. 

If future doses are required to maintain immunity, will compounded doses result in a different safety profile? 

There is a reason why hcws may want to shy away from the mrna vaccine for now because they actually read medical journals and not pro vaccine messages from the mass media. 

Attenuated virus vaccines have been well studied. And we do know that the attenuated virus retains the trophism of the target virus (in this case, sars cov2).

The first burden is to understand how does vaccines work and how long they take to work. This portion is where I feel a lot of you 'wait and see' people don't really get. Vaccines (even mRna) work by activating your body's immunity to fight against the virus. 3 outcomes can happen. 1 is that your immunity don't get activated, 2 is that the vaccine activates your immunity and it kills the virus, 3 is that the vaccine activates but starts attacking the everything including your vital organs - that is what we call an autoimmune disease. - the process and the timeline for this 3 scenario to happen is pretty short. You don't need to wait for a long time for this 3 scenarios to happen. Plus the Pfizer clinical trial has been past 3 months.
Where it gets tricky for the layman is that they confuse medication that causes long term effects with vaccines. Even medicine that causes long term effects don't cause long term effects with 1-2 dose. It causes damage with long term use.

The 2nd burden is to properly educate the public within these 3 months regarding the vaccines. That is the proper channel to go through. People with no understanding of how vaccine/medicine works should not comment and provide advice on how people should feel about them. Also note, when these expert talk about the wait and see, they are also trying to understand how long does this immunity last - because they have no idea.",13/1/21,253,Vaccination,271,4,-10.81719794,63,9,7,0.530443868,0,1,1

What happens if they do get infected with the virus after rejecting the vaccine. Who now has to bear those costs? Probably the government will still bear it. But is it fair since it was them who rejected the vaccine. 

And once it's determined to be safe, should we then allow the healthcare personnel to cut the queue since they are in the high risk sector? Or should we enforce a strict queueing system to put them at the end. If we allow them to cut the queue, is this then fair to those who wants the vaccine but now have to wait longer?

With regards to the Pfizer Vaccine, it is a new technology. Unlike previous vaccines where they introduce a inactivated virus into your body which would activate your immunity system to fight against this Covid virus. Instead of inject a virus, they inject a protein into your body. It is supposedly safer because you are not injecting a virus into your body. There is a fear (not a risk) that this protein may cause some autoimmune issues, this is an opinion of some people there is no data of this happening. The technology has been studied for decades but they have not pushed this to the markets. The reason is that this technology is an expensive solution to the traditional solution (they ultimately do the same thing) but from a market perspective it is largely unproven. Whether it is safe or not, nobody has enough data to conclusively tell you whether it is safe to take or not. You have to decide on your own. Known side effects for the vaccines are also common there may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site. Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination. These normal vaccine reactions are usually mild and subside after a few days.

Ultimately, you should decide to take an unproven vaccine vs trying to return to a time where there is no fear of getting Covid.",13/1/21,340,Vaccination,339,4,-10.67322217,66,13,14,0.30011263,0,1,1

> SINGAPORE - Singapore received its first shipment of China's Sinovac vaccine on Tuesday (Feb 23). However, the product has not yet been authorised for use by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), said the Health Ministry on Wednesday (Feb 24).

> In a statement, the ministry said: ""Sinovac has started submitting initial data, and HSA is currently awaiting Sinovac's submission of all the necessary information in order to carry out a thorough scientific assessment of the manufacturing process, safety and efficacy of the vaccine under the Pandemic Special Access Route.""

> Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are currently being used in Singapore, have received interim authorisation under this route. Both vaccines involve injecting snippets of the virus' genetic material into the body to stimulate an immune response.

> In contrast, Sinovac's product is an inactivated vaccine, which makes use of killed virus particles. This method has been used in vaccines for diseases such as polio.

> MOH also said it received a fresh shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, and will continue to monitor vaccine supplies closely.

> In a Facebook post, the Chinese embassy said the delivery of the vaccine cements the agreement made by both countries to cooperate on issues related to the pandemic.

> ""China and Singapore have helped each other to meet the challenge since the Covid-19 epidemic broke out, setting a fine example for cooperation against the virus among countries,"" it wrote.

> It added that China will continue to work with Singapore to ""enhance cooperation on vaccine and epidemic control, build a global community of health for all, and win the final victory in the fight against the epidemic"".

""At Tuesday’s press conference, Palácios said Sinovac’s relatively low efficacy rate of 50% was due to its more rigorous standard for what counts as an infection among trial volunteers. The Butantan Institute said it included six types of cases in its results: asymptomatic, very mild, mild, two levels of moderate, and severe. (The Brazilian authorities stressed that the public should focus on the vaccine’s 100% efficacy in protecting against severe cases of COVID-19.) Western vaccine makers generally included only mild, moderate, and severe categories, and companies like Pfizer are doing additional studies to see if the vaccine will prevent asymptomatic cases.""

People want to compare other studies, but that’s like comparing a person that runs a 1-kilometer race on a flat stretch and another doing it on a steep and obstacle-filled stretch,” Palácios said.

"" There is some evidence to back up Palácios’ claim that Brazil’s trial standards are more likely to catch mild cases of COVID-19 than trials conducted elsewhere, which would result in a lower efficacy rate."" In the U.S.’s Food and Drug Administration’s evaluation of Pfizer’s vaccine trials, the agency found that there were up to 1,594 suspected but unconfirmed cases of COVID-19. Because the infections were unconfirmed, they didn’t factor into the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy rate.

"Singapore research - ""SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls""",17/7/20 21:01,"Hi,
 
  I'm just trying to correct the record, hope this gets enough visibility. Happy to answer more questions if necessary. 

> We already know now that antibody immunity to a natural infection fades fast. 

  I am not sure what you mean by that, but I assume that you are referring to the studies that demonstrated that the antibody levels in recovered patients decrease after a few months. Thing is, the adaptive immune system (i.e. T and B cells) have memory. That means that once the adaptive immune system sees an pathogen or infection, they are likely to have a secondary response that is much faster than the original defense.

Hence, loss of detectable antibody in the blood/plasma doesn't mean that the memory B cells or plasmablasts are gone, nor does it mean that the patients that we can't find the antibody in can be reinfected by the virus (i.e. immunity may still be there) Truth is, we'll only know when it's put to the test.

> What the Singapore work shows is that the earlier SARS outbreak established very long-lasting immunity against SARS that also covers SARS-2. That also included CD8+ T-cells that play a key role in killing infected cells. As SARS-2 as similar to SARS, there is reasonable hope that these other new vaccines could also elicit long-term immunity. However, they did not study the S protein that those other vaccines are based on so we don't actually know if long-term T-cell immunity can be generated against that. It will be a ""game over"" downer for all candidates if it can't. Couldn't at least one effort have selected the NP protein instead? Groupthink.

The fact that the NP protein responses are being generated at a much higher frequency in COVID patients just means that for some reason, the SARS-COV-2 virus' most immunogenic protein is there. Why that is the case may have nothing to do with the antibody and the quality of the immune defense against the virus.

The S protein was chosen based on previous studies of similar viruses such as SARS and MERS. In fact, the main reason why we have clinical trials that quickly already is that much of the early work for developing a vaccine based off this target was already done. Based off this new study, we may need to look into NP. But a S protein based target may still work, since it doesn't [mutate as frequently] (https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02392-y), and still can [generate a response] (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483?query=featured_home). 

The main reason I am replying is to hope that you and others don't judge the work of the researchers based on hindsight. After all, hindsight is 20/20 for a reason.",18/7/20,425,Vaccination,444,4,-11.40760689,89,17,10,0.241193802,0,0,1

I complete agree with you. Moreover, we are 100 percent urbanized and only 720 sq km, which should make it easy to transport the vaccines to anywhere on the island.

The only explanation I can think of for the plans for vaccination centers is that they originally planned for vaccinations to be done in hospitals and polyclinics for storage reasons (e.g. ultralow refrigeration) before realizing that the vaccines are more easily transportable with dry ice which means that the injections can be done outside of polyclinics and hospitals.
