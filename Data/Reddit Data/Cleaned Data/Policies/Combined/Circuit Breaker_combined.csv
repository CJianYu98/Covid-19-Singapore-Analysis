> SINGAPORE - Singapore should be fully prepared that many of the current restrictions and circuit breaker measures in place will continue for some time even after June 1, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.

> This is to keep people and their loved ones safe after the circuit breaker ends, he said in a Facebook post on Sunday (May 17).

> ""It won't simply be a return to life before the circuit breaker,"" he said, noting the Government will adopt a careful and calibrated approach as the country resumes normal activities at work, schools, and in social settings.

> The Government is preparing for the next phase and considering what activities can resume in a safe manner, said the minister, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the Covid-19 outbreak.

> ""A controlled and phased exit from the circuit breaker will require patience and discipline from all of us,"" he said.

> ""We must all do our part to control the spread of the virus and ensure that it does not flare up again. Otherwise all our efforts and sacrifices during this circuit breaker period would have been made in vain.""

> He cited the approach taken for the construction sector, which will restart on a few critical projects where very tight safeguards are required from June 2.

> The safeguards include requiring workers involved in a project to be housed together, instead of lodging at multiple dormitories, as well as periodic testing of workers at two-week intervals.

> The number of construction workers involved in projects will scale up over time as the industry gains confidence and experience with the measures, Mr Wong said.

> Related Story 682 new coronavirus cases, including 4 Singaporeans and PRs

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> Construction work has largely been suspended since Covid-19 circuit breaker measures kicked in on April 7, with only 5 per cent of the sector's workforce - about 20,000 workers - continuing to work on a small number of critical projects, and those that have had to continue for safety reasons.

> The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) expects another 5 per cent of the workforce to resume work gradually, meaning about one-tenth of the usual workforce will be active in June.

> During a press conference on Friday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong also called on Singapore residents to remain vigilant even after circuit breaker measures officially end on June 1.

> He highlighted the need for restrictive measures to continue to ensure that the number of coronavirus cases does not spike, and urged Singaporeans to continue to cooperate with the authorities and support safe distancing measures so the country can progressively open up with time.

Let's imagine if Singaporeans didnt panic and rush to form long queues at hypermarts like NTUC, Giant. Since PM Lee has reassured us that these will remain open for essentials, then the crowd logically should be same (or lesser) than before Covid19,as there are also now restrictions on items.

But because now the crowd has formed due to people panicking and not listening. Eventually a cluster will form out of these hypermarts like Mustafa Centre, which then will force the Government to go even a step further and have to close or restrict these places too.

Now, here comes the funny problem.. when these full scale lockdowns finally happen, those people who went to panic buy or form the queues at these hypermarts will then tell you "" I TOLD U SO TO PANIC BUY AND STOCK UP MONTHS WORTH OF SUPPLIES.. DONT LISTEN TO ME LAH NOW U HAPPY ?"" .. when it is actually a result of their actions of forming potential clusters or crowd which has caused the escalation in lockdown.. so they will still continue think there is nothing wrong with their actions and rush to form queues again to ""stock up"" at every where place possible when the lockdown is lifted a little again.. and we become stuck in a negative loop",2020-04-06 10:49:42,220

Additionally, our government is being accidentally lax by announcing and giving days of leeway before any measures (thus making people want to go out even more, and highlight the fact that covidiots don’t understand that crowds should be avoided even if the government never says so). Another thing is the lax enforcement, like how NEA began to seriously enforce distancing in hawker centres 3 days before they are going to be closed to dine-ins anyway (with these covidiots, all the more the government should clamp down hard immediately).

The panic rush to the supermarkets and non-essentials means that people are not pretending its normal. But, covidiots are clearly too stupid to understand that the virus will not wait for the DORSCON Circuit Breaker to kick in before spreading. Also, add in the self-serving nature of our people, and you will realise many people flocked to the non-essentials to satisfy some of the most vain and unnecessary desires (hairstyling, pedicure, etc.)

Most Singaporeans are not stupid. 

For the past 2-3 months, they made a personal assessment, looking at the headline local and global news, the low number of local cases, and the behaviour of their friends and family, and they decided that the risk of continuing their social activities is low. 

They could not see (even experts did not know) that they can spread the virus even if they are asymptomatic, or that they can indirectly affect the elderly/ immunocompromised even if they themselves may not suffer severely. 

As they visit the malls, or go to the hawker centres, they see everyone behaving normally, and this further enhances the fact that they can continue normally. 

As a comparison, if the SARS-COV2 was similar to SARS-COV1 in mortality (30%), and they read the news of lots of Singaporeans dying, every Singaporean will guai guai stay at home at all times (without the constant nagging). 

This is the crux of the problem: the fact that SARS-COV2 does not have the killing power of more severe diseases like SARS-COV1 or Ebola, for example. So in terms of messaging of health policy, it is extremely difficult to get people to understand and follow. 

Hopefully now as we step up the messaging regarding the seriousness of the problem, things will improve. And we will come out of this 1 month with a flattened curve.",2020-04-06 14:46:17,227

Not to nitpick here, but you are comparing the numbers of New York City five days ago vs. New York *State* now.

I am going to go out and say it; I think some of this is a bit alarmist. While, obviously, people interacting with other people raises the likelihood of cases vs. not interacting at all, comparing a couple dozen people standing in queues at supermarkets to thousands of people in a very close proximity at football matches and festivals is a bit absurd.

I guess it's great if people are scared off going outside by seeing 120 new cases, but it seemed to have been made very clear that many of those cases are tied to those in worker dormitories who live in close proximity. Staying at home might not have done much to prevent those numbers, because the problem is their living conditions at their homes.

we’ve yet to see a multiple clusters from students in schools, probably that these students have a fixed social circle. the phrase “schs are safer” has much truth in it. many working people have fixed social circles as well. the HBL and WFH initiatives will help this. 

agreed that: not going out, social distancing, helps keeping that “social circle” fixed, and if everyone do that, everyone is safer

As I've acknowledged in OP. 

> I'm using examples of mass gatherings, but you can see the point - Every gathering, big or small helps the invisible enemy spread its wings 

Also why I've included the following as examples:

 [Beachgoers in the US](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-governor-refuses-shut-down-beaches-amid-spread-coronavirus-n1162226),  [Britons who didn't take social distancing seriously](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/03/22/many-britons-are-not-taking-social-distancing-for-covid-19-seriously),  [People in Italy outside their red-zone going to bars and restaurants](https://www.thelocal.it/20200318/learn-from-our-mistakes-italians-plead-with-people-abroad-to-take-coronavirus-risks-seriously)(Sounds familiar?) &  [people crowding on a NYC street](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fseld1/nyc_is_taking_this_seriously_look_at_this_crowd/)(Sounds like people crowding in shops here). 

&#x200B;

> many of those cases are tied to those in worker dormitories who live in close proximity. 

41 out of 120 new cases were tied with worker dorms. Of the remaining 79 cases, 66 are **unlinked**. Don't you think that's a cause for alarm?

&#x200B;

> Staying at home might not have done much to prevent those numbers, because the problem is their living conditions at their homes. 

You don't see pictures of people gathering in shopping malls, going out to meet friends ""one last time""? These are all sources of transmission whether or not you admit it.

Due in part to the government's relatively spineless ""it's not that bad"" approach to the second phase of this whole thing. The DORSCON-Almost-Red memes exist for a reason. 

For better or worse, the government has been trying and succeeding to downplay the severity of the situation here in Singapore. Locals take a look at other countries and see the streets literally devoid of people or traffic, then look at our own and see business as usual, and conclude that things are still going okay here.

This whole ""circuit breaker"" shit is a great representation of that. Even when it's lockdown, it's not really. We're always playing the careful escalation game because the government doesn't want to over commit. That's why people don't take it as seriously as they should.",2020-04-06 14:35:34,130

- What R0 is and what is the estimate R0 of the virus and what does that look like. Even a conservative estimate R0 of 2.5 means it will ravage the whole world in 2 months time.

- The possibility of asymptomatic transmission. Chris said that makes it a lot worse than SARS because with SARS, you knew who had the virus and you can isolate them very easily. This factor alone makes it a lot more invisible than SARS and you cannot fight effectively against something you cannot see/perceive. This is why you will need to consider the possibility of a lockdown when reports of asymptomatic transmission are coming out.

- Chris also mentioned a lot that tackling this Pandemic is a juggling act. You want to limit the spread but measures to do that will hurt the economy. Keeping your economy afloat will let the virus spread and overwhelm/cripple your healthcare. But if you let your economy crash, you will get shortages of supplies everywhere, making your war against the virus a lot harder. So far I think many countries have leaned too heavily on the economy part at the expense of limiting the virus spread and overwhelming their Healthcare.

The only country that did well in this is Taiwan and China is gonna be pissed off with this statement. South Korea did pretty well through tremendous effort. I believe Taiwan is at where we are 1 month ago right now and may reach 1000 cases in the coming few months. They will be able get away with minimal damage and will be back to normalcy relatively quickly. That was my hope that that will be outcome with Singapore's management on the disease.

It depends on how you define the supplies. If marketing is required then yes. But gov may not approve because they agree with your logic. I agree as well.

But you also agree fabric to mask maker as a supply chain is essential.

OP didn't share what business it is.

Supply chains are indeed treated as essential.

Your initial reply is that all support companies have to close which isn't true.

ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

To break down your reply clearly.

>Supply chain to essential business

>you supply fabric to mask maker u are essential

This 2 lines are the same except that 2nd line defines clearly what it is doing.

So line 1 is still valid.

You could also suggest that only essential supply chains to essential business can be exempted. 

So fabric is ok. Marketing isn't. 

But that's not how the policy is written. Which is why you have to apply for it.

Who knows, maybe certain business's supply chain which is marketing could be approved due to certain reasons.

So maybe marketing by itself may not be entirely non essential.

Supply chain to essential business does not clearly define what supplies will be approve or not.

The OP isn't false because it is vague and subjective.

Let me read again OP.

Edit:

>Companies are calling each other up to see if their clients are open. If the client is open, they will use that to justify that they need to remain open. This effectively nullifies the Circuit Breaker.

I note that OP did not include the word essential under ""clients"". However it is clearly implied since anything non essential will be closed without debate.

Only essential business / clients and their support chains have even a slim chance of staying open.

Since it is implied, so OP is not fake news.

Your first reply is below.

>Fake news, all non essential companies even if their clients are essential companies, if they can't do work from home, they must close.

However your reply clearly wrote.

Even if their clients are essential,  if the support chain cannot wfh,  they have to close.

I'm not sure if you are using it interchangeably with levain? Some people use levain/sourdough to refer to the same thing but in the US the sourdough is really sour while the typical  French boules made with levain are only a little bit. Also IIRC regular baguettes are specifically not made with levain to have that neutral/sweetish flavor, unless it's specifically a sourdough baguette. 

Sorry to be pedantic but I'm a bit of a bread geek but I don't bake, just eat. I did think of making my own boules though at one point. I'm puzzled at why people are making levain/sourdough starter though because it seems like the market for such breads in sg doesn't even exist commercially so why would they make it at home?! 

Tbh the quality of French/European bread here is not great IMO. I lived in the US and the local European/French bakeries produced better boules/baguettes than anything I have had in sg. Maybe I just havent found the right places.

My reddit account is probably a year or two old, with like 4 or 5 posts. I don't really care about points. But I just had to come out of my lurking just to respond to you. Perhaps you were referring to other users.


The risk increases the more people gather. It can be a queue, it can be a music concert, it can be school, or just about anything else. That is simple math. The queues we saw last weekend was packed with people, so I don't know if you are even in the same context as this thread. 


This context is important.


We are talking specifically about last few weeks where people senselessly went out before the lockdowns happened. The most recent examples being toys, IKEA and so on. 


Just to make it even clearer in writing, the problem is absolutely 'not adhering to safe distances' while queuing, as you said. Infact I thought the whole core of this thread stems from the OP's disappointment and frustration that people are not taking social distancing seriously, which he or she believes will lead to Singapore's situation worsening. This whole thread is to call that behavior out. It is probably the OP's holier-then-thou approach that got people all defensive and bothered.


Now, I've browsed through the rest of Reddit, and I see what you are trying to do. In your mind, you see yourself as someone combating against fearmongers, keeping the community spirit up, trying your best to spread what you believe is accurate information. I commend your positive intent. But playing down the threat is not the way to go. At this stage, people need to feel the danger. 


In the context of this thread (and as the OP pointed out in a few of the posts), people who RISKED queues, without practicing safe distances, for something they can survive a month without, have placed the people in danger. Man, some of them don't even have masks on! I wouldn't describe these people as 'selfish', but they are extremely complacent.

This explanation is very different from your first reply.

Now you trying to say if they apply and fail.

This is fairly backtracking and trying to change your words. Bad try though as it's fairly different the 2 statements.

But it is correct that if cannot get permission means must close.

Again not true.

If you are supply chain but not supplying to essential, you are not essential. 

Supply chain could be delivering things like pen and paper to popular.

However, you could be delivering paper to a hospital. Then the same supplier of paper becomes essential.

It's not up to you to decide what is essential or not. If the toy helps keep the kid entertained for a period of time and helps keep peace in the house yes than its essential.

*  We require the cooperation of all Singaporeans to minimise movements and interactions in public and private places, and stay home unless necessary for essential purposes. 
* ""Members of the public are strongly advised to stay at home and avoid going out unnecessarily, except to purchase daily necessities, essential services, or for urgent medical needs.""
*  The general public is advised to stay home and avoid interactions with anyone other than immediate family members living in the same household.

I put my daughter in infant care while both of us work. This circuit breaker was a little sudden to us but I had plans to buy those things anyway. I'm just bringing it forward because I have to spend this month with my daughter at home. And since at the infant care, they read books, do crafts and play with toys, I'm trying to replicate that same environment at home. For toddlers you have to establish a routine otherwise it's mayham. 

It's not some twisted priority, I'm trying to make my daughter comfortable while staying at home since she is used to the infant care and her friends. It's good for the both of us mentally. She's happy and so are we. 

Sure I have no doubt there are parents queuing not for these reasons but clustering everyone together is very judgemental and vindictive (why are you cross posting my comment to suit your narrative in another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fvw33i/comment/fml1hbb?context=1) when it's misrepresenting how I feel.

That said, while I would be the first to agree that our dear GLC/Gahmen scholars are usually idiots, I want to step away from the scholar management bad circle jerk because this is a systemic problem that has sucked in not just SIA

I am not going to go in depth into SIA's accounting, so this is what thing look like very roughly. This estimate is may be off, but it wont' be off by enough that the arguments change. Fuel is typically 30% of an airlines' operating costs. SIA I would estimate SIA's operating costs in this 13  year period is roughly 14 or so billion so a year, or which about very roughly 4 billion a year is fuel. SIA hedging operation runs about 3-500 million dollars a year in average losses over the last 13 years.[https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/2020/09/17/shareholder-raises-concerns-about-sias-15-years-of-fuel-hedging-losses-to-prime-minister-lee-as-no-one-takes-accountability/](https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/2020/09/17/shareholder-raises-concerns-about-sias-15-years-of-fuel-hedging-losses-to-prime-minister-lee-as-no-one-takes-accountability/)

This suggests to me that SIA's hedging operation is large and has a long history of incurring costs/ losses that are pretty high in relation to the underlying costs whose fluctuations they are trying to smooth out. This is in itself, not a good place to be.

The purpose behind hedging is to ensure a predictable P/L ratio. But we must think critically about why we are doing this and what it means. We seek out a predictable P/L ratio in order to allow for easy/cheap borrowing and to ensure that black swan events in a major operating expense don't wipe the business out out.

Yet to achieve this, the problem with fuel hedging is that a hedging operation this large may often create its own type of existential risk for the company.--Like it is doing right now, where SIA is simultaneously facing both huge losses from Covid and huge losses from a hedging.  An airline is not well equipped to stress test their trading positions in accordance with their own unique risk profile where jet fuel and passenger revenues may be inter-related ( and worse still co-related) in all sorts of weird and difficult to forsee ways.

The thing with hedging is that Airlines are not trading houses. Even trading houses very rarely beat the market. More than a few major hedge funds and investment banks have been buried by bad trades. And even as we understand that, it is very likely that the level of accountability and corporate governance in airlines is far worse than in the banks.

Outside of Singapore, AA , United and Delta have opted to stop hedging their fuel costs concluding that in the long run, it does not work. Southwest, famous for saving billions of dollars in the post 9/11 era by hedging their fuel costs later cumulatively lost billions of dollars in the mid 00s doing the same. Cathay Pacific has been suffering catastrophic losses from Fuel hedges gone bad and SIA is now in the same boat.

I think that if we are going to accept that SIA is 'too big to fail' and are going to have to be bailed out using our reserves, they should stay away from fuel hedging. Trading commodities is not a core airline competency and creates a corporate governance problem. Trading commodities creates a vector for risks that are not likely to be well understood and well characterized by management. Trading commodities in a firm that has the implicit backing of our government, creates a conflict of interest where profits get privatised and catastrophic losses get socialised.",2020-09-28 16:34:52,565

>Even accounting smaller planes that can travel far, is it profitable with the amount of passengers?

If a route is able to fill a plane while operating flights to a specific location at the frequency the flight is operated at, then it's profitable. Granted, there's a point at which decreasing frequency stops making it easier to fill a plane, as passengers have a time frame in which they need to get their flight. The time frame tends to be wider for the leisure consumers than the business consumers. Given how many smaller cities in SEA are pretty popular tourist destinations, and how many 787-8s are running around at the moment, it seems reasonable to me that you could get just over 200 passengers to fill a plane from a large European city to a Penang or a Phuket during holiday season.",2020-09-28 12:12:09,219

The reason why they have hedging loss is because they used long futures to hedge rather than doing the actual less risky way of hedging which is delta hedge via both options and futures.

Sure, you can argue that their VaR or Delta calculations were off, or that they shouldn't have made plays in the 5 year range, but SIA didn't inherently lose anything. 

Locking in a fixed price of oil to avoid price volatility that could impact their core business is very different from a rouge trader betting on Yen fluctuations.

When you hedge, you accept that you might lose some amount of money if price signals don't go your way, but that's not the point. The point of hedging is paying to avoid risk and price fluctuations, even if it may mean paying more than market prices.

If the price of oil skyrocketed, they wouldn't be impacted. There's a risk Vs reward analysis here. Would you say the same thing if Brent skyrocketed and SIA would be paying half the market price, and thus profiting?",2020-09-28 15:14:41,179

>It's not. A hedge means that you pay to get rid of the uncertainty and risk. When you hedge, you don't care if the market goes up or down.

It's still a bet. Believe it or not, all betting does not involve prices going up and making a profit out of it. You can make bets on the market going any direction to avoid losses. A bet is a bet, A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

>A bet is the taking on of risks based on a balance of probabilities. **In a bet, you are inherently looking to profit.** A hedge is paying to remove all uncertainty. You don't care if you lose or gain money from a hedge, all you want to do is get rid of uncertainty. In a hedge, you are not looking to profit

That's where you get it wrong and where your misunderstanding lies. Check the definition of a bet.

*risk a sum of money or valued item against someone else's on the basis of the outcome of an unpredictable event such as a race or game.*

A hedge is exactly a bet, you are putting up a sum against an unpredictable event or outcome.

>When you hedge, you don't look to make a profit or loss. You are simply looking to ensure the price of oil you pay today = price you pay tomorrow

It doesn't matter. A bet doesn't mean you are trying to make money as explained.

The expiry date for fuel is vastly longer than milk, meaning that it can be kept for longer.

Firstly, BBT has only been in the market for a couple of years. If you look at the growth of BBT, it is still more volatile than air travel. That volatility is amplified in single shops that might lose customers easily to competing shops round the corner. Secondly, current events is indicative of tail risk and not normal times.

The expiry date of milk is measured in weeks. The expiry date of fuel is about a year. Clearly there is no difference between a week and a year.

The analogy I used was a HDB flat, not a big home. A house is an essential good, just like a plane and the fuel it consumes. Just because you want to resort to hyperbole doesn't mean you should.

A big house analogy also works. If you have a family of 50 people helping pay the mortgage, you have all reason to believe that in 5 years, you would have a family of 50 people helping pay the mortgage. If you're entire family was murdered overnight and you can't pay back the mortgage, would it be your fault?

I cleary said to make advanced orders on milk, you are the one trying to obstufcate everything by bringing up milk OTCs as if it has to do with anything. Why can't you buy milk OTCs to hedge BTW? Why don't you just make a simple pre-order like SIA have done?

It is you who don't know what hedging means. You literally make a hedge with a pre-order, or a bet, or many other ways.

> The expiry date of milk is measured in weeks. The expiry date of fuel is about a year. Clearly there is no difference between a week and a year.

It's still a fucking pre-order. Find your needs appropriately and order accordingly. If an expiry is such a stumbling block excuse for you, you can change it to another business that doesn't deal with perishable goods. HDB pre-building houses 5 years before selling them perhaps.


> What sort of stupid argument is that? Are you seriously saying that different risk events cannot have different impacts. The impact of swine flu is different from on the probability/impact table as COVID. How dumb are you to not even comprehend that?

I guess you will never think you are ever wrong then.

Yes? Why buy put yourself in a risk of having such an apartment when you know you can't afford the downside? Either you move out and live on your own, or buy mortgage insurance for each of the 50 people. My argument is sound here.

> SINGAPORE - The first Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight staffed by pilots and cabin crew vaccinated against the coronavirus left Changi Airport on Thursday (Feb 11), marking a significant milestone for the battered national carrier.

> Flight SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am carrying a crew of 12, and is the first of three departing SIA Group flights with crew who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

> Scoot flight TR606 to Bangkok also left Changi at 9.30am with a set of 11 vaccinated crew members, while SilkAir's first vaccinated flight MI608 will leave for Phnom Penh at 4.30pm with a crew of eight.

> The crew members are among more than 52,000 personnel in the transport sector who have received their first dose of the vaccine as at Feb 10.

> The Ministry of Transport said more than 39,000 workers in the aviation and maritime sectors have gotten their first jab - over 90 per cent of the 43,000 front-liners in both sectors.

> More than 14,000 land transport workers have also received the first dose of the vaccine, with the remaining 66,000 scheduled to get their jabs in the coming months.

> In a statement, SIA Group, which has suffered billions in losses because of the ongoing pandemic, said it is among the first airlines in the world to operate flights with fully vaccinated crews.

> Noting that the Government has prioritised the aviation sector in the national drive to vaccinate Singaporeans and other long-term residents, SIA said this reflected the sector's importance and the national carrier's crucial role in Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against Covid-19.

> SIA chief executive Goh Choon Phong said: ""Vaccinations will be key to the reopening of borders and to enhancing travel confidence, in tandem with robust testing regimes and the wide-ranging safe management measures that are in place on the ground and in the air.""

> He added: ""They offer greater protection for our people and provide an added layer of assurance to our customers.""

> Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, who spoke to crew members operating SQ956 on Thursday morning, said the vaccination drive has been ""proceeding like clockwork"".

> He told reporters he is confident that a substantial number of workers from the aviation and maritime sectors will be fully vaccinated by the end of the month.

> Singapore's biggest vulnerability is its border, he said, given that the virus is under control here with very few community cases.

> ""If the border staff that come into contact with the outside world are all vaccinated, I think we would have really taken a very big step in securing our border and keeping Singaporeans safe,"" he added.

>

> 

> Passenger traffic at Changi Airport, which has been decimated by Covid-19, fell by 82.8 per cent last year.

> Front-line workers in the aviation and maritime sectors started getting jabs on Jan 13 as part of an operational trial, before the mass exercise began in earnest on Jan 18.

> Bus and train workers started getting jabs from Jan 25.

> SIA said its operating crew members have responded very positively to the exercise, with more than 90 per cent of cabin crew and pilots signing up for the vaccine to date.

> Its milestone comes days after a 41-year-old cabin crew member on a turnaround flight to the United Arab Emirates tested positive for the coronavirus.

> The Singaporean woman was the fifth person on the flight to test positive, with preliminary test results showing that all five had contracted the more infectious B117 strain of the virus.

> The air stewardess had departed Singapore for Dubai on Jan 30 and returned on Jan 31 without disembarking from the aircraft.

> She then received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Feb 2. She lost her sense of smell two days later but did not seek medical attention.

> Her case was eventually picked up during routine testing as required by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.

> The Health Ministry reiterated on Tuesday that it takes a few weeks for individuals to build up immunity against Covid-19 after completing vaccination, and it is possible to get infected just before or after inoculation.

> Other airlines have also begun vaccinating their crew.

> Mr Ong said last month that SIA could be the first vaccinated international airline of the world.

> On Wednesday, Etihad Airways staked its claim as the first airline in the world to have inoculated all its operating pilots and cabin crew.

> The United Arab Emirates airline said in a statement that more than three-quarters of its workforce have already received at least one dose of the vaccine.

Tried helping twice on the housework, get scowled for being ineffective.

I left the cooking chores to my sister, keeps sighing all over.

Every day conversations are about how they hated the PRCs for spreading the contagion, and how the ""infidels"" are all responsible for making the world a miserable place.

I need to concentrate on my work but I keep having second thoughts about the emotions of my sibling. When asked, she never responds.

I feel like I'm the asshole in this family. Never mind that my workplace requires me to be on my computer from 8 to 6 and sometimes spill over. Sometimes my work never gets done because I can't think of the solution in front of me due to insufficient skill set.

I don't sleep at times, trying to both relief myself from the boredom of work, and to escape the continuing scowling from my family members. Aged parent complained that I never talk to them, considering I'm being courteous by not saying anything contrarian.

I hold left liberal views, a despised position in my family. They say that kind of political thinking is akin to apostasy, and those who hold such beliefs mirror their asshole relatives: they kept hounded our family for many decades over their insistence to keep my dad as a guarantor for their ill-spent home loan; and the fact that my late mother was the primary target for putting house chores on top of her when she's pregnant with my sibling.

I feel like I am damned if I do, damned if I don't. I keep thinking negative thoughts because people are angry over my (in)actions. Many times I thought people want to see me go away and not be in their sights.

So I tried self-harm thrice in my lifetime. The last one got me into a psychiatric ward after prodding by my friend.

I feel like doing it again.

I don't like their continuous stream of racist, bigoted statements, but claimed they are ""humbler than many people"", I certainly don't like conservative thoughts because the outcomes became this. I certainly held a belief, naively, that people should be better versions of themselves, and I want to continue holding onto that belief.

Because otherwise, I might as well not marry.

There have been many hints that I will need to find a new home for myself. I have saved up considerably that I can probably pay off this Airbnb rent (until we get a temporary HDB home here some time in the near future), and to hush up ideas about my ""leeching off and not doing my part to the family."" Maybe me, living 300 kilometres away from my family to escape the dinner table conversations and miserable take on other human beings for the past decade, could have been good indicators that I can never gel well with this family of mine.

I can only say that I intend to move out from my sibling's HDB home and get myself a rent. Dad wants to keep the family intact, but I can't go out and find myself a date if I keep having thoughts that my choices will never be accepted by my family regardless.

I don't know if I should seek psychiatric treatment. The time for me to get a referral from my hospital in KL has long gone. I certainly don't want my family to know I need psychiatric help lest they cursed me for ""not believing enough"".

Honestly speaking, the vision of myself at the moment is only me being in this long, dark tunnel of misery, the walls are slimy with the degeneracy of people's thoughts, and an unseen, unknown terror behind me.

I kept silent about my thoughts from my family. My dad complains to my sibling that I don't talk enough to him. I just want to keep the peace, however untenable or uneasy this peace is.

At least the busking sessions, the random Spanish flamenco dance videos and Russian dramas on YouTube kept him entertained. Merdeka generation folk tend to harp about the simpler life in the past. I can't be empathetic about a past I don't know about.

Anyway, we're migrants from a shattered ideal of living in a place of lower costs of living. It turned out the people who run that country are as shitty as the country they came from.

My mind is definitely all over the place. Like I said, I need a place to rant and vent. My traditional social network accounts have been compromised and they are reading my posts so no go.",2020-05-28 23:41:48,762

Can't really blame them owing to the situation itself but there are a lot of inconsistencies in term of rules, measures, regulations. For example, classification of what is 'essential'. Apparently, they think haircuts is more important than renovation. You cannot don't have haircuts for 2-3 months but it's fine not to have your home renovated in 2-3 months. You can stay wherever you are now for all I care, despite incurring endless cost and inconvenience with no certainty when the end will be in sight.

You can crowd around in the trains, at transport hubs, bus stop with no 'safe distancing', heck, they even remove safe distancing decals in the trains. However, 3-4 workers renovating a flat with ample space between them is not allowed. Such inconsistency and ironically, these same renovation workers, who can't work, can freely go about their activities in the community such as buying food, haircuts, and for all we know, they may even taking up food delivery jobs and meeting many different people on daily basis. Just the other day, a property agent delivered food to me and shared that many in renovation and property lines have taken up food delivery jobs.

Now news are aplenty on closing of F&B restaurants. They simply can't sustain their business even with govt's help. Because no matter what, there is no revenue but fixed cost like overhead, rental, utilities still exist. Only a handful who can rely on delivery business can tough it out and even then, if the economy remain shut, they may not last long too.

In view of the low fatality rate, I think we can take greater risk and open the economy fast. Make wearing mask a habit everywhere we go. We should also do our part and download TraceTogether. Come on, the fatality rate is so low and only concentrate on certain vulnerable groups \[separate measures must be in place to protect them\], if unlucky to contract covid, as long as it is detected early, a normal patient should recover within 2-4 weeks. Meanwhile, if we have been playing our part by conforming to SafeEntry, TraceTogether etc, all the contacts can be traced easily and test for covid too and treat accordingly in positive.

Even though a lot of work can be done at home, I think WFH model is more suitable to people engaged in gig economy such as self employed in areas such as social influencers, equity tradings, forex speculators, resellers who buy clothes/books/furnitures etc from suppliers and sell it to you etc. Those who are employed by companies in whatever capacity, it is best to have physical meetings, interactions and even a meal together with bosses, colleagues and subordinates alike.  

People who pro lockdown, I think, are those not affected too much by it. Usually these are rich people who have ways and means to access whatever money that is left circulating in the system. For example they may be able to gain some of the money released by Fed Res through trading the US equity markets. They may be civil servants whose job security is not a concern, relatively to those people employed by businesses. 

Nobody and certainly the economy cannot function in isolation. No economy activity is as good as no revenue for many businesses. No revenue mean zero activity to circulate the money for everyone, no pay, no rental, no fee, no purchases, no deliveries, no production, no sale, no orders. Simply put, if the lockdown continues, only certain activities can continue owing to the fact that these activities are supported by govt \[reserves\]. Such as civil servant jobs, essential services paid by govt and even such activities will come to a halt if economy remain closed. As it is, the govt is propping everyone up with the various schemes at the expense of our reserves. How long can this last? Do we really have bottomless reserves? Once our reserves are weaken, we are susceptible to currency attacks. I hope the govt did not forget AFC. I think we have come to a point to seriously consider whether the prolonged lockdown is the way going forward. It is a difficult call, whether we save live in the short term with blanket lockdown or target to help the vulnerable groups with some focus measures so that majority can move forward or risking everyone to suffer with the collapsing economy?",2020-06-11 11:15:05,388

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/is-there-more-than-one-strain-of-the-new-coronavirus

Prof. David Robertson, head of Viral Genomics and Bioinformatics at the Centre for Virus Research, was part of the team. MNT asked his views on the possibility of there being more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2.
“Until there is some evidence of a change in virus biology, we cannot say that there are new strains of the virus. It’s important to appreciate that mutations are a normal byproduct of virus replication and that most mutations we observe won’t have any impact on virus biology or function,” he said.

971,723,r/Singapore April COVID-19 and Circuit Breaker Discussion,2020-04-05 12:46:55,"I think the government is placing too much faith in Singaporeans (myself included) to stay at home (except for essential errands) without strict enforcement or legal consequences. I feel like we didn't really cut our social interactions by much when it was DOSCON Orange (especially the later part, before Circuit Breaker was announced), and so even though we entered DOSCON CircuitBreaker I think there will still be people who don't feel the need to stay home and would go visit their friends instead when they get bored.

Given that the government doesn't seem to want to strictly enforce currently, a possible solution (indirect/soft approach) to deter non-essential transit could be to temporarily raise prices of public transport for those who are traveling a lot for non-essential reasons (reaching a certain number of trips in a week moves you to a higher price tier for that week), and have 2-3 tiers (normal unraised, slightly raised and greatly raised price), while giving concession passes or rebates to the essential workers etc. So for non-essential commuters, the first X trips in a week is at the lowest price tier, while the middle price tier will kick in when you travel more than X trips in that week, and then subsequently (if there are 3 tiers) after traveling more than Y trips in that week the highest price tier will kick in. However, this is only effective in the ideal scenario, where no one abuses the loophole of taking another family member's ezlink to bypass the raised prices. But since the loophole exists and is likely to be abused, the price tiers should start with the slightly raised price to begin with as the lowest tier, or the slightly raised price should kick in early maybe 2 trips in a week.

Also, the government should track the transit numbers and make a statement if number of transit trips are too numerous compared to the expected numbers, and are not following the spirit of the CircuitBreaker measures.

[12 Apr: Singapore’s first lady responds to Taiwan's mask donation with 'Errrr'](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/)

Back story: [Taiwan banned the export of masks in January 2020. ST Engineering had 2 mask producing lines in Taiwan. The masks ST Eng produced were banned from export. ST Eng moved their machinery back, which was allowed.](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx) (This is based on Google Translate of the article.)

It appears that the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban have not been requisitioned by the Taiwanese government but are not allowed to be exported i.e. the masks are stuck in Taiwan. No indication whether Taiwan is charging ST Eng storage fees for keeping their masks.

[Based on 2016-2017 statistics (would welcome more recent statistics), Taiwan appears to be the third largest mask producer worldwide.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/856804/share-of-global-sheet-face-masks-producers-by-leading-country/)

Taiwan announced this weekend that they are donating masks to Singapore. [These are surgical masks, which are lower quality from the N95 ones that ST Eng produced.](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/fn71x2f/) There does not appear to be an update on whether the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban can be exported to Singapore yet.

Ho Ching shared the news article on Facebook and said ""Errrr"", and causing 4 posts on r/singapore about one word. 

Comments: 

* I've read that the ban was to stop masks from being exported to China especially since there was a shortage of masks in Taiwan - it appears that as ST Eng ""[is not a domestic manufacturer and is not within the scope of the Ministry of Economics requisition](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx)"" - so foreign manufacturers already had different rules from the start. It's not clear why Taiwan didn't extend this to us.

* Should Ho Ching have said anything? She's wearing three hats in this scenario (1) wife of PM Lee (2) CEO of Temasek, who is the majority shareholder of ST Engineering (3) Singaporean ~aunty~ citizen. On one hand, this has brought up claims that Singapore is ungrateful ([though this might be](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn6uci8/) [sensationalised by Taiwanese media](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzot0k/singapore_to_shift_2_of_its_mask_production_line/fn5w0vc/)) and that she is unprofessional (or even the next [Elon Musk](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn688g2/)). On the other hand - this provides some counter-balance / depth to the backstory of what Taiwan has done: [if not for her post, would we even be aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn66406/)?

* I do wonder if Taiwan's actions influenced Singapore's mask policy in Feb - if we had stable supply lines, [would the government have suggested that everyone mask up earlier?](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn7963h/) The mask policy was only announced *after* we had reusable masks available. 

* This reinforces that no one owes Singapore a living. Taiwan had no hesitation stopping ST Eng's masks from export when Taiwan needed to. (To be clear: not commenting on whether Taiwan's actions are justified.)",2020-04-13 12:09:39,519

[12 Apr: Singapore’s first lady responds to Taiwan's mask donation with 'Errrr'](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/)

Back story: [Taiwan banned the export of masks in January 2020. ST Engineering had 2 mask producing lines in Taiwan. The masks ST Eng produced were banned from export. ST Eng moved their machinery back, which was allowed.](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx) (This is based on Google Translate of the article.)

It appears that the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban have not been requisitioned by the Taiwanese government but are not allowed to be exported i.e. the masks are stuck in Taiwan. No indication whether Taiwan is charging ST Eng storage fees for keeping their masks.

[Based on 2016-2017 statistics (would welcome more recent statistics), Taiwan appears to be the third largest mask producer worldwide.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/856804/share-of-global-sheet-face-masks-producers-by-leading-country/)

Taiwan announced this weekend that they are donating masks to Singapore. [These are surgical masks, which are lower quality from the N95 ones that ST Eng produced.](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/fn71x2f/) (note: need to google for a fuller source.) There does not appear to be an update on whether the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban can be exported to Singapore yet.

Ho Ching shared the news article on Facebook and said ""Errrr"", and causing 4 posts on r/singapore about one word. 

Comments: 

* I've read that the ban was to stop masks from being exported to China especially since there was a shortage of masks in Taiwan - it appears that as ST Eng ""[is not a domestic manufacturer and is not within the scope of the Ministry of Economics requisition](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx)"" - so foreign manufacturers already had different rules from the start. It's not clear why Taiwan didn't extend this to us.

* Should Ho Ching have said anything? She's wearing three hats in this scenario (1) wife of PM Lee (2) CEO of Temasek, who is the majority shareholder of ST Engineering (3) Singaporean ~aunty~ citizen. On one hand, this has brought up claims that Singapore is ungrateful ([though this might be](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn6uci8/) [sensationalised by Taiwanese media](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzot0k/singapore_to_shift_2_of_its_mask_production_line/fn5w0vc/)) and that she is unprofessional (or even the next [Elon Musk](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn688g2/)). On the other hand - this provides some counter-balance / depth to the backstory of what Taiwan has done: [if not for her post, would we even be aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn66406/)?

* I do wonder if Taiwan's actions influenced Singapore's mask policy in Feb - if we had stable supply lines, [would the government have suggested that everyone mask up earlier?](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn7963h/) The mask policy was only announced *after* we had reusable masks available. 

* This reinforces that no one owes Singapore a living. Taiwan had no hesitation stopping ST Eng's masks from export when Taiwan needed to. (To be clear: it is for the reader to argue whether this is justified.)",2020-04-13 11:09:47,532

We are worried that dialect-speaking seniors in Singapore may not be able to comprehend why there are lesser people on the streets or why the majority of shops are closed. To keep them informed of the heightened measures as shared by PM Lee's speech on 3rd April 2020, we have created a COVID-19 video in Singapore Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese. Would it be possible for you to add these links to your list, so that more people can help to share these videos to our seniors? Thank you so much! 😄🙏

As the other commenters said, it'll be best to wait for any announcements and just check with your supervisor one more time.

If you live separately then don’t shuttle back and forth between households potentially exposing both households to the virus. Either choose to move in entirely for the month or don’t see each other for the month.

Mustafa Centre was also alarming before it decided to temporarily close. 28 infected cases just 4 days after being named a cluster.

Wuhan's draconian lockout lasted 2 months. Malaysia's looser MCO is likely to be extended again (beyond one month) since it's not flattening the Covid-19 curve enough. Our measures are more lenient than theirs, so it's unrealistic that we get to end early.

I read that Malaysia is exploring partial lifting of restrictions so as to save their economy. It makes sense that we do the same, say, after 6-8 weeks from now.

They will not abandon contact tracing unless it's no longer an effective strategy in containing the spread. It's not that when you stop contact tracing, that the situation goes to shit. It's that when the situation goes to shit (too many unlinked cases, which indicates widespread community transmission) that you stop contact tracing because too many potential undetected cases are amongst us that will continue the transmission faster than we can catch them.

A single day's numbers does not mean much without taking into context other factors:

1. **The persistence of the increase in numbers.**   
For example today we had 100+ cases right? If next 7 days we got 0-30 cases, then it's not widespread community transmission (WCT). The average numbers over a period of time is what they use to determine. If not then you declare WCT every day that you get 100+ cases, then when numbers drop then you take back your words?
2. **The number of truly unlinked cases** (ie. totally unlinked after endless amount of tracing. Not just looking at the initial reported number of unlinked cases for each day)   
If you have 100+ cases, but most if not all of them are shown to be from existing clusters **eventually** (for example all are foreign workers from dorms of existing clusters), then it's not WCT.

So the situation must fulfill the criteria, persistent (sustained over time) increase in numbers and especially in number of truly unlinked cases, to be considered widespread community transmission.

And I do agree with you that the numbers are worrying, no doubt. But it's not an apples to apples comparison to Italy, because our contact tracing efforts are way more intensive and started early and had success in containment (thanks to us being a small country), so 100+ detected cases in Italy could have been just among significantly more undetected cases compared to us.

I didn't follow Italy's news fully, but if their response measures were made much later than at the moment they had 100+ daily cases, then it's definitely different from our case, because we already have our measures decided and ready to go now as the govt predicted that this will happen.

For me it's because there is no strong message due to the lack of penalties being announced. Perhaps the gov didn't want panic, perhaps they really have faith in us following rules. Whatever the case is, I feel the lack of penalties being shoved in our faces will be interpreted by some that it's not that serious yet. That's why I'm suggesting other possible solutions that could deter people from moving around excessively (given that the gov is currently focused on using a less heavy-handed approach for now)

These may additionally include those who do not have family, are isolated in their tiny flat- which they inch closer to not being able to afford the expenses of as each day of the control order (""Circuit Breaker"") goes by.

So these people deal with more stress and anxiety every passing day as we speak.

But my biggest concern regarding this control order is actually a specific group of people; those suffering from mental illnesses. 

A large number of these people may seem like they're simply experiencing ""cabin fever"" at first glance but the reality is that they simply cannot be left alone physically for such a period of time. Their condition may prevent them from being able to perform their daily/essential tasks without assistance, likely causing significant detriment to their well-being.

Yes, the act allows a few exceptions that could apply here; such as in the event of an emergency. But, is preventing mental detriment an emergency? Or do we have to wait until they have a nervous breakdown (mental collapse) for their situation to be considered an emergency?
The act also allows visitation to care for the mentally disabled. Again, you now have to define who IS mentally disabled? Do you need a cognitive disorder? Does severe depression causing the above symptoms count as disabled?

Who can answer this? MOH. Will they? With the track record of Singapore and mental healthcare, especially with the removal of psychiatric services from the list of essential services, I doubt it.

For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April. We converted places like [exhibition halls](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-more-than-18-000-bed-spaces-for-isolation-and-care-12683558) (Expo/ Changi Exhibition Centre) and army camps to cater to such needs.

Based on Covid-19's experience, we could expect new waves of it, or possibility of new diseases that might be equally or more contagious in the future (/slap wood). 

Thus, I was thinking that SG should consider building a fixed number of ""quarantine facilities"" in every town, like playgrounds/ parks etc in future towns (or added on to existing towns). It is similar to the idea of disaster shelters. Of course, in unused times, they could be used for other purposes, like those [shelters](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/home/civil-defence-shelter/types-of-shelter) in void decks.

Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

Been a bit sceptical about the decisions and statements by the joint ministerial committee - I don't agree with the partial lifting of controls when our numbers are still high, not convinced by the division of cases between FW-indorm , FW-outside dorm and Citizen/PR etc. But all these were opinions and I never had something objective to bring to the table. Until I came across this article about the testing rate in Singapore.

[Singapore has done over 143,000 Covid-19 tests](https://www.businessinsider.sg/singapore-has-done-over-143000-covid-19-tests-and-it-plans-to-increase-testing-capability-from-8000-to-40000-a-day), which reports:

>On Monday (May 4), Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong was reported by The Straits Times (ST) as saying that plans are underway to increase the nation’s testing capability from the current 8,000 a day to [40,000 a day](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/live-coverage-ministerial-statements-on-covid-19-situation-in-singapore) by late 2020.  
>  
>Singapore already has some of the highest testing rates in the world, he added.

I was able to find [some data](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) on testing rates around the world. err even if we account for incomplete data and anomalies like really small territories, Singapore ranks 37th out of 212 in tests per million as of today -0 less than Germany, Spain, Denmark, the UAE and Australia. But above HK, UK and US. (The data is apparently used by the Johns Hopkins CSSE and various govts so seems pretty trustworthy.)

Personally, I think Gan Kim Yong's statement makes it sound quite good when it's not that amazing. BUt I know I might be biased. Do you guys think 37th in the world, 8th in Asia can be considered ""some of the highest testing rates""?

1625,1498,r/Singapore April COVID-19 and Circuit Breaker Discussion Vol IV,2020-04-29 21:40:11,"> For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April.

I think this is a global issue, not unique to Singapore, though I'd say it's a problem too. Wuhan had that two massive temporary hospitals. UK has NHS Nightingale (their equivalent of ""Expo hospital""). The world realised we are woefully unprepared/underprepared for a contagious pandemic.

> Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

The shelters thing might sound good, but even with a centralised location, we seem to have a manpower crunch in Expo (as seen by the article of a person who got sent there). What more if we start to decentralize quarantine facilities, you need to duplicate the manpower across Singapore and monitor more staff for unwanted spread (e.g. what if Kallang's quarantine center has an outbreak within their staff?). The more places you have, the more likely you could ""screw up"" the handling and accidentally spread it somewhere else.

I'd say that having Expo/Suntec/whatever equipped to be converted to quarantine facilities in a day/two should be our goal. Make it so that the fixed facilities/infrastructure (e.g. HVAC) is rated for quarantine use. I believe MOH has done this with things like the Community Quarantine Facilities (which is why quarantine was set up super fast).",2020-05-17 17:16:23,263

One thing that I find is a silver lining in all these, is that the government has finally recognized the importance of mental health, and places the official hotlines and resources quite prominently in their messaging. I work in an industry where it's not civil service but on the periphery, and I can see that the government messaging is taken seriously and my managers are all imploring us to take wfh seriously but at the same time lightly, take care of our own needs, use available resources if we feel our mental health is suffering. 

I'm not sure how many of the isolated migrant workers have access to a counsellor or therapist, but I'd place that as quite a high priority to address after their lodging, food, healthcare and other basic logistics are settled. Anyone has any information if such resources are provided for them? They are particularly vulnerable if they can't speak english and thus tap onto official government resources so I think it's a valid concern. 

Beyond that, I feel that allowing interaction is super important, for people who don't live within the same household. Beyond the immediate family situation that is addressed by phase 1, one thing that could have helped is for dating couples to be allowed to visit each other. The risk is marginal; the spread will be within 2 households even if theres a positive contact, the contact is easily traced (tracetogether, or log the visit to a special portal etc). With data analytics it's not impossible to quickly capture the source/destination, spatial and time dimension and mitigate the risk of an untraceable outbreak because the virus spread between households like STDs in a college campus.",2020-05-20 11:57:46,302

Hi all. Throwaway for personal reasons. Some back story is, I took leave of absence in 2019 for the entire year of 2020 (tldr: not doing well in school, want to switch fields so decided to take year off to work in another unrelated field) in order to work and get some experience while trying to improve my mental health.

So what happened was, managed to get several offers amongst several applications, but chose a reputable one because it will help my resume greatly. But the downside was said company needed me to 'intern' for a few months since I had no prior proper professional experience. So I said OK. It was supposed to be only till end of Feb. And then I will receive a more permanent contract.

Then covid happened. Some projects were halted, office decided to close and work from home. It became way more unstable. Boss told me he can't promise the offer anymore, but would like me to stay indefinitely and at first opportunity, I can and will be contracted. 

I stayed because I didn't have anywhere else to go, and I really liked the culture and the people there. They really treat me well over there. But alas, fast forward to today, he broke the news to me that I sadly have to go. It wasn't because of job performance, I wasn't the first to go, there were a few full time staff that were let go last month. Didn't expect myself to be asked to leave too, since just a week ago I was involved in a huge project. But it's out of my hands. 

My question is, given my circumstances, am I eligible to apply for the several government grants due to the loss of this internship? Im still on leave of absence from NTU to end of year. The allowance was already very low before being asked to leave. and I'm just in a funk right now. Uncertain about the future. I have also bills to pay and some liabilities on hand like my school tuition fees.

Would appreciate some word of advice from those who can relate or are going through the same thing. I'm in my mid-20s.",2020-04-29 19:43:43,374

Yes, It seems like you are both eligible to apply for temporany relief fund (TRF as criteria is that you lost job opportunities due to COVIS-19) . Go to your nearest social service office to apply. Bring along yourt NRIC, payslip, (remember your singpass password to check CPF in the pressence of Social service officer if necessary), utilies bills (if you are paying for them), and other relevant documents.  Note that you will be interviewed by social service officer and you need to sign declaration forms. (Alloate at least 15 mins if you are served immediately and no crowds)

Rather than try to stop it, maybe the government could try for herd immunity at this stage.

> SINGAPORE: With a falling number of community cases, Singapore is in a position to start the gradual easing of ""circuit breaker"" measures, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force announced on Saturday (May 2).

> Speaking at a virtual press conference, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong noted that with stricter circuit breaker measures in place for about two weeks, the number of new cases in the community has been on the decline.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He said that some businesses will resume operations from May 12, with a gradual resumption of selected activities and services over a few weeks.

> Home-based businesses, selected food retail outlets, and food manufacturing firms will be among those that will be able to resume operations from May 12, co-chair of the task force Minister Lawrence Wong said at the press conference.

> Mr Wong added the authorities will start to bring back students in small groups or face to face lessons in May, focusing on cohorts who are taking national exams and are graduating.

> “It’s a small group, and we will do it with safe-distancing measures,” he said.

> In the meantime, registered Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners will be able to resume their acupuncture services and retail services on May 5. This was based on a comprehensive review, Mr Gan said.

> However, Mr Gan cautioned that “we are not out of the woods yet"".

> “New clusters can form if we let our guards down. We must press on with our efforts, so that we continue to keep the numbers low,” he said.

> The rest of the circuit breaker measures continue to be crucial, and will remain in force till Jun 1, he added.

> The Government will be able to further roll back some of the circuit breaker measures if the situation is “clearly under control” till Jun 1, he added.

> “Even then, it will be a new normal we all have to adapt to,” he said.

> 

> Singapore's economy will open up ""step by step"" when the number of COVID-19 cases in the community falls, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Thursday in his May Day message.

> Singapore is into its fourth week of a ""circuit breaker"" period to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. Safe distancing measures have been tightened and the circuit breaker extended by another four weeks to Jun 1.

Contact tracing activities are still being performed for the unlinked cases but they eventually get traced back to someone eventually, so I’ll leave them out for the purpose of this discussion.

The imported cases are self explanatory. Those infected through family contacts are understandable and expected. But those infected through their other contacts shows that safe distancing measures and, perhaps, personal hygiene maintenance are not being strictly observed. This is why we see an almost daily update to the mitigation measures implemented. People are not getting it!

Scrolling though social media you’d find that the odd small gatherings are still happening. And their rationale would be that these are the only people they see. But that is not how it works. We are not in a lockdown; work continues, schools are still running, people are out and about; essentially life continues.

> SINGAPORE: There is no “magic solution” to the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore, and a series of brakes are needed to handle the situation, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Mar 31).

> When asked at a press conference why Singapore has not been locked down, Mr Wong said: “There is a view, I think, that people sometimes say, ‘why don’t you just … don’t have to wait, just go for the drastic measures now, go for the so-called lockdown today, do it for two weeks then life can go back to normal’.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> “There is no such magic solution as (a) two-week lockdown and then we are free from the virus. It will not happen.”

> Several countries have heavily restricted people’s movement, including Malaysia and Indonesia, while parts of Europe have declared lockdowns.

> Advertisement

> Singapore could put in more “drastic measures” sooner, but the minister said that would not “eradicate the virus”.

> “It will still be with us, and we will still have to continue with this set of measures – like what we are today – for maybe months,” explained Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministerial task force looking at the COVID-19 situation.

> “We are in this for the long haul. We have to prepared that we have to deal with this situation for quite a long period of time.”

> Singapore will be “exposed continuously to recurring waves of infection from around the world” and local transmission within the country that will continue.

> “(It) is not just one month, two months, but potentially all the way until the end of the year and beyond,” Mr Wong said.

> 

> “So, we have to find measures that can control, slow down the virus and do so in a way that is sustainable – not just for two weeks, two months, but all the way through to the end of the year.”

> Singapore has announced several measures, including safe-distancing and stay-home notices for all travellers, among others.

> 

> On Tuesday, Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo said that regulations will be amended to ensure that employers are doing all they can to encourage workers to telecommute, rather than come into the office.

> Mr Wong said that “extra brakes” can be put in if the situation warranted it.

> 

> When asked if there was a ""trigger point"" for when a lockdown might be implemented, Mr Wong said the measures are a ""series of brakes which you can put in place"".

> ""Rather than use a phrase which means different things to different people - because people have different interpretations of what a lockdown means - we look at the measures specifically and what these measures imply,"" the minister added.

> The task force has set out baseline measures that will continue for sustained periods, and ""extra brakes"" on top of those measures.

> Singapore has enforced ""moderate brakes"", such as preventing large-scale gathering and safe-distancing measures.

> ""We will not see the benefits of these measures until one or two weeks later, so it's a bit too early to say the measures are not working,"" he said.

> ""Whatever cases we are seeing now ... symptoms came a week ago. You have to look forward and look at the data (that) we will continue to monitor and look at what happens to the trends of local cases, unlinked cases over the next one, two weeks.

> 

> Depending on the indicators, the task force could apply ""extra brakes"".

> ""There is no magic two-week solution to this. These brakes have to be applied for a sustained period. If the situation improves, we remove some brakes. But even as we remove these brakes, we will not go back to zero.

> ""We will still need a set of precautions - could be baseline, could be more than baseline - but if the situation does not improve, then we apply extra brakes.""

> He said this ""posture"" of apply and removing brakes will go on until at least the end of the year.

It is important to remember that we are in it for the long haul, as our ministers have said many times. Honestly, our rate of increase in local cases has been staying rather constant the past few days and that's a pretty good sign.

Most of the other countries that initiated a lockdown knew the situation was spiralling out of control and they had little choice but to sacrifice the economy to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. I think part of it is also because China's an authoritarian state so that was easy to mandate, and it worked for them, so other countries follow it too.

We are not listening to the Authorities at all...

I feel that in Singapore, we require Authorities to police the streets issuing fines to anybody who doesn't comply.

Just like the PMD situation.

Went out for a jog and decided to go thru the park thinking it will be empty. What I saw was a bunch of people mingling around, all without mask.

Why punish the people who legitimately are exercising or buying groceries or tapauing food because they can’t afford to have food delivered daily? Why threaten to take away privileges?

We are so used to this as Singaporeans, with schools and the army drilling in this notion that we need to punish everyone to get the few bad seeds to cooperate. In this CB situation, the bad seeds are likely far out of the influence of those abiding by the rules, unlike say a classmate in school or a bunkmate. I can’t very well scream at random kids or uncles gathering in the park can I? 

I say for situations like these you need to precisely catch and punish the few who do break the rules more harshly. Safe Distancing Ambassadors are in an unfortunate spot here, but it kinda IS their responsibility for now. I don’t envy them. But leave the obedient folks alone. It’s stressful enough being cooped up at home most of the time.

It’s echoed worldwide, and is as common as it is sensible. You know what would be unpopular? The possibility that isolation and lockdowns turn out to be temporary solutions; that the virus flares up once restrictions are eased. When we come to that, some uncomfortable questions need to be asked. What is the nominal value of avoiding casualties? Its not actual cash, obviously, but an accounting measure that helps us weigh different things like our jobs, the economy, our values, the value of lives, etc.

A year-long lockdown/free-to-roam on/off cycle with consumers stuck at home half the time would obviously hurt GDP. But more than that it would’ve taken its toll on our mental health as we endure months upon months at home. Investments would be postponed further and innovation and productivity stall; the cranking of the economic engine to get back to normalcy would be more strenuous.

Yes, when a team of young footballers are stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand, the world comes together to demonstrate the strength of the human spirit, of our shared values, with no consideration of cost - as it should be, and that’s good. But during wartime or crises, tough questions have to be asked, and responsible leaders will have to find a way to weigh the costs against the benefits.

As much as I am loathe to say it - when the Orange Man in the US suggested that the “cure mustn’t be worse than the virus” - he does have a valid point, however unpopular it may be. And I say these having just recovered from bronchitis a year earlier - not sure if that qualifies as a pre-existing condition.

Point is, we may have to recognise that the costs of distancing might just outweigh the benefits.

I'd like to challenge that previous advisories were not a mistake, merely that different scenarios require different measures. 

Take the mask wearing for example. Why now everyone have to wear? Because we are missing a lot of links and we suspect there are hidden cases still in the community (not in isolation). Hence now it makes sense to have everyone wear because now we want to assume everyone is potentially a carrier and hence you should wear masks to protect OTHER PEOPLE AROUND YOU. 

Its almost as if we can only have one right measure and the right measure is right at all points in time.

“I wore my mask and I stayed at home during CB... how have I broken the law or rules by queuing up for bubble tea?” I guess we’re clever enough to identify loopholes and follow mandatory regulations, but less wise in practising the overall principle. 

If there was a strong cause for concern, civilians would have, by their own initiative, stayed away from crowds or unnecessary gatherings. And it’s all about whether the individual wants to do so.

2121,378,How effective would Singapore have managed the coronavirus without CB and mandatory mask wearing?,2020-12-20 23:44:41,"Initially I thought CB was not necessary as community cases were considered under control and at that time, the cases in the dorms have not exploded. Announcement was on 3 Apr, CB on 7 Apr, 229 dorm cases on 9 Apr ([Source - the ""Number of Cases"" tab](https://covidsitrep.moh.gov.sg/)). I would imagine if the CB had been implemented a few days later - I think there will be real fear.

With hindsight, we probably will end up like KR and JP now at best, as fatigue sets in.

I also did not fully appreciate the fact that the CB was really necessary to buy time for the authorities to ramp up hospital, community care, isolation, testing, contact tracing & basically everything else that has their supply chain messed up. I think the difference between Singapore and many other countries is that Singapore really took this very seriously and we now see that we are able to have all the necessary tools to deploy at request.

Another difference between Singapore CB and the lockdown in other countries is that we did it way before it went out of control & healthcare systems at the brink of collapse. So how we choose to exit it may be slow, but so far it seems to be effective. Those that hastily exited lockdowns have been burned e.g. IL & AU.

I'm an American living in a major metro area. I've been watching mainly Vietnam during the pandemic, as well as other countries, to compare how it's going in my situation vs. elsewhere. It's pretty clear to me that enforcement of risk mitigation protocols is necessary, and at the population level it's impossible to expect everyone to cooperate and comply. There will always be people who break the rules. The only exception I know of is Japan, where COVID rules are just suggestions and there's no legal enforcement. They're the only society where this could work, as their culture is uniquely equipped to handle this. 

In my situation, and for the vast majority of Americans, COVID doesn't affect them directly. I am indirectly, negatively affected because I stay informed of the unfavorable statistics, death rate, hospitalizations, etc, as well as the socio and political friction that the pandemic has caused in my country and globally. 

Compare this to Singapore, where COVID statistics are much more favorable, but COVID rules are enforced, and lockdowns were mandatory and enforced. I wonder how it feels to be in Singapore during COVID compared to how it feels in America. Isn't life pretty much normal for you guys right now? Small social gatherings, mostly OK and fine? 

In America, if you don't pay attention to the news, and don't care about COVID statistics, don't have concern about the minority of people ( who are old/obese/other comorbidities) who are getting hospitalized, then I imagine life's pretty easy and peachy. There's no real restrictions on anything, and most businesses are open to some capacity. But it does seem like people are voluntarily isolating much more than before. And masks aren't exactly enforced, but the vast majority of places have a requirement, and people voluntarily wear them with pretty decent compliance. Obviously America is a very large place, so YMMV on this judgement. This is based on my major metropolitan area and friends who live in other large metropolitan areas.",2020-12-21 14:16:35,336

2150,407,How effective would Singapore have managed the coronavirus without CB and mandatory mask wearing?,2020-12-20 23:44:41,"Before I answer the question, I will say a few things.

First off, by asking people to consider a different statistic, there is a slight chance that you are implying that the American authorities, the American media and health experts in America are involved in a conspiracy to lie to the American public. Especially when the LA Times are tracking admitted and confirmed cases, suspected cases in hospitals, and even the health infrastructure of LA county. These numbers are pulled both from the LA County's Department of Public Health, which is a part of the wider monitoring network of California's Department of Public Health. Included in the graphs is this disclaimer:

> Number of daily cases will not match the number of newly reported Los Angeles County cases as episode date reflects date of underlying illness rather than date of report.

The implication of this is that the LA County's numbers will lag behind the LA Times' number.

Secondly, and most importantly, had you bothered to explain yourself as to why we should consider your statistic rather than seemingly dismiss the explanations outright, you'd be met with far less hostility and you'd come off as less of a douchebag. Especially when you start with

> Lol. Quick to press the downvote button I see.

rather than your explanation. So don't be surprised when someone tries to call you out on your bullshit.

It gets way, way worse when you accuse me of ""grasping at straws"".

Don't want to be treated like an ass? Stop acting like one.

And now, the answer is, **no, considering we couldn't even accurately test how many migrant workers had the disease.** And especially when you said. 

>You assume that the proportion of cases detected in tests is not far off from the actual cases in the population. This has repeatedly been said to be unlikely by the experts over there.

And this can be corroborated with the fact that we could not get an accurate number of foreign workers infected with COVID-19.",2020-12-21 03:27:55,327

Well, in that case, happy to act like an ass in your definition. And continue with your strawplay if that makes you happy.

Fact of the matter is, I never said nor implied that the reported positive test results were fake/cooked up or anything like that. You are the one who suddenly jumped in like a douchebag, and came up with this half-assed and irrelevant question on whether I was saying that the Californian media/authorities were lying. It is as good as me suddenly asking you to answer some question on whether you prefer rice or pasta.

I used to go out a lot, and I really enjoy meeting new people, having people around me, and feeling that sense of togetherness by just being in a crowd. Right now, I'm cooped up in my house, and I'm not loving it. I want to do my part, stay in, and follow all protocol until it's acceptable to socialize again, but until then, I'm just working, watching TV, and playing videogames. I live with my partner, so it's not lonely, so I shouldn't be complaining too much, but I really, really, REALLY miss hanging out with people, friends or strangers. I'm also quite garrulous by nature, and my partner has limits to her patience lol

Zoom calls only go so far, and it's hard to read the room. It's not working for me as much as everyone says it does. I still press on, and be part of these calls, and try to get what I can out of personal contact.

I'm a subscriber on the /r/pilates subreddit and when this covid thing first started breaking out internationally, there were people who made free videos to offer some form of guidance for the community that was suddenly cut off from regular classes. This marketed their expertise and allowed an audience that was no longer able to attend classes physically to seek out new ways to continue training.   
From what i've seen, some of this translated into users who went on to pay for online classes. Perhaps he can consider doing the same via whatever social media he is more comfortable with.

Agree it's not any less real but the good thing is since it's a mental construct we can choose to reframe it in a way that is beneficial to us

> SINGAPORE - Singapore's circuit breaker will formally end on June 1, the Multi-Ministry Task Force on the Covid-19 outbreak announced on Tuesday (May 19), saying the economy would then be reopened gradually in three phases.

> At a virtual press conference, the task force outlined the broad plan to transition Singapore in phases out of its period of stringent measures eventually into a new normal that will be remain until an effective vaccine or treatment for Covid-19 is developed. But the ministers stressed that reopening plans were not a return to life before Covid-19.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong also noted that phases could be rolled back should the outbreak flare up again. He also said that a rise in number of cases is likely as Singapore reopens.

> ""As we being to resume more activities, we do expect to see a rise in daily cases... If we can continue to keep the situation under control then we can reopen progressively,"" he said.

> In the first phase, called ""safe reopening"", more people will be allowed to return to their workplaces, with priority given to critical sectors and businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks.

> But those who are working from home should continue to work from home, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing. Only those who require machinery or specialised terminals will be able to return to the office, as well as those who need to complete legal documentation.

> Schools will also gradually reopen by levels, with full resumption by June 10. For primary and secondary schools, those in graduating cohorts will attend school daily, while the rest will rotate weekly.

> Places of worship - closed during the circuit breaker - will be allowed to open next month, but only for private worship. Congregational services will not resume.

> Social gatherings will also still be prohibited, although an exception will be made for people visiting their parents or grandparents. Visits will be limited to one per day, with a maximum of two visitors a day. These visitors should be from the same household.

> This means that dropping off children for childcare will be allowed, although seniors themselves should not go out, Mr Gan said.

> In this first phase, the risk of a resurgence in community transmission is high, he added. This means that people should continue wearing masks when they leave the house, and only go out for essential services.

> The first phase is expected to last a few weeks and Singapore will move into the second phase if community transmission rates remain ""low and stable"" and the dormitory situation remains under control.

> In the second phase, called the ""safe transition"", people will gradually be able to resume more social activities. More businesses will be allowed to reopen, including tuition and enrichment centres, gyms and fitness studios. However, employers must implement safe distancing measures and ensure that those who can work from home continue to do so.

> In this phase, small social gatherings and dining in at food and beverage outlets could also be allowed.

> Mr Gan said the second phase comprises several steps and could last several months.

> Depending on the how the Covid-19 situation then develops, measures will continue to be eased further until reaches the third and final phase, called ""safe nation"".

> In the third phase, Singapore will move to a ""new normal"" until the vaccine is found. By this time, social, cultural, religious and business gatherings are expected to have resumed. However, limits will be put in place on gathering sizes.

> The same applies to services and activities that involve significant prolonged close contact, such as massages, or significant crowd management risk in an enclosed space, such as cinemas.

> On public transport, where it is difficult to maintain physical distancing, commuters will have to wear masks and refrain from talking.

> National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said that while some might be disappointed that they will not be able to go out freely and socialise after the end of the circuit breaker, the reopening needs to be done carefully.

> ""We have to do this in careful and calibrated manner as we don't want to risk a flaring up of virus. And importantly, we do not want to sacrifice the efforts all of us have put in controlling the outbreak,"" he said.

> He added that the government would continue to support businesses and workers that are unable to open on June 2. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat has announced that he will deliver a ministerial statement on the plans on May 26. It will be the fourth budget this year.

Hanging out with them means you're a close contact instead of just a transient one. There is a significant increase in risk of transmission if that's the case. People start going to meet other people from different families and those people and their families go meet their partners and now we are back to square one, except it isn't just affecting the dorms, it'll be the whole of Singapore.

So if anywhere in that chain of customers, someone had the virus, it’s going to be a Long ass train of the hairdresser passing the virus on?

Versus meeting your SO? Even if you were gonna change SO every week, your exposure to your hairstylist is much greater.  

On TOP of that, we’re more upset at the fact that the gov’s measures are going against the very rationale that they keep emphasising.

If the whole point of CB (of all young ppl staying home) was to protect the elderly, why are the elderly the first to have contact with other households? Shouldn’t they be the last? Shouldn’t the young people be the ones testing waters first?",2020-05-19 23:31:18,186

2271,541,Singapore's Covid-19 circuit breaker ends on June 1; economy to reopen in three phases,2020-05-19 19:33:54,"Please explain how the argument I’ve presented is a strawman argument. 

Arguments you presented:
1. Partners are close contacts and not just transient ones. If gov allows ppl to meet their SOs, people can start meeting ppl from other families and we’ll thus be back to square one due to cross-contamination like food in diff compartments. 

2. People can change as many partners as they want and so it wouldn’t be just one partner that they’re visiting (for the next few months I Guess I my interpretation)


My arguments against the above points:
1. If the rationale behind the gov’s measures for SOs not being allowed to meet was truly as you speculate - that they want to prevent “cross-contamination” of different households - the gov allowing a hair salon providing close contact (non-transient) 3-6 hour services between 2 ppl from different households is going against that very rationale. 

2. Yes, people can change partners every week, but still it wouldn’t be as bad as the potential breeding ground that a hair salon could be (that the gov is allowing) due to the fact that they see high counts of people from different households daily.

Edit after reading your second reply to another user: Again, I did not say that you are for salons opening up. I’m using the example of our gov opening up salons for non-essential services to show that the gov is displaying clear hypocrisy that people who are related to each other cannot meet because they’re from different households, but a hairdresser can meet multiple people from multiple households, and those individual customers would have essentially have the same amount of exposure as the hairdresser they go to.",2020-05-20 00:26:00,278

I am arguing for my opinion that being able to meet grandparents is less risky in terms of community spread than being able to meet people from different families, such as your partner.

If your post above isn't a straw man argument then please enlighten me.

Now that I think we have cleared that up, I'll be happy to engage you on reasons why you think allowing families to meet their grandparents also means we should allow individuals to meet their partner(s), or that meeting partners takes priority over being able to visit grandparents.",2020-05-20 00:20:00,118
2274,545,Singapore's Covid-19 circuit breaker ends on June 1; economy to reopen in three phases,2020-05-19 19:33:54,"For point 1, It's simple. I'm not arguing against that. I agree with you that 'cross-contamination' is going to exist as long as we can roam the streets. You are thinking that I don't agree with you here, that's the issue.

I don't agree that we should increase the risk of our elderly by letting families meet grandparents, but that's not my decision.

Now that that decision has been made by our gov, people now want to meet their partners too because 'hey I can meet my grandparents why cannot meet my future wife/husband?' This is what I am against. I also think that meeting your own family (including extended) poses less risk of community spread than meeting your partner but this is of course my opinion.

For point 2, I'm not saying partners can change every week although they very well can. I'm saying people will use this as an excuse to meet whoever they want, and when that happens, what's the point of a CB.

Edit: So to elaborate on why I think meeting grandparents is less risky than meeting partners, here's why.

Grandparents are generally less mobile and do not have to go to work. Sure, they may get infected from you but the buck could stop there. That's 1 event to get them infected. If your brother now visits your dad and gets infected, that's 2 events that have to happen. Now your brother goes to office and infects the people there that's 3. A total of 3 events have to happen before the virus reaches the community (disregarding yourself otherwise there's no point arguing as you just infect everyone).

On the other hand, meeting a partner when you are infected goes like this. You meet your partner, she goes to work. That's just 2 events that have to happen.",2020-05-20 00:35:26,282

When it's time to relax the measures it will be, and soon too. Wanting normalcy again is normal but it's still a bit too soon, we can afford to  wait another month or so before meeting our partners than risk going into multiple CBs because cases have risen.

But to go one step further I'm saying allowing the meeting of your family's elderly poses less of a risk than allowing the meeting of a partner. The risk being transmission of the virus to the general public and enforceability of people who may abuse this leeway given to us. 

I know that the elderly will have a higher fatality rate in the event of contracting covid19, in case anyone wants to use that as an argument. 

When given both choices of meeting elderly and a partner, you can choose not to meet your elderly parents to keep them safe but how many are going to not meet their partners? Meeting with partners also tend to go on for longer and more often.",2020-05-20 07:47:19,127

2280,553,Singapore's Covid-19 circuit breaker ends on June 1; economy to reopen in three phases,2020-05-19 19:33:54,"yeah exactly i highly highly doubt we will ever have 0 cases for a extended period of time. So the question i had after reading the new measures for after june 2 was 'what exactly does the government want to get out of this CB?' 

do they want 0 community cases for 7 days? 14 days straight? because honestly i dont see that happening. And in my opinion, thats fine because to say we can eradicate this virus from our country is not realistic.. especially when we are a country so reliant on other countries (travel, trade etc). so if thats the case, the government basically has to just mitigate it as much as possible and right now with the measures we have i think they are doing a pretty good job.

I mean even in feb-early march when we were MUCH less prepared for this, we managed to control the spread rather well. (we didnt even have any CB or anything people were still going about their normal lives)


so now with all these social distancing and tracing etc i think that the government has a good chance of being able to control the spread well. 

so yeah they should definitely open up in stages but i PERSONALLY feel that this phase 1 is kind of half-baked and the government is too non-linear. they allow this and that in some areas despite them being clearly non essential (some hairdressing services etc) but then other areas they are still strict like how they are so afraid of letting any form of social interaction happen (even minimal in grps of no more than 2 arent allowed). 

So while they want to open in stages i personally cannot understand many of this phase 1 steps. i feel after CB the next step (alongside slowly opening workplaces and schools) is to also gradually allow people to interact as well (especially since they will definitely already interact in school/work). even if its just starting small with eg 2 people first then slowly increasing the no.",2020-05-20 02:21:28,330

> SINGAPORE: Singapore will exit the circuit breaker as planned on Jun 1, with measures to be progressively lifted in three phases from the next day, the authorities announced on Tuesday (May 19).

> As the risk of a resurgence in community transmission remains high, the Government will first resume economic activities that do not pose a high risk of transmission in the first phase, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in a joint media statement.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Besides the essential businesses that are already operating, businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks will be allowed to open. These include manufacturing firms, subject to the issued guidelines set for the manufacturing sectors and most offices. Nevertheless, the authorities said that tele-commuting must be used the “maximum extent”.

> “Those who have been working from home so far should continue to do so, and employees should go to the office only where demonstrably necessary,” they said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Such circumstances might include employees who need to return to the office to access to specialised systems and equipment that cannot be accessed from home, or to fulfil legal requirements.

> The circuit breaker measures first took effect on Apr 7, and were further tightened after three weeks, with more workplaces closed, and social gatherings banned.

> In announcing the lifting of measures, the authorities emphasised that the country is likely to see a rise in new community cases.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, speaking at a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference, said that the task force’s decision to exit the circuit breaker is because of the low number of cases in the community, and the stabilised situation at the dormitories.

> As the nation resumes more activities, however, Singapore can expect to see a rise in daily new cases, he cautioned.

> “The key is to detect these cases and contain them quickly, so as to prevent a sharp rise in the number of cases, or the emergence of a large cluster,” he said.

> HAIRDRESSERS, BARBERS CAN OFFER ALL SERVICES

> Hairdressers and barbers will be allowed to resume all services, beyond just basic haircut services.

> All home-based businesses that operate using a delivery or collection model will also be allowed to resume.

> Businesses that can resume operations from Jun 2 will not need to apply for exemptions, but will have to submit their manpower details through the GoBusiness portal within two weeks of the date of resumption of operations, the authorities said.

> Other services that will be able to resume include motor vehicle servicing, aircon servicing, printing, basic pet services, school bookshops and retail shops selling school uniforms.

> Most retail outlets and other personal services will however not reopen in Phase One.

> Dining in at food and beverage outlets will continue to be disallowed. Sports and recreation facilities will also remain closed.

> “Everyone should continue to leave home only for essential activities, and should wear a mask when doing so. As seniors are a particularly vulnerable group, they should continue to stay at home as much as possible,” the authorities said.

> DROPPING OFF CHILDREN AT GRANDPARENTS, SOME VISITING ALLOWED

> The agencies said that while people should continue to limit contact with others outside of their household, some exemptions will be allowed.

> Each household will be allowed to visit their parents or grandparents, a move that will allow families to spend time and provide support to one another.

> “Each receiving household should limit such visits to only one per day, and to not more than two persons who must be from the same visiting household,” they said.

> As part of this policy, dropping off children at parents’ and grandparents’ homes for childcare will also be allowed, subject to the same limit of two visitors from the same visiting household per day, they added.

> Mr Gan stressed that while families can visit parents and grandparents, seniors should refrain from leaving their homes to visit their families.

> “Children or grandchildren can visit their parents or grandparents. Grandparents and parents, please stay at home. Don't go visiting your children, because we do want to keep you safe at home,” he said.

> Siblings will not be allowed to visit each other.

> IN-PERSON MARRIAGE SOLEMNISATION, PRIVATE WORSHIP ALLOWED

> The authorities added that they will allow marriage solemnisations to take place in-person again, involving up to 10 persons.

> Places of worship can also reopen for private worship, they added. This will be limited to a maximum of five members of the same household praying together at any one time.

> “Families can continue to gather for wakes and funerals, with no more than 10 persons at any one time,” the authorities added.

> “Other non-essential activities and social gatherings will remain prohibited, as these will invariably bring together more people living in different households, undermining our efforts to keep our families safe,” they added.

> PRE-SCHOOLS TO GRADUALLY REOPEN, GRADUATING STUDENTS TO ATTEND SCHOOL DAILY

> Pre-schools will gradually reopen from Jun 2, so that young children can be cared for safely while their parents return to work, the authorities said.

> This will begin first with children from the kindergarten levels, followed by those in nursery levels, and finally, those in infant care or playgroup on Jun 10.

> In Phase One, students from graduating cohorts in the primary and secondary levels will also be allowed to return to school on weekdays, while other cohorts will rotate weekly, alternating between home-based learning (HBL) and returning to school for lessons.

> Junior Colleges and Millennia Institute will arrange to have half of their students back in school at any one time. Students in the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) whose terms are in session will be able to return to campus for practical and lab-based sessions, with lectures remaining online.

> Studentcare centres will also fully reopen on Jun 2, along with the reopening of schools.

> Co-curricular activities, enrichment activities and tuition however will not resume as “they encourage mingling across classes and schools”, the authorities said.

> SOME HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO RESUME

> Healthcare services such as specialist outpatient services, medical procedures, allied health services, community-based services, and chronic disease management will resume, prioritised by healthcare providers based on medical necessity and available capacity, the authorities said.

> Examples include surgeries for advanced cataracts, joint surgeries for patients with severe impairment, cancer screening and surveillance services including scopes for high-risk groups, ongoing dental procedures with guidance to minimise aerosol-generation, and diabetic foot screening.

> Preventive health services, such as flu vaccinations, will also recommence. Complementary healthcare services will resume for one-to-one sessions and by appointment, and traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture will be allowed for all conditions, they said.

> Providers will have to maintain appropriate safe distancing and precautionary measures, they said.

> Senior activity centres will gradually resume some activities in a safe and controlled manner, to address the psychosocial well-being of seniors with little or no social support.

> Community-based centre services for persons with disabilities will also gradually reopen to serve those who need the services, with safe distancing measures in place, MOH and MTI said.

> Activities, where needed, will be held in smaller groups, and persons who have medical conditions are encouraged to remain at home to receive home-based support, the authorities said.

2339,66,"Singapore to exit circuit breaker on Jun 1, visiting of parents, places of worship allowed with restrictions",2020-05-19 20:07:01,"I read the comments and I'm quite... sad.

I can agree with some of the commenters that some services, like full service hairdressing, do seem a bit questionable given their seeming non-necessity. Reasonable people can also disagree about whether grandparents should be allowed to see their grandchildren.

But allowing friends to meet up? Even for just two or three people at a time? I cannot agree with that.

Let us imagine if we allowed that, and let's assume I have the virus. Assume a R0 of 2, to make the math easy. I meet my 3 friends for lunch, two of whom will carry the virus because of me. Both of them, having been cooped up at home for a long time, want to go meet their other friends for dinner. They, and two of their own friends, then go on to meet other friends for a few days. All this time, they are asymptomatic and unlikely to be traced until I display symptoms. By then, how many people would have been infected despite the restriction on the number of friends at a gathering?

The community cases now are low *because* such meetings are not allowed. The low number of cases are not an excuse to allow such gatherings. Remember the Shincheonji cluster in South Korea? It only took *one* person to cause the megacluster to form. Sure, it would take longer to happen in our context, because we're not talking about huge church gatherings here. But the point is that you only need one person to start a new cluster, and allowing friends to meet up will accelerate that process.

We cannot confuse cause with effect. The low numbers now are an effect of the circuit breaker. The low numbers should not in themselves result in excessive loosening of the circuit breaker measures.

The implications of allowing friends to meet up are too much of a risk even at this point in time. The whole point of the mitigating measures at workplace and schools is to try to slow down the inevitable spread of the virus, and to contain it to close contacts at most. Allowing friends to meet completely thwarts those mitigations, and allows the virus to spread beyond these close contacts.

I don't support all of the details of the government's ""ending"" of the circuit breaker. But on this issue of meeting friends, I am firmly in support.",2020-05-20 00:42:17,392

Now that cb is going to be lifted with alot of restrictions still in place (they did say it's going to be like this) because the government wants to limit the potential spread of covid-19 while trying to open up, people here suddenly get upset about the government for being cautious about this to prevent a potential spread of covid-19. 

It's as if after 2nd June Singapore is clear of covid-19.

This is literally an extended CB with a nicer name called Phase 1.

If it's not extended CB, why would they say Phase 1 will last at least 4 weeks, with majority of the businesses and activities still closed? Lol

Check out other countries' versions of ""exit"".
When they say exit, it's really exit, such as retail opening up in 2 weeks time, gym opens 1 week after retail etc....

They're trying to avoid an uproar and backlash that's all. And to make it less obvious it's actually extended CB, they allow minor lifting of some restrictions but for the most part, nothing much changes.

Circuit Breaker became Tightened Circuit Breaker and now it's Continued Circuit Breaker.

The true ""exit"" that many Singaporeans are waiting for, is actually Phase 2, where dine-ins, gyms and retail, offices all open. Now that is the true exit.

Not this ""Phase 1 which will last at least 4 weeks"".

I suspect that full hairdressing services are allowed because it is unlikely for the virus to spread in this scenario. Even if you're at the salon for a few hours, you're spending it facing the mirror and not talking/communicating with others, thereby drastically limiting the spread of the virus. It is not so much the length of time spent, than the potential amount of communicating that might be done. Same for grandparents - I suspect the value judgement made is that grandparents are unlikely to go out and spread the virus to others. Whereas for SO or friends, not so much. The key policy principle appears to be to mitigate the spread of the virus to within close contacts/associates only, and no further. Clearly, I'm trying to derive the policy rationale for the government's decrees and it would have been nice if they just told us up front, but these seem plausible, at least in my mind.",2020-05-20 01:13:14,162

But clearly the govt is making pretty irrational decisions! How is resuming school even if at different levels, any safer than just a pair of couple alone at home? If you decide people are allowed to sit at a hair salon for 3-6 hrs, how is it not okay for pet and vet services to resume??! (Only basic pet services can resume) How?! And as many people have clearly said, aren’t elderly more susceptible to the virus, so how is allowing visits to elderly any better than allowing SOs? I understand that the elderly needs to be taken care of, but if so, why only allow now? Did they not need help these 2 months that has past? I mean I’m not a politician but this is basic logic. When they banned famous bubble tea shops, they allowed hawker bubble tea to resume. What’s the rationale, you’re simply thronging the crowd to these hawkers. All I can say is, there is major political agenda at play. I assure all of you if Election has been announced cancelled, you wouldn’t see a lot of these decisions made, but rather more thought through and logical ones. I stand firm with my proposition.
Edit: And also, clearly the govt doesn’t want the economy to collapse, otherwise a lockdown would have happened 2 months ago and none of this would have happened. But clearly none of this is helping the economy. Economic growth goes beyond GDP but HDI (Human Development Index). Just because everyone is employed and unemployment increases, doesn’t equate to higher productivity. And clearly a 2 month confinement at home isn’t helping that. The govt made so many mistakes and they just aren’t willing to admit to them and assess these mistakes and make better judgement. Yeah cue the supporters of PAP: MPs are working hard and tirelessly to make things better! Yea but are things really getting better? Community cases are suppose to be 0 by the third week. And where are we now?  Studying hard at school don’t mean you will get good grades. I’m not saying to be Anti-Govt or be a super law abiding citizen. I’m saying not every decision made by the govt is good and as educated citizens, we need to understand what the govt is doing and the rationale behind things. All the govt is doing is dishing out unthought measures that are presented in a way that doesn’t cause distress and make the govt seem incapable. 🤷🏼‍♂️",2020-05-19 21:24:58,434

The best example would be parents dropping off their kids at their grandparents place while potentially exposing themselves to the virus at their workplace. Grandparents probably live with some other family members who are in the work force as well and this goes back to square one yet again.

Isn't it unfair that you acknowledge this, while painting elderly visits as ""seeing grandchildren"" like it's something frivolous?

If my parents were staying alone, I know I'd be worried for their mental health moreso than my hypothetical live-alone brother. This enables adult children to visit and check on them. If they're irresponsible and want to indulge in seeing school going grandchildren despite the risks, it's on the individual.

It will be a much more popular choice too at the ballot box. And yet they decided to be cautious with people's lives and handle the reopening slowly and cautiously. Isn't this exactly what reddit wanted? Lives over GDP, necessary strict draconian measures to flatten the curve. So now why are we complaining? We got what we wanted didn't we?

It just felt like a contrast brushing off their seeing grandchildren only to later emphasize on how bad it is for people in WFH alone. If you didn't mean the contrast, then I retract my moot point.

I get the apparent contradiction. I'm just saying I find it a superficial contradiction in the sense that, going by that logic, must we keep them locked away for the longest time (compared to other groups), to not contradict ""keeping them safe""? Aggressively trying to keep community transmission low is in itself a way to keep them safe. Relaxing measures is already the acceptance of increased risk. If an elderly is to catch covid with the relaxed measures, I think they would rather it be because they had family visiting (the cautious ones could always choose not to), than because seemingly healthy young individuals were lepaking with beer and ended up forming a cluster that then spread widely because of their mobility, and reached their isolated doors.

Ultimately my main point was still: we can be unhappy that the social restriction is still on the rest of us, but why complain that it's now legal to have people visiting aged parents? It doesn't take away anything from you, even if it's contradictory. We gain nothing if they decide to not allow visits to elderly after all.",2020-05-20 04:24:22,222

Yet practically the whole of reddit was calling for a lockdown back in March precisely so that we can flatten the curve enough that any subsequent community outbreak won't overwhelm hospitals.

2614,387,"Singapore to exit circuit breaker on Jun 1, visiting of parents, places of worship allowed with restrictions",2020-05-19 20:07:01,Maybe because the numbers are smaller? It could be that there are more people wanting to meet their spouses compared to people visting the seniors. Besides seniors have lesser ways of communicating with loved ones compared to young people since many of them are hopeless with tech making them more prone to loneliness. Not to mention that seniors are in greater need of care from others compared to young people too. So judging by a needs basis it does makes more sense from their boomer persepctive to allow seniors to receive vistations when compared to young people since old people requires more help both physically and mentally whereas young people have more ways to communicate anyway.  The toxic mentality of if I don have it no one should have it that we have here is really very petty. When the decision can be rationalized as being made from a needs basis more than anything. It seems Singaporeans would rather everyone suffer together instead of allowing atleast some Singaporeans to get the chance to be able to see their loved ones.

> The Sunday Times talks to barber shops, laundry services and bakeries to find out how they have been affected and how they are trying to comply with the restrictions when they reopen for business.
