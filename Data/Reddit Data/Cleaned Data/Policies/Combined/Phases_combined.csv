0,0,When do you think Phase 1 will end?,2020-05-23 18:33:52,"Going with the currently stated four weeks, at least with all of the currently defined restrictions.

I'd like to think that even the Singapore government understands that more than three months without meeting partners or virtually anyone out their households is ridiculous and almost unheard of elsewhere.

These claims of an uptick causing a rollback... nobody thinks that the virus has been eradicated, and if that's the goal we'd be in lockdown until a vaccine that may never come. Of course cases will go back up; the idea is to prevent the case load from going out of control. Seems we've already achieved that, but extending this phase beyond four weeks would cause any remaining perception of them being reasonable would evaporate.",2020-05-23 19:04:48,118
1,1,When do you think Phase 1 will end?,2020-05-23 18:33:52,"There are a few scenarios I can think of:

1. Govt listens to trade associations kpkb-ing about losing money (completely justified), opens up 2 weeks into phase 1. Govt listens to the public kpkb-ing about not meeting their SOs, friends, mental health suffering (again, completely justified) and sets up social bubble policy (where people can register 1/2 people to visit.) Everyone is happy.
2. Govt doesn't listen and phase 1 continues for 4 weeks. Phase 2 is very very slowly implemented, ie. very few businesses start opening at a time, people's livelihoods are still affected, but at least some progress is made. A few businesses close and/or file bankruptcy anyway. People are allowed to visit a registered small number of people and their mental health improves. 
3. Govt doesn't listen AND phase 1 is extended. The dams of resentment finally burst and there is an outpouring of complaints. Businesses close and/or file bankruptcy. Election doesn't look pretty for PAP.

64,75,When do you think Phase 1 will end?,2020-05-23 18:33:52,"Let me preface this by saying that, despite how long this is, I largely agree with you. And I think the government's capriciousness makes this hard to predict with a high degree of accuracy. Nevertheless, in my thought process:

> The Singapore gov has done bizzare things which no other countries have done : such as no-mask when every country is already doing it, and letting in tourists even when Europe's infection rates are soaring.

The no-mask policy may have been unusual in Southeast or East Asia (or was it?), but it wasn't something no other country was doing.

Also, Singapore was actually quite ahead of the curve on travel restrictions all along. For China, they were one of the first, in a handful of countries that did it at all. Then in March, the broader travel restrictions were so rapidly introduced globally, it's hard to argue that they were behind. For example, the EU was up in arms over the US's travel restrictions on the Schengen Area (at a time when Europe was way ahead of the US in number of cases)... only for their countries to institute a *global* travel ban maybe five days later.

At the beginning of March, the idea of global travel bans seemed unimaginable; by the end of March, dozens upon dozens of countries were doing it. In retrospect, perhaps they should have been instituted earlier (and, to that, I think they were too late to even accomplish much), but the world, as a whole, seemed to act too late, based on the (faulty and incomplete) information it had and the fixation on China.

> In Singapore, the gov can extend CB for 7 more months. What can Singaporeans do, except lament on social media? LOL

Yeah, I know the government can do whatever it wants. I'm merely making a guess; I, of course, can be completely wrong.

I am giving the government the benefit of doubt here (even though I was already annoyed by the nature of this ""Phase 1"" reopening thing). By the end of June, it seems Singapore will still be on near lockdown, while most of the rest of the world has moved on. Even hard-hit countries not led by Donald Trump, like Spain and Italy, will be open to at least regional tourists... while Singapore with only a handful of community cases prohibits people from socializing with other households in open-air? Absurd.

I firmly feel the length of this circuit breaker/lockdown/'safe reopening' is based on Singapore trying to salvage its image after losing its standing in combating the pandemic. But if they're going to continue to size themselves up against the rest of the world, barring a change of circumstances elsewhere (or in Singapore) that allows the SG government to smugly say they were right, Singapore is going to look so out of step from the rest of the world by the end of June that that might result in a different kind of embarrassment.

> You've to understand that the people making decisions in SG are not your everyday Singaporean. They live in an alternate reality, parallel universe where they don't see the same world we do. Besides, these ministers are already married with kids, why and what does it matter to them if you can't meet your gf/bf?

I do agree with this in that the decision-makers are unable to personally relate to those without live-in partners or who live alone, because the decision-makers are likely not in these circumstances. The Phase 1 concessions are so largely family-oriented, disregarding the fact that many people's lives are not structured that way.

But at the same time, surely they can't be completely devoid of empathy. And they surely have friends or other people outside their household of concern. Or perhaps they might be spurred on by the economic angle.

> Even till now, the gov is still taking about ""waiting for a vaccine"".

Yes, this does raise questions. But, then again, Phase 3 is so close to normal life – with cinemas, bars, and clubs open. I guess no sporting events, concerts, or other very large gatherings? Yeah, that's not desirable forever, but people can get most of what they want.",2020-05-24 13:09:46,674

> SINGAPORE: Singapore may be able to enter Phase 3 before the end of the year “if all the stars are aligned”, said Minister for Education Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Nov 10).

> Responding to a question at a multi-ministry task force press conference on when Singapore may be able to enter Phase 3 , Mr Wong said the timing will be “contingent” on individuals doing their part.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> In particular, he said, Singapore needs to see higher participation in the TraceTogether programme, as well as continued cooperation and compliance with all prevailing safe distancing measures.

> ""So if all the stars are aligned, we might be able to enter Phase 3 before the end of the year,"" said Mr Wong.

> ""There’s still some time before the end of the year. I do not know whether all the stars can be aligned, but we continue to monitor and we will give you updates if so.”

> As Singapore gradually transitions into Phase 3, it can also expect the number of its COVID-19 cases in the community to rise, said Mr Wong.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> With more activities resuming, community cases may rise “perhaps to the low teens, maybe even to the 20s, or upwards in the 30s”, said Mr Wong.

> “We have to be mentally prepared for that and be ready to ensure that even if the local cases in the community were to rise, they do not form large clusters that are out of control. The key to doing that is to step up our testing capabilities which we are doing and now we are making testing more accessible to everyone,” he added.

> While one case in the community currently “may not have much of a chance” to cause a large COVID-19 cluster, there will be “a lot more” activities in the community when Singapore enters Phase 3.

> “People dining in groups of eight, weddings of larger sizes, places of worship with larger gatherings, events with a larger (number of) people coming together. With all of these activities in Phase 3, the risks of clusters forming will go up. It is inevitable, as we have seen in countries everywhere around the world.”

> Advertisement

> On top of strengthening testing capacities, contact tracing capabilities must also be strengthened through the expansion of SafeEntry and TraceTogether, he added.

> “If we all cooperate and do our part, we can move confidently towards Phase 3. And even in Phase 3, ensure that the reopening of our borders and the resumption of activities do not result in large classes forming again, because all of us do not want to have to go through another circuit breaker.”

> SINGAPORE: Phase Two of Singapore’s post-circuit breaker reopening could start before the end of June, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Thursday (May 28).

> The move from phase one to the next will depend on the number of community transmissions in the first two weeks of June, he said.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> If infection rates remain low and stable, then a decision will be made by the middle of June whether or not the move can be made to the second phase, said Mr Wong. ""This means Phase Two could happen before the end of June.""

> 

> On May 19, the Singapore Government announced its initial plans to move the country out of its circuit breaker in three phases.

> The Health and Trade and Industry ministries said at that time that businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks will be allowed to open. These include manufacturing firms and most offices.

> 

> About 75 per cent of the economy will resume operations in Phase One, but Phase Two will see even more activities resuming. Retail shops, consumer services and sports facilities will be allowed to reopen, while individuals and groups of up to five people will be allowed to dine out at food outlets and meet for social gatherings.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Sports facilities including stadiums and swimming pools will be permitted to reopen as well. There would also be social interactions and family visits, subject to group sizes capped at five people.

> 

> As for activities that involve large groups of people gathering in enclosed spaces like museums, clubs and movie theatres, the Government will “take a more cautious approach” about when they can restart, Mr Wong said.

> 

> The authorities will begin to talk to businesses in this category to ensure they have the safeguards in place that can allow them to run again.

> 

> They may not resume at the beginning of phase two but they could still open up later “but still within Phase Two”, said Mr Wong.

> 

> He declined to commit to an exact date, cautioning that discussions with these businesses could “stretch on for a while”.

> 

> EASING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS

> 

> The Government is also in talks with their foreign counterparts to establish travel bubbles with countries where the virus is under control, Mr Wong said, with the stage of discussions varying from country to country.

> 

> Both countries will have to implement testing regimes, he added, offering suggestions like requiring travellers to be tested before and after their flight, and downloading the TraceTogether app while they are in Singapore.

> 

> Details on a particular country where they have reached an agreement will be released when ready, he said.

> 

> Mr Wong emphasised that these safe ‘green lane’ travel arrangements will only be for essential travel, so that businesses that require their employees to travel around the region to resume and jobs to continue.

> 

> “Having these arrangement does not mean that we will allow mass market travel… which I think will take a lot longer to resume, not just in Singapore, but also internationally,” he said.

> 

> SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES AT WORKPLACES

> 

> Businesses that are unable to resume operations immediately after the circuit breaker should use the downtime to put in place safety measures to prevent infections from appearing.

> 

> He warned that businesses where cases or clusters were to emerge run the risk of having their entire business or shops “closed for quite a while”.

> 

> “I think this should give every incentive for businesses to take responsibility, and to do their part to put in place all the necessary precautions and safeguards so that they can resume and reopen safely.”

My take is, when the Government (backed by all the experts and facts) say the nation is safe and ready to reopen, I say we don't cower in fear and just thank ourselves for being good, law-abiding citizens for 2 months. Just go out with caution but know that our efforts are not in vein. Do not let these fear mongers discredit or stop you from doing what you want when the ""Government deemed is safe"".

If the current ruling party has went through 2 months CB and $90ish bn, what are another couple of weeks rather than risk it all going down the drain?

Without public health in reasonable order, there isn't much point of opening up the economy much. Most people still won't be out to spend much if a large cluster pops up again in the community? Looking at some other countries, I hope Singapore does not ever get to the point that she feels that it is reasonable to sacrifice a portion of the population for the economy.

My beef is not that the government is being too careful. It is that they are being unnecessarily restrictive to low risk people while letting high risk people interact. The construction industry was let out of SHN. No special measures targeted towards people who have to work with foreign workers, who have accounted for half of our recent community cases, frequently infecting their families.

I'm just trying to say why the MMTF said what they said today, IMO may be largely due to their findings from testing of the preschool staff. It may be the reason why they reduced the possibility of moving from phase 1 to phrase 2 from 4 to 2 weeks.

Elections will come, but I just don't think it will be that early. My personal guess that it will be after NDP. Why lose utilizing the biggest event of this year to their advantage.",2020-05-28 22:50:50,102
