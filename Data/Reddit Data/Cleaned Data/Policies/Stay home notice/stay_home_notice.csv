> SINGAPORE: ""Fast lane"" travellers returning to Singapore may appeal for swab tests in place of the mandated 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) they would have to serve when they are back in the country, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Jun 15).

> 

> A ""fast lane"" arrangement was set up by Singapore and China to facilitate essential travel between the two countries for business and official purposes.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""While many have welcomed the establishment of the Singapore-China fast lane arrangements, some have asked if it is possible to have alternate arrangements to the 14-day SHN,"" said Mr Chan in a Facebook post.

> ""On a case-by-case basis, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) is prepared to consider appeals for swab test arrangements in place of the 14-day SHN for returning fast lane users.""

> Appeals can be made via email to MTI, he added.

> CNA has reached out to MTI to ask about the criteria under which such exceptions may be made.

> The ""fast lane"" arrangement was launched on Jun 8, and involves Singapore and six Chinese provinces or municipalities: Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

> 

> Approved travellers must take a COVID-19 swab test within 48 hours before departure as well as upon arrival, after which they need not be quarantined, but must remain isolated for one to two days while waiting for COVID-19 test results.

> 

> Travellers must also stick to a controlled itinerary that is supervised by the host company or government agency for the first 14 days.

> 

> Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from China will be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice.

> 

> On Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that all travellers entering Singapore from Thursday will be tested for COVID-19 before the end of their stay-home notice.

> The ministry also said that travellers from 10 countries or territories, who stayed in the said place for the 14 days prior to their entry, will be allowed to serve their stay-home notice at home instead of a designated facility.

> ""In line with the progressive re-opening of our economy and society, the MTF (COVID-19 multi-ministry task force) has also reviewed the border measures we had put in place earlier to manage the risks of importation and will progressively implement changes as part of our resumption of international travel,"" said Mr Chan.

> 

> Earlier this month, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat said in Parliament that travel will be restarted on a limited scale, focusing first on “essential travel for businesses to function and for purposes such as maintaining critical infrastructure and providing needed services”.

I used Fairprice for my grocery haul but they couldn't deliver until 2 days later like you mentioned. I'll probably use Amazon to stock up this week.


No kitchen, only a kettle and coffee/tea. 3 meals per day are included but they're pretty bland, I've been doing mostly delivery through Foodpanda. 


They were kind enough to provide a sponge, dish soap, and trash bags for the entire stay.

People who serve the SHN at a hotel are already quite well monitored by the hotel itself. Not that much that can go wrong there... So far, we have also not heard from the MOH except for their official SHN e-mail notification.

Homer report: I was not aware of that app! Good to know! Do you know if the app is mandatory even if you serve your SHN in a government facility...? It seems the app has been designed for people who serve their SHN at their own home. To monitor their movements and keep track of their health status.

During the SHN there are nearly zero human interactions anymore. The meals are deposited in front of our hotel room door. They ring the bell and then move on immediately. So we know that the meals are ready to be picked up at the door. But we don't have any human interaction.

In our case, it was a full-size bus and only about 12 passengers on it (probably only 10% of its max. capacity). So, there was plenty of separation between each of the passengers.

Formula: You can buy formula and other stuff online with ease while being in quarantine. And it will be delivered to your hotel room (by the hotel staff). So, don’t worry about that. Only if you need food or items which are not available in Singapore it’s important to bring it. And remember that delivery might need a few days. So better order a few days in advance before you run out of something. Amazon Prime delivers same-day. We used their service a lot. But needs a subscription.

> Advertisement

> He told the court that he intends to plead guilty and was given a date to do so later this month.

> Foo returned to Singapore from Thailand on Mar 17 and was issued a stay-home notice for the period between Mar 17 and Mar 31.

> However, Foo allegedly left his home at Kreta Ayer Road on Mar 29 and took a private-hire car to Sengkang Central. According to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), he did so to meet a friend to settle some personal matters.

> The charge sheet stated that he left his home at about 4am that day and went to Sengkang to look for a Lee Quan Hui, before going home.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ICA launched an investigation and Foo was charged. If convicted, he faces a jail term of up to six months, a maximum fine of S$10,000, or both.

> 

> Foo is the third man to be charged over stay-home notice breaches - a newspaper vendor is accused of doing so to deliver newspapers, while another man has pleaded guilty to breaching his notice to run errands and eat bak kut teh with his girlfriend.

> 

> The Government had announced that all residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with travel history to ASEAN countries entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Mar 16 would be issued a stay-home notice.

> Under the notice, they must remain in their homes at all times for two weeks. These requirements were extended to all residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore from all countries from Mar 20.

> From Apr 9, the requirement switched to one of 14-day self-isolation at dedicated facilities.

> ICA said it will not hesitate to take action and prosecute those who fail to comply with stay-home notice requirements. It also reminded all travellers arriving in Singapore to ensure that they submit complete and accurate health and travel declarations.

> Anyone who makes a false or misleading declaration can be prosecuted, and ICA can take further actions such as revoking or shortening the validity of permits and passes to remain in Singapore.

> Information about those who breach stay-home notice requirements can be reported to ICA at go.gov.sg/reportshnbreach or 6812 5555.

> SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) will put in place more stringent border measures to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases, including on-arrival testing for travellers.

> From 11.59pm on Jan 24, all travellers, including Singaporeans and permanent residents, will need to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon arrival in Singapore, said MOH in a media release on Saturday (Jan 16).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Existing stay-home notice requirements, including a PCR test at the end of the stay-home notice period, will continue, said the ministry.

> 

> To facilitate the testing process, travellers are ""strongly encouraged"" to register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test before departing for Singapore, said MOH.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Currently, travellers who are not Singaporeans or permanent residents who have a recent travel history to high-risk countries or regions are required to take a PCR test within 72 hours before departure. They are then tested at the end of their stay-home notice period.

> MOH said that the new measures will be implemented given the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and the worsening coronavirus situation around the world.

> 

> FURTHER PRECAUTIONS FOR TRAVELLERS FROM UK AND SOUTH AFRICA

> From 11.59pm on Jan 18, all Singaporeans and permanent residents returning from the UK and South Africa will be subject to an additional seven-day self-isolation at their place of residence, following their 14-day stay-home notice period at dedicated facilities.

> Advertisement

> They will be tested at the end of their stay-home notice, as with the current requirement, and again after they have completed their seven-day self-isolation period, said MOH.

> These further precautions will apply to travellers who are currently serving their stay-home notice, and they will be in place until further notice.

> Singapore authorities had earlier restricted entry and transit for all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with a recent travel history to the UK and South Africa, due to concerns of a more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus circulating in those countries.

> INSURANCE COVERAGE

> With effect from 11.59pm on Jan 31, visitors applying to enter Singapore under the Air Travel Pass (ATP) and Reciprocal Green Lanes (RGLs) will need to have travel insurance for their COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000.

> ""The travel insurance will help them pay for the costs of their medical treatment in Singapore. The visitors can purchase the travel insurance from Singapore-based or overseas insurers,"" said MOH.

> Currently, short-term visitors entering Singapore under the ATP and RGLs are required to bear the full costs of medical treatment, should they be suspected of being infected with the coronavirus or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore.

> 

> ""As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community,"" said MOH.

> ""The Ministry of Health will also continue to review the data and evidence on any new viral strains and update the measures accordingly.""

> Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website.

> Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, tests and treatment.

> SINGAPORE - The man who allegedly breached his stay-home notice (SHN) conditions to have bak kut teh will likely be charged.

> Responding queries from The Straits Times (ST), the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said it has, together with the Ministry of Health, consulted the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) on the matter. The AGC has indicated that it is likely to charge the man.

> Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam had highlighted a Facebook post by the man, Mr Alan Tham, 33. He had posted on social media photos of his bak kut teh meal while he was supposed to be at home serving his 14-day notice.

> Mr Shanmugam said he had asked for the case to be investigated, and added that stern action will be taken against those who breach such notices, which are issued to all travellers returning from abroad since March 20.

> Those issued SHN must remain in their residences at all times from the day they return, and are not allowed visitors. They are not allowed to go out, even if it is to purchase daily necessities.

> Mr Tham had said he thought the 14-day notice started the day after he returned from a three-day holiday to Myanmar.

> Others who have got into trouble for allegedly flouting the stay-home notice include film producer Mike Wiluan, a permanent resident.

> Upon his return to Singapore from the United States on March 20, Mr Wiluan did not declare a recent trip to Indonesia, which would have subjected him to the stay-home notice.

> The authorities subsequently found out that he had flown to Singapore from Jakarta on March 7, a day before his flight to Los Angeles. Mr Wiluan was then issued an SHN. The authorities also shortened the validity of his re-entry permit.

> It is not clear if further action will be taken against him.

Yeah, you're at risk if you're young and immunocompromised but if your immune system is fine you'll be fine. I'm symptomatic right now and it's just a mild cough

Sure it is. We're living in one of the most prosperous markets in history, coronavirus aside. 

>Not to mention that the employer with decent healthcare is going to have that much more control over you especially without unions

Many decent jobs have unions. Also, what do you mean by ""have that much more control over you?"" Like, telling you when to show up to work and what to do when you do so? What a novel concept. 

>Also, don't retail workers and mcdonalds employees and shit deserve decent healthcare

If they want decent healthcare, they can go get it. If they can't afford it, the government already provides it. If they want better than that, then they should probably acquire a better skill set than flipping burgers.",2020-03-17 22:35:25,142

---------|----------|----------|
Do you get to eat room service food? If not how do you get food delivered to you?|We kinda get boxed food delivered to our rooms. So really we cannot leave the place at all.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzgjui/)
Why did you travel?|Am a sponsored international student in the US and my sponsor keeps 'highly encouraging' me to go back even though the risk of getting COVID-19 is probably higher if I travel :(|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flze6cz/)
Why in god's green earth would you go to Singapore, RIGHT NOW???|Because I'm Singaporean? And I'm asked to go back! Plus our cases are actually pretty well contained as a whole. And I wont have help financially if I do happen to get COVID if I'm back in the US|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzpcl2/)
Do you live in Singapore?|Just previously(a couple days go), I lived in the US as I was studying but I guess I'm back for good in Singapore right now|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzgg7o/)
What are some cool things one might not expect about Singapore?|The popular one is that chewing gums are banned in Singapore since the early 2000s as the government wanted to reduce incidence of vandalism. HAHA. In addition, Singapore is a super young country, just under 60 years old!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzi3bl/)
How packed is the hotel?|Honestly, I dont know! When we first arrived we were kinda ushered through the secret backdoor in order to segregate us from the normal population and were sent straight to our rooms and confined. So honestly, no idea!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzlr72/)
Do you have a balcony? Can you access fresh air?|Nope! :( I do have a window tho at least. But sadly, it cannot be opened.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzq43x/)
Who’s paying for your hotel?|The Singapore government. IMO I think its pretty smart of them. Cos the hotels would all probably die and shut down without tourists. It's kinda like giving the hotels business.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzey9s/)
How many other countries have you been to?|At least 12 I think??? Cant exactly recall. But I know that within my few years of studying in the US I have been to at least 30 states!!! Hhehe mildly proud about it 😝|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzldp6/)
What are you doing to pass the time?|Reddit, phone, using my computer, some homework and doing jumping jacks lol. Honestly, it is stifling to be confined. It is like living in a high end prison with no yard time at all in 14 days.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/flzm7hk/)
I'm a Citizen of Singapore. What is it like? I'm still going to school normally so...|Though I'm staying at a hotel for free it gets pretty stifling and sucks being confined. It's like being in a luxurious prison without anytime to go to the yard to exercise.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/fs4lhi/currently_on_a_stay_home_notice_in_a_hotel_in/fm046e8/)

386,"From Mar 21, all Singapore residents and visitors entering Singapore will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.",2020-03-18 21:20:16,"SINGAPORE: Singaporeans were advised on Wednesday (Mar 18) to defer all travel abroad with immediate effect amid a heightened risk of importation of COVID-19 cases into Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). 

In a press release, MOH said this supercedes the advisory issued on Sunday to defer all non-essential travel abroad. The expansion of the travel advisory is ""to reduce the risk of Singaporeans being infected with the virus when abroad and spreading it to other Singaporeans when they return"", the ministry added. 

In addition, all Singaporeans, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Friday will be issued a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

For Singapore residents and long-term pass holders entering from the Hubei province in China, they will serve a 14-day quarantine.

They will have to provide proof of the place where they will serve the SHN, for example, a hotel booking covering the entire period or a place of  residence that they or their family members own. 

People under SHN will have to stay at their place of residence at all times for 14 days after entering Singapore.

As announced previously, short-term visitors with recent travel history to mainland China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Spain are not allowed to enter or transit in Singapore.

""Globally, there has been a sharp increase in cases and widening spread across the world. To date, there are close to 200,000 COVID-19 cases across 159 countries, with more than 7,900 deaths,"" said MOH. 

""Many countries have seen an exponential rise in cases recently, and more than 40,000 new cases have been reported in the past three days. 

""Globally, the number of cases and deaths has surpassed those in China since the beginning of the outbreak. 

""The World Health Organization has urged its member states to take urgent and aggressive measures to stop the transmission of COVID-19.""

> SINGAPORE: Travellers entering Singapore after 11.59pm on Sunday (Jul 19) with travel history to Victoria in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong within the last 14 days, including transit passengers, will have to serve their stay-home notices at dedicated facilities rather than their own home, announced National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday.

> They will also need to take a COVID-19 test before ending their stay-home notice, in line with current requirements.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Speaking at a multi-ministry taskforce press conference on Friday, Mr Wong noted a global resurgence of COVID-19 cases, even in countries which have successfully controlled the virus before.

> “The cases from overseas coming in through our borders represent another risk for us, even as we clear the dormitory cases and therefore we are monitoring the situation very carefully,” said Mr Wong.

> “Our overall advisory remains for everyone in Singapore not to travel or to avoid all travel - that remains the overall posture for now.”

> Previously, travellers entering Singapore from countries with a controlled number of COVID-19 cases were allowed to serve their 14-day stay-home notice in their place of residence rather than a dedicated facility.

> Mr Wong emphasised that this was “not something new”, as the Government has “repeatedly emphasised our border measures are not static”, adding that the taskforce is “constantly reviewing, updating” border measures based on their assessments of the viral situation around the world.

> “We really need to remain vigilant both at our borders, in terms of the measures we have in place at our borders, as well as within our community to continue to ensure that we control the infection and control the spread of the virus within our community,” he said.

> All travellers who have left Singapore from Mar 27 and travellers who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents will have to pay for their stay at dedicated stay-home notice facilities.

> Responding to a question on the task force's travel advisory for Singaporeans for the rest of the year, Mr Wong said that the Government's position - not to travel out of the country - is ""unlikely to change in the near term"".

> 

> While green lane discussions will continue with countries who have ""appropriate control measures"", Mr Wong said that this will only be applicable to essential business travel.

> He added: ""This will not apply to mass tourism travel. That I think will not happen any time soon.""

> SINGAPORE - A 45-year-old Singapore permanent resident (PR) who breached stay-home notice (SHN) requirements while he was in Singapore from Feb 20 to 23 has lost his PR status.

> He has also been barred from re-entering Singapore, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said on Wednesday (Feb 26).

> According to the ICA, the man was served with the notice on Feb 20 when he arrived at Changi Airport as he had travel history to mainland China in the past 14 days.

> These notices are issued to Singapore residents, long-term pass holders and foreign workers who have travelled to mainland China in the last 14 days.

> He was briefed on the requirements of the notice but failed to respond to phone calls, and was not at his declared place of residence when ICA officers conducted enforcement checks in the days after his return to Singapore.

> On Feb 23, he was spotted attempting to leave Singapore, and was warned that he had breached the requirements of his notice and could face penalties.

> But he still insisted on leaving.

> As a result, ICA said it has rejected his application for renewal of his Re-entry Permit, which allows a person to retain his or her PR status while outside of Singapore.

> This means that he has lost his PR status.

> ICA said: ""The Government will continue to conduct regular random checks through house visits and phone calls to ensure compliance with the SHN, so that the well-being of the community is not put at risk.""

> It highlighted that those who fail to comply with the notice may face stiff penalties, including prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act.

The Singapore government issuing Stay at Home Notice for people coming back from Switzerland does NOT mean that Switzerland is not doing a good job at handling the outbreak, it’s just a preventative measure considering we have had one case recently who just came back from Switzerland and Germany (not sure which country of the two he got infected in, though. That would be impossible for us to trace.) Another example is South Korea is on our travel ban list even though they are handling the virus situation very well at the moment. The sheer number of cases they have still poses a risk, however successfully they have contained the virus at present. The government is having to reassess the travel ban situation everyday because things are changing rapidly across the globe. Sweden and USA and a few other countries will definitely be on our quarantine list soon if things get much worse, which I predict they will be.

That is a ridiculous false equivalence.

If the aim is to stop the number of imported cases, it seems to be sensible to go after people who seem to have contracted it in the US -- which seem to pop up daily now (including today) -- rather than just the countries that supposedly might start exporting cases in the future.

This seems to have multiple aims: stop countries with repeated imported cases here and punish countries they feel aren't doing enough to stop the virus. Seems they're punishing countries, like Vietnam, that aren't guilty of either, and letting off a country, the US, that is guilty of one, and arguably both. It's bizarre.

> SINGAPORE: From Aug 10, travellers entering Singapore who are serving their stay-home notice outside of dedicated facilities will have to wear an electronic monitoring device throughout the 14 days.

> This will apply to all travellers including Singaporeans, permanent residents, long-term pass holders, work pass holders and their dependents, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education in a joint press release.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Only those aged 12 and below will be exempt from the requirement.

> 

> ""On arrival in Singapore, travellers serving their stay-home notice at their place of residence will be issued with an electronic monitoring device at the checkpoints, after immigration clearance.

> ""They will need to activate the electronic monitoring device upon reaching their place of residence,"" the press release said.

> If the device is not activated as required, the authorities will follow up to determine the traveller's location, and assist to resolve any technical difficulties, or take enforcement action, as the case may be.

> During the 14-day period, those wearing the devices may receive notifications on these devices and need to acknowledge them in a timely manner, said the authorities.

> Any attempt to leave the place of residence or tamper with the electronic device will trigger an alert to the authorities, who will conduct follow-up investigations, except when the person is leaving his or her place of residence for an appointment to take the COVID-19 swab test.

> 

> The devices use GPS and 4G or Bluetooth signals to determine if people on stay-home notices are within the range of their place of residence.

> ""The devices do not store any personal data and do not have any voice/video recording function,"" said the agencies, adding that data transmitted from the devices is protected by encryption.

> ""His job entails issuing electronic monitoring devices to individuals who will be serving (stay-home notice) outside of dedicated facilities, and helping them to wear the devices. While on duty, he wears a surgical mask, face shield and gloves,"" said MOH.

> The man is asymptomatic. His infection was detected after he went for rostered routine testing on Feb 4.

> His result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on Feb 5 and he was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases that same day.

> His previous routine tests, with the last being on Jan 22, were negative for COVID-19 infection.

> Advertisement

> His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection, said MOH.

> Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all of the man's identified close contacts, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine.

> They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period to detect asymptomatic cases. Serological tests will also be conducted for the close contacts to determine if the man could have been infected by them.

> Singapore introduced electronic monitoring devices in August last year for all incoming travellers serving their stay-home notice outside of dedicated facilities. Those aged 12 and below are exempted from this requirement.

> Advertisement

> These individuals are issued with the device at the checkpoints, after immigration clearance.

> They are required to activate the electronic monitoring device upon reaching their place of residence. If the device is not activated as required, the authorities will follow up to determine their location, and assist to resolve any technical difficulties, or take enforcement action, as the case may be.

> IMPORTED CASES

> The remaining 23 cases were imported and had been placed on stay-home notice upon arrival. Of those 21 were asymptomatic, and three were symptomatic.

> The imported cases include two Singaporeans and one permanent resident who returned from Canada, Ethiopia, India and the United Arab Emirates.

> Six of them are dependant's pass holders who arrived from India, Spain, the UAE and the United States.

> There are five work pass holders who arrived from Spain and the UAE.

> Eight of the cases are work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines​​​​​​​. Three of them are foreign domestic workers.

> The remaining case is a short-term visit pass holder who arrived from India for studies in Singapore.

> No new infections were reported in foreign worker dormitories.

> ONE CASE STILL IN CRITICAL CONDITION

> Twenty-eight more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged, bringing the total number of recoveries to 59,433.

> There are 36 cases in hospital, with one remaining in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Another 201 cases are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from three cases in the week before to two cases in the past week.

> The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at two cases per week in the past two weeks.

> ""We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme,"" said MOH.

> Among the 163 confirmed cases reported from Feb 1 to Feb 7, 82 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 30 have tested negative and 51 test results are pending.

> As of Sunday, Singapore has reported a total of 59,699 COVID-19 cases, with 29 fatalities.

> 

> 

> 

> MOH said on Saturday that a resident staying at a migrant worker dormitory is Singapore’s first likely case of COVID-19 re-infection.

> The case is a 28-year-old Bangladeshi work permit holder who stays in a dormitory at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> He was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Apr 12 last year. He tested positive again on Jan 25 this year.

> ""He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH’s surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their postinfection immunity,"" said the ministry.

> When the man was confirmed to have had COVID-19 last year, he was identified as Case 2513 and was part of the cluster of infections at Tech Park Crescent dormitory.

> He recovered from that infection and tested negative for COVID-19 from last June.

> However, the man tested positive for COVID-19 once again on Jan 25 this year and was isolated. ""Numerous repeat tests conducted subsequently were also positive for the virus,"" said MOH on Saturday.

> The man's new infection was not previously stated in the ministry's situation reports. CNA has sought further information from MOH.

> SINGAPORE: All travellers entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Jun 17 will be tested for COVID-19 before the end of their stay-home notice, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Monday (Jun 15).

> The test will be scheduled a few days before the end of the 14-day stay-home notice period, at an allotted testing facility, MOH said in a press release.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Each person under a stay-home notice will receive information on the scheduled appointment slot and venue via an SMS notification.

> “It is an additional precautionary measure to detect the virus, especially given the risks of asymptomatic cases,” MOH said.

> “We will monitor the results of these tests and may make adjustments to the testing requirements over time.”

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> These individuals will have to travel from their place of residence to the designated testing facility, and return back immediately after the test, using their own private vehicle, taxi or a private hire car, and avoid commuting via public transport.​​​​​​​

> 

> SOME ALLOWED TO SERVE SHN AT HOME

> Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders entering Singapore from Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Mainland China, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam and who stayed in these countries in the last consecutive 14 days prior to their entry will be allowed to serve their SHN at home under the new norms, MOH said.

> Previously, they had to stay at dedicated facilities.

> All those who can serve their stay-home notice at home must remain in their place of residence at all times, MOH said, adding that their whereabouts will be closely watched, through electronic monitoring as well as physical spot-checks.

> However, travellers entering Singapore from countries not in the list will still need to serve their 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities, regardless whether they are residents or visitors.

> PAY FOR TESTS AND STAY AT SHN FACILITY

> All inbound and outbound travellers who enter or leave Singapore from 11.59pm on Jun 17 will also be required to pay for their COVID-19 tests, and those who are not Singaporeans or PRs entering the country will need to foot their own bill for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities.

> Previously, the Singapore Government paid for the costs of stay at stay-home notice facilities for travellers entering Singapore, except for those who left Singapore from Mar 27 onwards.

> It also bore the costs of the large majority of COVID-19 tests, MOH said.

> ""As we expand (and) reopen for more travel, we want to move to a more sustainable position,"" said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong at a press conference on Monday.

> According to MOH, a COVID-19 test for a person under stay-home notice costs up to S$200, while a 14-day stay at a dedicated facility costs S$2,000.

> APPROVAL TO ENTER SINGAPORE

> All long-term pass holders will still need prior approval before coming back to Singapore.

> MOH said the Government has “gradually increased” the number of entry approvals given to these pass holders, “especially those with deep roots to Singapore or have exigent circumstances”.

> “We expect to be able to facilitate the re-entry of more Long Term Pass holders in the coming weeks,” MOH said.

> “We will also study how to facilitate business travels, in particular for professionals based in Singapore who need to travel frequently as part of their work, with the necessary safeguards,” it added.

E.g. Assuming this 142 guy went to a doctor and said ""I have a cough a fever"" and the doctor says ""when did you start coughing"", 142's imagination might then go into overdrive and think that every single cough in the last week is potentially Corona related.

Do you not see how being able to say this leans you towards having one of the highest form of privileges?

If the pensioners didn't volunteer themselves, we can't ask them. If they volunteered, great. They have done their duties and I think they deserve to rest. Young 20 year olds? You are on duty, so get in the suit and do your job. Likewise, with COVID pandemic: old retirees have done their part for society, now they deserve to be protected. Young people? You are on the line of fire, now take that bullet.

Disagree? Look at my username. Empires eat young men lives for breakfast and pay the butcher's bill for their glory.

Well, according to many people, especially Republicans, conservatives, and libertarians, that's not ""privilege"". It's hard work; perhaps not each individual's hard work only, but a collective hard work of myself and people in my support network who worked hard to build a good home environment for all of us.

Well, if you don't; you can start by blaming the parents, then pick up some Molotov's cocktails and start rioting, demanding for changes. That's the traditional way to resolve these kinds of grievances. To demand for better public housing, social safety nets, National Job Guarantee, etc ... If you don't have the courage for that kind of political violence, then you are at the whims of the people with privileges. Money is not a problem, because [war financing](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g26wwu/what_was_your_experience_during_the_20082009/fnk1s5i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) showed governments have no problem coming up with the money.

That's a secret to power and politics. People with privileges have quite a bit of political powers when everything is peaceful, and I will admit, from this point of view, I am perhaps a person of privilege. The moment violence starts, those power vanishes and it's the violence that holds real power. It's a secret because people with privileges desperately try to convince you to not exercise that power to violence to protect their own powers.

> A new scheme to help Singaporeans and permanent residents affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will be launched in January, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said on Wednesday.

> The COVID-19 Recovery Grant will focus on lower- to middle-income workers and self-employed people.

> MSF said there are “individuals who remain significantly affected by job or income loss” despite the previous Budget relief measures and various National Jobs Council initiatives.

> ""The Government has therefore decided to provide targeted support to help these individuals while they actively search for a new job or training opportunities,"" said the ministry.

> Under the scheme, eligible Singaporeans and permanent residents aged 21 years old and above will receive up to S$700 a month for three months.

> This will be for employees who have been retrenched or had their contract terminated, or placed on no-pay leave for at least three consecutive months.

> Those who are facing salary loss of at least 50 per cent on average for at least three consecutive months will receive up to S$500 for three months.

> Self-employed people facing an average loss in net trade income of at least 50 per cent over a period of at least three consecutive months, compared to their average monthly net trade income in 2019 or 2020, will also be eligible to receive up to S$500 for three months.

> The job loss, involuntary no-pay leave or income loss should have occurred after Jan 23 this year - when the first COVID-19 case was detected in Singapore - and must still be present at the point of application.

> 

> Applications for the grant will be open from Jan 18 to Dec 31 next year.

> Singapore has reported a total of 58,377 as of Thursday.

Free SHN (for those who left before Mar 27) expired Dec 31, so many citizens/PR who regularly live abroad but visit occasionally would have re-timed their visits to avoid paying the quarantine fee. Especially since many international employers are still full-time remote working and IRAS has already said they will not charge income tax for telecommuting from Singapore for the time being, so nothing is lost as long as they can tahan the timezone. For some reason, gahmen did not require a pre-departure COVID test for SC/PR so there'll be at least another week of high caseloads from this demographic.

Gahmen has also been granting more WP (for example to domestic workers) and STVP to family members of residents who are rightly cautious about leaving, hence why there are over 17k people in SHN as we speak.

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, as Singapore rolled out vaccinations for healthcare workers.

> Urging Singaporeans to get inoculated when they can, Mr Lee said there are ""ample vaccines coming in"" as Singapore ordered the vaccines early.

> ""It will make us safer, and it will make you and your loved ones safer. So please take it when you can,"" he said.

> ""It may well be that travellers coming back need not serve SHN (stay-home notice) or will serve a shorter SHN. So those will be the benefits of getting a vaccination besides the fact that you are protecting yourself and your loved ones,"" Mr Wong told CNA in an interview.

> From Jan. 1, 2021, returning Singapore citizens, permanent residents, and and long-term pass holders (LTPHs) who left Singapore before March 27, 2020 will have to bear the costs of staying at dedicated stay-home notice facilities if they develop Covid-19 symptoms within 14 days of their arrival here.

> The Ministry of Health announced on Oct. 27 that the Singapore government will no longer waive the costs of inpatient medical bills.

> Most have returned

> This is because the ""vast majority"" of Singapore citizens and PRs who last left Singapore within the past year have returned, the ministry said.

> “They will be able to tap on regular healthcare financial arrangements for their inpatient medical bills – SCs and PRs may access government subsidies and MediShield Life/ Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills, while LTPHs may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as private insurance,” the ministry said.

> Evolving measures

> MOH added that Singapore’s border measures will evolve as the global Covid-19 situation changes.

> “We will continue to monitor the global health situation closely and update our border measures in accordance with the public health risk assessment,"" said MOH.

> “If the situation in a country/ region deteriorates, more stringent measures will be put in place to limit the risk of importation and prevent community transmission from imported cases.”

> Meanwhile, all other incoming travellers have had to pay for these costs as part of their private expenses, subject to the applicable healthcare arrangements for their bills, MOH said.
