> SINGAPORE — With the number of imported cases of COVID-19 continuing to rise, the risk of locally transmitted cases will also increase, making the threat of a widespread virus outbreak “very real”, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.

> Hence, practising safe distancing and minimising social activities is important in slowing down the spread of the virus, and public venues and roads are already less crowded, he noted during a press conference on Tuesday (24 March).

> However, the adjustments to Singaporeans’ daily lives are taking place too slowly, said Wong, who is also the co-chair of the multi-ministry taskforce to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

> “The virus isn’t going to wait for us. It is continuing to spread and circulate in our population, and anytime you can get an outbreak,” he said.

> “It is of great concern that you still hear stories of people gathering together. You still hear anecdotes of people gathering in clubs, in discos, where there are large social gatherings which can easily become super-spreader events, and then another cluster will break out after that.”

> On Tuesday, the taskforce announced a slew of measures to further minimise the spread of the new virus.

> Among other things, all bars and entertainment venues - including night clubs, discos, cinemas, theatres, and karaoke outlets - will be closed at least till end-April. All events will also be cancelled, while gatherings outside of work and school should be limited to 10 attendees or fewer.

> Centre-based tuition and enrichment classes, as well as religious services and congregations will also be suspended.

> Wong said the taskforce hopes Singaporeans will take the measures seriously as they are meant to minimise the risk of local transmission.

> “Our key message to all Singaporeans is stay at home as much as you can. Go out if you need to work, go to school, go out for essential tasks, but otherwise stay at home, reduce your social gatherings and all other activities for the next one month,” he said.

> “It is only by all of us reducing our activity level and the intensity of our contacts – that’s the only way where we can significantly reduce the chance of this virus spreading further in our community. And so this is a collective endeavour and we need Singaporeans to really take this task seriously.”

> As of Tuesday, Singapore confirmed 49 new cases of the virus, bringing the total to 558. 17 remain in the intensive care unit while two have died.

> Meanwhile, there are close to 396,000 COVID-19 cases globally as of Tuesday. More than 17,000 have died from the virus, with the death tolls in China and Italy accounting for more than half of the figure.

Almost every new measure being put in place is as if we're in DORSCON red, eg. social distancing but they just don't want to say the word red. From what I can see the govt. is just afraid of raising the official level as it might lead to panic.  But the taskforce needs to understand this, people will not confine themselves because the current DORSCON level does not require people to practice social distancing.",2020-03-25 13:16:08,93

When he said that, most cases were linked cases and in generally small numbers. It was safe to go out as long as you take personal hygiene precautions. 

This spike in cases that we are seeing are mainly imported cases from returning citizens, except for yesterday where there was a increase to 13 unlinked cases. It is therefore now appropriate to ask people to stay home as much as possible.",2020-03-25 11:02:40,94

The government have been advised by numerous professors in epidemiology and doctors and have access to a much larger picture of how the country is performing in different facets than we do. I trust in their ability to calibrate measures accordingly.

Again, a testament to the adequacy of their decisions is that before Singaporeans started returning home, the situation was very much controlled. We have only started to see exponential growth and strain on our healthcare following the massive influx of returning Singaporeans and they are pushing out measures to attempt to keep ahead of the curve, e.g. those announced yesterday.

We can argue about the efficacy of their measures but it will always be post-factum and cannot compare to them making decision in the moment.",2020-03-25 13:07:02,153

It's so that we can open to/with China. There's much less value in creating a bubble with Thailand or Taiwan.

That's not to say that the bubble with HK should carry on if they can't handle their cases (anyway there's already a provision in the HK bubble agreement that it will be suspended for 2 weeks if the 7-day moving average exceeds 5). My point is merely that Thailand and Taiwan are irrelevant to the bubble discussion. I don't see anything wrong with choosing HK as our 'bubble partner' as you put it. It's just a matter of whether that bubble can go ahead.

Similarly we are in talks about a bubble with Germany. Not because Germany has better numbers than any other country, or because Germany is very nice to visit, but because they have emerged as the defacto leader of the EU after the whole Brexit saga.",2020-11-21 08:26:39,159

If you're feeling even a bit sick, stay home!!",2020-03-10 12:41:47,"As far as I can piece together from the ST reporting as well as what B plus is saying, the original climber is likely Case 142 (20 something male), and he was at the gym from 7 onwards that evening.

It also sounds like he was already showing some symptoms when he showed up (bad move man).

Climbing gyms have the potential of being very big clusters since everyone is packed in a small place and everyone are touching the same climbing holds.",2020-03-10 12:56:34,80

tbh, i feel like for b+ it was always like a disaster was gonna happen because there were no measures like temperature taking in place at all.

Perhaps if there were such measures in place, all cases linked to bouldering gym could have been prevented? 

I really feel it's poor on their part considering all the other gyms i've been to had some kind of temperature taking or assurance in place.",2020-03-11 22:39:03,82

155,"Transmission at a Singapore climbing gym. If you're feeling even a bit sick, stay home!!",2020-03-10 12:41:47,"I wanna be as fair to the guy as possible, so, when the reports say ""symptoms"" this is a very imprecise and general term. It is also basically what the patient is telling the doctor, and so this also opens up all sorts of issues with people incorrectly remembering just when they fell sick. 

E.g. Assuming this 142 guy went to a doctor and said ""I have a cough a fever"" and the doctor says ""when did you start coughing"", 142's imagination might then go into overdrive and think that every single cough in the last week is potentially Corona related. This ends up with wrong information on just when the corona symptoms started, since you can cough for all sorts of non-corona related reasons.",2020-03-10 13:59:11,124

Never been to boulder+ but climb central is perpetually crowded. i stopped going because i realised i spent too much time waiting for lanes, but it really is a recipe for disaster. worse than dinner function i daresay",2020-03-10 17:29:08,70
