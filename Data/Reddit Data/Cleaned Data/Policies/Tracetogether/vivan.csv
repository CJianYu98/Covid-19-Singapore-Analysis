> Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, Vivian Balakrishnan, takes full responsibility for the ""consternation"" and ""anxiety"" caused by the revelation that TraceTogether data can be used for police investigations.

> Vivian said this in Parliament today (February 2), while giving his speech during the second reading of the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill.

> TraceTogether is privacy-protecting by design: Vivian

> Highlighting the importance of contact tracing, Vivian explained that TraceTogether is ""fundamentally privacy-protecting by design"".

> ""TraceTogether only collects proximity data, which is necessary to identify close contacts. TraceTogether does not collect GPS location nor movement data. Furthermore, the app and the token only keep a temporary record, in an encrypted form, locally on the device. The data is automatically purged after 25 days. The Government also intends to deactivate TraceTogether, along with other digital contact tracing programmes, once the pandemic is over.""

> On using TraceTogether data in the investigation of severe crimes, Vivian said that it would be ""unconscionable to inhibit the ability of the Police to act, when it comes to a serious offence that affects someone’s life or safety"".

> ""It would not be right – in fact it would be untenable – to adopt a purist ideological stance and deliberately refuse to check that data.""

> Some important points to note about TraceTogether data

> The rest of his speech touched on four key thrusts of the Amendment Bill, which you might want be apprised of:

> Firstly, the personal contact tracing data defined in the legislation covers entry or exit records, proximity information and other data collected using any digital contact tracing tools.

> Digital contract tracing tools here include TraceTogether, SafeEntry as well as BluePass (a private sector contact tracing system which can be interoperable with TraceTogether).

> Second, aside from contact tracing, the TraceTogether data can only be used for investigations or criminal proceedings of serious crimes. There are seven categories of serious crimes:

> Third, the Government cannot use the data for any purpose other than those mentioned above, regardless of any other written law requiring or allowing the disclosure of the data.

> ""This will give added assurance that there are no further scenarios where public agencies may use the data apart from the purposes stated in this Bill,"" said Vivian.

> Lastly, there is a clause in the BIll which allows the Minister to specify a date after which a digital contact tracing system is no longer required to prevent or control the spread of Covid-19. Personal contact tracing data must then be deleted.

Others that could possibly fall under the list (but not really) would be:

- Wong Kan Seng: Kena tainted by Mas Selamat's escape. Retired from cabinet after 2011, remained as an MP until 2015.

- Mah Bow Tan: Quietly stepped down after 2011, presumably due to him being nigh unelectable after the colossal fuck-up that was the public transport system, along with the housing shortage/rampant inflation.

That said, PAP ministers/MPs resigning over personal/policy failings are few and far between. Josephine Teo is still around after her many gaffes, Vivian is still around after the mismanagement of the YOG (overspending, poor planning, shoddy food/food-poisoning) as well as the recent TT nonsense.

It’s also convenient that the government actually comes out ahead after this screw-up. If he were truly willing to take full responsibility, the government would have declared that all data collected this way would not be used for any investigations whatsoever.

255,"Bring Singaporeans back home, grow local talent for Smart Nation efforts: Vivian Balakrishnan",2020-10-28 09:40:38,"This is a difficult situation to manage though. 

Let’s say you are hiring for Google and you need 50 Developers in Singapore. Let’s say fresh grads.

Nus computing takes in on average about 500 each year. Let’s assume 100% graduation rate and NTU also about the same, with other private unis adding another 500. So let’s say every year we have 1500 new people in computing. Let’s say 70% stay in software related roles (an optimistic number) so  about 1000 possible people. 

Now obviously Google doesn’t just take everyone but it takes very good people. Let’s say the top 10%. So of 1000, only 100 have what it takes to get into Google.

But then, Google is also fighting with other A names like Facebook, grab, etc. So let’s say FB also need 50, grab 50. So 150 jobs and only 100 candidates who will make the Cut. 

What do you do? Do you lower the bar for entry? Ok, this is possible, but it is unlikely you can force a company to hire someone they don’t want.  Plus, it’s not practical in the Long run. Do you ask your universities to churn out more grads? Ok, possible, but that takes time. 

Uncomfortable truth is at the bleeding edge of technology Singapore is too small to produce enough talent and big companies will want to look further afield for talent. This problem gets worse the more higher up the skill chain you go. How many top AI Researchers do you have? Robotics guys? How many guys good enough to be CEO of a tech company?

283,"Bring Singaporeans back home, grow local talent for Smart Nation efforts: Vivian Balakrishnan",2020-10-28 09:40:38,"Having lived there for about 4 years I can tell you that you're wrong. There's corporate tax for Oil and Gas and also foreign branches of banks and insurance. 

It also has 5% VAT and typically a 5% import duty on most goods. Some items such as alcohol and tobacco are up to 30% or even higher.

Total payroll typically is higher in say Dubai compared to Singapore and not because Singaporeans don't earn enough. Purely because you to pay to provide housing for all your foreign workers (typically 98% of your headcount). You only need 2% of locals if you're over 50 employees. It goes up to 4% in finance and 5% in insurance. They only represent 11% of the population, although this can swing wildly.

The benefit of doing business in the UAE is its close links to India. As an Indian friend of mine said, Dubai is a city built by Indians for Indians. It's basically what Singapore was for the Chinese years ago.

Yet there still are a ton of companies that have a pretty decently sized office there. Some of them unnecessarily so but I guess we all like the low taxation that it offers and the typically good incentives to open up shop there.",2020-10-28 18:31:33,195

With more stakeholders and more eyes on the project, they can read through your code and identify vulnerabilities, essentially free of charge (in return they get to use it free of charge). Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux once said, ""given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."" The same can be said of software vulnerabilities. Linux as a whole is an extremely secure and stable kernel. That's why airplanes, rockets, financial exchanges (and other mission critical systems) and the majority of all internet servers use Linux.

Sorry, but I don't believe that's true. Because prospects in IT are (for now) a lot better than other STEM fields, I think you'll see a lot of talented people making the switch. 

There are a lot of bright kids in other programming-intensive courses (e.g. Physics, EE, Comp E) who are really, really good. Or how about mid/early-career switchers?

>Who knows, some nutjob in ISD taps onto the TraceTogether system for their ""personal vendetta?""

If you understood the underlying tech of TraceTogether, you wouldn't make this comment. I'll link the long read version here but to summarize:

1. TraceTogether saves data locally on the phone and it doesn't send to some central server where ISD can tap into it 

2. The underlying platform is open source so any 'future' changes are public knowledge

Singapore is trying to open up progressively in safe manner.

They're not massively different, certainly in my life there's been limited changes between June and October. 

> if we want to open up more, then unfortunately, we will need more aggressive contact tracing methods. tradeoffs i guess

I wholeheartedly agree with this, but the ""opening up more"" they're currently talking about changes little too. Letting us have 8 rather than 5 people on a table - wowee! 

Things that would make me happier (and I'm aware this isn't remotely a factor they would consider, I'm just saying what would make it feel ""more normal"" for me):

* no mask unless inside a building/vehicle

* reduce limits on table sizes (I'm not sure what's sensible here, but permitting 10 people + doesn't seem that risky)

* reopening of bars with whatever level of safe distancing rules etc enforced

* remove the 10:30 shut off - move it back to midnight like Hong Kong

As you can see, most of my interests are around entertainment and bars, as that's one of the few enjoyments we're still able to have at the moment. I'd really love some green lanes to places like Vietnam or Thailand that are operable for a short break; travel has always been high on my list of priorities and I'm going a bit stir crazy going to the same places day-in-day-out.

Anyway, my list is largely irrelevant, the Gahmen will continue to plod on with their plans for reopening and we'll be forced to cart this token around whether I/we like it or not.

Open Trace is the framework responsible for underlying data storage and interaction and that is open source. As you pointed out, this has not undergone changes since May so there's no change in the storage mechanism.

All the other updates to TT have been to enable SafeEntry and similar features but it doesn't change the way the underlying data is stored nor the mechanism for data exchange happens.

The linked article does not address whether it's possible for a malicious entity to somehow trigger or schedule an upload.

If the Android code was open source, a [direct-from-source compilation](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Reproducible_Builds/) could be made available on [F-Droid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid), which would assuage the worries of anyone _really_ concerned about privacy.

Since we're using taxpayers' dollars to fund its development, I think it would contribute positively to how sceptics view the Singapore government, and the world's perception of Singapore as a tech hub, if the actual app source code gets published.

Australia seems to have no problem open-sourcing — and keeping updated! — their app, which is [built on BlueTrace/OpenTrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVIDSafe): here's [their iOS repo](https://github.com/AU-COVIDSafe/mobile-ios), and [their Android repo](https://github.com/AU-COVIDSafe/mobile-android).

2) There were some studies to show that mask wearing was effective if (a) it was of a particular type and (b) if it was worn properly by medical professionals. Whether it was effective in public was unclear.

3) Given that there was a limited stockpile of masks and with the world in panic, the G also had to make a quick decision.

4) They made the initial decision to discourage public use of masks, with one eye on preventing a run on mask. Was it the right decision? On hindsight, probably not. Could the comms be improved? Yes.

The linked article does mention all the online data transport the app engages in. So if the app was DESIGNED to send information out maliciously, this can be identified using a check of the underlying framework OpenTrace / BlueTrace (open sourced by the TT team) or network sniffing or reverse engineering of the apk. 

>What stood out to me immediately was the absence of backend host strings (e.g. api.myawesomeapp.com) or API calls, which is (almost) always the first thing to look out for when inspecting applications. Developers of applications with significant resources or risk typically harden their applications by packaging critical functionality such as encryption and data transport in low level libraries and calling them via JNI, effectively protecting critical functionality from inspection with basic tooling and script kiddies.
>However, that’s not the case with TraceTogether: all online functionality was pointing to Firebase SDK, from User Authentication via OTP (PhoneAuthProvider) to records uploading with Firebase Storage.



And that's not hard to do and in fact it's done for a lot of controversial apps like TikTok to find out what endpoints it's sending data to. 

https://www.cscjournals.org/manuscript/Journals/IJCSS/Volume14/Issue2/IJCSS-1552.pdf

If TraceTogether was DESIGNED to send this kind of data without the user's consent (i.e. other than an explicit manual action when a user is detected as a COVID patient), it can easily be found out. 

As far someone outside the development team maliciously gaining access and sending the device specific data - open sourcing of the apk code is NOT going to show you that. A third party maliciously gaining access and making sense of the data are also extremely unlikely and even if they do get access to that encrypted local storage data that stores nothing but temporary IDs associated with the phone exchanges rather than actual phone numbers, there's very little a third party hacker can do with that data unless they are able to decrypt it and gain access to the actual phone numbers behind ALL temporary IDs across all devices. 

>Australia seems to have no problem open-sourcing — and keeping updated! — their app, which is built on BlueTrace/OpenTrace: here's their iOS repo, and their Android repo.

Also, strange that you bring up Australia's app as an example of transparency and privacy. Independent study by the MIT Technology Review scores Australia low on transparency and privacy of the data collected and sent.

That is an exaggeration, I think they’ve done a reasonable job of creating a central system that doesn’t geolocate users as a matter of course.

Now, could they? Of course. They can do it today if they wanted (e.g. Israel has a system that tracks without warrant through mobile phone signals in the name of national security).  They don’t need to rely on this clumsy system for it.

How the fuck can you teach this for a living when you have no idea what a meta-review is?

The first link I provided is a bloody meta review. If you have bothered to read it, you will know it reviewed studies that were done decades ago to arrive to the conclusion. This is exactly what the govt should have done before deciding that healthy people did not need to wear masks.

Could the G time travel to look at these future studies? What the fuck are you smoking? Do you actually think all the studies in there are future studies just because the review is done in 2020?

As if this isn't enough to expose your stupidity, you gotta start criticizing the studies that shown that masks helps. But yet, you are unable to produce or criticize any studies that supports healthy people do not need masks, which now have been all proven wrong and unreliable.

You still aren't getting it with remdesivir  do you? Like with remdesivir, we should have recommended masks until the  more recent findings show it might not be effective. That is how  science works.

636,Making TraceTogether mandatory seems to contradict Vivian Balakrishnan's pre-election assurances,2020-10-27 08:51:40,"Oh come on. A meta-analysis IS a study which summarizes previous studies to provide some sort of idea on a particular directionality of effect. At the point in time where the first mask policy came into effect, these meta-analyses were not around yet. Was MOH supposed to come up with their own meta-analysis in a few days? These meta-analyses take some time to do.

Even in Chaabna et al (2020), they acknowledged that ""The randomized clinical trials (high-level evidence) assessing the effectiveness of medical facemask use to prevent transmission of respiratory infections in community settings were conducted in closed settings with high transmission risk of respiratory infections (e.g. households and university dormitories). No trial studied medical facemask use effectiveness to prevent transmission of respiratory infections in open areas.""

They further added: ""At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO did not recommend facemask use in community settings, on the basis that ‘no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons’ (World Health Organization, 2020). However, on 5th June 2020, WHO issued updated guidance about medical and cloth facemask use in areas with ongoing widespread community transmission and where physical distancing is difficult to implement e.g. public transportation, shops, etc. They recommend that countries should encourage the general population to wear facemasks in the aforementioned settings (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020). Since medical facemasks are a critical resource for healthcare workers, the WHO clarifies that when medical facemasks are in shortage, these must be reserved for frontline workers and at-risk individuals.""

Following that, they wrote: ""Healthcare professionals are a population at a higher risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 as they can be more often in close contact with infected individuals. In addition to protecting the healthcare workforce itself, prioritizing the allocation of medical facemasks to HCWs might also be a strategy to reduce nosocomial transmission of the virus.""

So again, going back to the strategy by the G at that particular point in time, when balancing the evidence with potential shortage of masks for medical workers, it was a sound policy. And that was my argument, that it was SOUND policy AT THAT TIME. 

I ask the IV/DV question because the other studies you cited very obviously missed the point, and illustrates your lack of knowledge in the area. They are not scary terms. Basically, face mask use is the outcome being studied in those other studies you cited. They were not studies looking at the effectiveness of face mask use.

Finally, when everything is exhausted, you try the lame old ""It was a sound policy because they were conserving masks for healthcare workers.""

Vivian also tried to play to the compassionate card to try to compel people's sensibilities to comply but honestly I don't have much confidence in his words either.

I do not expect the government to relent on the stance they've taken, which is why I think we should suggest reasonable solutions to safeguard our privacy within that.

I believe that other than clearly defining 'serious crimes' in legislation, there is another compromise that they can easily achieve without too much work: **Publicly announce every time they requested for TT data for investigations** and WHAT crime it is, as well as explaining WHY it was necessary whether be it due to insufficient evidence or there being still some reasonable doubt of the suspect's guilt. If this can be done without failure, preferably as a legislated REQUIREMENT for accessing TT data for criminal investigations, I believe that transparency is at least a right step in ensuring that privacy isn't completely disregarded by the government",2021-01-05 22:05:59,180

Giam was really spot-on here. Is the benefit of using TT in police investigations (even with full faith that that is all it would be used for) really significant enough to offset lowered adoption rates and loss of trust in the gov?

To even get the data out and use it for non-COVID 19 contact tracing purposes, someone has to say yes for a use-case there is outside the norm for TT, who was it, and was it within his/her power to say yes? Who else was informed after he/she said yes? Why does it seem like Vivian only knows about the use today?

Why does Singapore need this? EDIT: Removed South Korea from the list due to info that came in (see comments below).
2. South Korea and Taiwan had turned to healthcare innovations to manage the pandemic - nanosilver masks, swab booths etc. Singapore has been calling itself a biomedical hub for decades. Where are the healthcare innovations?
3. The government had said when the time is right, they will review and evaluate the strategies. As everyone could see, the policies had been changing every other day over the course of the last few months, sometimes with announcements through social media. Why not conduct the review and see how public health crisis should be managed better? Jumping straight to this is putting the horse before the cart. And since it's a decision taken in isolation of a review, doesn't that mean the point is not to address failure, but they have wanted this anyway?
4. The gov has been repeatedly saying everything is under control, the healthcare system is not overwhelmed. In fact, Singapore didn't need a lockdown, unlike other countries. Yet Singapore needs a surveillance device - unlike other countries? So there is no basis for a need to have this device. Again, another conflicting message.",2020-06-08 13:34:34,223

> SINGAPORE - The wearable device for contact tracing in development by the Government to help curb the spread of Covid-19 will not track an individual's location, and those who prefer to use Singapore's contact-tracing app TraceTogether will still be able to do so.

> The device, which may be issued to everyone here, will be a small device that people can slip into their bag or pocket, said Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan.

> Dr Balakrishnan gave these updates on Sunday (June 7) in the comments thread of a post on his Facebook page, where he had shared a video of him talking in Parliament on June 5 about the device, which may be issued to everyone here.

> The announcement of this device comes after news that TraceTogether, which identifies people in close contact with a coronavirus patient via wireless Bluetooth technology, does not work well with Apple devices.

> The app is useful when those infected cannot recall whom they had been in proximity with for an extended period, but it has not been popular here.

> Dr Balakrishnan, who is also the Foreign Minister, earlier said that about 1.5 million users have downloaded the TraceTogether app since it was launched in March, which works out to only a quarter of Singapore's population.

> This falls short of the optimum number of users needed for the app to work well - which is about three-quarters of the population.

> Responding to concerns that Facebook user Justin Herson had about the device being developed, Dr Balakrishnan said it will not be a tracking device and will not track an individual's location.

> He said: ""It acts as a personal diary, uses Bluetooth proximity data to collate prolonged close contacts.""

> The data in the personal device is encrypted, automatically erased after 25 days and never leaves the device unless the person is infected.

> ""If and only if that happens, then the data is used by authorised contact tracers to find people who may have inadvertently been infected by you,"" Dr Balakrishnan added.

> In another reply, this time to Facebook user Sylvester Zhuo, Dr Balakrishnan said that the thinking behind the device is that there are still people here without a smartphone, or whose smartphone does not work well with the app.

> The device will be able to communicate with TraceTogether and allow the Government to include as many people as possible to maximise public health.

> Responding to requests from user Simon Sin to make the device multi-purpose or to be able to replace TransitLink transport cards, credits cards or company entry passes, Dr Balakrishnan said that he is reluctant to do so as the device's battery should last ""many months"".

> After his announcement of the device on June 5, a petition called ""Singapore says 'No' to wearable devices for Covid-19 contact tracing"" was started by Mr Wilson Low that day.

> In three days, the petition, which rejects the development of this contact-tracing device, has been signed by almost 30,000 people.

> When asked what spurred him to start the petition, the self-employed man said he noticed that many of his friends on social media had shared concerns about privacy and surveillance, and he wanted to give an avenue for them to have their voices heard.

> ""I had no idea that it would get so much attention in such a short time. I am surprised at the response it has received,"" said Mr Low, 37.

> On its Facebook page, opposition party Singapore People's Party on Sunday released a statement by assistant secretary-general Ariffin Sha to express its concerns about data that would be collected by these devices, and called for the Government to ""tread with utmost caution and regard for the privacy of Singaporeans"".

> Mr Bryan Tan, a lawyer from Pinsent Masons MPillay specialising in technology law and data protection, said the device will likely overcome the hardware issues currently associated with contact tracing and that the designers will be implementing privacy by design and take it into account even while putting it together, just like how they have done so with TraceTogether.

> The app also does not collect or use users' location data, but records only whom they might have been close to, and Mr Tan said the new device will likely function in the same way.

> ""I do not see a need to change the position of storing physical locations automatically. There could be an opportunity to build in more features, for instance, a SafeEntry link to allow users to enter locations even easier,"" said Mr Tan, referring to the Government's digital check-in system for contact-tracing purposes.

This is a Bluetooth contact tracing device that performs handshake and records the other such devices that you have come into contact for long periods of time, it runs on a battery.

With no internet connection it is not realistic to perform location tracking unless permanent points are set up every several metres to ""capture"" the handshake of your device which I would argue, can already be achieved by security cameras all over Singapore.

What this means to me is that a user's movement pattern cannot be extracted unless every single device is collected, all of the data exported and analysed. The data remains encrypted and local to your device.

Network and GPS connected services such as Google Maps would have greater potential to track the movement of a user. The only thing keeping people assured about such services is that they are non-mandatory, and Google's promise of ""protecting your privacy""

People are right to be worried, but I also think that many of those reactions, in retrospect, now seem to be over the top and a little silly.

Specifically: “Many studies have shown that location data linked over time can be used to de-anonymise: this is unsurprising since, for example, knowledge of the work and home locations of a user can be inferred from such location data (based on where the user mostly spends time during the day and evening), and when combined with other data this information can quickly become quite revealing.”

Secondly: And someone please correct me here if I’m wrong, so if my token is collecting data of everyone else’s nearby tokens and it’s possible for MOH to find out who I have been near by looking at the data in my token, what’s to stop the government from planting tokens at locations which have data fed live back to their servers thereby establishing who has passed by a given area.

Sure, this would require them to plant beacons in all areas of interests but that’s a bloody small cost compared to the sheer number of tokens they’re planning on giving to everyone anyway.

And if for example they REALLY want to know if you’ve been near a person of interest, what’s to stop them from seizing the token from said person of interest and then checking if you’ve been nearby?

To say “it can’t track you” is nonsense because if it truly couldn’t track you then the device would be useless. It most certainly can track you, maybe not directly, but indirectly.

Over the coming weeks we will be testing some applications and products. No final decisions have been made at this stage.""

I did a bit of reading and digging. Turns out you are actually right, if assuming the tracking device follows BlueTrace's specifications, which TraceTogether is based on. I've corrected my post.

>The difference between this and CCTV is speed and scale. If they decide to implement listening devices at points of interests such as at HDB lift lobbies, they can just run a DB query and find out who visited and who went out. No need to go through CCTV footage.

Using existing CCTV footage and machine learning, it's already possible to analyse and index everything into a db. It'll might arguably be more accurate, since there's actual visual confirmation. Check out 'video analytics' on google.

Of course, that's not to say that they cannot enhance this data further with the bluetooth bracelets, it'll just.. undermine the COVID19 tracking purpose and backfire on it when people simply choose not to wear it.

>Both your examples are fallacies.

Firstly, u/KawaiiSumo only gave one example, not two (unless it was edited). 

Secondly, it is fairly obvious that burning your house down is bad but this new tracing capability is not so clear cut as bad because there are some pros about it that can be argued and privacy is not as big a thing here as in the West. Also, it is quite unimaginable that the tracing idea has not been weighed, debated and discussed by VB and his team before coming to the public. So to compare it with a rash decision like burning a house down is quite silly if you ask me.

>As for your second one, I'm not bothering to explain.

Thirdly, I'd like you to take more time thinking about the 'second' example instead of brushing it aside because if you ponder about it, u/KawaiiSumo's last sentence meant that just because those countries succeeded in controlling the spread without needing to use tracing capabilities, we should not blindly follow them too..which implies that we need to rationalize and consider various solutions carefully...which is similar to what you advocated,

People trust the government to do the right thing and hold honest conversations. 

Fortunately, Singaporeans are very forgiving as a whole so it won’t take much to regain trust. 

Unfortunately, as a minister would say, the rot seems is at the top - and this sets the standard for the rest of the Govt / civil service.",2020-06-08 14:48:46,74

I've got nothing to hide but neither do I feel like giving access to something that isn't regulated by international standards. Not going to install the tracetogether app in a hurry, not going to carry an ankle tag like a convict, happy to do safe entry.

Another thing I noticed is some places have moved away from Safe Entry to a manual scanning operation on a 1-by-1 basis causing massive queues (313 Somerset, Ion etc) - queues are suddenly 3 times the size, this seems to defeat the purpose of physical distancing...",2020-06-08 16:46:36,96

I opened the app and used my phone to listen to music, browse reddit and pretty much forgot about the app. To my surprise, at home, the app said that it interacted with around 180 people. 

It’s why the app no longer has a battery saving mode. It used to turn the screen black to save power when you placed it in the pocket but now that it works in the background, you can use it as per normal. Try it out on your iPhone, it no longer nags to you about battery saving",2020-06-08 15:24:10,99
953,Contact-tracing device will not track location; people can use TraceTogether if they prefer: Vivian Balakrishnan,2020-06-08 13:12:40,"It will need to be Bluetooth, and I doubt that it's already out there since this thing didn't come about before TraceTogether was developed. This thing will only work with TraceTogether and the wearable, so it doesn't make sense for it to exist before. Also, there are other technological means that are already out there that the government can use to track your movement, but it's much more difficult.

I am not saying that the government has the intention of doing so, but if I am the government, and if I can make the wearable mandatory, I would first replace scanning ICs at malls/supermarkets with listener devices. I can justify this by saying that it reduces risk of infection because now there's no need for officers to be stationed there. If this works out, then I would consider expanding it to other points of interests such as HDB lobbies if I want to track who goes out and visits.",2020-06-09 03:53:18,155

956,Contact-tracing device will not track location; people can use TraceTogether if they prefer: Vivian Balakrishnan,2020-06-08 13:12:40,"Sorry, I think I misunderstood u/Dunkjoe. Basically the situation as of a few days ago was that nobody with an Iphone would be using TraceTogether, because it can't run in the background. That's like nearly 50% of smartphones in Singapore. Then many Android users also won't bother with TraceTogether, because they know that half of their contacts would be missed. 

It's the kind of thing where the more people use it, the more useful it is to those who use it, so more people will use it.

If primary school kids, elderly without smartphones, and others who are willing to be traced but don't have smartphones use these devices, then hopefully 75% can be reached altogether. 

Ankle monitor, harhar. It's now specified that it is a small device you can slip into your bag or pocket.",2020-06-08 16:21:59,129

SingPass has included SafeEntry, and it allows to find the location within 450m radius before you enter, so you don't need to scan at the entrace. Only problem with SafeEntry is the location does not have access to the data, that's why they have to do their own double-checks.",2020-06-08 16:48:39,56

I think mine just updated to 2.0.2 while I was fiddling with it. It had already changed to the red logo before that, but the front page looks different.

So why did VB say what he did??",2020-06-08 15:34:26,58
961,Contact-tracing device will not track location; people can use TraceTogether if they prefer: Vivian Balakrishnan,2020-06-08 13:12:40,"I get what you mean. For context: Children may have limited verbal resources, may feel powerless, or may not have developed the skills to recognise their emotions, and this results in behaviour that some adults call 'acting up' or 'being naughty'. Most of the time, when children engage in 'bad' behaviour, it's an expression of stress or being taught different expectations. 

Back to what you mean - I still disagree that we should liken politicians who are being reumnerated for their education, skills and their work to 'bad children'. One is a group that agreed to a set of laws and ethics to receive remuneration for their education, skills and work performed--and they too have the power to impact those laws. The choice to be irresponsible and deceitful was done actively and purposefully, often with the enablement of others, with the goal to empower themselves. The other group (children) is essentially powerless in the face of regulations, have way fewer cognitive, emotional and physical capabilities to understand the ramifications on themselves and others, and if we take the science into consideration, their bad behaviour is triggered by events and incidents.",2020-06-08 15:09:48,187
