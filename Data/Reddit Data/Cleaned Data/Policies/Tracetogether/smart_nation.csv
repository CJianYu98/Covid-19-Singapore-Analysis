On top of that, one is free to choose whether to be on social media or not. They may accept the trade-off that their data will be used for commercial purposes.

Governments and commercial entities have different motivations. One of the motivations for governments is power. This includes shaping your perception of it through propaganda and shutting down anything that threatens it's power. For example, arresting a lone protester. A government is also made up of individuals who have their own personal motivations. It's all good when the government's motivations are aligned with yours but we've seen many times, even in Singapore, what happens when the government or individuals in government decides otherwise.

When a team succeeds due to this, they are celebrated, which is right, but its a combination of ""right place, right solution, right time"" that... mostly depends on everything except the people involved. 

And even in this ideal scenario, the successful team is then usually put on another, separate project, which then has to stop when the first one requires urgent ""knee-jerk"" maintenance. 

That's not really a good way to handle any project, or any team for that matter; You'd get better chances paying the $100 tariff to head into Marina Bay Sands and trying your hand at the craps tables for the project duration. 

Apps don't just ""fail"" because of poor developers. They can fail due to poor planning, poor risk management or targetting a problem that simply does not exist, or no longer exists because someone else got there first/did it better than j00.

Projects can also fail due to being too far ahead of their time, resulting in a solution that suddenly comes in handy - except it was deemed a failure months ago, with nobody left to maintain it, so it gets left by the wayside and we needlessly have to implement a new solution from scratch.

Projects can also fail because it succeeded for 100k users, but when all 5 million people in SG start to use it, the project chokes.

If the government really wanted people to have the app remain on their phones just in case, they could conduct more education on the subject, so that people see the importance of having such an app. That isn't going to solve all problems, and you'll still have some people deleting it, but it's likely to increase retention.",2018-08-15 16:00:26,81

This line. Usually a trojan and adware is the case of some organization, typically an advertisment company, wanting a direct line to the user's device, the purpose of which is to personalise the content that is pushed to a user - who, thanks to said trojan or adware cannot help but see the pushed content. 

The fact that such apps usually bypass system security itself means that the app owner is free to take any personal data from the device itself, all the better to build a profile of a user without the user's input. 

At worst, this allows the app owner access to important things he shouldn't have, like login information, authentication keys, etc. 

Even before the age of the mobile device, the purpose of such apps is professed to be for the benefit of anyone who installs them, but in reality they don't work very well or do nothing useful. Y'see, that's because the real purpose of the app is something else.

In fact, it isn't unusual for a trojan or adware app to pretend to be something else entirely, advertising a feature that is completely unrelated to its true purpose. 

So, when you claimed that the SG Secure app is in fact a case of authorities wanting an app to be on anyone's phone... you start ringing alarm bells. 

Edit: And just to pre-empt the argument that we can trust the Singapore Government because they are not an advertisement company and they are looking out for us, I would like you to google Windows Telemetry, as an example of a company you *have to implicitly trust* wanting an app or a feature on everyone's device for the purposes of data collection.
