Eg. I always buy flour from redman because they have the good stuff (Bob's red mill) and it's cheaper than cold storage, ntuc doesn't sell this brand of flour.

Sadly I haven't gone there since before the announcement of the CB because the queues have been horrendous. I know they sell nice dried pasta and some outlets sell eggs, but I guess people expect to be baking a lot more at home, hence the long queues. Kinda looking forward to this restriction of it means queues will be shorter, my sourdough started that I've been cultivating for more than a year needs to be fed with flour, and I'm running out...",2020-04-24 23:58:30,153

Singapore is the worst in south east asia, by a very significant margin, even compared to countries where testing is done properly. Go ahead and compare to vietnam, malaysia. Of course you are going to accuse them of faking numbers or undertesting with no evidence or proof, because thats all you know how to do.

I'm not going to draw conclusions on which country is undertesting cos there isn't really a standard to compare to, but it is pretty obvious that SG has already done more tests per capita than some of the countries you have mentioned.

Now I'm not gonna deny that the govt did fuck up with regards to the situation in the dorms right now. Yes that was a problem we could have foresaw. Yes we did have a chance to do something about that before shit hit the fan. But without being in the shoes of the ministers, without the information that they had, who are we to judge that the decision they made then was not an informed one? Hindsight is always 20/20. I'm not even saying that the decision they made was a **right** one, just an *informed* one.",2020-05-01 14:49:20,162

In other words, I was right. Singapore did not do great. Yes they did fuck up. The numbers are indisputably worse than even many third world countries. Case closed.

The rest of your post is nothing more than an inference that just because there were fewer tests PER CAPITA (NOT total tests) that that automatically means that Singapore MUST have less actual cases than those countries. You know that is not true.

The most likely reason the number of cases are so low in those countries is because THEY HAVE LOWER CASES. Period. This is basic statistical inference. That is why we can tell the result of elections from just a small subset of voter results. What matters is we have a statistically significant number of total tests carried out. This is valid for all earlier mentioned countries, including Singapore

If you have evidence that these countries are underreporting their actual cases. I would like to invite you provide actual direct evidence of that. You can win a prize for investigative journalism should you manage to do so. I eagerly await to read your findings

Your narrative of not being allowed to criticise them because ""oh they can't be perfect, look at how hard they are trying"" is completely disingenuous.

Agreed.

Moving on to finding out why they fucked up, which you agree to be what we need to find out. While I'm not gonna bother finding out if they are indeed paid the highest but I do concur that they are paid handsomely. And yes for that much remuneration it is definitely natural and justified to expect performance of a high calibre. 

Perhaps I did come off as defensive when I said that we are in no position to judge them when we aren't in their shoes. I'd like to clarify that what I meant was not that they cannot be judged but we have to take into account the asymmetry in our situation and theirs. Yes you can argue that given their pay they should be expected to make correct decisions and I do concur that point. All I'm trying to say is, at that point in time and under that pressure from the other parties in the picture, perhaps that decision they made was the one they believed to be the correct one. Then the issue becomes whether their calibre is worth their pay or not does it not? If that is the best they can do, should they still be paid the sums they are being paid? That is a question I don't think I'm qualified to answer.

Now I'd like to clarify that the purpose of me digging up all those numbers are only to back up the fact that SG is indeed doing active testing, more active than other countries. Nowhere in my previous comment did I try to compare case counts.

Moving on, I think we can both agree that if the number of confirmed cases is high, it's either due to two things: 1) there is just that many cases; and/or 2) we are picking up more cases due to more active testing (because let's face it no country is going to be able to pick out every single case). I am not denying that our high numbers are most probably due to that we have a large population of infected patients. Rather what I'm trying to highlight is our degree of active testing is indeed much more active than other nations.

Perhaps I came across as whitewashing, but all I'm trying to do with my previous comment is 1) highlight that SG is doing more active testing than other countries (something which I think we should recognise, just not too much) ; and 2) our ministers did fuck up but I don't think we are in a good place to be judging them for it (it's my personal belief so if the part about not being in a good place to judge others doesn't resonate with you then it's just a matter of personal beliefs).",2020-05-01 18:00:04,702

Overthrow the government? You think AR-15s would do shit against the actual military? If you look at actual coups in the middle east, you'd see that revolutions are won and lost based almost solely on which side the military falls on.

The infantry is important in military conflict because infanteers have extremely cost effective ways to kill armour and attack helicopters, via manpads and anti-material weapons like the matador. US civilians by and large do not. Because of this, tanks have to be supported by infantry in a conventional conflict. In the conflicts you mentioned, the US also facts major power-projection issues in mobilising large amounts of armour, both logistically and due to the political cost of mobilising that much. 

There is a role for light infantry. The thing is, light infantry is usually much more heavily armed than even the gun nuts of the US. Every platoon has a few matadors.

I'm literally saying that the loyalty of the military is what matters, so I have no idea why you're asking me that. I am categorically _not_ assuming that the military will stay loyal to the federal government in the event of civil war. 

The national guard will likely come into play, but it still has little to do with the arming of civilians and the second amendment. The second amendment does not enable the existence of the national guard. The national guard is the reserve Corp of the US army and air force.

Most small developed countries actually rely very heavily on equipment, and have more kitted out militaries than their larger counterparts. Singapore has ~180 MBTs. France, a much larger country, only has ~200. No, the doctrine for us is not for a small military to fight guerilla war, it's to win outright via force multipliers such as technology and of course to take advantage of the fact that most of the largest militaries in the world are far away and will run into force projection issues.

There are manifold concerns that remain to be addressed - and rushed implementation of something this privacy intrusive needs much more thought and debate than this is being given. 

From a policy perspective, whilst the G has said that only a team of MOH officers will have access to the data and that’s its protected by OSA, that doesn’t mean that police and other investigative bodies can’t use their investigate powers to request for the data which has been provided to MOH. That’s particularly concerning given that criminal charges could potentially be built on this data - and in the absence of freedom of information legislation, we’d never know how this data is treated. If this is to go through, we need a strict system of binding rules - whether in legislation or not - to govern data access of if the G wants something as intrusive as this. The public service recommendations are just not enough. This is particularly given that the G’s track record on surveillance is already questionable. 

From a tech perspective, we don’t know how this works yet. One example: the device doesn’t have a net connection - but will it pair with smartphones? If so, data could be transmitted from the device to your phone and then onwards from there. Also, just because the device doesn’t track location doesn’t mean that the G can’t cross reference the data it collects from the device with other data sets it has. 

An additional consideration is that the G’s cybersecurity record is pretty poor, and data with this level of sensitivity is always going to be a nice prize for people looking to get at it.

But what happens if we see a micro-controller that isn't a standard part (for example, not one I can pick up at Sim Lim Tower?) and there's no datasheet? What if it just says ""CHINA"" on it with no part/bin number? I'd be more worried actually, maybe a foreign country would have put in a backdoor that activates it through a specific BLE signal? How would I know that this ""BLACK BOX"" does whatever you said? Yeah, I could technically ""scan"" the airwaves for signals, but then again, how the hell would I know what is stored inside it (especially if it is encrypted)? I can go on and on. And x5,000,000, by the way, because maybe it's only 10k devices that are rigged by the supplier (e.g. they knew that it would be distributed to PM/ministers or worthy targets).

It's the same as electronic voting. How the hell do I know that the computer can be trusted? I am a software engineer, I can check that the code is safe and correct (if it's open source). However, I can't check the hardware and the code it is ACTUALLY running, unless ELD allows me to bring an oscilloscope to the polling booth and probe each machine.

Time and time again has shown that many government around the world have failed in ensuring security of their technology, either due to laziness or incompetency. Heck, even US cannot secure their bloody nuclear silos properly, what more SG government and this small stupid, one-off project.

I don't think this has been confirmed, has it? In the Tracetogether app, if you test positive, MOH sends you a code that allows you to upload your data to the server, presumably through data network or Wifi. I would not be surprised if the device DOES have another means of transmitting data. The local implementation does not use the Google/Apple API, and I think it means that the connection between the device ID and your NRIC needs to be sent to the MOH server when you first register.

208,COVID-19 Wearable: Thoughts,2020-06-09 09:43:53,"What I think is that the idea of the device isn't fundamentally bad, but with many things, boils down to the issue of execution of said idea. Technology, of course, isn't going to be perfect, but it shouldn't be shunned altogether. 

As it is just a concept right now, I am perfectly fine with the idea. Theoretically, it does streamline the contact tracing process, and it solves the problem about iPhone users that cannot(?) use the TraceTogether app (forgive me, I'm an Android user myself).

The question has to be asked though: how secure does this entire system have to be in theory in order to convince the general population to accept this particular move? Security is never going to be watertight; some hacker out there is bound to find a way in. Open-source code is dangerous since there are more ways for malicious software to work it's way in, while developing the software internally brings its legitimacy and security under question since no one has the chance to look at and analyse it.

As much as the government is under fire for being incompetent and blundering through this crisis, I cannot bring myself to blame them for toying with this idea. The TraceTogether concept in itself breaks up the contact tracing process into it's simplest form: Person A is infected, find out who else is at risk of being infected by Person A, isolate and test them all. If through the device, all the government wants is my location with respect to everyone else, it's something I can abide them with, but it has been made painfully clear that the government is going to have to be extremely transparent with what they are putting out.

What I don't get are those that just go ""oh shit, a tracker? I'm going to be monitored 24/7 by the gahmen! Not using it!"" with no argument other than ""it's my privacy where I go.""

That's just a convenient cover.

The real reason is that without your NRIC, when MOH finds out that your phone has been a close contact, they can only call your phone number. If you hang up on them or refuse to follow instructions, they can't do much. Maybe they can check Singpass databases or demand that the Telco gives up your NRIC number, but this takes time. People may transfer phones within the family too. Anyway, if they have your NRIC, they can send enforcement agents to your address. Basically, you should be issued SHN already, the govt doesn't want to allow you to dodge by not responding.

That's also why the govt doesn't want to adopt the Google/Apple API. The latter would not allow linking of device with NRIC. If you were exposed, you'd get a notification, which you can choose to ignore i.e. not acceptable to MOH.

Nevertheless, I am ok with the NRIC link. It is consistent with the previous govt policies of close contacts identified by traditional means. No dodging allowed.",2020-06-09 10:39:33,187

iOS will direct BAR to prioritise apps that are frequently used. Which explains why they added the SafeEntry feature, so that people would use the app more often and hence increasing the priority of the app being picked up by BAR.
