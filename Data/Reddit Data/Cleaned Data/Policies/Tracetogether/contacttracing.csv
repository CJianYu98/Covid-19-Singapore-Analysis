Thank you for reflecting valid concerns.

The device has only Bluetooth proximity function, no GPS or no cellular connection.

Key advantage is battery life and privacy.

The battery will last many months before replacement is needed.

The data stays encrypted only with you. There are no complicatged cotnrols.

Just switch on once - that's it.

28,Singapore's move to introduce wearable devices for contact tracing sparks public outcry,2020-06-07 17:38:44,"The reason why people are skeptical about government tracking is because 1. Lack of transparency and 2. Misuse of the data. 

For 1, not saying that Sg govt has done enough, but they are already relatively transparent and increasing transparency is possible, so it is not a unsolvable limitation to government tracking. 

2, also unlikely in Singapore given past policing - you may disagree with the criteria for action, but it is fair. 

Data leaks in this specific case is also unlikely if the device only collects proximity data which what was is planned for the device.

I also find the reaction quite the irrational overreaction when people can agree with giving up a significant degree of personal freedom by staying at home to keep the virus at bay or using a contact tracing app but not agree to a tracking device. Especially so when nation-wide tracking may allow people to move more freely since clusters can be tracked more easily. If the device needs to be used after the virus has been solved, that's when we need to get angry, not now when every measure can help reduce cases and eliminate a second wave.

That said, a fob design for carrying in your pocket may have gone down marginally better than a ""wearable"" device like a wristband. That at least adds a layer of distance from the tracking device and our bodies, which may be emotionally more comfortable.",2020-06-07 23:02:32,232

31,Singapore's move to introduce wearable devices for contact tracing sparks public outcry,2020-06-07 17:38:44,"I don't get why people are so upset by this....

Everyone is complaining that the MRT, the buses, the supermarkets are too crowded and they fear getting infected. So obviously you would want to be contacted if you were in close proximity to a confirmed case.

Now how should the government trace you. Cameras/CCTV are hard to monitor and time consuming to trace people as you have to either hope they look directly into a camera and hope you can match the face in a database or you need to trace them all the way home, find out who they are and then contact them. This is not only inefficient, but costly as well.

So the best choice is tracing through an app or through a wearable device. Firstly you can't really make an app obligatory. Even if it is highly unlikely, what about people who don't have a phone? Does the government buy you a phone then? It's also hard for enforcers to check if people have downloaded the app. Additionally, if you contact trace through an app it sets a precedent for the government to track you through your cellphone. People such as Edward Snowden have warned that apps such as contact tracing apps will be useful during crisis, but will remain a part of life even after the pandemic. That's when people privacy is really violated. For people who aren't tech savvy (all our aunty and uncles) who don't know much about allowing location data access and such, this will really breach their privacy. A wearable device is a good option because you know when they are tracking you, and after the crisis you can throw out the device or return it. There's no fear of the government still tracking you. Enforcers can also easily see if you are wearing your device without having to stop you and talk to you.

Overall I think the wearable device is a good option. Where are you going that you don't want the government to know? Your friends house? A party? If that's why you don't want to wear the device then you are the biggest problem we have right now. Wearing the device would be as much hassle as remembering to wear a mask when you leave the house. After coronavirus passes you can ditch the device and chuck it out or give it back. Simple.

Edit: I really like my privacy, but I don't care if the government knows where I'm going in these times. Wow, I go out for my daily jog and go out once a week to get groceries at the nearest supermarket. Even if the data was hacked it's not useful. Giving up this tiny bit of data is such a small thing compared to knowing if you've been in close proximity to a COVID-19 case. And like I said, after the crisis you can throw out the device, or stop wearing it. If it's an app then only tech savvy people will truly know if the app has been completely deleted or if it's still secretly tracking you.

Edit 2: If you guys think that somehow wearing this device is a huge step up from what the government is already doing to track you, then I have some bad news for you.",2020-06-08 07:09:10,532

If you look at the FAQ for the API, you get a notification if the app finds a match and thinks you've been exposed. You receive info about what you should do next. But it does not say that the govt will know who you are. If you choose to ignore the notification, MOH will never know.

I prefer TraceTogether to SafeEntry. SafeEntry DOES tell the govt where you've been to, and you have to manually press quite a few buttons to do it. It also doesn't have info about how close you were to the infected person, for how long. You could be on  another floor/wing of the shopping center. Whereas TraceTogether doesn't give location data away, and works seamlessly. And the data stays on your phone unless you test positive. With the Google API, your bluetooth ID changes randomly very 10-20 minutes, defeating the conspiracy theory of the govt putting up stationary Bluetooth receivers everywhere to track your movements.",2020-06-08 08:44:24,176

Once a person is sick, the (anonymous) identifier is marked as infected, and published on a server. The app periodically checks published identifiers, and when it sees you have been in close contact with an infected identifier for more than X minutes, it prompts you to get tested.

Some countries (e.g. Belgium) have employed 3rd parties to audit apps and servers (to ensure privacy and/or security), although that doesn't necessarily mean they really are 100% secure, or anonymous. Keeping your BLE on might be not 100% secure, but IMO it's a thousand times more secure than constantly sending your GPS location to external servers...

If it does happen that the anonymous BLE identifiers can be de-anonymised, then the police would only be able to check who you've been in contact with in the last two weeks (assuming they have physical access to your phone and the app has no remote access, stores the list of seen identifiers only locally, and only identifiers seen in the last two weeks are stored).

The Bluetooth beacon will push a random low power identifier ‚Äúxxxx‚Äù, and if another beacon is nearby ‚Äúyyyy‚Äù it logs that random identifier. That random identifier is uploaded to a server saying ‚Äúxxxx saw yyyy‚Äù (the other device also does an upload with their ID).

On your device ‚Äúbob‚Äù, you report that you are infected. The server looks at all ‚Äúbob‚Äù uploads for the past two weeks, seeing all of the beacon pairs, and sends the ‚ÄúAlice‚Äù user a push notification saying the were exposed on the date/time the match was reported. 

I get the worry about someone injecting bad data in a beacon, although it is a short string and all garbage data is dropped.  

Protocol/interface attacks are a real worry, although **any** radio is a potential avenue: cellular, wireless, Bluetooth, NFC, and GPS.

Now, if a user tests positive they can then submit their broadcast numbers for the past 14 days (or whatever) to a central server that everyone polls periodically. If a number you retrieve from that server matches a number you've seen from broadcasts near you, that means you've been near an infected person and the app will warn you.

It's really very elegant and doesn't require location or identity data at all. In everyday use the only data that's exposed is a periodic poll request which reveals nothing other than that someone with your IP address is using the app. If you submit a positive result you may have to authenticate (to prevent abuse), but in that case your test result is already on record anyway. And there's no immediate way to derive location data from the numbers you upload.

It's not *perfect* from a privacy perspective, but it's a damn good compromise given the crisis.

The only ""maybe"" is if the devices register each other at all. How exact the time granularity will be ultimately depends on how often the IDs are rotated. If you do it too seldom, you can trace people passively because it becomes much easier to tie IDs to individuals. Typically it's in 5-15 minute increments. The number of days you store contact logs is a matter of policy, not protocol.

> I don't think you understand how it works.

Then please explain your take to me so that I can correct you.

In my understanding, users generate ephemeral IDs that are broadcasted over BLE. The IDs are rotated at regular intervals so as to prevent the correlation between users and their used IDs, and only the user's device can derive the sequence of ephemeral IDs used. The devices record broadcasted ephemeral IDs and store them locally on the device. Tracing is enabled by voluntary submission of reports of the seeds used to generate the ephemeral IDs. These reports are then distributed to all users so that they can check whether and when they were in contact with the user by correlating them with their contact log containing ephemeral IDs they've encountered.

Naturally, if an adversary can retrieve both the seeds from which the ephemeral IDs were generated and the contact logs of two users, they can know whether and when the users were in contact.

I suggest reading the DP-3T whitepaper if you want to be able to say ""I don't think you understand how it works"" without talking out of your ass.

> Stupid pedantry.

1) passing a law makes the contact tracing system more permanent and hence more suspicious (they cite that the TT system will end after the pandemic but who knows what they mean by this; many consider this move a test pilot for extended surveillance)

2) nobody asked for this, the police is already extremely efficient, and rather than apologising for planning to use the data for extra purposes beyond the pandemic, the government is doubling down on their decision by passing this law.

360,Singapore government to pass law to ensure contact tracing data can be used only for serious crimes,2021-01-09 19:18:21,"To keep track of who came into contact with confirmed covid cases, the govt has 2 systems:

1) safe entry: when entering malls and stalls, we must scan a QR code and enter our identity number

2) at first it was an app but then now given as a tictac-box sized token, tracetogether: it actively pings its presence to nearby phones/tokens. Each device is suppose to keep a log of the time and id of each recent device it got pinged. If one is confirmed with covid, their token gets checked to see the list of recently pinged devices that coincide during the duration of the infection. Then it gets checked against the registered database to see who owns that device id. Then the relevant persons get informed to come for a swab


-----

So you can see how the latter can get abused. Many were reluctant to install tracetogether on phone. Hence the tokens.

So recently police have been fiddling on using tracetogether data to locate criminal and/or confirm where suspects were (most probably by comparing with data saved in the device logs of known MOP in the vicinity at the time of the event, or maybe confirm alibi was with suspect)


So ye.


That's pretty sus. Before we know it, we become monitored and social credit score rating based on time spent at home or not at home ü§î

Singapore is a totalitarian authoritarian conformist state *and* an actual perfect futuristic utopia, the first time both those things have come together. A century ago it was a corrupt den of prostitution and drugs and misery. A previous leader ""Uncle Harry"" reformed the entire society, but to do so he had to come down hard on any sort of dissent or nonconformity that didn't support utopia. The thing is that Harry was a ""Benevolent Dictator"" which enabled the government and people to cede all authority to this charismatic and effective leader and his position. Usually in history after such a transfer is made subsequent rulers get worse and worse, drunk with power, and you end up with Hitler, Stalin or Nero.

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore‚Äôs migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures ‚Äúturned out to be insufficient‚Äù, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

> During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.

> In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date. Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.

> ‚ÄúOn 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,‚Äù said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.

> ‚ÄúHowever, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.‚Äù

> While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, ‚Äúno two crises are the same‚Äù, Teo said. The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is ‚Äúa major challenge‚Äù, he added.

> On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.

> ‚ÄúBut they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines‚Äù, he noted.

> The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH‚Äôs overall medical support plan.

> Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.

> ‚ÄúThe operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak. About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,‚Äù he added.

> Teo‚Äôs delivery is the third in a¬†series of national speeches¬†by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister¬†Lee Hsien Loong¬†last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday. Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing is scheduled next to deliver his speech on Sunday.

> In his speech on ‚ÄúResilience in a changing external environment‚Äù,¬†Teo also spoke at length about Singapore‚Äôs efforts in providing community care facilities for patients who have mild or no symptoms.

> ‚ÄúWe had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and had started to build them. We accelerated these plans and scaled them up, adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April,‚Äù he said.

> At the peak on 12 May, some 20,000 patients were being cared for at community care and similar facilities, with as many as 1,000 are admitted daily, Teo said.

> ‚ÄúThis is more than the total number of beds in all our public acute hospitals. We mobilised resources from across our public service, government-linked companies, and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities. Healthcare volunteers stepped forward to help man them,‚Äù he stressed.

> ‚ÄúThis is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our healthcare system and putting lives at risk.‚Äù

> The clear lesson learned during the COVID-19 outbreak is that Singapore needs to plan in peace-time ‚Äúon facing the unknown, and build deep reserves of people and capabilities, so that when we face a crisis, we can act decisively, and respond flexibly and rapidly‚Äù.

> He referred to past challenges in Singapore‚Äôs history such as in 1967 when the British announced the withdrawal of their troops from the city-state. With the move, Singapore was poised to lose 20 per cent of its gross domestic product and 70,000 jobs at a time when the population was half of what it is today, Teo said.

> ‚ÄúWe are far more resilient today than in 1967, and better positioned to create new markets, businesses, and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.‚Äù

> Singapore also rode out the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Asian and global financial crises. ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is an even bigger test,‚Äù he added.

> The outbreak is the first major crisis for many of the new generation of ministers and civil servants taking the lead in efforts to tackle the situation.

> The ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of their older Cabinet colleagues as well as consulted widely within and outside the government, Teo said.

> He added, ‚ÄúOver the past few months, I have worked very closely with them. We speak daily and exchange views freely. They have stepped up to the task, worked together as a team, and led from the front. This is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore.‚Äù

As for what Minister Jo Teo's did / said, I think the lapses under her ministry, while not directly responsible for Covid-19, did contribute to the rapid spread of the disease amongst our migrant worker population. Had she been more amiable, less arrogant, I think more people would have given her a pass (She seems to be trying for Minister Shanmugam's style, without having his charisma). Covid-19 has really wrecked havoc all over the world. Again, all of the above are my opinions. 

With regards to Ho Ching, I wholeheartedly agree with you. It's embarrassing to see the wife of our PM act in such a childish and classless manner. So far in this crisis, I see PM Lee only when he's giving speeches, but he has been reassuring, and his messages in different languages tailored to the audience. His speeches have been lauded, on reddit, on my facebook feed from my foreign friends, as well as on the news. So, to see Mdm Ho Ching act in such an infantile manner is really disappointing. But, she's not a politician, and free to act and say as she please. I just think the way she acts and speaks isn't befitting of my respect, at least on social media. 

Again, this entire post is just my opinion. :D",2020-06-13 08:07:02,261

569,"Singapore reports 932 new COVID-19 cases, bringing total past 17,000",2020-05-01 15:13:43,"Some thoughts - given the high level numbers and the disparity between cases in the various categories (dorms only, Singaporeans/PRs, work pass holders, work permit holders etc), I barely pay too much attention anymore to the preliminary high level number that comes out at \~3pm everyday. We have to wait for the detailed updates at night to get a better sense of how the situation is progressing.

In particular, I'm paying close attention to community cases and work permit holders not living in dorms (I'm conservatively assuming these people are still part of the community, but most should be serving 14 day SHNs). I reckon we need to see both community cases only (Singaporeans/PRs + work pass holders) AND community cases + work permit holders not in dorms stay low for at least 2 weeks before we start getting our hopes up. Dorm cases pretty straight forward there - given the tight living conditions and aggressive testing, i reckon we see high numbers for a while more before we start seeing the results of the distancing measures that were implemented about 2 weeks back for the dorms.  


Also - keeping brief track of unlinked cases is also somewhat important. In particular, both the absolute number of unlinked cases on a particular day AND following up the next day or couple to see if those unlinked cases have been linked (they do tend to take a while to link some cases because contact tracing etc is a VERY tough job). This is important because if they can link a specific case to an existing cluster and/or infected person, there is a lower possibility of there being existing further community spread that the authorities don't yet know about. Ideally would like to see those unlinked numbers stay low AND have the authorities constantly being able to link cases on a daily basis (which they have).

If you need any hard evidence and/or anecdotes that social distancing works, just look at the trend of community cases and work permit holders not in dorms over the past 2 weeks. So please. PLEASE STAY AT HOME AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.",2020-05-01 23:14:37,347

when got good news can talk cock about how this is due to good governance by pap. ask ppl to look at countries with bad govt like malaysia or leaders like trump. say its good sg got no free media or multi party goverment to distract pap.   

but if got bad news its somehow its the collective responsibility of all singaporeans. like millions of ppl petitioned manpower ministry to ignore their cramped overcrowded conditions for decades. or if got referendum where ppl voted that josephine teo should listen to dorm/biz owners and just leave rules up to dorm owners. who told govt to dismiss ngo's concerns for dorm conditions for years. 

some human decency should say that give these ppl a decent accommodations. at least army standard bunks with space and furnishing. 

some foresight would show that fw living in cramped conditions and deterred for years to report sick would have been prime target for virus cluster

some humbleness would have allowed you to listen to ngo's who as recent as last month wrote letter to 154 about the dorm conditions. or not treat dissenting views as enemies

now healthcare resources get stretched by high virus numbers. will other patients suffer due to lack of resources?

> SINGAPORE - Cruise ships are being assessed for their feasibility as temporary housing for foreign workers who are recovered from Covid-19 and tested negative for the virus.

> SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius, mid-sized cruise ships operated by Genting Cruise Lines, will be checked for consideration by the Government for factors such as ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures.

> If deemed feasible, the two cruise ships may be used to complement other interim facilities such as Singapore Armed Forces military camps and vacant Housing Board blocks that have been refurbished to house healthy workers.

> By reducing numbers of workers in existing dormitories, health measures can be implemented more effectively, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in a media statement on Friday (April 17) morning.

> Cruise ships are being considered for use as temporary housing as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact, added STB.

> SuperStar Gemini, which arrived from Hong Kong on Friday, is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SuperStar Aquarius may be activated for assessment at a later date.

> If deemed suitable, the two ships may accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers in total.

> STB said that ""if activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times"".

> Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

> Related Story Coronavirus: 3 more foreign worker dormitories declared isolation areas

> Related Story Coronavirus: Floating facilities ready to house healthy foreign workers

> While the spread of the coronavirus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially.

> As of Friday morning, the total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689, which is about 60 per cent of all Singapore's cases.

> There are now a total of 12 dormitories declared as isolation areas where workers at these lodgings must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.

639,Coronavirus: Cruise ships assessed for feasibility to temporarily house healthy foreign workers,2020-04-17 12:51:50,"Came here to say, this will not help and it‚Äôs such a terrible decision.  
  
I know our Frontlines in charge of Covid containment is overwhelmed with work but this has to be said:  

**Edit: ignore the first 3 points. Cruise for recovered FW.**  
1.They will do swap test first on those being relocated to these cruise- **but tests are known to have turn out negative initially** so they can still be infected.
   
2.These FW aren‚Äôt fully quarantined, **they are still going to work**.  
(Another concern, are we asking FW to continue wearing mask throughout work? again, if not then it‚Äôll obviously be more likely to spread Covid. Perhaps their work already requires them to wear a mask idk.. I‚Äôll just point this out so anyone in the know can work it out so no FW faints doing  labour work because of a suffocating mask whole day.)
   
3. Bad publicity worldwide. Once an outbreak occurs on this cruise(unless it‚Äôs contained very well, which is just betting ur luck.)
   
4. We should be applying lockdown for all FW living in crowded/shared dorm for at least 14days to make sure our healthcare doesn‚Äôt get strained more.
   
5. Imo, It makes no sense to let our FW continue work during this CB and Dormitory spike. We should solve the crowded dorm issues first, since we currently have community spread going on we shouldn‚Äôt react as if FW bringing Covid back to temporary dorm or causing further spread in community isn‚Äôt likely. 
   
My suggestion: I don‚Äôt know the capacity our country can do to house as many of them separately. But if surveillance is an issue, we can make mid shift shelters and get general public to help monitor via camera(we report to authorities if anyone try to sneak out) hopefully this will help slow the spread and we can get some breather for our frontlines.  
(For the sake of everyone, We will have to endure and work together if rubbish and cleaning or other essentials done by FW is disrupted.)
   
Before *you* start flaming aimlessly. Lockdown and surveillance means, **temporary** build a fenced shelter/tents for few weeks so the dormitory issues doesn‚Äôt turn tragic(we will only monitor the fences to make sure no one flout).

Edit: just realised it was for recovered FW, heard on TV and saw the comments hence I didn‚Äôt check the article first sorry. But some of my points can be considered.

This is confusing though: 
>The STB said: ""If activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times.""

>Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins. [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/govt-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/govt-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders)

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

FWIW, I've commented on this a few times:

For companies, these construction workers are expendable. They get injured in the workplace, they get shipped back to their home countries after patching them up. You think a fine + bills is a ""wake up call"". Nah, it's just a ""one-off expense"", ""we got caught fine"", basically a gamble for them. The calculations for them is such that they can mistreat them and still be in the green (cos you know, these events don't happen every year).

They will just gladly pay up and mistreat them again. And you know what? They won't follow, they will try to bend the rules further (like people who flout SHN/CB rules) and that will result in worse conditions for the workers. For instance, if a worker gets XYZ communicable disease (assuming it isn't hard to test like COVID-19), instead of reporting, they will just quickly ship that worker back to this hometown on the grounds of ""slacking off at work"". There, we mitigated the spread, absolutely nothing happened in our dorms! Bring in the next healthy batch of workers.

What we need isn't punitive punishment only (not saying that they shouldn't foot the bill). What we need is regulations and oversight. Which is why I feel, just like our HDBs, housing for them should be government run. That way, the government has control over it and we have indirect control over how the government treats them (e.g. making it a voter issue for pete's sake).",2020-04-14 00:46:43,246

The last few weeks have shown that, no amount of appeals to common good is working... people just don't give a shit. Those who've run the dorms have been doing this years, and there's very little chance of them changing their ways, and if at all they do, there's a question of whether they'll do it fast enough.

Minister of State & Manpower stated

So if ""shitty conditions"" can pass MOM inspection standards.

Question to be asked:

* Are amenities adequate for the workers to use?
* Is the inspection criteria stringent to ensure liveability? (Electrical, plumbing etc) Or the inspection was done half fuck?
* Problem of deplorable living conditions have already been around from initial -> current ""satisfactory"" conditions. Are the laws/ standards created to hit the bare minimum of the workers ""rights""? Social workers working with them have already mentioned these issues over many years.

[Source](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-conditions-at-punggol-dormitory-could-have-been-better-maintained-as-it-was-made)

Even if the workers fuck shit up in the dorms, isn't inspection meant to uncover these teething problems and reflect it to ministry & dormitory providers?

I see all these moves by the governing agency to move them out as a way to 

* Solve current ""satisfactory but deplorable"" conditions on paper
* Solve the now exploding increase of infection rate
* Sweep their crap way of handling treating of FW from the past till current under the rug (inspection criteria) 
* Acknowledge but don't apologize for past failings wrt. handling of the foreign workers situation

Ultimately, we as a society need to pay the price for the situation mentioned above. Prices of HDB have remained pretty cheap while cost of workers have increased over time. We as a society have also chosen to push them away from general population areas in fear of losing property value etc.

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be. 

There are restrictions on how many beds you can put in a certain area, how many toilets per number of ppl, fire safety requirements, a sickbay separate from living qtrs must be planned, WiFi is compulsory, even entertainment is a must. These are all set out by big G not the dorm owners. Why will any dorm owner go beyond the basic requirement to make a loss? 

Most people will not believe it but the obscene environment is actually caused by the workers themselves. The best example is hanging clothes. By law, the dorm owner must specifically have an area just for hanging clothes because hanging clothes in your sleeping qtrs is asking for disease to spread but the workers would rather hang them in their own rooms for convenience. 

Many do not practice basic hygiene. My own employees said it was a living hell with bedbug infestations so we moved them out.

There's a limit to how much we can interfere with free market and more importantly, how nice should we treat the employees? Should the cost rise to 2-3k per employee?

The hard truth is that no one would do their work for the meagre salary. Theres also the hard labour that is not enticing under the hot sun or stifled conditions within construction. We should have been learning from examples like Australia, where they pay their labour workers well and a huge bulk of the hard labour jobs consists of their own people. This also creates a sense of pride within our community.

Going back to the main point, if we as a nation has been in such a situation where we dont rely on foreign workforce, the housing situation might not have happened and any form of exploitation would have been greatly reduced which in turns lead up to the fact that when a pandemic occurs, which is does throughout history, such a scenario we see unfolding would not have occurred.

DOs usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels. What are the demands? How do we balance between quality and cost. I believe that you wouldn't expect DOs to operate at a loss unless they're doing charity and expected to make some profit.

Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others. Do you think that I will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other, lousier dormitories are charging?

Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price? Would DOs that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive? Those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general.

Then you might say that, why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better. Then again who is paying for it? If it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories, how do we get people to do it? If the cost increases, are the workers suppose to pay for the increase? Or are the employers expected to absorb the fee? Or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers. And we have another recurring problem.

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

We need to be careful with this as well, otherwise the costs for the better dorms will be passed to the workers. A majority of them won't want this - they just want to do their time, earn enough, and leave as soon as possible.",2020-04-14 10:13:57,173

A couple if not more bunk beds in a room, depending on room size with shared living area.

They aren't living in inhuman conditions. I doubt they will be fined except for if safe distancing law applies to the dorm supervisors. The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well. HUGE FINES like people are hoping for probably won't happen.

If it all adds up it might be substantial, but nothing big enough to invoke waves of change. Stricter supervision will become a thing, but I doubt they will suddenly be living in better homes. While living conditions were not stellar, they were livable. There were no major issues prior to Covid. So the majority of this outrage is stemming from *distancing issues.*

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

If anyone of you can solve these issues, and compile the math and financial budget required for any minister to undertake this task, be my guest.

I don't have issues with the size per room. I have stayed before. But I do with two things, the maintenance and the size of dorm.

The size is fixed by the MOM guidelines of certain sqft per pax. Not the most comfortable but they are just cheap accommodation. For the maintenance, I know and I've seen how sloppy it can get. On facilities and all. Yes, I think they should be subjected to fines for that.

Seen the pictures of MOM approved dorms online. Yes, some dorms are a bit messy and look cluttered; but area wise, it is comparable to our NS dormitories. 

IF our SAF soldiers and NSFs can stay in such ""inhuman"" bunks, why can't our foreign workers? The complaint, rather should be - maybe we should be making the dorm operators enforce some level of discipline. Maybe more ""stand by area"" and ""area cleaning"". Or hire more cleaners.

Don't forgot that if you actually read the regulations, you will see that it is mandated by law for every dorm to have common areas for recreation; rooms to hang their clothes; sick bays and even wifi.

1. Do we need that many foreign workers in the first place?

So there is still space to reduce the number of workers while still maintaining the same output. 
2. Do we really lack space? Some of the bosses of these dorms own a couple of landed properties for themselves both in and out of Sentosa. Maybe its time to consider a more utilitarian approach to the use of our land. If we are so land-scarce as you say, then why allow people to own more property than they need? 
3. Lastly, why must the solution fall on us? Govt sets the law and the market should be left with its own devices to come up with solutions. That is the beauty of capitalism.

They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers.

If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore.

The logic of  causality that you are parading is mistaken. If they weren't clustered in the first place, and covid did happen, their high infection rates could have been avoided. You cant just blame everything on covid as if it is a singular cause. If we can do that, then why not just blame Raffles for founding Singapore.

If  the govt is doing the work in coming up with ideas and solutions to keep construction companies profitable, then is it really capitalism? Might as well keep the profits for ourselves then. The solution on our end is just set the minimum requirements, then let the market decide for themselves how they want to work things out. Its the same with other forms of regulations we have. Take the example of internet banking that is happening right now. Govt sets the minimum requirements and the private sector competes with each other for the license and figures it out for themselves how to get it done. We dont have to go into detail to tell them how to do it. You want government to provide them with programmers and coders and customer support staff? No. You set the floor, and let the companies do the work. That's the point of capitalism.

And if it ends up making things harder for the FW, then we adjust and try again. Policy is always open-ended in that sense.

Edit: Speaking of economics, the pertinent problem here is that  these companies are causing a negative externality in the form of higher spread of disease. This negative externality is borne by the public. Now if you really know your economics, you know exactly what we must do in face of negative externalities: Tax.

I've adequately answered in my other post why clustering was unavoidable. We can spew rhetorics about for 10,000 years about how you think tech could magically cut down the amount of foreign worker necessary by half so we suddenly only need to cram 6 instead of 12 to a room, but clustering was never an issue until today and it was necessary for the foreign workforce. The point being argued is that clustering was inhumane.

It isn't.

I am not defending companies for capitalism. I am tackling the illogical. I don't need to be on the companies side to call people out for whining without giving concrete solutions. Defending the companies would be saying they don't need to take responsibility. I never said that.

Im pretty sure all the economists who argue for govt intervention to mitigate negative externalities (such as this one) are idiots. 

Also, I'm not sure why you think criticism MUST come with neatly packaged solutions. Criticisms are valid, whether or not a better alternative is readily available. It is valid to point out that, for example, ""coal-powered plants pollute the Earth"". That's just a fact. That statement does not need to come with the following argument that ""coal plants should be replaced"" for it to be true. Just like the fact that ""taxpayers are paying for the negative externality caused by companies that hire foreign workers."" How is it wrong to point out the illogical?",2020-04-15 01:47:30,113
842,"Opinion: Companies that are running the foreign worker dormitories should be the ones footing the bill for the treatment of the foreign workers, not the taxpayers.",2020-04-14 00:34:02,"1) Literally difference in belief once again. Like I said, I don't believe in capitalism. Negative externalities will never be covered by the market, are you insane? How much compromised rivers and seas polluted by waste and natural water resources occupied by private enterprise do you need before you realize government intervention is needed to mitigate that shit?

2) Sure you can be critical, the hell are you on about. I didn't try to censure you or attack your freedom of speech. I can simply attempt to shoot down your criticism if it's a stupid criticism. I think your proposal that tech would magically solve the problem is unrealistic, and I think your proposal that simply putting in regulation is stupid. 

Your entire argument boils down to this: prodding the market will fix it.

You are underestimating the shithole the market is.

3) Again I think you're being dumb. You back yourself into a corner if you criticise coal but provide zero alternatives. What do you do when asked so what? You just tell them to have the market find alternative for you. Meanwhile the market is doing everything in their power to fund the notion that coal is a necessary evil through fudged bias studies, and that coal isn't that bad. 

That is not true. It's because of extremely convincing proposals that alternatives are viable and the cost will be lowered that countries adopted a different policy. 

You are pointing out wat you think is the illogical, I am point out what I think is illogical. The statement does not contradict.",2020-04-15 10:14:51,253
