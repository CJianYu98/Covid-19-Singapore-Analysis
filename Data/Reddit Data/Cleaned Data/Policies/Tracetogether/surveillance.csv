2) Privacy. Aren’t current measures already invasive enough? Just look at the amount of CCTVs we have around us. Plus, I am pretty sure that the authorities can track each one of us via current technologies if it wishes to. So what is the point of making all of us wear that shit when we go out?

Questions have to be answered in parliament. That's the point of parliament. The fact that there are no details means they are still in the discussion phase. It takes time to develop custom devices. They can't tell you details when they don't have details.

My point is that the implications of tracetogether or this new wearables scheme, assuming it is mandatory, should be properly debated.

If the government believes that there's a justifiable tradeoff between privacy and security (or in this case public health safety), then it should be clearly and tactfully presented to the public, given to robust debate, with concerns properly aired and addressed, so that people themselves can be convinced that the tradeoff is acceptable.

Convince people to adopt, rather than use a blunt-force instrument and railroading it through with mandatory legislation.

The government does have some catching up to do in order to bridge the trust deficit in light of rather egregious events like the Singhealth breaches and blood donor data leak. Stuff like PM Lee's personal particulars and medically confidential data being leaked may seem like funny news to some, but the implications are far from funny.

Civil liberties and personal privacy, however trivial it is thought to be, should be jealously guarded and not lightly given up. Once surrendered, it's very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.

The article was written based on a question in Parliament regarding asking whether Tracetogether will be made compulsory. The minister has to answer the question, that is the point of parliament. 

The precedent set is that Tracetogether did not use location data, and was open source so people could inspect the code to check for themselves if they did not believe it, which addresses privacy concerns.

The device hasn't even been developed yet. In my opinion, this petition is the blind leading the blind.

If this is how the average person sees it, is it not better for the government to come out and clarify things properly? I don't expect them to say every single detail, but at least address the privacy concerns. There is still going to be opposition, but now it is for them to prove that it is something to be concerned about.

>I do not know the petition's starter, or what kind of person he is, but at least he is being proactive to try making his voice heard instead of sitting back to wait for further developments. 

How does making up details help anything? If you seek clarification by writing a ST forum letter or starting a petition demanding an explanation then yes, I can believe the motive is to seek clarification. 

If someone is starting a petition by making up details to get people to support it instead of seeking clarification, then that is telling of the true motives of the starter. It tells me the motive is not to seek clarification in any way, but instead inciting people to think that the made up details are true. 

It does not help that others are forwarding the petition with these false claims backing it, getting even more people to subscribe to these blatantly false claims. 

I find that extremely irresponsible.",2020-06-07 01:11:06,295

Activity mapping showed that both individuals had visited the same church on Jan 19, 2020. C5 was identified through active case-finding. **Two other people with COVID-19 were subsequently linked to this cluster (C1 and C2, who are husband and wife)**. These individuals were Chinese nationals from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 19, 2020. **Re-interviews with C1 and C2 found they had also visited the church on the same day**. All five people were asymptomatic during the church visit (figure 1 lower panels)._  
  
_The church is an independent church that occasionally receives a few visitors from China at the Mandarin service conducted every Sunday.11 Although C1 and C2 were not church members, they attended the 2-h morning service when they travelled to Singapore. They left immediately after the service and did not report having lunch at the church. Based on closed-circuit camera findings, **C5 occupied the same seat as did cases C1 and C2 at the prayer meeting after the morning service, but they did not recall meeting each other**.""_

100,Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for surveillance and response measures,2020-03-21 22:27:33,"> Interpretation
SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community.

Interpretation of their interpretation (after few hours of sleep), combined with the collective thought consciousness, and possibly my personal biases laced with flawed logic:

If one wants to contain and minimise the risk of widespread community transmission via contact tracing as opposed to more stringent measures such as public activity lock down all the way until quarantining everyone in their houses, the former being gentler on the economy, then current methods of contact tracing that utilise interviewing an infected person is insufficient for a variety of reasons such as weak memory, memory loss, bad memory, corrupted memory, unwillingness to divulge embarrassing or compromising details etc., and many potentially infected contacts cannot be traced in a timely manner, if at all.

Additional methods which could help include using the TraceTogether app, activating Google Maps timeline and/or journaling your movement activity.",2020-03-22 15:44:07,188
