1,COVID app triggers overdue debate on privacy in Singapore | Civil Rights News,2021-02-11 06:21:46,"Calling it a debate is a gross overstatement imho. Like what, Straight Times doing an editorial questioning the respect of privacy by the government? 3 big newspaper answering it back to back with headlines, some calling it an abuse, some weighting the other way? TV shows putting head to head a privacy advocate slamming the government, a government official defending it, a lawyer with expertise in the field for good measure, and someone from the opposition party? When did this ever happen

Backlash and rumors and backtrack happened, but debate, not buying that, it’s still the age of libel law, fake news law, and media and public anchors keeping their head down, then people just rolling with it after a little rant",2021-02-11 10:10:07,122

Largely since the data resides with us until it is requested for investigations, as opposed to residing with government. It's little different from how phone data is used for crime.

As for how we know it won't be abused-- well, there's a law which restricts its usage, that's about as much as I can say.

initially singapore tested an optional tracking app but nobody used it and it didnt work.

>Revelation 13:16‭-‬18 KJV

But whatever happens, NEVER take the mark of the Beast. Anyone who does will be cast into the eternal lake of fire.

>And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, **If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,  The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb**:  And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

A cashless, digital, debt forgiving system) we will have the option to receive the mark of the beast. They cant force us directly (think vaccines, not mandatory but they can exclude you from society without them). When the second beast comes it will seem as if its something good but its not, Its a false light. Its going from evil to bad, so you think its a good thing and you are tricked into accepting the mark. 

Here's a video that helps understand. Its the third video of a series but you'll get the gist of it without watching the others. It's long, but pretty interesting.
