The fact is Singapore has always been almost a full blown dictatorship. There are opposition parties in theory but they are powerless. Totally unacceptable practices for us are there, such as criminalization of homossexuality, and physical punishment. Migrants are treated as short of subhuman. They are without question an horrible hellhole that no one would rationally choose over Europe. We don't shit over them the way we shit on other dictatorships because they are rich.

Further discuss also brought suspicion that he and Minister of Home Affairs, K Shanmugam had some miscommunication behind the scenes for TT and was made somewhat a half scapegoat for it. 

That incident also sparked some debate among people. One side said that hiding it can help accelerate collection of TT tokens and app installations for contact tracing in order for quicker transition to phase 3 and a further partial lift of lockdown, and health comes above all else. Another thou believe that this incident further eroded the trust we had in government transparency and policies which is already shaky beforehand even before the pandemic and it should have been clarified beforehand before collection of TT token exercise started.

> Most of those seen in queue were senior citizens.

> Progressively increase number of collection centres

> Currently, TraceTogether token collection is restricted to residents' constituency community centres.

> However, in days to come, the TraceTogether token and app to do SafeEntry check-in at certain venues with large groups of people in Singapore will soon be compulsory.

> It was previously reported that each TraceTogether token costs S$20 to make.

I think it's definitely possible with the current architecture that base stations can be set up at choke points to sniff all the traffic from TraceTogether tokens.

The base stations will then be linked up to a central server to collate the wealth of data for data analysis.

Data from TT Tokens can then be used to link up with other forms of data points that have lower confidence levels, such as EZ-Link cards, bank cards, CCTV footage to build up and calibrate models that will allow a central authority to predict people's movements with higher confidence levels even after TT has been removed. 

**Geo-location Data without GNSS (GPS/GLONASS/Beidou/Galileo/QZSS)**

Given that TT Tokens do handshakes with other tokens that are sending out messages, how can people be sure that there aren't also other base stations that have known locations actively beaming out handshakes? This will allow the central authority to be able to say: ""Ok so this guy got this specific token ID which we know to be at XXX location. This means that this guy went to XXX location at XXX time.""",2020-11-28 15:12:02,247

In case of private/public companies they have strict rules to follow and the government doesn’t own the data. Instead they have to formally request for it. The granularity of location data (for example) is not very high. mobile devices are able to detect and send location from tower data alone but it again is not extremely accurate if you want to create a view of who is in contact with whom. That process is also very data compute intensive and can only be done in retrospective on offline infra, not the online infra (except law enforcement requests).
Today all data is getting captured in isolation in different buckets and it only gets stitched together into a view based on need. However what TraceTogether presents is an opportunity to create an online way of running an efficient query on this data which is being aggregated online.

In my view if the aim was to only capture and Ensure that everyone was compliant then it would have been enough to run the TT app on a device and have a led indicating it was online. There was no need to scan the trace together tokens at entrances. Similarly for mobiles, the app could show on screen that it’s compliant and let them enter. Why scan the QR code.

Social media platforms and big tech don’t give all data to the government and the government will never directly ask at the risk of it blowing up. 
Also the data you get from social media and other tech companies are not granular enough to create a correlation with a specific named individual (as per official records). They aggregate content which is approximate. For example Google knows you by the advertising id or probably your device id and if you use two separate devices with separate id’s it’s tough for them to correlate the two as one individual.

With TraceTogether the data is extremely granular and identifiable. If for example the government wanted to do target advertising, they would know your device id (from TraceTogether), your identity, preferences etc and then they would create campaigns with specific curated audiences and instead of casting a large net, you could be targeted directly including through SMS etc. You may not realise it’s a custom curated message. This makes the spend on targeted messaging extremely efficient. Like imagine Facebook doing a ID check for every account and knowing he people behind it.

The China isn’t directly relevant but just an example to show how far you can go with data.

But what’s more relevant is the social scoring system in China through which the government can identify “trouble makers”. People who do not toe the line. The social score doesn’t even need to be published but used by the government for all its decisions related to individuals.Now hypothetically if the government has this  “contact tracing” data it can tell them accurately who all one has been in close contact with enough to establish a relation/influence.

I'm saying, there is a fundamental difference in mindset and mentality between someone who chose to bear arms with a career in enforcement and someone who doesn't. I don't think there naivety in thinking that people will do what is practical. You don't need to be super nice to think that you don't want to go enforcing against possibly your own friends and relatives when it isn't your job.

That thought experiment is so far out. Do you think if Singapore faces an unemployment rate of 40%, it will be an overnight phenomenon instead of a gradual decline, and Singaporeans will mostly stay in Singapore to inevitably face the decline? Please name at least one developed nation which has faced 40% unemployment rate. Even the US in the great depression only faced 25% unemployment rate.

Say I entertain your thoughts. The unemployment rate has reached 40%, isn't it also possible that the Government uses a tracing system to make sure families get their fair ration at the food shelter and ensure no one abuses whatever welfare in place for this economical dystopian future?

Additionally, you must not be paying attention when you didn't think our Government isn't big. Singapore only arrived at where we are because our Government is big while being wildly pragmatic for a long period of time, lending to the credibility that we are the most geopolitical stable nation among our Asian brethren.  People are in fact screaming for our Government to be bigger, look at how left-leaning this sub has become. UBI has been picking up steam here. Yet people chose not to see that having UBI means surrendering individual economical power to government control, making the scenario you paint more likely than the current system.

Here's another thought experiment. Imagine that Indonesia is facing underemployment and a high unemployment rate. In order to find a scapegoat, they chose Singapore. Meanwhile, Singaporeans are divided from within due to people screaming how we are screwed and shaking the faith in the system while Indonesia capitalizes on that to run disinformation campaigns further putting seeds into the populace, somewhat like what is happening in the US. Indonesia successfully undermined our Government, ushering in a weak and incompetent populist Government, MNCs feel that the once corporate-friendly and stable geopolitical landscape in Singapore are no longer a certainty, and choose to instead to go to another cheaper neighbouring country since it's the same anyway. Then, would this be a scenario to lead to your scenario?

Whenever there is an economical calamity, what we see first is an exodus of the populace when it's possible. And armed uprising from civilians will first happen, leading to the government taking the chance to use martial law to suppress the populace.

To feed a military in a 40% unemployment rate scenario, what natural resources or illegal trade do you think Singapore can tap into to fund something like this? It's unreasonable to think that we have not exhausted all means in our financial resources to stop-gap an inevitable 40% unemployment rate scenario in Singapore. Or people are too stupid to see this is not viable and choose to stay in Singapore even as they already lost all reasons to stay here.

In SG, I don't think the rulers will go mad as much as the populace going mad first due to spreading paranoia to a group of unsecure people. And if the rulers went mad, it is extremely likely because the populace went mad first to usher in a mad government, like the US. We have many precedents to such scenarios which started out as populist movement in fact.",2020-12-01 11:01:04,820
