> SINGAPORE: With a falling number of community cases, Singapore is in a position to start the gradual easing of ""circuit breaker"" measures, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force announced on Saturday (May 2).

> Speaking at a virtual press conference, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong noted that with stricter circuit breaker measures in place for about two weeks, the number of new cases in the community has been on the decline.

> He said that some businesses will resume operations from May 12, with a gradual resumption of selected activities and services over a few weeks.

> Home-based businesses, selected food retail outlets, and food manufacturing firms will be among those that will be able to resume operations from May 12, co-chair of the task force Minister Lawrence Wong said at the press conference.

> Mr Wong added the authorities will start to bring back students in small groups or face to face lessons in May, focusing on cohorts who are taking national exams and are graduating.

> “It’s a small group, and we will do it with safe-distancing measures,” he said.

> In the meantime, registered Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners will be able to resume their acupuncture services and retail services on May 5. This was based on a comprehensive review, Mr Gan said.

> However, Mr Gan cautioned that “we are not out of the woods yet"".

> “New clusters can form if we let our guards down. We must press on with our efforts, so that we continue to keep the numbers low,” he said.

> The rest of the circuit breaker measures continue to be crucial, and will remain in force till Jun 1, he added.

> The Government will be able to further roll back some of the circuit breaker measures if the situation is “clearly under control” till Jun 1, he added.

> “Even then, it will be a new normal we all have to adapt to,” he said.

> 

> Singapore's economy will open up ""step by step"" when the number of COVID-19 cases in the community falls, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Thursday in his May Day message.

> Singapore is into its fourth week of a ""circuit breaker"" period to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. Safe distancing measures have been tightened and the circuit breaker extended by another four weeks to Jun 1.

Contact tracing activities are still being performed for the unlinked cases but they eventually get traced back to someone eventually, so I’ll leave them out for the purpose of this discussion.

The imported cases are self explanatory. Those infected through family contacts are understandable and expected. But those infected through their other contacts shows that safe distancing measures and, perhaps, personal hygiene maintenance are not being strictly observed. This is why we see an almost daily update to the mitigation measures implemented. People are not getting it!

Scrolling though social media you’d find that the odd small gatherings are still happening. And their rationale would be that these are the only people they see. But that is not how it works. We are not in a lockdown; work continues, schools are still running, people are out and about; essentially life continues. The only way we can keep everything ‘open’ is if everyone really adheres to the safe distancing measures. Also, stop talking on public transport and other confined spaces.

> SINGAPORE: There is no “magic solution” to the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore, and a series of brakes are needed to handle the situation, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Mar 31).

> When asked at a press conference why Singapore has not been locked down, Mr Wong said: “There is a view, I think, that people sometimes say, ‘why don’t you just … don’t have to wait, just go for the drastic measures now, go for the so-called lockdown today, do it for two weeks then life can go back to normal’.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> “There is no such magic solution as (a) two-week lockdown and then we are free from the virus. It will not happen.”

> Several countries have heavily restricted people’s movement, including Malaysia and Indonesia, while parts of Europe have declared lockdowns.

> Singapore could put in more “drastic measures” sooner, but the minister said that would not “eradicate the virus”.

> “It will still be with us, and we will still have to continue with this set of measures – like what we are today – for maybe months,” explained Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministerial task force looking at the COVID-19 situation.

> “We are in this for the long haul. We have to prepared that we have to deal with this situation for quite a long period of time.”

> Singapore will be “exposed continuously to recurring waves of infection from around the world” and local transmission within the country that will continue.

> On Tuesday, Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo said that regulations will be amended to ensure that employers are doing all they can to encourage workers to telecommute, rather than come into the office.

> Mr Wong said that “extra brakes” can be put in if the situation warranted it.

> When asked if there was a ""trigger point"" for when a lockdown might be implemented, Mr Wong said the measures are a ""series of brakes which you can put in place"".

> ""Rather than use a phrase which means different things to different people - because people have different interpretations of what a lockdown means - we look at the measures specifically and what these measures imply,"" the minister added.

> The task force has set out baseline measures that will continue for sustained periods, and ""extra brakes"" on top of those measures.

> Singapore has enforced ""moderate brakes"", such as preventing large-scale gathering and safe-distancing measures.

> ""We will not see the benefits of these measures until one or two weeks later, so it's a bit too early to say the measures are not working,"" he said.

> ""Whatever cases we are seeing now ... symptoms came a week ago. You have to look forward and look at the data (that) we will continue to monitor and look at what happens to the trends of local cases, unlinked cases over the next one, two weeks.

> ""There is no magic two-week solution to this. These brakes have to be applied for a sustained period. If the situation improves, we remove some brakes. But even as we remove these brakes, we will not go back to zero.

> ""We will still need a set of precautions - could be baseline, could be more than baseline - but if the situation does not improve, then we apply extra brakes.""

> He said this ""posture"" of apply and removing brakes will go on until at least the end of the year.

However, please, no half-measures please, like e-scooters:

>France on Friday (Oct 25) officially legalised the use of electric scooters and similar devices, but banned them from footpaths, highways and rural roads.

>They may normally only be used on cycle paths and city roads with a speed limit of 50kmh or less.

Lockdowns are a desperate move, but should help flatten the curve when a high percentage of people comply (as death rates rise I’m sure more people will be scared into compliance).

It is important to remember that we are in it for the long haul, as our ministers have said many times. Honestly, our rate of increase in local cases has been staying rather constant the past few days and that's a pretty good sign.

Most of the other countries that initiated a lockdown knew the situation was spiralling out of control and they had little choice but to sacrifice the economy to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. I think part of it is also because China's an authoritarian state so that was easy to mandate, and it worked for them, so other countries follow it too. Thankfully, we have not reached that point yet, and I hope we won't.

215,[Compiled] Circuit-breaker measures,2020-04-11 23:05:16,"""Delivering essential goods or services"" line is targeted towards those who do it as a job, ie Grabfood people etc. Govt has clearly stated that if you do not have a job in essential services, you should not leave your house except for essential services (takeaway food, buy grocery, medical services etc for yourself) or solitary (or with household member) exercise. This is from the perspective of strictly following the law and spirit of the circuit breaker measures.

If you really wanna exploit some grey areas, maybe you can sign up to be a deliveryman or something. Or if their family members still have the same address on their IC, this is also a potential exploitable loophole. Even if this is done, it is strongly recommended that contactless delivery is done, since he is given 5 day SHN/MC due to flu-like symptoms. But in doing so, you would have done non-essential commuting against the spirit of the circuit breaker measures, possibly exposing yourself to contracting COVID19 if someone on the public transport were to have it.",2020-04-12 15:27:04,174

Why punish the people who legitimately are exercising or buying groceries or tapauing food because they can’t afford to have food delivered daily? Why threaten to take away privileges?

We are so used to this as Singaporeans, with schools and the army drilling in this notion that we need to punish everyone to get the few bad seeds to cooperate. In this CB situation, the bad seeds are likely far out of the influence of those abiding by the rules, unlike say a classmate in school or a bunkmate. I can’t very well scream at random kids or uncles gathering in the park can I? 

I say for situations like these you need to precisely catch and punish the few who do break the rules more harshly. Safe Distancing Ambassadors are in an unfortunate spot here, but it kinda IS their responsibility for now. I don’t envy them. But leave the obedient folks alone.

It’s echoed worldwide, and is as common as it is sensible. You know what would be unpopular? The possibility that isolation and lockdowns turn out to be temporary solutions; that the virus flares up once restrictions are eased. When we come to that, some uncomfortable questions need to be asked. What is the nominal value of avoiding casualties? Its not actual cash, obviously, but an accounting measure that helps us weigh different things like our jobs, the economy, our values, the value of lives, etc.

A year-long lockdown/free-to-roam on/off cycle with consumers stuck at home half the time would obviously hurt GDP. But more than that it would’ve taken its toll on our mental health as we endure months upon months at home. Investments would be postponed further and innovation and productivity stall; the cranking of the economic engine to get back to normalcy would be more strenuous.

Yes, when a team of young footballers are stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand, the world comes together to demonstrate the strength of the human spirit, of our shared values, with no consideration of cost - as it should be, and that’s good. But during wartime or crises, tough questions have to be asked, and responsible leaders will have to find a way to weigh the costs against the benefits.

As much as I am loathe to say it - when the Orange Man in the US suggested that the “cure mustn’t be worse than the virus” - he does have a valid point, however unpopular it may be. And I say these having just recovered from bronchitis a year earlier - not sure if that qualifies as a pre-existing condition.

Point is, we may have to recognise that the costs of distancing might just outweigh the benefits. I’m just glad I’m a normie who doesn’t have to make that call - I’d hate to take the flak and be vilified for doing what’s economically necessary and pragmatic, but morally tough to swallow.",2020-04-11 01:15:15,345

I'd like to challenge that previous advisories were not a mistake, merely that different scenarios require different measures. 

Take the mask wearing for example. Why now everyone have to wear? Because we are missing a lot of links and we suspect there are hidden cases still in the community (not in isolation). Hence now it makes sense to have everyone wear because now we want to assume everyone is potentially a carrier and hence you should wear masks to protect OTHER PEOPLE AROUND YOU. 

Its almost as if we can only have one right measure and the right measure is right at all points in time.

Kiasi - omg this vaccine so new, later long term side effect how?

The fact the crowds gather and queues form, showed that civilians comply with measures because they have to (and maybe agree with), but failed to grasp the overall principle of saying away from crowds (esp for frivolous reasons) and staying safe. 

“I wore my mask and I stayed at home during CB... how have I broken the law or rules by queuing up for bubble tea?” I guess we’re clever enough to identify loopholes and follow mandatory regulations, but less wise in practising the overall principle. 

If there was a strong cause for concern, civilians would have, by their own initiative, stayed away from crowds or unnecessary gatherings. And it’s all about whether the individual wants to do so. Case in point: when COVID first broke out in SG, people started to avoid entertainment outlets and Chinese hotpot restaurants- all by their own will, no rules enforced.

378,How effective would Singapore have managed the coronavirus without CB and mandatory mask wearing?,2020-12-20 23:44:41,"Initially I thought CB was not necessary as community cases were considered under control and at that time, the cases in the dorms have not exploded. Announcement was on 3 Apr, CB on 7 Apr, 229 dorm cases on 9 Apr ([Source - the ""Number of Cases"" tab](https://covidsitrep.moh.gov.sg/)). I would imagine if the CB had been implemented a few days later - I think there will be real fear.

With hindsight, we probably will end up like KR and JP now at best, as fatigue sets in.

I also did not fully appreciate the fact that the CB was really necessary to buy time for the authorities to ramp up hospital, community care, isolation, testing, contact tracing & basically everything else that has their supply chain messed up. I think the difference between Singapore and many other countries is that Singapore really took this very seriously and we now see that we are able to have all the necessary tools to deploy at request.

Another difference between Singapore CB and the lockdown in other countries is that we did it way before it went out of control & healthcare systems at the brink of collapse. So how we choose to exit it may be slow, but so far it seems to be effective. Those that hastily exited lockdowns have been burned e.g. IL & AU.

Lockdown should have been initiated much earlier, we went through weeks of rolling the dice with no mask wearing, minimal measures, borders still open, etc. This was when the virus was at it's most dangerous as nobody knew if it was going to be worse than it turned out.

A hard lockdown at that point followed with leaving borders closed/ strict quarantine for returning Singaopreans could have lead to quick elimination.

I'm an American living in a major metro area. I've been watching mainly Vietnam during the pandemic, as well as other countries, to compare how it's going in my situation vs. elsewhere. It's pretty clear to me that enforcement of risk mitigation protocols is necessary, and at the population level it's impossible to expect everyone to cooperate and comply. There will always be people who break the rules. The only exception I know of is Japan, where COVID rules are just suggestions and there's no legal enforcement. They're the only society where this could work, as their culture is uniquely equipped to handle this. 

In my situation, and for the vast majority of Americans, COVID doesn't affect them directly. I am indirectly, negatively affected because I stay informed of the unfavorable statistics, death rate, hospitalizations, etc, as well as the socio and political friction that the pandemic has caused in my country and globally. 

Compare this to Singapore, where COVID statistics are much more favorable, but COVID rules are enforced, and lockdowns were mandatory and enforced. I wonder how it feels to be in Singapore during COVID compared to how it feels in America. Isn't life pretty much normal for you guys right now? Small social gatherings, mostly OK and fine? 

In America, if you don't pay attention to the news, and don't care about COVID statistics, don't have concern about the minority of people ( who are old/obese/other comorbidities) who are getting hospitalized, then I imagine life's pretty easy and peachy. There's no real restrictions on anything, and most businesses are open to some capacity. But it does seem like people are voluntarily isolating much more than before. And masks aren't exactly enforced, but the vast majority of places have a requirement, and people voluntarily wear them with pretty decent compliance. Obviously America is a very large place, so YMMV on this judgement. This is based on my major metropolitan area and friends who live in other large metropolitan areas.",2020-12-21 14:16:35,336

407,How effective would Singapore have managed the coronavirus without CB and mandatory mask wearing?,2020-12-20 23:44:41,"Before I answer the question, I will say a few things.

First off, by asking people to consider a different statistic, there is a slight chance that you are implying that the American authorities, the American media and health experts in America are involved in a conspiracy to lie to the American public. Especially when the LA Times are tracking admitted and confirmed cases, suspected cases in hospitals, and even the health infrastructure of LA county. These numbers are pulled both from the LA County's Department of Public Health, which is a part of the wider monitoring network of California's Department of Public Health. Included in the graphs is this disclaimer:

> Number of daily cases will not match the number of newly reported Los Angeles County cases as episode date reflects date of underlying illness rather than date of report.

The implication of this is that the LA County's numbers will lag behind the LA Times' number.

Secondly, and most importantly, had you bothered to explain yourself as to why we should consider your statistic rather than seemingly dismiss the explanations outright, you'd be met with far less hostility and you'd come off as less of a douchebag. Especially when you start with

> Lol. Quick to press the downvote button I see.

rather than your explanation. So don't be surprised when someone tries to call you out on your bullshit.

It gets way, way worse when you accuse me of ""grasping at straws"".

Don't want to be treated like an ass? Stop acting like one.

And now, the answer is, **no, considering we couldn't even accurately test how many migrant workers had the disease.** And especially when you said. 

>You assume that the proportion of cases detected in tests is not far off from the actual cases in the population. This has repeatedly been said to be unlikely by the experts over there.

And this can be corroborated with the fact that we could not get an accurate number of foreign workers infected with COVID-19.",2020-12-21 03:27:55,327

Well, in that case, happy to act like an ass in your definition. And continue with your strawplay if that makes you happy.

Fact of the matter is, I never said nor implied that the reported positive test results were fake/cooked up or anything like that. You are the one who suddenly jumped in like a douchebag, and came up with this half-assed and irrelevant question on whether I was saying that the Californian media/authorities were lying. It is as good as me suddenly asking you to answer some question on whether you prefer rice or pasta.

I used to go out a lot, and I really enjoy meeting new people, having people around me, and feeling that sense of togetherness by just being in a crowd. Right now, I'm cooped up in my house, and I'm not loving it. I want to do my part, stay in, and follow all protocol until it's acceptable to socialize again, but until then, I'm just working, watching TV, and playing videogames. I live with my partner, so it's not lonely, so I shouldn't be complaining too much, but I really, really, REALLY miss hanging out with people, friends or strangers. I'm also quite garrulous by nature, and my partner has limits to her patience lol

Zoom calls only go so far, and it's hard to read the room. It's not working for me as much as everyone says it does. I still press on, and be part of these calls, and try to get what I can out of personal contact.

I'm a subscriber on the /r/pilates subreddit and when this covid thing first started breaking out internationally, there were people who made free videos to offer some form of guidance for the community that was suddenly cut off from regular classes. This marketed their expertise and allowed an audience that was no longer able to attend classes physically to seek out new ways to continue training.   
From what i've seen, some of this translated into users who went on to pay for online classes. Perhaps he can consider doing the same via whatever social media he is more comfortable with.  


Regarding the social aspect, I think its important to stay connected both as a couple and as individuals. Eg.

>  It is also neither good nor bad to let your vocation (not just a job) define you. In general, an association with a productive vocation helps to ground people to see that they are useful members of society. 

It's helpful until it's not. Letting an association with something that can be easily taken away from you (a vocation/job in this case) define your identify is setting yourself up for disappointment IMO.",2020-05-25 14:26:23,128

> SINGAPORE - Singapore's circuit breaker will formally end on June 1, the Multi-Ministry Task Force on the Covid-19 outbreak announced on Tuesday (May 19), saying the economy would then be reopened gradually in three phases.

> At a virtual press conference, the task force outlined the broad plan to transition Singapore in phases out of its period of stringent measures eventually into a new normal that will be remain until an effective vaccine or treatment for Covid-19 is developed. But the ministers stressed that reopening plans were not a return to life before Covid-19.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong also noted that phases could be rolled back should the outbreak flare up again. He also said that a rise in number of cases is likely as Singapore reopens.

> ""As we being to resume more activities, we do expect to see a rise in daily cases... If we can continue to keep the situation under control then we can reopen progressively,"" he said.

> In the first phase, called ""safe reopening"", more people will be allowed to return to their workplaces, with priority given to critical sectors and businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks.

> But those who are working from home should continue to work from home, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing. Only those who require machinery or specialised terminals will be able to return to the office, as well as those who need to complete legal documentation.

> Schools will also gradually reopen by levels, with full resumption by June 10. For primary and secondary schools, those in graduating cohorts will attend school daily, while the rest will rotate weekly.

> Places of worship - closed during the circuit breaker - will be allowed to open next month, but only for private worship. Congregational services will not resume.

> Social gatherings will also still be prohibited, although an exception will be made for people visiting their parents or grandparents. Visits will be limited to one per day, with a maximum of two visitors a day. These visitors should be from the same household.

> This means that dropping off children for childcare will be allowed, although seniors themselves should not go out, Mr Gan said.

> In this first phase, the risk of a resurgence in community transmission is high, he added. This means that people should continue wearing masks when they leave the house, and only go out for essential services.

> The first phase is expected to last a few weeks and Singapore will move into the second phase if community transmission rates remain ""low and stable"" and the dormitory situation remains under control.

> In the second phase, called the ""safe transition"", people will gradually be able to resume more social activities. More businesses will be allowed to reopen, including tuition and enrichment centres, gyms and fitness studios. However, employers must implement safe distancing measures and ensure that those who can work from home continue to do so.

> In this phase, small social gatherings and dining in at food and beverage outlets could also be allowed.

> Mr Gan said the second phase comprises several steps and could last several months.

> Depending on the how the Covid-19 situation then develops, measures will continue to be eased further until reaches the third and final phase, called ""safe nation"".

> In the third phase, Singapore will move to a ""new normal"" until the vaccine is found. By this time, social, cultural, religious and business gatherings are expected to have resumed. However, limits will be put in place on gathering sizes.

> The same applies to services and activities that involve significant prolonged close contact, such as massages, or significant crowd management risk in an enclosed space, such as cinemas.

> On public transport, where it is difficult to maintain physical distancing, commuters will have to wear masks and refrain from talking.

> National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said that while some might be disappointed that they will not be able to go out freely and socialise after the end of the circuit breaker, the reopening needs to be done carefully.

> ""We have to do this in careful and calibrated manner as we don't want to risk a flaring up of virus. And importantly, we do not want to sacrifice the efforts all of us have put in controlling the outbreak,"" he said.

> He added that the government would continue to support businesses and workers that are unable to open on June 2. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat has announced that he will deliver a ministerial statement on the plans on May 26. It will be the fourth budget this year.

541,Singapore's Covid-19 circuit breaker ends on June 1; economy to reopen in three phases,2020-05-19 19:33:54,"Please explain how the argument I’ve presented is a strawman argument. 

Arguments you presented:
1. Partners are close contacts and not just transient ones. If gov allows ppl to meet their SOs, people can start meeting ppl from other families and we’ll thus be back to square one due to cross-contamination like food in diff compartments. 

2. People can change as many partners as they want and so it wouldn’t be just one partner that they’re visiting (for the next few months I Guess I my interpretation)


My arguments against the above points:
1. If the rationale behind the gov’s measures for SOs not being allowed to meet was truly as you speculate - that they want to prevent “cross-contamination” of different households - the gov allowing a hair salon providing close contact (non-transient) 3-6 hour services between 2 ppl from different households is going against that very rationale. 

2. Yes, people can change partners every week, but still it wouldn’t be as bad as the potential breeding ground that a hair salon could be (that the gov is allowing) due to the fact that they see high counts of people from different households daily.

Edit after reading your second reply to another user: Again, I did not say that you are for salons opening up. I’m using the example of our gov opening up salons for non-essential services to show that the gov is displaying clear hypocrisy that people who are related to each other cannot meet because they’re from different households, but a hairdresser can meet multiple people from multiple households, and those individual customers would have essentially have the same amount of exposure as the hairdresser they go to.",2020-05-20 00:26:00,278
543,Singapore's Covid-19 circuit breaker ends on June 1; economy to reopen in three phases,2020-05-19 19:33:54,Yeah I think that's the most likley explanation is that the confrence already happend but they broke some press embargo that was agreed upon by accident.,2020-05-19 19:53:27,25
544,Singapore's Covid-19 circuit breaker ends on June 1; economy to reopen in three phases,2020-05-19 19:33:54,"Your argument revolves around the assumption that I am ok with barbers being able to offer more than haircuts. I am not ok with that. 

I am arguing for my opinion that being able to meet grandparents is less risky in terms of community spread than being able to meet people from different families, such as your partner.

If your post above isn't a straw man argument then please enlighten me.

Now that I think we have cleared that up, I'll be happy to engage you on reasons why you think allowing families to meet their grandparents also means we should allow individuals to meet their partner(s), or that meeting partners takes priority over being able to visit grandparents.",2020-05-20 00:20:00,118
545,Singapore's Covid-19 circuit breaker ends on June 1; economy to reopen in three phases,2020-05-19 19:33:54,"For point 1, It's simple. I'm not arguing against that. I agree with you that 'cross-contamination' is going to exist as long as we can roam the streets. You are thinking that I don't agree with you here, that's the issue.

I don't agree that we should increase the risk of our elderly by letting families meet grandparents, but that's not my decision.

Now that that decision has been made by our gov, people now want to meet their partners too because 'hey I can meet my grandparents why cannot meet my future wife/husband?' This is what I am against. I also think that meeting your own family (including extended) poses less risk of community spread than meeting your partner but this is of course my opinion.

For point 2, I'm not saying partners can change every week although they very well can. I'm saying people will use this as an excuse to meet whoever they want, and when that happens, what's the point of a CB.

Edit: So to elaborate on why I think meeting grandparents is less risky than meeting partners, here's why.

Grandparents are generally less mobile and do not have to go to work. Sure, they may get infected from you but the buck could stop there. That's 1 event to get them infected. If your brother now visits your dad and gets infected, that's 2 events that have to happen. Now your brother goes to office and infects the people there that's 3. A total of 3 events have to happen before the virus reaches the community (disregarding yourself otherwise there's no point arguing as you just infect everyone).

On the other hand, meeting a partner when you are infected goes like this. You meet your partner, she goes to work. That's just 2 events that have to happen.",2020-05-20 00:35:26,282

When it's time to relax the measures it will be, and soon too. Wanting normalcy again is normal but it's still a bit too soon, we can afford to  wait another month or so before meeting our partners than risk going into multiple CBs because cases have risen. 

If cases stay 0 for Singapore ex dorms I don't see how the gov wouldn't hasten to lift more restrictions.",2020-05-19 23:33:57,77

550,Singapore's Covid-19 circuit breaker ends on June 1; economy to reopen in three phases,2020-05-19 19:33:54,"Yes you summarised it quite well. But to go one step further I'm saying allowing the meeting of your family's elderly poses less of a risk than allowing the meeting of a partner. The risk being transmission of the virus to the general public and enforceability of people who may abuse this leeway given to us. 

I know that the elderly will have a higher fatality rate in the event of contracting covid19, in case anyone wants to use that as an argument. 

When given both choices of meeting elderly and a partner, you can choose not to meet your elderly parents to keep them safe but how many are going to not meet their partners? Meeting with partners also tend to go on for longer and more often.",2020-05-20 07:47:19,127

553,Singapore's Covid-19 circuit breaker ends on June 1; economy to reopen in three phases,2020-05-19 19:33:54,"yeah exactly i highly highly doubt we will ever have 0 cases for a extended period of time. So the question i had after reading the new measures for after june 2 was 'what exactly does the government want to get out of this CB?' 

do they want 0 community cases for 7 days? 14 days straight? because honestly i dont see that happening. And in my opinion, thats fine because to say we can eradicate this virus from our country is not realistic.. especially when we are a country so reliant on other countries (travel, trade etc). so if thats the case, the government basically has to just mitigate it as much as possible and right now with the measures we have i think they are doing a pretty good job.

I mean even in feb-early march when we were MUCH less prepared for this, we managed to control the spread rather well. (we didnt even have any CB or anything people were still going about their normal lives)


so now with all these social distancing and tracing etc i think that the government has a good chance of being able to control the spread well. 

so yeah they should definitely open up in stages but i PERSONALLY feel that this phase 1 is kind of half-baked and the government is too non-linear. they allow this and that in some areas despite them being clearly non essential (some hairdressing services etc) but then other areas they are still strict like how they are so afraid of letting any form of social interaction happen (even minimal in grps of no more than 2 arent allowed). 

So while they want to open in stages i personally cannot understand many of this phase 1 steps. i feel after CB the next step (alongside slowly opening workplaces and schools) is to also gradually allow people to interact as well (especially since they will definitely already interact in school/work). even if its just starting small with eg 2 people first then slowly increasing the no.",2020-05-20 02:21:28,330
