That said, while I would be the first to agree that our dear GLC/Gahmen scholars are usually idiots, I want to step away from the scholar management bad circle jerk because this is a systemic problem that has sucked in not just SIA

I am not going to go in depth into SIA's accounting, so this is what thing look like very roughly. This estimate is may be off, but it wont' be off by enough that the arguments change. Fuel is typically 30% of an airlines' operating costs. SIA I would estimate SIA's operating costs in this 13  year period is roughly 14 or so billion so a year, or which about very roughly 4 billion a year is fuel. SIA hedging operation runs about 3-500 million dollars a year in average losses over the last 13 years.[https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/2020/09/17/shareholder-raises-concerns-about-sias-15-years-of-fuel-hedging-losses-to-prime-minister-lee-as-no-one-takes-accountability/](https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/2020/09/17/shareholder-raises-concerns-about-sias-15-years-of-fuel-hedging-losses-to-prime-minister-lee-as-no-one-takes-accountability/)

This suggests to me that SIA's hedging operation is large and has a long history of incurring costs/ losses that are pretty high in relation to the underlying costs whose fluctuations they are trying to smooth out. This is in itself, not a good place to be.

The purpose behind hedging is to ensure a predictable P/L ratio. But we must think critically about why we are doing this and what it means. We seek out a predictable P/L ratio in order to allow for easy/cheap borrowing and to ensure that black swan events in a major operating expense don't wipe the business out out.

Yet to achieve this, the problem with fuel hedging is that a hedging operation this large may often create its own type of existential risk for the company.--Like it is doing right now, where SIA is simultaneously facing both huge losses from Covid and huge losses from a hedging.  An airline is not well equipped to stress test their trading positions in accordance with their own unique risk profile where jet fuel and passenger revenues may be inter-related ( and worse still co-related) in all sorts of weird and difficult to forsee ways.

The thing with hedging is that Airlines are not trading houses. Even trading houses very rarely beat the market. More than a few major hedge funds and investment banks have been buried by bad trades. And even as we understand that, it is very likely that the level of accountability and corporate governance in airlines is far worse than in the banks.

Outside of Singapore, AA , United and Delta have opted to stop hedging their fuel costs concluding that in the long run, it does not work. Southwest, famous for saving billions of dollars in the post 9/11 era by hedging their fuel costs later cumulatively lost billions of dollars in the mid 00s doing the same. Cathay Pacific has been suffering catastrophic losses from Fuel hedges gone bad and SIA is now in the same boat.

I think that if we are going to accept that SIA is 'too big to fail' and are going to have to be bailed out using our reserves, they should stay away from fuel hedging. Trading commodities is not a core airline competency and creates a corporate governance problem. Trading commodities creates a vector for risks that are not likely to be well understood and well characterized by management. Trading commodities in a firm that has the implicit backing of our government, creates a conflict of interest where profits get privatised and catastrophic losses get socialised.",2020-09-28 16:34:52,565

There is hedging and then there's gambling. Stock options are used to hedge, but gamblers take it to the next level and gamble with it. SIA hedged longer and taken bigger positions than anyone else. I'd say that's gambling.

Fate of Singapore’s aviation hub rests on it",2020-09-28 10:53:05,"There's no definitive answer to whether big plane hub and spoke or small plane point to point is more economical. If your hub and spoke model has planes not full or has planes spending time sitting around on the ground, it's going to be less economical. The economies of scale from using a larger plane also start to break down when larger planes like the quad jet A380 become more fuel inefficient, which is amplified at longer distances, where fuel economy is already worse. 

>Even accounting smaller planes that can travel far, is it profitable with the amount of passengers?

If a route is able to fill a plane while operating flights to a specific location at the frequency the flight is operated at, then it's profitable. Granted, there's a point at which decreasing frequency stops making it easier to fill a plane, as passengers have a time frame in which they need to get their flight. The time frame tends to be wider for the leisure consumers than the business consumers. Given how many smaller cities in SEA are pretty popular tourist destinations, and how many 787-8s are running around at the moment, it seems reasonable to me that you could get just over 200 passengers to fill a plane from a large European city to a Penang or a Phuket during holiday season.",2020-09-28 12:12:09,219

The reason why they have hedging loss is because they used long futures to hedge rather than doing the actual less risky way of hedging which is delta hedge via both options and futures.

Not being prudent is not the same as gambling.

That's false equivalency. Milk has a vastly lower expiry date and cannot be kept for the same period as oil, resulting in the need for higher turnover and storage costs.

The expiry date for fuel is vastly longer than milk, meaning that it can be kept for longer.

Firstly, BBT has only been in the market for a couple of years. If you look at the growth of BBT, it is still more volatile than air travel. That volatility is amplified in single shops that might lose customers easily to competing shops round the corner. Secondly, current events is indicative of tail risk and not normal times.

A lower expiry date means that you require an extremely high turnover. At the current market, a milk III futures contract would be infeasible for a BBT shop, making OTC futures contracts the only way. It would also result in a rollover of a portion of the initial contract.

You are clearly off your rocker. From arguing that SIA is not gambling, you can gone full on discussing different future options. Why not just, y'know, forecast what you need and ordering prudently? You have fallen into the same trap trying to gamble on milk futures just like SIA did on oil futures.

>Hedging is no pre-paying. You have the option to box out the hedge should you not want FOB delivery.

Not in this case. They are committed with what they ordered.

>The expiry date for fuel is vastly longer than milk, meaning that it can be kept for longer.

Still have an expiry date. So all the the disadvantges with milk still applies.

>Unlike you, I can think about the different magnitude of things. Swine flu has a different place on the probability/impact framework than COVID.

You are obviously smoking crack at this point. BBT has been in Singapore for decades. 

>That volatility is amplified in single shops that might lose customers easily to competing shops round the corner.

This still goes to prove the stability of BBT as compared to aviation, then bigger better players keep coming in to steal the market share. 

>It's not. The fact you think so is a disgrace to whatever risk dept you work in.
You are clearly the disgrace if this is the best explanation you can offer.

>you not know the difference between VaR and stressed VaR? And how things can have different magnitude of impact? Did the financial crisis force planes to be grounded for months (potentially years) on end? Did SARs?

Bringing finance gambling again instead of prudent thinking.

Sure because the options are a big home or homeless. You can't buy a smaller cheaper home.

You were the one who brought in milk futures as an example, not me.

And how do you do that smartass? Do you have any experience with modelling future cash flows? Clearly SIA did try, but they failed. But as if you can develop a better model.

> You have fallen into the same trap trying to gamble on milk futures just like SIA did on oil futures

And you have not even understood the fundamental nature of hedging.

> Not in this case. They are committed with what they ordered.

Do you even know how hedging works? A futures contract is in no way a commitment to actually deliver the good. You can box it out by buying an opposing contract. That is a very common practice. The fact that you don't know that speaks to your knowledge of the subject.

> Still have an expiry date. So all the the disadvantges with milk still applies

The expiry date of milk is measured in weeks. The expiry date of fuel is about a year. Clearly there is no difference between a week and a year.

> Except in this case you are clearly wrong as proven by COVID. 

What sort of stupid argument is that? Are you seriously saying that different risk events cannot have different impacts. The impact of swine flu is different from on the probability/impact table as COVID. How dumb are you to not even comprehend that?

> Sure because the options are a big home or homeless. You can't buy a smaller cheaper home.

The analogy I used was a HDB flat, not a big home. A house is an essential good, just like a plane and the fuel it consumes. Just because you want to resort to hyperbole doesn't mean you should.

A big house analogy also works. If you have a family of 50 people helping pay the mortgage, you have all reason to believe that in 5 years, you would have a family of 50 people helping pay the mortgage. If you're entire family was murdered overnight and you can't pay back the mortgage, would it be your fault? ""But you should have accounted for the complete decimation of your cash flow!"" you argue.

> Man, I really hate the bankers and finance types. They ruined the world economy with their housing bets, and now they want to do the same with aviation with the same excuses that they are not gambling.

I cleary said to make advanced orders on milk, you are the one trying to obstufcate everything by bringing up milk OTCs as if it has to do with anything. Why can't you buy milk OTCs to hedge BTW? Why don't you just make a simple pre-order like SIA have done? 


 
> And how do you do that smartass? Do you have any experience with modelling future cash flows? Clearly SIA did try, but they failed. But as if you can develop a better model.

You don't have to look to me for a better model. You can look to like, every other fucking airline. They clearly can develop a better model. 



> And you have not even understood the fundamental nature of hedging.

Clearly you don't seeing your lame explanation.


> Do you even know how hedging works? A futures contract is in no way a commitment to actually deliver the good. You can box it out by buying an opposing contract. That is a very common practice. The fact that you don't know that speaks to your knowledge of the subject.

It is you who don't know what hedging means. You literally make a hedge with a pre-order, or a bet, or many other ways.

> The expiry date of milk is measured in weeks. The expiry date of fuel is about a year. Clearly there is no difference between a week and a year.

It's still a fucking pre-order. Find your needs appropriately and order accordingly. If an expiry is such a stumbling block excuse for you, you can change it to another business that doesn't deal with perishable goods. HDB pre-building houses 5 years before selling them perhaps.


> What sort of stupid argument is that? Are you seriously saying that different risk events cannot have different impacts. The impact of swine flu is different from on the probability/impact table as COVID. How dumb are you to not even comprehend that?

So your stupid argument is ""If I am wrong, it's becuase no one can foresee my problems, but if I'm right, it's because I'm fucking smart to foresee problems nobody can see?""

I guess you will never think you are ever wrong then.


> The analogy I used was a HDB flat, not a big home. A house is an essential good, just like a plane and the fuel it consumes. Just because you want to resort to hyperbole doesn't mean you should.

You don't get to invent your false equivalence analogies to make your own hyperbole. You answer to mine. If you can't retort you have no point.

> A big house analogy also works. If you have a family of 50 people helping pay the mortgage, you have all reason to believe that in 5 years, you would have a family of 50 people helping pay the mortgage.

""But you should have accounted for the complete decimation of your cash flow!"" you argue.

Yes? Why buy put yourself in a risk of having such an apartment when you know you can't afford the downside? Either you move out and live on your own, or buy mortgage insurance for each of the 50 people. My argument is sound here. 



> Man, I really hate ignorant people who think they know it all. They ruined the world with populism and their stupidity and now they want to do the same to common sense with the same stupidity, arrogance, ignorance, and general idiocy they employ in their daily lives.

Guess what, you are clearly wrong here. You aren't even able to accept the fault in the financial system in crashign the world economy and just keep blaming the people as stupid. It's this fucking attitude that no one respects you. 

> You clearly are unable to accept facts just because they are contrary to your (uneducated) beliefs. Calling whatever you want gambling doesn't make it so. All I have to say is, thank God you are nowhere near our financial system.

This is a totally true statement you are making though, so I'm not sure why you are not getting it. If you go all in in a single stock investment with your life savings, you are literally gambling with it. Over-leveraging on mortgages to buy houses is totally gambling, there is even an entire financial crisis that happened because of it. It is actually very interesting, I suggest you watch the movie ""The Big Short"" to watch how people are making properties a huge gamble that ended up with complex derivatives on mortgages like people here are suggesting we do with fuel.

I don't see you making any specific argument on SIA's hedging here though. Care to explain why they think making a hedge several times bigger than their next competitor is a good idea, other than ""SIA is smart, they just don't have 20/20 hindsight benefit?""",2020-09-30 13:34:07,212

> SINGAPORE - The first Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight staffed by pilots and cabin crew vaccinated against the coronavirus left Changi Airport on Thursday (Feb 11), marking a significant milestone for the battered national carrier.

> Flight SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am carrying a crew of 12, and is the first of three departing SIA Group flights with crew who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

> Scoot flight TR606 to Bangkok also left Changi at 9.30am with a set of 11 vaccinated crew members, while SilkAir's first vaccinated flight MI608 will leave for Phnom Penh at 4.30pm with a crew of eight.

> The crew members are among more than 52,000 personnel in the transport sector who have received their first dose of the vaccine as at Feb 10.

> The Ministry of Transport said more than 39,000 workers in the aviation and maritime sectors have gotten their first jab - over 90 per cent of the 43,000 front-liners in both sectors.

> More than 14,000 land transport workers have also received the first dose of the vaccine, with the remaining 66,000 scheduled to get their jabs in the coming months.

> In a statement, SIA Group, which has suffered billions in losses because of the ongoing pandemic, said it is among the first airlines in the world to operate flights with fully vaccinated crews.

> Noting that the Government has prioritised the aviation sector in the national drive to vaccinate Singaporeans and other long-term residents, SIA said this reflected the sector's importance and the national carrier's crucial role in Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against Covid-19.

> SIA chief executive Goh Choon Phong said: ""Vaccinations will be key to the reopening of borders and to enhancing travel confidence, in tandem with robust testing regimes and the wide-ranging safe management measures that are in place on the ground and in the air.""

> He added: ""They offer greater protection for our people and provide an added layer of assurance to our customers.""

> Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, who spoke to crew members operating SQ956 on Thursday morning, said the vaccination drive has been ""proceeding like clockwork"".

> He told reporters he is confident that a substantial number of workers from the aviation and maritime sectors will be fully vaccinated by the end of the month.

> Singapore's biggest vulnerability is its border, he said, given that the virus is under control here with very few community cases.

> ""If the border staff that come into contact with the outside world are all vaccinated, I think we would have really taken a very big step in securing our border and keeping Singaporeans safe,"" he added.

>

> 

> Passenger traffic at Changi Airport, which has been decimated by Covid-19, fell by 82.8 per cent last year.

> Front-line workers in the aviation and maritime sectors started getting jabs on Jan 13 as part of an operational trial, before the mass exercise began in earnest on Jan 18.

> Bus and train workers started getting jabs from Jan 25.

> SIA said its operating crew members have responded very positively to the exercise, with more than 90 per cent of cabin crew and pilots signing up for the vaccine to date.

> Its milestone comes days after a 41-year-old cabin crew member on a turnaround flight to the United Arab Emirates tested positive for the coronavirus.

> The Singaporean woman was the fifth person on the flight to test positive, with preliminary test results showing that all five had contracted the more infectious B117 strain of the virus.

> The air stewardess had departed Singapore for Dubai on Jan 30 and returned on Jan 31 without disembarking from the aircraft.

> She then received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Feb 2. She lost her sense of smell two days later but did not seek medical attention.

> Her case was eventually picked up during routine testing as required by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.

> The Health Ministry reiterated on Tuesday that it takes a few weeks for individuals to build up immunity against Covid-19 after completing vaccination, and it is possible to get infected just before or after inoculation.

> Other airlines have also begun vaccinating their crew.

> Mr Ong said last month that SIA could be the first vaccinated international airline of the world.

> On Wednesday, Etihad Airways staked its claim as the first airline in the world to have inoculated all its operating pilots and cabin crew.

> The United Arab Emirates airline said in a statement that more than three-quarters of its workforce have already received at least one dose of the vaccine.
