It makes no sense..why open up childcares fully but then older kids only go every other weeks. What about parent with 1 childcare kid and 1 primary school kid...?

> SINGAPORE: Singapore will exit the circuit breaker as planned on Jun 1, with measures to be progressively lifted in three phases from the next day, the authorities announced on Tuesday (May 19).

> As the risk of a resurgence in community transmission remains high, the Government will first resume economic activities that do not pose a high risk of transmission in the first phase, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in a joint media statement.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Besides the essential businesses that are already operating, businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks will be allowed to open. These include manufacturing firms, subject to the issued guidelines set for the manufacturing sectors and most offices. Nevertheless, the authorities said that tele-commuting must be used the ‚Äúmaximum extent‚Äù.

> ‚ÄúThose who have been working from home so far should continue to do so, and employees should go to the office only where demonstrably necessary,‚Äù they said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Such circumstances might include employees who need to return to the office to access to specialised systems and equipment that cannot be accessed from home, or to fulfil legal requirements.

> The circuit breaker measures first took effect on Apr 7, and were further tightened after three weeks, with more workplaces closed, and social gatherings banned.

> In announcing the lifting of measures, the authorities emphasised that the country is likely to see a rise in new community cases.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, speaking at a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference, said that the task force‚Äôs decision to exit the circuit breaker is because of the low number of cases in the community, and the stabilised situation at the dormitories.

> As the nation resumes more activities, however, Singapore can expect to see a rise in daily new cases, he cautioned.

> ‚ÄúThe key is to detect these cases and contain them quickly, so as to prevent a sharp rise in the number of cases, or the emergence of a large cluster,‚Äù he said.

> HAIRDRESSERS, BARBERS CAN OFFER ALL SERVICES

> Hairdressers and barbers will be allowed to resume all services, beyond just basic haircut services.

> All home-based businesses that operate using a delivery or collection model will also be allowed to resume.

> Businesses that can resume operations from Jun 2 will not need to apply for exemptions, but will have to submit their manpower details through the GoBusiness portal within two weeks of the date of resumption of operations, the authorities said.

> Other services that will be able to resume include motor vehicle servicing, aircon servicing, printing, basic pet services, school bookshops and retail shops selling school uniforms.

> Most retail outlets and other personal services will however not reopen in Phase One.

> Dining in at food and beverage outlets will continue to be disallowed. Sports and recreation facilities will also remain closed.

> ‚ÄúEveryone should continue to leave home only for essential activities, and should wear a mask when doing so. As seniors are a particularly vulnerable group, they should continue to stay at home as much as possible,‚Äù the authorities said.

> DROPPING OFF CHILDREN AT GRANDPARENTS, SOME VISITING ALLOWED

> The agencies said that while people should continue to limit contact with others outside of their household, some exemptions will be allowed.

> Each household will be allowed to visit their parents or grandparents, a move that will allow families to spend time and provide support to one another.

> ‚ÄúEach receiving household should limit such visits to only one per day, and to not more than two persons who must be from the same visiting household,‚Äù they said.

> As part of this policy, dropping off children at parents‚Äô and grandparents‚Äô homes for childcare will also be allowed, subject to the same limit of two visitors from the same visiting household per day, they added.

> Mr Gan stressed that while families can visit parents and grandparents, seniors should refrain from leaving their homes to visit their families.

> ‚ÄúChildren or grandchildren can visit their parents or grandparents. Grandparents and parents, please stay at home. Don't go visiting your children, because we do want to keep you safe at home,‚Äù he said.

> Siblings will not be allowed to visit each other.

> IN-PERSON MARRIAGE SOLEMNISATION, PRIVATE WORSHIP ALLOWED

> The authorities added that they will allow marriage solemnisations to take place in-person again, involving up to 10 persons.

> Places of worship can also reopen for private worship, they added. This will be limited to a maximum of five members of the same household praying together at any one time.

> ‚ÄúFamilies can continue to gather for wakes and funerals, with no more than 10 persons at any one time,‚Äù the authorities added.

> ‚ÄúOther non-essential activities and social gatherings will remain prohibited, as these will invariably bring together more people living in different households, undermining our efforts to keep our families safe,‚Äù they added.

> PRE-SCHOOLS TO GRADUALLY REOPEN, GRADUATING STUDENTS TO ATTEND SCHOOL DAILY

> Pre-schools will gradually reopen from Jun 2, so that young children can be cared for safely while their parents return to work, the authorities said.

> This will begin first with children from the kindergarten levels, followed by those in nursery levels, and finally, those in infant care or playgroup on Jun 10.

> In Phase One, students from graduating cohorts in the primary and secondary levels will also be allowed to return to school on weekdays, while other cohorts will rotate weekly, alternating between home-based learning (HBL) and returning to school for lessons.

> Junior Colleges and Millennia Institute will arrange to have half of their students back in school at any one time. Students in the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) whose terms are in session will be able to return to campus for practical and lab-based sessions, with lectures remaining online.

> Studentcare centres will also fully reopen on Jun 2, along with the reopening of schools.

> Co-curricular activities, enrichment activities and tuition however will not resume as ‚Äúthey encourage mingling across classes and schools‚Äù, the authorities said.

> SOME HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO RESUME

> Healthcare services such as specialist outpatient services, medical procedures, allied health services, community-based services, and chronic disease management will resume, prioritised by healthcare providers based on medical necessity and available capacity, the authorities said.

> Examples include surgeries for advanced cataracts, joint surgeries for patients with severe impairment, cancer screening and surveillance services including scopes for high-risk groups, ongoing dental procedures with guidance to minimise aerosol-generation, and diabetic foot screening.

> Preventive health services, such as flu vaccinations, will also recommence. Complementary healthcare services will resume for one-to-one sessions and by appointment, and traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture will be allowed for all conditions, they said.

> Providers will have to maintain appropriate safe distancing and precautionary measures, they said.

> Senior activity centres will gradually resume some activities in a safe and controlled manner, to address the psychosocial well-being of seniors with little or no social support.

> Community-based centre services for persons with disabilities will also gradually reopen to serve those who need the services, with safe distancing measures in place, MOH and MTI said.

> Activities, where needed, will be held in smaller groups, and persons who have medical conditions are encouraged to remain at home to receive home-based support, the authorities said.

What happened to all the people clamouring for a longer lockdown at the start? Reactive instead of proactive?

66,"Singapore to exit circuit breaker on Jun 1, visiting of parents, places of worship allowed with restrictions",2020-05-19 20:07:01,"I read the comments and I'm quite... sad.

I can agree with some of the commenters that some services, like full service hairdressing, do seem a bit questionable given their seeming non-necessity. Reasonable people can also disagree about whether grandparents should be allowed to see their grandchildren.

But allowing friends to meet up? Even for just two or three people at a time? I cannot agree with that.

Let us imagine if we allowed that, and let's assume I have the virus. Assume a R0 of 2, to make the math easy. I meet my 3 friends for lunch, two of whom will carry the virus because of me. Both of them, having been cooped up at home for a long time, want to go meet their other friends for dinner. They, and two of their own friends, then go on to meet other friends for a few days. All this time, they are asymptomatic and unlikely to be traced until I display symptoms. By then, how many people would have been infected despite the restriction on the number of friends at a gathering?

The community cases now are low *because* such meetings are not allowed. The low number of cases are not an excuse to allow such gatherings. Remember the Shincheonji cluster in South Korea? It only took *one* person to cause the megacluster to form. Sure, it would take longer to happen in our context, because we're not talking about huge church gatherings here. But the point is that you only need one person to start a new cluster, and allowing friends to meet up will accelerate that process.

We cannot confuse cause with effect. The low numbers now are an effect of the circuit breaker. The low numbers should not in themselves result in excessive loosening of the circuit breaker measures.

The implications of allowing friends to meet up are too much of a risk even at this point in time. The whole point of the mitigating measures at workplace and schools is to try to slow down the inevitable spread of the virus, and to contain it to close contacts at most. Allowing friends to meet completely thwarts those mitigations, and allows the virus to spread beyond these close contacts.

I don't support all of the details of the government's ""ending"" of the circuit breaker. But on this issue of meeting friends, I am firmly in support.",2020-05-20 00:42:17,392

Heck we slam ppl who queue for McDonald's and for barbers when that was lifted because covid-19 might spread. 

Now that cb is going to be lifted with alot of restrictions still in place (they did say it's going to be like this) because the government wants to limit the potential spread of covid-19 while trying to open up, people here suddenly get upset about the government for being cautious about this to prevent a potential spread of covid-19. 

It's as if after 2nd June Singapore is clear of covid-19.

This is literally an extended CB with a nicer name called Phase 1.

If it's not extended CB, why would they say Phase 1 will last at least 4 weeks, with majority of the businesses and activities still closed? Lol

Check out other countries' versions of ""exit"".
When they say exit, it's really exit, such as retail opening up in 2 weeks time, gym opens 1 week after retail etc....

They're trying to avoid an uproar and backlash that's all. And to make it less obvious it's actually extended CB, they allow minor lifting of some restrictions but for the most part, nothing much changes.

Circuit Breaker became Tightened Circuit Breaker and now it's Continued Circuit Breaker.

The true ""exit"" that many Singaporeans are waiting for, is actually Phase 2, where dine-ins, gyms and retail, offices all open. Now that is the true exit.

Not this ""Phase 1 which will last at least 4 weeks"".

It is not so much the length of time spent, than the potential amount of communicating that might be done. Same for grandparents - I suspect the value judgement made is that grandparents are unlikely to go out and spread the virus to others. Whereas for SO or friends, not so much. The key policy principle appears to be to mitigate the spread of the virus to within close contacts/associates only, and no further.

If you decide people are allowed to sit at a hair salon for 3-6 hrs, how is it not okay for pet and vet services to resume??! (Only basic pet services can resume) How?! And as many people have clearly said, aren‚Äôt elderly more susceptible to the virus, so how is allowing visits to elderly any better than allowing SOs? I understand that the elderly needs to be taken care of, but if so, why only allow now? Did they not need help these 2 months that has past? I mean I‚Äôm not a politician but this is basic logic. When they banned famous bubble tea shops, they allowed hawker bubble tea to resume. What‚Äôs the rationale, you‚Äôre simply thronging the crowd to these hawkers. All I can say is, there is major political agenda at play. I assure all of you if Election has been announced cancelled, you wouldn‚Äôt see a lot of these decisions made, but rather more thought through and logical ones. I stand firm with my proposition.
Edit: And also, clearly the govt doesn‚Äôt want the economy to collapse, otherwise a lockdown would have happened 2 months ago and none of this would have happened. But clearly none of this is helping the economy. Economic growth goes beyond GDP but HDI (Human Development Index). Just because everyone is employed and unemployment increases, doesn‚Äôt equate to higher productivity. And clearly a 2 month confinement at home isn‚Äôt helping that.

The best example would be parents dropping off their kids at their grandparents place while potentially exposing themselves to the virus at their workplace. Grandparents probably live with some other family members who are in the work force as well and this goes back to square one yet again.

If my parents were staying alone, I know I'd be worried for their mental health moreso than my hypothetical live-alone brother. This enables adult children to visit and check on them. If they're irresponsible and want to indulge in seeing school going grandchildren despite the risks, it's on the individual.

It just felt like a contrast brushing off their seeing grandchildren only to later emphasize on how bad it is for people in WFH alone. If you didn't mean the contrast, then I retract my moot point.

I get the apparent contradiction. I'm just saying I find it a superficial contradiction in the sense that, going by that logic, must we keep them locked away for the longest time (compared to other groups), to not contradict ""keeping them safe""? Aggressively trying to keep community transmission low is in itself a way to keep them safe. Relaxing measures is already the acceptance of increased risk. If an elderly is to catch covid with the relaxed measures, I think they would rather it be because they had family visiting (the cautious ones could always choose not to), than because seemingly healthy young individuals were lepaking with beer and ended up forming a cluster that then spread widely because of their mobility, and reached their isolated doors.

Ultimately my main point was still: we can be unhappy that the social restriction is still on the rest of us, but why complain that it's now legal to have people visiting aged parents? It doesn't take away anything from you, even if it's contradictory. We gain nothing if they decide to not allow visits to elderly after all.",2020-05-20 04:24:22,222

Not to mention that seniors are in greater need of care from others compared to young people too. So judging by a needs basis it does makes more sense from their boomer persepctive to allow seniors to receive vistations when compared to young people since old people requires more help both physically and mentally whereas young people have more ways to communicate anyway.  The toxic mentality of if I don have it no one should have it that we have here is really very petty. When the decision can be rationalized as being made from a needs basis more than anything.
