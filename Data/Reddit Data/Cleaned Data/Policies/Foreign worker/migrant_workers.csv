0,Prevalence and Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Migrant Workers in Singapore,2021-02-11 01:47:29,Asia didn't fuck around on the medical end when the virius came. They lived through SARS.

From the article: Singapore had over 111,000 confirmed cases of Covid19 in the migrant worker population. And 1 death. Track & trace doesn't explain the extraordinary low mortality rate. 

What is Singapore doing right? And why isn't the rest of the world doing the same? Someone figured Covid19 out. And they weren't waiting for a vaccine.

As I said, contrarian.",2021-02-11 01:53:46,58

3,Prevalence and Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Migrant Workers in Singapore,2021-02-11 01:47:29,"It's pretty simple:

>About 95% of Singapore's COVID-19 infections are among migrant workers, mostly in their 20s or 30s, living in cramped dormitories and employed in labour-intensive sectors such as construction and shipbuilding.

5,Prevalence and Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Migrant Workers in Singapore,2021-02-11 01:47:29,"To add to this: no other population in the world (AFAIK) has had the level of testing that Singapore's migrant worker population had.

Singapore's migrant workers stay in dormitories, separate from the wider population. When the virus broke out among them, they were forced to stay in the dormitories (effectively, imprisoned) until 100% of them had been tested for the virus. This allowed the government to detect 100% of asymptomatic cases in that population (except for any false negatives) which normally go undetected in any other population - which would inflate the lethality statistic of the virus in other populations. No other population on earth of equivalent size, that I'm aware of, has been 100% quarantined and tested like this, which is another reason why the virus has higher reported rates of death amongst other populations (undetected asymptomatic cases.)",2021-02-11 07:27:04,132

The PAP is a right-wing political party, and our political history has seen anything resembling the left being crushed. We have a tripartite system that is designed to neuter labour - there is no hint of collective bargaining. Employers can literally get away with everything - so you hope to join a firm that is decently run/managed. 

The narrative of the Other (be it the foreigner, or different skin colors) is a useful one that the government does not want to puncture for fear of the normals realising that their insecurities, etc can only be resolved in a socio-economic fashion at the ballot box.

Which if you ask me, is the consequence of having such a rule-driven society like Singapore. Yes, it does make for very clear guidelines, but it also draws the line in the sand with regards to how people ought to act. If you have ever wondered why Singaporeans are such bullies on the road, look no further, because everything thinks they have the right of way simply because they have the law on their side. 

In addition, the Singaporean government was the one who decided to open the floodgates in the first place to drive growth in the country, in addition to driving down wages and further straining our infrastructure. It was always a ticking time bomb waiting to happen. 

You are right in that they are human and deserving of better treatment, but none of us asked for any of this in the first place. If their working conditions are indeed so bad, then perhaps they should go back to their own country.

migrant workers from the likes of bangladesh are lured to wealthier countries like singapore by the promise of money, which they need to support their family back home. they may be willing to put up with some level of discomfort and hardship because they are focussed on how they can earn money, but this does NOT absolve employers of the responsibility to provide a minimally decent living condition. 

i have chatted to migrant workers, and most of them are full of praises for singapore simply because they think singapore is lawful and fair. this makes our collective treatment of our migrant brothers and sisters even more appalling because it is clear that we can do so much better for them. 

note that in this situation, they have NO autonomy whatsoever. the fact that they are powerless and can’t even protect themselves to the best of their abilities (due to being quarantined w each other) is a direct result of policies and laws that they never had a say in. so, for you to come here WHILE THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST OF SINGAPORE’S OUTBREAK and say “don’t like here then don’t come to work” ... demonstrates a particular dearth of compassion, let’s just say that.",2020-04-09 20:50:44,217

I admit that the morality of voting is quite murky. Some cases are very clear, (like if you voted for Hitler to come into power). But other cases like this are less clear because the power to control policy through voting is very limited, but not totally useless. In that sense I disagree that we, as a society, are totally blameless. We do, and must, shoulder some blame.

You do realize that the issue we're debating on is about their vulnerability towards pandemics, which wouldn't be a thing if their living quarters aren't pitiful. Why do you think most of us are still surviving the virus? Because we're capable of making ourselves less vulnerable. Imagine trying to be semi-immune in a flat filled with cockroaches with floors caked in urine.


Are you trying to tell me that the government is capable of wielding their power for good? Actually, yes. On the other hand, given how quickly they changed their tune after a bunch of people angrily pushed back, they can definitely use it for the greater good. In terms of land, if they can greenlight estates of unnecessary condos in tiny spaces, they could have also used the same land to build dorms for foreign workers. I live near a large patch of deserted land that could have been used to build a long stretch of dorms. It's convenient for the workers too. Been here for a decade and nothing's been done to it. Hence, I disagree with the notion that we do not have sufficient land — we do, the big G's simply unwilling to use it if it's not gonna make them money.",2020-04-10 10:28:58,214

I digress.


In regards to the situation at hand, you must have missed the deplorable comments about how the workers are at fault for ""not knowing how to eat off the ground"" and ""having poor hygiene standards in the first place"". No one was born with the knowledge of good hygiene, but we were all *educated* on the practice. Thus, they could have been educated as well. But no, they're just animals to some apparently. One comment I read even suggested that help shouldn't be rendered to them because they'll ""revert to their terrible hygiene standards"". And that's just one idiot who dared to vocalize such thoughts. What makes you think no one else thinks the same way?


As I mentioned in a previous post, humans seem to derive sick pleasure from treating their perceived inferiors as non-humans. Not just migrant workers but domestic helpers too. So, yes, each of our respective actions will shape the world it is today.

It's estimated there's at least 100,000 people in the UK that are essentially held as slaves - more than half of them migrants.  Anti-slavery charities argue that despite stricter laws, especially the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the government still isn't doing enough.  This is only one example of how migrant workers, or workers in general, can be mistreated in the UK. (Links below)

I'm not trying to argue that the state of affairs in the UK is worse than in Singapore.  What I am arguing is that the treatment of migrant workers is poor across the globe, even in countries deemed to be firmly ""first world"".  Of course Singapore can do better, and Singapore should do better, but the west isn't always a workers' heaven, either.

EDIT: and it's also naive to assume there's no modern-day slaves in Singapore, but again - that's a problem globally.

In his years working in aluminum production and on construction sites, the Bangladeshi national has suffered various work-related injuries. The most recent, on March 18, left him with searing pain in his left hip.

That was also the date that coronavirus infections in the city-state — whose early response epidemiologists had lauded as the gold standard — began soaring, from 313 then to more than 9,000 as of Tuesday, after two days of record jumps.


Almost 70 percent of Singapore's coronavirus cases are concentrated in migrant dormitories.

Singapore's migrant workers face a heightened risk of infection because of overcrowded living quarters, poor nutrition, limited access to health care and personal protective equipment, low wages and, in some cases, discrimination.
Thousands of new cases — and almost 70 percent of Singapore’s total — are concentrated in dormitories that house migrant workers, who have been locked down in their quarters as authorities seek a solution. For Shekor, who gave only his first name for fear of retribution from his employer, it means no access to painkillers he needs just to sleep.

“Everything is so difficult for everybody here,” he said in a phone interview from his dormitory of 25,000, where hundreds have been infected. “It seems like they only take the most serious ones to hospital; the normal ones like me, no one takes care of us.”


The situation highlights the vulnerability of migrant workers, who in Singapore make up one-third of the labor force. Their risks of infection are exacerbated by overcrowded living quarters, poor nutrition, limited access to health care and personal protective equipment, low wages and, in some cases, discrimination.

 A construction site in Singapore lies empty on April 11 during a halt to nonessential work to stem the spike in coronavirus cases.
In the Persian Gulf, laborers’ quarters also have become infection hotspots. As in Singapore, many migrant laborers are from South Asia. Elsewhere, African migrants in China are facing discrimination and xenophobia, refused entry into restaurants or evicted from their homes. Singapore’s largest Chinese-language broadsheet, Lianhe Zaobao, recently published a letter from a reader who blamed the migrants for the outbreaks, labeling their countries “backward” and their practices dirty.

In Singapore, critics say these events have revealed a hubris among the authorities and the wider community, who took for granted their initial success in keeping infection numbers low while failing to prepare for the possibility of an outbreak among the most downtrodden.

Workers hang out in a dormitory compound. About a dozen compounds have been put on quarantine, which means workers are confined to their rooms.
“For the first two months, we engaged in a lot of self-congratulation,” said Alex Au, vice president of rights group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2). “If anyone had cared to look, the dangers were already there.”

Authorities had planned for the epidemic with a focus only on citizens, he said, distributing surgical masks, hand sanitizer and reusable masks only to Singaporean households. Singaporean residents returning from the United States and Britain, meanwhile, were put up in four- and five-star hotels paid for by the government.

“This reflects the deliberate invisibilization of the foreign worker; the whole machinery of state operates as though they don’t exist,” Au said.

HealthServe, a nonprofit providing subsidized health care to migrant workers, said migrants had been anxious as early as February about the virus and their level of risk in overcrowded living conditions. But a change in regulations meant volunteer doctors and nurses staffing the organization’s nonprofit clinics could no longer serve part-time, forcing it to cut services by 90 percent.

“This was a situation we felt was going to come, even if we were hoping for the best,” said Suwen Low, spokeswoman for HealthServe.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Manpower responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post with a news release, issued April 14, saying that authorities are working to “reduce the number of workers in the dormitories and also implement a medical support plan at all dormitories.”


Workers in essential services have been moved out of dormitories, the ministry said, while officials were identifying alternative accommodations for others, such as army camps, sports halls, vacant housing blocks and shipping containers.

“Our immediate priority for the workers in the dormitories is to help them stay healthy and minimize the number that get infected,” said Josephine Teo, Singapore’s manpower minister, in a news conference last week.

In an address to the nation on Tuesday, Singapore prime minister Lee Hsien Loong began by noting that the number of new cases in the local community has leveled off before acknowledging the problematic sharp rise in total cases overwhelmingly among migrants.

“We will care for you just like we care for Singaporeans,” he said. “We will look after your health, your welfare and your livelihood.”

Authorities are also working with organizations such as the Migrant Workers Center, which has a program of “ambassadors” who are helping their colleagues and friends understand hygiene practices, social distancing and practicalities like how to send remittances online. Yeo Guat Kwang, the group’s chairman, said the focus should be on improving conditions in the future.

“In hindsight, everyone would be wiser,” Yeo said. “But this is really an unprecedented global pandemic.”

A second wave of coronavirus infections began taking root in Singapore in mid-March, similar to other places in Asia, like Hong Kong and Taiwan, as residents abroad flocked back to the region when outbreaks intensified in Europe and the United States. But while Hong Kong managed this spike, getting new cases down to single-digits for more than eight days straight, and Taiwan recorded several days this month with no new cases, Singapore now has among the highest number of cases per capita globally.

The migrant workers bearing the brunt of the outbreak are overwhelmingly male and employed in construction and other labor-intensive sectors that Singaporeans avoid. The typical construction worker in Singapore earns about $430 a month, while the median monthly income for Singaporeans is $3,227.

 This field is usually crowded with migrant workers enjoying a day off.
“To keep them cheap, we have to exploit,” said Au from TWC2. “We pack them into [trucks], we pack them into dormitories, and now, when a crisis hits, they have no buffer.”

Clusters have been identified in many dormitories. More than a dozen dormitories have been placed under quarantine, meaning workers cannot leave their rooms, while nearly all dormitory residents are now barred from leaving the facilities, which are guarded by police.

The more than 200,000 dormitory residents are now anxious, bored, isolated and scared. Unable to buy their own groceries, cook for themselves or purchase phone cards to call home, they are almost completely dependent on charity and handouts.

A worker in one of the worst-hit dormitories, who only wanted to be identified by his first name, Ali, was treated for a sore throat and fever before the lockdown, and placed on sick leave until April 9. He was given an “advisory for patients with respiratory tract infection” — a status that means he has to isolate himself from others or be fined $7,000.

That was impossible in his 12-person room, he said. Ali’s cough persisted, but under lockdown, he was unable to seek medical attention for several days.

“Who will give me any treatment or help?” he said in an interview. “I am so scared I will die before any help comes.”


Authorities say that infected dormitory residents have been linked through common work sites, and through places like shopping malls, where many gather on their days off. In the dormitories, before the lockdown, men were able to socialize with each other and cook together, a distraction from their physically demanding jobs and the difficulty of being away from their families.

In an interview Thursday, Ali said he was finally able to see a doctor, who gave him cough syrup and tested him for the coronavirus. He has not heard back. His 11 roommates are trying to keep their distance from each other, but find it near impossible. On a trip to the bathroom on Thursday evening, he found that there was no hand soap.

I may dislike the current lockdown measures, but it's clear that the media's narrative is simply untrue.

The reality is that what we know as community spread doesn't include the dorm-based foreign worker population as the government's measures effectively isolates them from what we see as the community around us. If they addressed the foreign worker situation in its own op-ed, yeah by all means. But to say that the country has lost control of the outbreak while the daily community spread total doesn't even reach triple digits is just incorrect.

185,"Singapore lost control of its coronavirus outbreak, and migrant workers are the victims",2020-04-22 21:50:23,"I would largely disagree. The method of stratifying ""community spread"" and ""dorm"" is very arbitrary.

For example, parallel our way of stratification with other politicians that likes to stratify between old and young. Some republicans will claim that Trump has the virus under control because when you stratify it by age, it will seem like they have it under control, because while death rates amongst the old are very high while death rates amongst the young are negligible. They can say, ""see, if you ignore the old, our statistics look great!"" Would that be correct? Because that's essentially what you're saying, ""if we ignore the dorms, our statistics look great!""

When you talk about whether a country has it under control, you should really include everyone who the government is **responsible** for. Our government is responsible for everyone no matter where they live. HDB, condo, landed, dorms. Just because we don't interact with foreign workers, doesn't mean government is not responsible for them. 

Furthermore, its damn arbitrary as to how we define ""community"". Govt could have stratified it any other way, they could have excluded prisons, they could have excluded old folk's home, they could have even excluded people living in Yishun. They could then quarantine these groups in their homes and say ""they are not in our community, so no community spread, therefore we have in under control"".

I agree it would be much harder to quantify if govt had excluded a particular region rather than just a particular group. I also agree that the government is responsible for the foreign workers living in dorms contracting the virus due to inferior living conditions, there's no two ways about that.

That said, it is just how the situation with migrant workers has been handled by the government that, for the time being, effectively prevents them from mingling with the wider society outside of their dorms or isolation facilities. During this time they're pretty much unable to mingle with the rest of us, which is very unfortunate, but doing so has clearly brought cases outside of the dormitory down to low double digit numbers. I'm just saying that the situation isn't as overblown as the headline makes it out to be.

Hence, I feel the virus is still very much under control, and it will probably remain so as more migrant workers continue to be tested. One can only hope that this blows over quickly and they are allowed to return to the wider society soon, and that the government takes ownership of the dormitory problem and gets it resolved sooner.",2020-04-23 01:10:10,207
