>To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination.

And here's the Moderna one:

>The interim analysis included a concurrent review of the available Phase 3 COVE study safety data by the DSMB, which did not report any significant safety concerns. A review of solicited adverse events indicated that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Grade 3 (severe) events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first dose included injection site pain (2.7%), and after the second dose included fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), headache (4.5%), pain (4.1%) and erythema/redness at the injection site (2.0%). These solicited adverse events were generally short-lived. These data are subject to change based on ongoing analysis of further Phase 3 COVE study data and final analysis.

You usually expect any safety signals to manifest themselves with 7-21 days from the last dose received and from a safety perspective, they appear to be well tolerated.

I am still on the fence because there are so many conflicting information that I am picking up all over.

Given that both Pfizer & Moderna are mRNA-based vaccines and their phase 3 results / data are released at about the same time with similar effectiveness, it gave me a bit more confidence initially.

However I am really a bit alarmed with how UK managed to approve the Pfizer one so quickly. Am interested to see how they roll it out starting from next week, if what they claim is true. And how they botched their response (have some colleagues in the UK) plus the errors with initial results and data from AstraZeneca undermines confidence in them recently.

I sure hope that other countries that do not have the virus under control are now not under pressure (especially looking at USA) to quickly approve vaccines without going through all the necessary processes.

Just reading this article and already some countries rushing the approval process to appear like they are leaders. Very worrying trend.

Firstly, there is no such thing as a perfect vaccine or a perfect drug. There will always be side effects and people  that will be allergic to or not responsive to it. One of the worlds most common drug - Paracetamol (Panadol) has an efficacy rate of 97%. Are you going to stop taking it? The decision to take them are often weighed by side effects against benefits. The side effects at the moment seem to be pretty manageable.

Even if there is a ""perfect"" drug, no one in science will come out claim that it is because that is no such thing as 100% in science. Are you even in healthcare or pharm? Your claim of Pfizer marketing ploy 90%-95% also falls flat because of you don't understand the matric that determines the results. Numbers in this are tied heavily to the number of individual tested. When they released the 90% efficacy rates, testing was probably on-going because you cannot immediately determine the 43000 individuals results at the same time.

Thalidomide was a new drug a few decades ago and was recommended as a drug for hyperemesis gravidarium. Turns out it took them a few months to realise it actually caused birth defects. 

In recent history the dengue vaccine from Sanofi actually was associated with the deaths of over 600 phillippine children despite having been trialled extensively. It is believed that the mechanism was due to antibody dependent enhancement, or an overly exuberant immune reaction to the dengue virus if u will.

Mrna vaccines don't have that tried and tested safety record unlike inactivated virus vaccines.

There are concerns that the lipid nano particles used to encase the mrna can end up in unintended places and trigger off unhelpful inflammatory responses in certain organs.

240,ggs6zag,t1_ggrn311,"Mechanically speaking, mRNA vaccines seem very safe.

Ideally, they prefer specific immune cells, make virus proteins using the host cell machinery using a natural and quickly degraded information carrying molecule.

mRNA cannot integrate into the DNA, neither can it propagate itself. All it can do is tell your protein making machinary to make proteins based on the information encoded on it. The carriers of these mRNA are not viral particles, but rather bubbles of fat molecules, and I read some paper somewhere that says it can be designed to concentrate on the lymphatic system (important in generating immune response).

There’s no chance for the virus to reactivate itself, which is rare but not impossible for weakened virus vaccines, since there is no virus involved. There’s no risk of finding small amounts of intact virus like in inactivated vaccines with poor quality control, because there is no virus involved. Unlike a weakened virus vaccine, the mRNA fat bubbles aren’t going to go into the usual tissues or organs that the virus targets and risk provoking unwanted immune reactions there, since it contains no virus specfic proteins or receptors on the bubble, the proteins that help to direct the virus to its target, because once again, *no virus involved*.

It is synthetic. It’s not harvested using virus particles.

However, its not entirely without risk. One risk I came across was that apparently some COVID viral protein resembles the body’s own proteins, and in some severe covid cases, the body overreacted and was tricked into targeting friendly cells. If the mRNA vaccine manufacturer chose the right protein target, then this is unlikely. Also, if they unluckily chose that allegedly troublesome protein, you would have seen much more cases of severe effects as compared to placebo in trials. If they get it right, you won’t ever come across that unlucky protein. In comparison, you can’t guarantee that in vaccines using destroyed virus fragments or weakened versions of it, because one can be that unlucky.

Some drugs can cause long term side effects because you take it long term and it targets a certain important function in the body, which may be important in some way that wasn’t predicted. But the Pfizer one which we have right now does not do that. It doesn’t target any cellular function and it is unlikely to do so, and the most likely consequences are immune related ones. And as mentioned earlier, the mechanism of this type of vaccine would have made it more preferable than other traditional types of vaccine.

277,ggtd53u,t1_ggt3feb,"Long term side effects usually comes from long term use of a medication. It happens because the way modern medicine works. 

The body has lots of natural processes going on. Some of this processes, when out of “balance”, can lead to disease. Drugs target aspects of such biological processes to bring it back to “balance”, sometimes by blocking it, sometimes by enhancing it. 

Drugs are *small* molecules. The body doesn’t care about the atoms making up the molecule, the body cares about the *shape*. These specially designed drug molecules go into the protein (or other molecules) and do its “magic”, affecting the natural biological processes and bring it into balance.

One problem with this is that the body sometimes likes to reuse the same protein (or family of similar proteins) in different places to control different processes. A drug may unintentionally affect an otherwise unintended process(es) and cause long term unforseen problems.

Another problem is that a drug can target some completely unexpected target. As I said earlier, the shape is important. While a drug can be designed to fit a certain protein, there is chance that by coincidence, it can also hit some unrelated protein elsewhere and affect other processes and cause problems in the long term.

Also, ultimately, all drugs are poison and the only thing that differentiate medicine from poison is the dosage. Too much of an effect can be bad. There are drugs that can cause damage to organs at higher dosages, for example. 

Sometimes, the drug molecule itself can be chemically reactive, and can cause damage. Keep using it and you get long term damage. Rarely, if such chemically reactive drug damage the DNA enough over the years, people can even get cancer. Fortunately, people know some of the common reactive features and avoid those.

To complicate things, the body tends to do things to a drug molecule to make it easier to get rid of it. That thing can be inherently toxic (such as one of paracetamol/panadol’s metabolite), or it can have effects of its own.

There are a lot of ways for a drug to cause long term problems and side effects. However, does this mean mRNA vaccines can do so too? There are differences between mRNA and drug molecules and that makes things different.

Ultimately, mRNA is a naturally occuring information carrying molecule. You have it in your body and it comes in many different lengths. The mRNA in the vaccine is not going to be any more reactive than those you already have!

Compared to drug molecules, mRNA are huge. Things bind to sites on the mRNA, not really the other way around. It’s not very likely to trigger things you wouldn’t expect a normal mRNA to trigger.

Inherently, mRNA are not toxic, so that is one safe part.

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the viral product it encode for can target unwanted processes and cause effects, it isn’t something very likely. Given that mRNA is not very stable, it doesn’t stay for long and you are only exposed to the amounts injected. Even if the product is not harmless, it is transient and shouldn’t cause too much of an effect, and unlikely to cause a long-term one. Your body can take a bit of damage. You go out under the sun? Damage. Eat or touch stuff too hot? Damage. Etc etc.

It would be *far worse* to get the real deal, since the actual virus can replicate and make much much more potentially harmful viral proteins that a mRNA vaccine can cause your body to produce, on top of other problems associated with the actual covid virus.

To be honest, the most likely reactions are immune related ones and those most side effects are short term and not likely to be very harmful.

If you react very negatively to the mRNA in the vaccine and the protein it produces, I don’t think you would fare any better with the real virus.

The chances of the vaccine working as intended safely is high, probably better odds with that then the odds between mild and serious covid.",t3_killem,2020-12-24 01:41:54,Pyrrylanion,7,COVID-19 vaccine stirs rare hesitation in nearly virus-free Singapore,t3_killem,92,killem,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-singapore-vaccine-idUSKBN28X0BP?taid=5fe2bf9aca1f440001beee27&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter,119,2020-12-23 11:58:50,0.91,"['long', 'term', 'side', 'effect', 'usual', 'come', 'long', 'term', 'use', 'medic', 'happen', 'way', 'modern', 'medicin', 'work', 'bodi', 'lot', 'natur', 'process', 'go', 'process', 'balanc', 'lead', 'diseas', 'drug', 'target', 'aspect', 'biolog', 'process', 'bring', 'back', 'balanc', 'sometim', 'block', 'sometim', 'enhanc', 'drug', 'small', 'molecul', 'bodi', 'care', 'atom', 'make', 'molecul', 'bodi', 'care', 'shape', 'special', 'design', 'drug', 'molecul', 'go', 'protein', 'molecul', 'magic', 'affect', 'natur', 'biolog', 'process', 'bring', 'balanc', 'one', 'problem', 'bodi', 'sometim', 'like', 'reus', 'protein', 'famili', 'similar', 'protein', 'differ', 'place', 'control', 'differ', 'process', 'drug', 'may', 'unintent', 'affect', 'otherwis', 'unintend', 'process', 'es', 'caus', 'long', 'term', 'unforseen', 'problem', 'anoth', 'problem', 'drug', 'target', 'complet', 'unexpect', 'target', 'said', 'earlier', 'shape', 'import', 'drug', 'design', 'fit', 'certain', 'protein', 'chanc', 'coincid', 'also', 'hit', 'unrel', 'protein', 'elsewher', 'affect', 'process', 'caus', 'problem', 'long', 'term', 'also', 'ultim', 'drug', 'poison', 'thing', 'differenti', 'medicin', 'poison', 'dosag', 'much', 'effect', 'bad', 'drug', 'caus', 'damag', 'organ', 'higher', 'dosag', 'exampl', 'sometim', 'drug', 'molecul', 'chemic', 'reactiv', 'caus', 'damag', 'keep', 'use', 'get', 'long', 'term', 'damag', 'rare', 'chemic', 'reactiv', 'drug', 'damag', 'dna', 'enough', 'year', 'peopl', 'even', 'get', 'cancer', 'fortun', 'peopl', 'know', 'common', 'reactiv', 'featur', 'avoid', 'complic', 'thing', 'bodi', 'tend', 'thing', 'drug', 'molecul', 'make', 'easier', 'get', 'rid', 'thing', 'inher', 'toxic', 'one', 'metabolit', 'effect', 'lot', 'way', 'drug', 'caus', 'long', 'term', 'problem', 'side', 'effect', 'howev', 'mean', 'mrna', 'vaccin', 'differ', 'mrna', 'drug', 'molecul', 'make', 'thing', 'differ', 'ultim', 'mrna', 'natur', 'occur', 'inform', 'carri', 'molecul', 'bodi', 'come', 'mani', 'differ', 'length', 'mrna', 'vaccin', 'go', 'reactiv', 'alreadi', 'compar', 'drug', 'molecul', 'mrna', 'huge', 'thing', 'bind', 'site', 'mrna', 'realli', 'way', 'around', 'like', 'trigger', 'thing', 'expect', 'normal', 'mrna', 'trigger', 'inher', 'mrna', 'toxic', 'one', 'safe', 'part', 'although', 'rule', 'possibl', 'viral', 'product', 'encod', 'target', 'unwant', 'process', 'caus', 'effect', 'someth', 'like', 'given', 'mrna', 'stabl', 'stay', 'long', 'expos', 'amount', 'inject', 'even', 'product', 'harmless', 'transient', 'caus', 'much', 'effect', 'unlik', 'caus', 'one', 'bodi', 'take', 'bit', 'damag', 'go', 'sun', 'damag', 'eat', 'touch', 'stuff', 'hot', 'damag', 'etc', 'etc', 'would', 'far', 'wors', 'get', 'real', 'deal', 'sinc', 'actual', 'viru', 'replic', 'make', 'much', 'much', 'potenti', 'harm', 'viral', 'protein', 'mrna', 'vaccin', 'caus', 'bodi', 'produc', 'top', 'problem', 'associ', 'actual', 'covid', 'viru', 'honest', 'like', 'reaction', 'immun', 'relat', 'one', 'side', 'effect', 'short', 'term', 'like', 'harm', 'react', 'neg', 'mrna', 'vaccin', 'protein', 'produc', 'think', 'would', 'fare', 'better', 'real', 'viru', 'chanc', 'vaccin', 'work', 'intend', 'safe', 'high', 'probabl', 'better', 'odd', 'odd', 'mild', 'seriou', 'covid']","Long term side effects usually comes from long term use of a medication.

At this moment in Singapore, the benefits of inoculation don't exactly outweigh the risks. Covid-19 isn't ravaging our hospitals (unlike in the United States), so there isn't an urgent need to protect oneself with a vaccine. In addition, there are [valid concerns regarding long-term side effects](https://www.jpost.com/health-science/could-an-mrna-vaccine-be-dangerous-in-the-long-term-649253) of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Healthcare workers may perceive themselves to be guinea pigs, rather than beneficiaries, of this novel and untested mRNA technology.

At this moment in Singapore, the benefits of inoculation don't exactly outweigh the risks. Covid-19 isn't ravaging our hospitals (unlike in the United States), so there isn't an urgent need to protect oneself with a vaccine. In addition, there are [valid concerns regarding long-term side effects](https://www.jpost.com/health-science/could-an-mrna-vaccine-be-dangerous-in-the-long-term-649253) of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Healthcare workers may perceive themselves to be guinea pigs, rather than beneficiaries, of this novel and untested mRNA technology.

It ultimately boils down to personal choice and agency. After all, no one likes to be told what to do. People may feel more comfortable with inoculation if they have a say on when they get vaccinated and which vaccine they take.

Usually phase 3 takes longer, but a lot of what usually happens in phase 3 was done in phase 1 and 2 (funding, preparation, and even manufacturing of the vaccine), or done in parallel.

The first burden is to understand how does vaccines work and how long they take to work. This portion is where I feel a lot of you 'wait and see' people don't really get. Vaccines (even mRna) work by activating your body's immunity to fight against the virus. 3 outcomes can happen. 1 is that your immunity don't get activated, 2 is that the vaccine activates your immunity and it kills the virus, 3 is that the vaccine activates but starts attacking the everything including your vital organs - that is what we call an autoimmune disease. - the process and the timeline for this 3 scenario to happen is pretty short. You don't need to wait for a long time for this 3 scenarios to happen. Plus the Pfizer clinical trial has been past 3 months.
Where it gets tricky for the layman is that they confuse medication that causes long term effects with vaccines. Even medicine that causes long term effects don't cause long term effects with 1-2 dose. It causes damage with long term use.

The 2nd burden is to properly educate the public within these 3 months regarding the vaccines. That is the proper channel to go through.

460,gj2svgj,t1_gj2qdck,"HAHA gosh you are trying really hard to twist my words.

>You yourself have said it’s about risk assessment. A doctor can give their risk assessment of whether a vaccine should be taken based on their informed opinions. What you’re really asking for is that all doctors should push the vaccination, which then means there is no proper risk assessment done.

I am not a doctor yet but I'll give you an example of doing an unbiased risk assessment without giving my opinions. At the end of this test you will find that ultimately I have not influenced you in anyway.

With regards to the Pfizer Vaccine, it is a new technology. Unlike previous vaccines where they introduce a inactivated virus into your body which would activate your immunity system to fight against this Covid virus. Instead of inject a virus, they inject a protein into your body. It is supposedly safer because you are not injecting a virus into your body. There is a fear (not a risk) that this protein may cause some autoimmune issues, this is an opinion of some people there is no data of this happening. The technology has been studied for decades but they have not pushed this to the markets. The reason is that this technology is an expensive solution to the traditional solution (they ultimately do the same thing) but from a market perspective it is largely unproven. Whether it is safe or not, nobody has enough data to conclusively tell you whether it is safe to take or not. You have to decide on your own.

>You yourself have said it’s about risk assessment. A doctor can give their risk assessment of whether a vaccine should be taken based on their informed opinions. What you’re really asking for is that all doctors should push the vaccination, which then means there is no proper risk assessment done.

I am not a doctor yet but I'll give you an example of doing an unbiased risk assessment without giving my opinions. At the end of this test you will find that ultimately I have not influenced you in anyway.

With regards to the Pfizer Vaccine, it is a new technology. Unlike previous vaccines where they introduce a inactivated virus into your body which would activate your immunity system to fight against this Covid virus. Instead of inject a virus, they inject a protein into your body. It is supposedly safer because you are not injecting a virus into your body. There is a fear (not a risk) that this protein may cause some autoimmune issues, this is an opinion of some people there is no data of this happening. The technology has been studied for decades but they have not pushed this to the markets. The reason is that this technology is an expensive solution to the traditional solution (they ultimately do the same thing) but from a market perspective it is largely unproven. Whether it is safe or not, nobody has enough data to conclusively tell you whether it is safe to take or not. You have to decide on your own. Known side effects for the vaccines are also common there may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site. Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination. These normal vaccine reactions are usually mild and subside after a few days.

Ultimately, you should decide to take an unproven vaccine vs trying to return to a time where there is no fear of getting Covid."
