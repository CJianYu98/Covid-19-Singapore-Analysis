1 they do their fair part for businesses and the community
2 they don't shirk from their primary responsibility, which is to have a resilient balance sheet and not end up requiring govt bailout (compared to American banks during the global financial crisis)
3 they are sensible employers",2020-05-21 22:30:04,52

Just because the government subsidizes the cost of wages which is an operational expense, doesn't mean that demand is artificially generated by said subsidy. 

If a bank requires 10 tellers in a branch in order to operate at full capacity, adding 10 more tellers ain't going to see it generate double the amount of revenue and double the profit.

It can only work if there is long term investment plans in increasing capacity, and companies aren't going to do that unless they are confident that this investment will be utilized by customers.

The best way that the government can help these companies is to ensure that there is continual demand for goods and services and the ability for people to service these demand by having cash in pocket.",2020-05-22 13:01:23,152

> Half of them will be placed in new roles, the spokesperson said, adding that many of these new roles will also go to graduates.

> The Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) also plans to use the JSS payouts to create new jobs and improve existing positions.

> Its group brand and communications head Koh Ching Ching said that the bank is “intensifying training and development across the organisation” to prepare its workers for a post-COVID-19 future.

> “New roles will be required and some existing roles have to be reviewed for redesign to fit into the future job landscape,” she said.

> The JSS will help to fulfil these plans, as well as support “a wide range of welfare schemes for our employees”, she added.

> On Thursday, Citi Singapore announced that it was joining a list of companies that have returned the wage subsidies.

> The Ministry of Finance announced early this month that 32 companies had returned JSS payouts worth a combined S$35 million as of May 9.

> These companies also pledged to decline future JSS payouts from the Government, MOF said then, adding that the S$35 million in returned payouts would be used for future disbursements.

> Both DBS and OCBC pointed out their charitable efforts in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> DBS said that it is donating S$2.5 million to provide 700,000 meals to the elderly, low-income and migrant worker communities in Singapore, while OCBC said it had given out about S$1.5 million worth of aid to help vulnerable seniors, migrant workers and needy families.

> Both banks, as well as United Overseas Bank, pledged in April not to lay off employees because of COVID-19.

4,Wage subsidies from Jobs Support Scheme will be used to create new jobs: Singapore banks,2020-05-21 21:15:52,"A nice side effect of JSS being automatically given is that we get to see companies that don't need it (due to being more or less fully operational) do good stuff with the extra money.

However once again we must wonder how many have merely pocketed the ""windfall"".

Its kinda like that shopping trolley experiment. No one will punish you for not returning the trolley but you should do so anyway to be a good person.

Same here, there is no governmental regulation to punish companies from not spending surplus JSS funds appropriately, but good companies should do so anyway.

And if some companies don't, no one can really do anything about it. Except maybe silently judge them from a distance.",2020-05-21 21:21:34,119

Holy shit, if you tell someone there is two people of same skill but one of them cost you 40,000 less in the first year who do you think you hire? The government has already handicapped the FT , what more do we want?",2020-05-22 01:45:18,61

Also the JSS monies are specifically only for locals so i seriously doubt any of the banks especially the locals ones will be using that to create new jobs for non locals.",2020-05-22 00:21:34,57
