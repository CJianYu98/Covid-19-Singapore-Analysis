17,[LIVE HD] COVID-19: Heng Swee Keat delivers 4th Budget to support Singaporeans and businesses,2020-05-26 15:32:14,"Maybe someone can clarify who understood it better but - under the extension of JSS - he made two points.

* 1 more month to cover wages till August 2020 
   * This coverage of 25% to 75% applies to firms that are on the permitted list to resume operations after 2nd of June, right? The same one found here -  [https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/permittedlist/](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/permittedlist/) 
* For firms that are NOT allowed to resume operations, the wage support is still at 75% - regardless of what industry your firm is in.

The clarification needed here is - well, is your firm considered ""not allowed to resume operation"" as long as your industry is not on that permitted list?

For example, I work for an events company that does mainly team bonding and I'm sitting here wondering if we still continue to apply for the 75% or not?

If no one has the answer, I'm wondering which organization I should call for some clarification? Would it be GoBusiness COVID? The same organization that has the posted list of permitted businesses allowed to resume?

Just like how landlords kept benefits for themselves, I’ve heard of companies who pretty much let go of all their staff a day prior to the circuit breaker.

One of my friends and all his coworkers were handed their termination letters five minutes before closing on the last day the business was allowed to stay open (April 6).

46,[LIVE HD] COVID-19: Heng Swee Keat delivers 4th Budget to support Singaporeans and businesses,2020-05-26 15:32:14,"Won't the retail industry get the same Jobs Support Scheme so that they won't lay employees off? If I understand this correctly, the employers will also have to maintain the similar average wage levels as before (i.e. in Oct/Nov 2019) to qualify for the JSS, or else some of the money will get clawed back. 

In any case, I am not sure higher direct cash transfers to citizens (as opposed to JSS) is a better idea. In the short-term a direct cash transfer will help impacted folks quickly. However, when companies end up furloughing or laying off employees, or just go bankrupt, there might not be a job for the employees to go back to. This will cause further disruptions and slow the economic recovery.

I think the ultimate aim here is to preserve otherwise economically viable companies and avoid employers laying people off so that people can get back to work quickly as the circuit breaker is lifted and reopening progresses.

This is similar to what European countries are doing, and is in contrast to the American approach of enhancing unemployment payments while supporting only targeted industries (hospitals, airlines, etc...).",2020-05-26 17:06:57,189

Yeah companies typically don't, especially if they are diversified. The advice for an emergency fund is given to individuals because most of us have our eggs in one basket (our one full-time job) and if we lose that, we lose all our income. 

Larger companies might plan for 10 or 20% of their stores/factories temporarily closing and revenues going down by that much because of unexpected events, but they don't usually plan for scenarios where all their facilities close for two or three months at a time.",2020-05-26 19:23:35,101

Likewise, there is nothing stopping a company that is otherwise doing well from simply closing and laying off their employees to avoid paying them during this period.

60,[LIVE HD] COVID-19: Heng Swee Keat delivers 4th Budget to support Singaporeans and businesses,2020-05-26 15:32:14,"Not every business has a large enough profit margin to easily keep 6 months of savings, especially if they’re businesses only 1-3 years old. Rent / utilities eats a lot of monthly revenue. I understand from a non-business owner’s perspective it looks like a lot of help from the G, but imagine let’s say company A has 10 employees and they pay them a good $3000 per month, that’s already $30000. And then on top of that having your revenue cut by up to 80%, and not even getting any real help from landlords (either pushing payment back or just cutting off the tax payment you gotta do for rent), and this quickly snowballs into absolute hell for business owners.  

So yes, the additional help prevents employees from losing a stable income, but then there are also other companies genuinely struggling financially even with good money management. Especially for SMEs, there’s really a huge overestimation of how much profit they truly bring in per month. It’s not as much as people assume.",2020-05-26 20:45:39,170

The problem with these events is that every single crisis is different with varying impact on industries. For instance, retail sales (of non-essential goods) probably dropped somewhat during 1985, 1997, and 2009, but sales certainly didn't go to zero for two months. Prudent retailers would plan for a repeat of 2009, but probably not 2020-style lockdowns around the world.

Yeah, this is the moral hazard of governments mounting a rescue operation every time there is a crisis, so I believe that companies getting a bailout should feel some pain -- a dilution of the common stockholders would be a good start. 

However, letting lots of companies fail isn't tenable either -- ultimately when companies go bankrupt, it is citizens like you and I that get laid off and end up with no income.

I tend to think of it this way, because it is literally the point of stuff like counter-cyclical fiscal policy. Tax more during good times, stimulus during bad.

They would be right to do so too: if the shops/factories are all closed on government orders and no one is working, why should they pay their workers? The companies are not in the business of providing a safety net either.

> SINGAPORE - The Government will announce an unprecedented third round of support measures to help tide Singapore through the one month of Covid-19 ""circuit breaker"" distancing measures, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Sweet Keat said on Sunday (April 5).

> Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said the measures to support workers, businesses and households will be announced when Parliament sits on Monday.

> To be called the Solidarity Budget, the supplementary measures mark the first time in history that the Government has released three Budget statements in less than two months while tapping on Singapore's reserves, and come as enhanced measures to break the chain of virus transmission come into effect next week that will result in all schools and most workplaces closing.

> Mr Heng said the Covid-19 situation has taken a very sharp turn, both globally and locally, and strong measures have to be taken to protect lives.

> But the economy has taken a hit as a result.

> ""We must remain steadfast in the face of crisis, and stand in solidarity with one another during these difficult times,"" he said.

> ""I am therefore naming this set of measures to tide us through the 'circuit breaker' the Solidarity Budget.""

> The new set of measures follows a nearly $55 billion package from the Feb 18 Unity Budget and March 26 Resilience Budget aimed at protecting jobs, helping enterprises with immediate challenges, and strengthening economic and social resilience so Singapore can emerge intact and stronger.

> ""Unity, Resilience, Solidarity - these values will come to define who we are as a people,"" said Mr Heng, who called the fight against Covid-19 the defining chapter of this generation.

> ""The bonds that bind us together will be forged and renewed in this crisis, much as how the turbulent years of Independence brought our founding generation together.""

> He thanked earlier generations of Singaporeans who have saved up and built strong foundations for the country, giving the Government the wherewithal to dip into the country's savings to protect people and their jobs.

> ""When the storm eventually subsides, as all storms do, I am confident that as a stronger society, we can build an even better future for our children and our grandchildren,"" he wrote on Facebook.

> Mr Heng will deliver his ministerial statement at 2pm on Monday, the Ministry of Finance said.

> The speech will be broadcast live on various platforms, and will also be published on the Singapore Budget website after it is delivered.

> Parliament will also resume its debate on the Resilience Budget that Mr Heng delivered on March 26.

> He will then round up the debate on Tuesday.

Devaluing or debasing your own currency will not improve your ability to buy goods on the global market, and would not change anything with regards to stimulua

This is why the government is financially prudent. You have to have massive foreign reserves to be able to effect fiscal stimulus effectively in the globalised world. Modern monetary theory provides an understanding of cash, but that doesn't help at all without a corresponding understanding of the rest of the economy.",2020-04-05 23:35:41,91

Most of the money supply exists in the form of credit (ie. M2 & M3). This is not created by the government anyway; it is created primarily by commercial banks. As such, the easiest way to manipulate the money supply is using interest rates; however, in Singapore interest rates are floating. The exchange rate-based monetary policy MAS uses also has some control over the money supply, but we all know there hasn't been massive easing just by looking at the exchange rate.

Finally, even if the government did print money, it would be loaned from the MAS to the government, as there is no direct transfer mechanism; as such, it would show up as a SGS issue.",2020-04-06 05:18:44,116
