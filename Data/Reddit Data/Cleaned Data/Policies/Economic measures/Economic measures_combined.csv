Rather than to directly supply $$ to the companies (which could be misappropriated/benefit only bosses or unknowingly support companies already on life support pre-COVID), the $100 is kinda giving citizens a say as to where the ""bailout"" should go.

> SINGAPORE - Singaporeans aged 18 and above this year will each receive $100 in digital vouchers to spend on staycations, tickets to leisure attractions and local tours.

> The SingapoRediscovers Vouchers will be accessible via SingPass from December and can be used to offset ticket purchases and hotel stays through the end of June next year. Permanent residents will not be eligible for the vouchers.

> Adult Singaporeans will also be able to purchase up to six subsidised tickets for attractions and tours - each at $10 off - for those under 18 from December to the end of next June.

> Announcing the details on Wednesday (Sept 16), Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said the duration of the voucher programme is timed to coincide with the June and December holidays and spreading out demand in between.

> The initiative is not a social assistance scheme, he added.

> ""This is an economic scheme to help our tourist attractions preserve their capabilities that have been built up over their years while they consolidate the capacity in the interim,"" Mr Chan told reporters during a visit to the Jurong Bird Park.

> The $320 million SingapoRediscovers Vouchers scheme was first announced last month and forms part of the Government’s efforts to prop up the tourism sector, which has been decimated by travel restrictions amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

> The vouchers, which will come in denominations of $10, can be used at all licensed hotels, leisure attractions and for local tours by operators that have received approval from the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to reopen or resume.

> There are currently 214 hotels, 40 attractions and 438 tour itineraries that have been given the green light to resume operations with safe management measures in place. They include Singapore's four wildlife parks, a number of activities and hotels on Sentosa and guided tours of Pulau Ubin.

> The vouchers complement the $45 million SingapoRediscovers marketing campaign, launched in July to encourage locals to holiday at home and support local businesses.

> More than 200 deals and packages have been launched so far, and the vouchers will give locals more incentive to rediscover their backyard, STB said on Wednesday.

> The tourism board said specific details on how vouchers can be redeemed will be announced in November.

> While STB expects that the redemption process for the vouchers ""will adopt a digital mode by default"", it will provide support for those who have difficulties using such methods.

> Industry players have said that the vouchers will act as a form of indirect discounting for businesses, as lowering prices is a challenge with capacity limits on their operations in place.

> HIGHER CAPACITY LIMITS FOR ATTRACTIONS

> However, tourist attractions - which are currently restricted to 25 per cent of their operating capacity at any one time - can apply to increase this to 50 per cent from Friday.

> 

> Adult Singaporeans will also be able to purchase up to six subsidised tickets for attractions and tours for those under 18 from December to the end of next June. ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG

> 

> They can also seek STB's permission to scale up the capacity at their outdoor shows to 250 people, up from 50 currently. But shows must be split into five zones with a maximum of 50 people in each, with safe distancing between groups as well as zones.

> Related Story Staycations under $180: Explore trendy locales while staying at these chic boutique hotels

> Related Story Tourist at home: Explore Singapore with cool local tours

> This means the limit for outdoor shows at attractions will be in line with the maximum number of participants soon to be allowed at approved meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (Mice) events.

> STB said on Wednesday that the easing of rules for attractions comes as operators have been effective at preventing and dispersing crowds, as well as maintaining high standards of cleanliness and hygiene.

> All attractions have also introduced online booking systems for timed-entry or pre-booking of activities to monitor and control visitor numbers, it said.

And maybe i read too much into this but I'd like to provide my viewpoint as a true born local. Anti-foreigner sentiments have been stirred up in the midst of the pandemic and also apparent from polling day. Issues like job security and discriminatory hiring are very real and true. (i too, got retrenched but not saying that i dislike foreigners. More like the disdain for overly open immigrant friendly Singapore. But also acknowledging that with our low birth rate, we do need additional workforce) 

It's a great and right thing that Singapore would want to prioritise providing benefits for locals (including converted singaporeans), such as sg traineeship or the job wage support scheme. And not for other ep or spass. (sorry, not sorry). 

Should Singapore provide benefits to PRs equal to true local born and bred singaporeans, such as a hypothetical universal basic income, how would singaporeans feel?

But well, i digress. Maybe i feel triggered because there are possible self entitled (really not implying u) ppl who feel tt they deserve exact equals of locals. (despite not even having being converted to pink ic yet) Of course in this case, $100 is not a big sum of money. And by providing this, the main rationale is to help inject funds into the travel sector based on personal choice. 

This might be due to other factors like concerns over overcrowding. (my best bet) Or to appease singaporeans? Policies are never perfect and have their pros and cons.",2020-09-17 08:59:49,248

It’s really interesting to see that perspective. And as a foreigner and EP holder I completely understand your position. I guess at the end of the day every country needs to look after its own. I would say 99% of foreigners understand that here. I think the only thing that truly feels a bit off living here atm as a foreigner is you can feel there is a tension in the air around us being here. I for one am so grateful for the opportunity to be here and have come here knowing how welcoming the country is. But things are changing and it’s gets harder to manage living here. So it might be time to leave soon. Some would rejoice, another foreigner gone, however I can’t help but wonder who is going to replace me as no one is Singapore is trained in what I do as there is no university course for it here or training opportunities as it’s an incredibly niche field. My company will simply move the role back to Europe or the US and the Singaporean economy will suffer as a result. It’s a lose lose I think. That’s just my perspective on the bigger picture here.

> SINGAPORE - From December this year, Singaporeans aged 18 and above will be given $100 worth of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers to spend on local attractions, hotel stays and tours.

> Here are some answers to common questions on the vouchers.

> 1. How much vouchers will you get?

> Each eligible Singapore citizen will receive $100 worth of vouchers to spend on approved hotel stays, attraction tickets and tours, as part of the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers scheme. The vouchers will be in denominations of $10.

> 2. Who is eligible?

> The SingapoRediscovers Vouchers will be available to all Singapore citizens aged 18 and above in 2020.

> All adult Singaporeans are also entitled to purchase up to six child or youth tickets for younger relatives under the age of 18, at $10 off per ticket. So, besides parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, other relatives and legal guardians can purchase such subsidised tickets.

> To do so, however, the adult must declare his familial relationship to the child or youth, and must have at least $10 left in your SingapoRediscovers Vouchers balance.

> 3. When can the vouchers be used?

> The vouchers can be redeemed from Dec 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.

> 4. What can I spend the tourism vouchers on?

> They can be used at all Singapore Tourism Board (STB) approved hotels, leisure attractions and local tours.

> As of Monday (Nov 23), STB said 230 hotels, 971 tour itineraries, 43 attractions and 230 hotels have been approved to resume operations.

> For now, the vouchers can be used at 178 hotels which represents about 77 per cent of hotels allowed to re-open.

> They can be spent on the tours offered by 79 tour operators.

> As for attractions, 39 of them, or 91 per cent meet the eligibility criteria for the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers.

> The full list of eligible merchants can be found here.

> 5. Can the vouchers be used on cruises, shopping and food and beverage and at weddings?

> Generally, no, even if a wedding package includes a hotel stay.

> But the vouchers may be used for retail and F&B only if they are part of an approved package including a hotel stay, attraction visit and/or tour.

> Such packages must meet certain criteria such as ensuring that the retail or F&B component is used during the same period as the hotel stay, attraction visit and/or tours.

> For instance, the vouchers could be used for a one-night room stay bundled with dinner for two at the hotel’s restaurant.

> Simlarly, vouchers can only be redeemed for cruises as part of a bundled package.

> 6. Can the vouchers be used all at once?

> You can decide on the value of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers you want to redeem for each purchase.

> Each voucher comes in denominations of $10 and any unused value in a voucher will be wasted. For instance, if you buy one $25 attraction ticket and use $30 worth of vouchers, the $5 leftover from the vouchers will be wasted. You can instead use $20 worth of vouchers and top up the remaining $5 with cash.

> You can check your current SingapoRediscovers Voucher balance at this website from Dec 1.

> 7. How do I redeem the vouchers?

> The SingapoRediscovers Vouchers can be redeemed online through five authorised booking partners: Changi Recommends; GlobalTix; Klook & UOB Travel Planners; Traveloka; and Trip.com.

> 8. Users can redeem their Vouchers by following these steps:

> - Have your SingPass ready. Citizens are encouraged to register for a SingPass account if they do not have one, or reset their SingPass password if they have forgotten it, before the scheme commences on 1 Dec 2020.

> - Choose your products. Browse the websites of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers authorised booking partners. Eligible products are marked ""eligible for SingapoRediscovers Vouchers"" or with the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers icon. Add your item(s) to the shopping cart. To pay, click ""Use SingapoRediscovers Vouchers"" at the checkout page.

> - Login with SingPass to:

> a. Select the voucher amount to use.

> b. Activate child/youth subsidies. If you are purchasing child/youth tickets, please declare details of any family members under the age of 18. Up to six child/youth tickets will be subsidised by $10 each.

> - A voucher code will be generated. Copy and paste this at the booking partner's checkout page, and pay the outstanding amount (if any). Payment modes may differ from merchant to merchant, but most debit and credit cards will be accepted for the payment of any outstanding amount.

> - You must complete the checkout process within 10 minutes. Your vouchers are only deducted after you have completed the booking.

> 9. Where can people redeem their SingapoRediscovers vouchers? Can non-seniors redeem them from physical counters?

> Authorised booking partners will provide assistance at 69 locations across Singapore, with most located within CCs or within a five-minute walk from CCs. Booking counters will also be available at selected malls and SingPost locations.

> Of the 69 counters, 30 are run by Changi Recommends, 23 are run by GlobalTix, and 16 are run by Klook and UOB Travel.

> Each physical counter caters for bookings from only one of the three mentioned booking partners. So a Changi Recommends counter only allows bookings for packages under it, not those by GlobalTix, for instance.

> STB advised customers to ascertain what packages they wish to book, before heading down to the physical counter nearest to them.

> If the counter does not have the package they wish to book, consumers can book them online or visit a physical counter by a booking partner which has the package.

> Non-seniors can also redeem their vouchers at these physical counters, although STB recommends that citizens redeem their vouchers online, and assist family members and friends who require help with online transactions.

> 10. Why do merchants have to pay a commission to booking platforms?

> When asked, STB did not say why booking platforms can charge merchants commissions. But it said that booking partners provide marketing resources to help Singaporeans discover eligible merchants.

> These partners also have the manpower to operate physical counters islandwide and the resources to provide customer and merchant support.

> 11. Will hotels, attractions and tours jack up their prices due to the vouchers?

> STB said it takes a serious view of practices such as profiteering and said it will penalise merchants found to have done so.

> 12. Are vouchers transferable between individuals and can they be pooled with other people's vouchers?

> Your SingapoRediscovers Vouchers cannot be stacked or combined with another person's within the same redemption.

> But you may purchase an eligible product using your vouchers, and transfer the product to another person provided the merchant allows it.

> For more information, please visit this website. A how-to video on how to redeem your vouchers is available online as well. Alternatively, a hotline (1800-2828-228) is open from 8am to 10pm daily, for those who might require further assistance.

Hey guys,  
  
Testing the waters to see how useful this is.  
  

I noticed the STB website only listed the names of the attractions and not much info. I've gathered the addressees, tripadvisor ratings and categories for the Attractions where you can use the Rediscover Singapore Vouchers. This is to hopefully kickstart some discussion and make it easier for you guys to decide where to use your vouchers.

It's meant as a stimulus for the tourism industry. The ideal outcome is for people to use their vouchers on places, and spend more of their own money there on food/souvenirs etc.

> It has been about a month and a half since all Singaporeans received S$100 in SingapoRediscovers vouchers to spend on local hotels, attractions, and tours to support Singapore's tourism industry.

> For those of you out there who haven't decided how to use your vouchers, or who wish to put your vouchers toward a good cause, one option is to use them to purchase Singapore Flyer tickets for migrant workers.

> Initiative by ItsRainingRaincoats

> Through an opportunity organised by local community initiative ItsRainingRaincoats (IRR), Singaporeans can donate their SingapoRediscovers to migrant workers, a group that was hit disproportionately hard by the Covid-19 pandemic in Singapore.

> Here's how you can use your vouchers to fund one or more migrant workers to have the experience of riding the Singapore Flyer:

> 1. Go to the Klook link.

> The tickets can be purchased on Klook here.

> 2. Select the date and number of tickets.

> Scroll down to the package options. Click ""Check availability"" and select Mar. 8, 2021 as the date.

> Select the number of tickets that you wish to purchase. Each ticket is S$35, and includes entrance to the Singapore Flyer and its newest attraction, The Time Capsule.

> Once you have done so, click ""Book now"".

> 3. Log in or sign up for an account to proceed with the order.

> Once you have either logged in to or signed up for a Klook account, you will be directed to a new page to enter your booking info.

> Tick the box acknowledging that the purchase goes toward IRR, to purchase tickets for migrant workers.

> 4. Fill in your contact information

> 5. Select the ""Use SingapoRediscovers Vouchers"" option.

> Once again, click ""Use Singaporediscovers Vouchers"", which will open up a new window of the LifeSG SingapoRediscovers website.

> There, select ""Redeem vouchers"", which you can redeem using your SingPass.

> Select ""Copy voucher code"".

> 6. Enter voucher code(s).

> Back on Klook, paste the copied promo code(s) into the box.

> Select ""Redeem"", and then ""Book now"".

* 1 more month to cover wages till August 2020 
   * This coverage of 25% to 75% applies to firms that are on the permitted list to resume operations after 2nd of June, right? The same one found here -  [https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/permittedlist/](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/permittedlist/) 
* For firms that are NOT allowed to resume operations, the wage support is still at 75% - regardless of what industry your firm is in.

The clarification needed here is - well, is your firm considered ""not allowed to resume operation"" as long as your industry is not on that permitted list?

For example, I work for an events company that does mainly team bonding and I'm sitting here wondering if we still continue to apply for the 75% or not?

If no one has the answer, I'm wondering which organization I should call for some clarification? Would it be GoBusiness COVID? The same organization that has the posted list of permitted businesses allowed to resume?

If I understand this correctly, the employers will also have to maintain the similar average wage levels as before (i.e. in Oct/Nov 2019) to qualify for the JSS, or else some of the money will get clawed back. 

In any case, I am not sure higher direct cash transfers to citizens (as opposed to JSS) is a better idea. In the short-term a direct cash transfer will help impacted folks quickly. However, when companies end up furloughing or laying off employees, or just go bankrupt, there might not be a job for the employees to go back to. This will cause further disruptions and slow the economic recovery.

I think the ultimate aim here is to preserve otherwise economically viable companies and avoid employers laying people off so that people can get back to work quickly as the circuit breaker is lifted and reopening progresses.

Yeah companies typically don't, especially if they are diversified. The advice for an emergency fund is given to individuals because most of us have our eggs in one basket (our one full-time job) and if we lose that, we lose all our income.

Today’s parliament session is an exception because everyone wants to know what the government is doing to help prop up the economy, and because more people are working from home and free to watch TV anyways. Normally, I think it will suffice for the entire session to be filmed, then the salient parts edited and posted online for those who wish to view them. I don’t need footage of the entire session from start to end. 

It can be done, but this doesn’t mean that it should be done.

Telling shareholders that you’re keeping their money in risk free assets and therefore lowering their rate of return to a lower risk product isn’t going to fly.

I think people of different political persuasions would have different answers to this question.

> Companies don't plan for such scenarios even though things like that happen once every ~10 years, like clockwork.

The problem with these events is that every single crisis is different with varying impact on industries. For instance, retail sales (of non-essential goods) probably dropped somewhat during 1985, 1997, and 2009, but sales certainly didn't go to zero for two months. Prudent retailers would plan for a repeat of 2009, but probably not 2020-style lockdowns around the world.

Conversely, financial services are less affected by the circuit breaker this time around (at least until large swathes of companies start defaulting on their debt, which we are trying prevent).

> Or does this whole gov-corp dynamic work in such a way that corporates just have to focus on making money for themselves and their pockets during good times, while big hits to their businesses are assumed to be shouldered by the nation.

Yeah, this is the moral hazard of governments mounting a rescue operation every time there is a crisis, so I believe that companies getting a bailout should feel some pain -- a dilution of the common stockholders would be a good start. 

However, letting lots of companies fail isn't tenable either -- ultimately when companies go bankrupt, it is citizens like you and I that get laid off and end up with no income.

This virus doesnt follow any pre-established approaches/pattern.

1. Define Problem
2. Design Requirement
3. Research
4. Conceptualise
5. Feasibility
6. Prototyping
7. Repeat

Your conceptualisation always comes from your research on existing solutions for the current problem or solutions for a similar problem which can be redesigned/reformulated to address the problem.

Its 9k. If you think about it, its not even that much. If your dad was middle-income, maybe he makes 5k/month on the low end. A higher end taxi driver takes home 4k/month.

> Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said the measures to support workers, businesses and households will be announced when Parliament sits on Monday.

> To be called the Solidarity Budget, the supplementary measures mark the first time in history that the Government has released three Budget statements in less than two months while tapping on Singapore's reserves, and come as enhanced measures to break the chain of virus transmission come into effect next week that will result in all schools and most workplaces closing.

> Mr Heng said the Covid-19 situation has taken a very sharp turn, both globally and locally, and strong measures have to be taken to protect lives.

> But the economy has taken a hit as a result.

> ""We must remain steadfast in the face of crisis, and stand in solidarity with one another during these difficult times,"" he said.

> ""I am therefore naming this set of measures to tide us through the 'circuit breaker' the Solidarity Budget.""

> The new set of measures follows a nearly $55 billion package from the Feb 18 Unity Budget and March 26 Resilience Budget aimed at protecting jobs, helping enterprises with immediate challenges, and strengthening economic and social resilience so Singapore can emerge intact and stronger.

> ""Unity, Resilience, Solidarity - these values will come to define who we are as a people,"" said Mr Heng, who called the fight against Covid-19 the defining chapter of this generation.

> ""The bonds that bind us together will be forged and renewed in this crisis, much as how the turbulent years of Independence brought our founding generation together.""

> He thanked earlier generations of Singaporeans who have saved up and built strong foundations for the country, giving the Government the wherewithal to dip into the country's savings to protect people and their jobs.

> ""When the storm eventually subsides, as all storms do, I am confident that as a stronger society, we can build an even better future for our children and our grandchildren,"" he wrote on Facebook.

> Mr Heng will deliver his ministerial statement at 2pm on Monday, the Ministry of Finance said.

> The speech will be broadcast live on various platforms, and will also be published on the Singapore Budget website after it is delivered.

> Parliament will also resume its debate on the Resilience Budget that Mr Heng delivered on March 26.

658,1,"WP supports stimulus packages, but questions what it means for Singapore after Covid-19 crisis is over",2020-04-07 07:03:34,"Some points mentioned by Pritam and Sylvia are interesting:

>Mr Singh asked if the measures in the various schemes would represent a “new normal” for Singapore, especially after the nine months that several schemes in the Resilience Budget covers.

>“Will these schemes represent a new normal akin to a multi-year ‘New Deal’ to help Singaporeans cope and bounce back from economic hardship? For Singaporeans who will continue to see disruption and technology reducing their job prospects, can we expect continued support for them in the nine months after this package expires, particularly for training and wage support?” the secretary-general of the opposition party asked.

>The New Deal is an economic support package by the late American president Franklin Roosevelt to provide relief in the aftermath of the Great Depression from 1933 to 1939, and was arguably a temporary approach to help the United States recover.

>But it became a defining moment in American politics that cemented the US as a “welfare state with a strong federal government and a perennial national debt problem”, Mr Singh said.

Hopefully, there are longer term measures that will kick in when the economy gets better. Pritam is right,there needs to be caution when providing benefits to the whole nation for an extended period of time. Not to mention this includes the rich, instead of focusing on vulnerable groups.



>Later, WP chairman Sylvia Lim pointed out how the Jobs Support Scheme, for example, provides wage offsets to the employers rather than the employees directly. The scheme provides substantial government subsidy to businesses to help them pay the wages of their staff members in a bid to help them retain workers.

>However, Ms Lim said that many employers have already initiated cost management schemes by asking employees to take salary cuts, such as airline companies. 

>Retail employers, hard hit by the pandemic, have also asked their staff members to work reduced hours, while other employers in non-essential services have told employees that their job situation was not assured due to the stay-home measures, Ms Lim added.

>“To be sure, employers without revenue have to make tough choices, and I understand that. To that end, I know Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat’s speech included a hope that those who receive support will use the resources wisely and responsibly, and that the Government will not hesitate to take action against any abuse.”

>Ms Lim asked Mr Heng to clarify what would be a form of abuse by employers under the Jobs Support Scheme.

It's no secret that some companies are enacting pay cuts, like SIA. However, with Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), the question is how will it be enforced? 

The easy way out is looking at CPF contributions but that may be manipulated by unscrupulous employers. The hard part is potentially receiving thousands of complaints about reduced or unpaid leave once the JSS kicks in. Even once the JSS kicks in, companies with a lot of employees with above $4600 salaries will still suffer a lot. What will be their decisions?

Looking at the schemes and measures for COVID-19, hopefully the government has already planned properly how to properly enact them. 

Hopefully this will be unlike the property tax hoo-ha, social distancing measures' difficulty of enforcing or the work from home directives which clearly didn't deter most businesses from insisting their employees work from their workplaces.",2020-04-07 07:33:38,551
659,2,"WP supports stimulus packages, but questions what it means for Singapore after Covid-19 crisis is over",2020-04-07 07:03:34,"Not all companies use JSS payouts for SG'reans. JSS is saving companies but not singaporeans. For a reference, of a ratio of 4 foreigners to 6 SG/PR in a company, in addition to prolonged MOM's / TAFEP's advisory that companies are to have a fair workplace, local SME's Or MNC's, HR dept by default, will base their decision on fund management on these factors. The massive funds, in turn does not fully 'help' SG'reans save jobs, but the whole workforces' jobs, (40% foreigners inclusive and ~10-20% PR). The default decision made was contributed by prolonged periods of ""HR has to rule-keep if not companies will be blacklisted by MOM and quota will be reduced- again to save foreigners jobs"". 

Also, for SG/PR support grants that were issued, namely TRF and Covid-19 support grant, money was credited without thorough fact checking on the documents, reason being that govt knows that their people are in need of money / cash fast.

Also, the money can still go to the employers, but the employers are not bound to keep the employees even as they will get JSS payouts. This is tricky since many jobs are actually impacted this year starting in Feb 2020. In fact, the payout itself is to put more resources to firms and to really cut their costs, but employers have discretion on how they intend to use the rebates. Some will keep jobs as is, some will reduce wage bills and make people go on no pay leave.

The total figure announced is a mixture of actual loans and tax breaks/loan guarantees. So, when Canada talks about a 82 billion dollar package, that includes tax breaks, support for individuals and tax deferrals as well. Arguably, some parts of it are loans that need to be paid back with little to no interest (hence lost is made on inflation), tax deferrals (hence no net loss) and cash payouts (net loss). Therefore, they are not really spending $x amount of money, more like small portions of that amount is actual money given away with no strings attached. 

As for borrowing from the future, well, this is going to saddle a lot of businesses with a lot more debt. More debts means you would be more risk averse. That means less hiring, less expansions, less spending, at least until people feel comfortable where they are at again.

It can only work if there is long term investment plans in increasing capacity, and companies aren't going to do that unless they are confident that this investment will be utilized by customers.

> SINGAPORE: Local banks in Singapore are using the wage subsidies from the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to create new jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, they told CNA on Thursday (May 21) .

> In response to queries, a DBS spokesperson said that it will use the payouts to continue hiring amid the economic downturn.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The JSS is a wage subsidy programme aimed at helping companies retain and pay their workers as businesses take a hit from the impact of COVID-19 -

> For the month of April and May, the subsidies cover 75 per cent of the first S$4,600 of each local employee’s salary.

> “We are committed not only to protecting jobs but also creating new ones,” said a DBS spokesperson.

> DBS, which employs about 12,000 people in Singapore, has previously announced that it plans to hire more than 2,000 people this year.

> Half of them will be placed in new roles, the spokesperson said, adding that many of these new roles will also go to graduates.

> The Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) also plans to use the JSS payouts to create new jobs and improve existing positions.

> Its group brand and communications head Koh Ching Ching said that the bank is “intensifying training and development across the organisation” to prepare its workers for a post-COVID-19 future.

> “New roles will be required and some existing roles have to be reviewed for redesign to fit into the future job landscape,” she said.

> The JSS will help to fulfil these plans, as well as support “a wide range of welfare schemes for our employees”, she added.

> On Thursday, Citi Singapore announced that it was joining a list of companies that have returned the wage subsidies.

> The Ministry of Finance announced early this month that 32 companies had returned JSS payouts worth a combined S$35 million as of May 9.

> These companies also pledged to decline future JSS payouts from the Government, MOF said then, adding that the S$35 million in returned payouts would be used for future disbursements.

> Both DBS and OCBC pointed out their charitable efforts in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> DBS said that it is donating S$2.5 million to provide 700,000 meals to the elderly, low-income and migrant worker communities in Singapore, while OCBC said it had given out about S$1.5 million worth of aid to help vulnerable seniors, migrant workers and needy families.

> Both banks, as well as United Overseas Bank, pledged in April not to lay off employees because of COVID-19.
