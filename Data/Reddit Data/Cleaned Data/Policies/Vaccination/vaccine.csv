>It's kinda ridiculous they are only now talking about plans for vaccination centers and all. All that should've been done before the vaccines even arrived/or while MOH was evaluating the vaccine data??

I complete agree with you. Moreover, we are 100 percent urbanized and only 720 sq km, which should make it easy to transport the vaccines to anywhere on the island.

The only explanation I can think of for the plans for vaccination centers is that they originally planned for vaccinations to be done in hospitals and polyclinics for storage reasons (e.g. ultralow refrigeration) before realizing that the vaccines are more easily transportable with dry ice which means that the injections can be done outside of polyclinics and hospitals.

But giving out the sign up sheet only around Christmas is really hard to explain. They should have organized this a lot earlier since they were expecting the vaccines to be delivered. This issue should be raised in parliament.",2021-01-22 07:05:05,195

75,Covid-19 vaccine will not be reserved for Singaporeans who choose to wait and see: Lawrence Wong,2021-01-21 18:33:19,">Except they have been super shady about their numbers since the start. They had to be constantly pressed as to what their actual numbers were (when they gave the 78% success rate) and only admitted that the 78% was from leaving people out of the study that made the numbers lower. after Brazil found that it was only 50%.

Who is ""They""? This is not factual. Read your own link

The initial efficacy rate of 78% was also reported by a Brazilian Institute based on trials in Brazil and not Sinovac itself. This was revised to 50.38% based by the same institute later using a more stringent criteria. The trials of these studies are conducted by Brazil and not Sinovac itself.

>CoronaVac, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the Chinese company Sinovac, has been shown to have an efficacy of 78% during phase 3 trials in Brazil, its local partner, the Butantan Institute, announced on Thursday. 

>""Today is a very important day for Brazil, for Brazilians, for life and health,” Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria said during a press conference, alongside state health officials and executives from the Butantan Institute.

>""The Butantan Institute and the Government of Sao Paulo report that the coronavirus vaccine achieved a 50.38% overall efficacy rate in the clinical study conducted in Brazil, in addition to (an efficacy rate of) 78% for mild cases and 100% for moderate and severe cases of Covid-19. All rates are higher than the 50% level required by the WHO (World Health Organization),"" the statement released Tuesday said.",2021-01-22 10:38:59,245

Locals working in higher-risk industries are currently being tested every 7-14 days: healthcare, marine, construction, aviation, SHN hotels, etc. They are also getting higher vaccine priority than the general public, as a reflection of this risk.

So, once they get vaccinated, maybe the COVID swab frequency can  be reduced significantly.

> On Tuesday alone, about 2,800 people were vaccinated.

At this rate, it's 0.05% a day, which is significantly better. To vaccinate 70% of the population by end-2021, though, requires a 4x increase; hopefully when vaccination of the general public starts it becomes possible to ramp up much more quickly, as vaccination centres for the public are being set up, in addition to polyclinics and GPs getting access to the vaccine.",2021-01-14 03:49:22,77
