> Vaccinations for the elderly and those at greater risk of severe COVID-19 will start in February, beginning with seniors aged 70 and above. Vaccinations will be free for all Singaporeans as well as long-term residents in Singapore.

Pzifer and Moderna can only manufacture 800k doses per day. Only 6 companies are racing to make vaccines for 2021 and let's say if the other companies manufacture at the same rate of 800k per day. That's 1490 days (4 years) to vaccinate 90% of the population. If there're more companies in 2022 onwards, realistically it'll be 1-2 years faster.

The gov is already pushing the responsibility to us. The reason it's optional is because they want people to be responsible for themselves when taking the vaccine. Anything happen is not the gov problem since they didn't force it on us. The gov will assumed you have done your own research to undergo this vaccination. That's why it's important every individuals should equip themselves with knowledge about different types of vaccines. So we're able to weigh the risks, pros and cons by themselves. At the very least, we should equip ourselves the knowledge of the difference between mRNA and weakened-inactivated virus cells vaccines.

As it is, there will be no choice as long as Ah Gong is footing the bill (mostly for logistical purpose, I suspect, since sending multiple vaccine types to a single location probably complicates matters).

> Having dozens of different vaccines available and asking ordinary people to choose which one they want to receive is irresponsible and reckless.

This isn't inherently dangerous, as long as you trust the authorities to have properly evaluated the candidates. People can already get flu shots of their choice by choosing the GP/clinic.
