3,"COVID-19: SafeEntry digital check-in system deployed to more than 16,000 venues",2020-05-09 17:35:43,"This should probably be discussed further and upvote for visibility. To be honest, the SafeEntry is more like ""NoEntry"" to people who are not tech savvy. And that's actually quite a significant portion of Singaporeans. The elderly in my family is already whining about it and I hope that there's an alternative option in place, when the user/customer can't scan the QR code.

It's also very problematic if ppl end up downloading QR Scanning Apps that's bloated with ads or virus. QR scanning never took off in Singapore anyway, so ""enforcing"" it now is just kinda... backwards?

***Edit:*** A better solution might be to just give everyone a electronic ID that they can just tap and scan for entry. Actually, that is not too different from EzLink and we already have the know how

***Edit2:*** Ok, I admit I didn't research enough before making this stupid comment. I was focusing on the QR scanning which is the deployment of ""SafeEntry Digital Check-In"" while neglecting that the existing NRIC Scanning for Supermarket is also called ""SafeEntry"". That was stupid of me, fine. But my point remains beyond the supermarket model, where workplaces, taxis and more sectors are to become mandatory, and NRIC scanning are not available. I still remain in my belief that we should just adopt a tap N go system",2020-05-09 23:26:25,215

> SINGAPORE: The SafeEntry digital check-in system, which logs employees' and visitors' entry into businesses to facilitate contact tracing, has been deployed to more than 16,000 venues to date, said the Ministry of Health and Smart Nation and Digital Government Office in a joint release on Saturday (May 9).

> Developed by the Government Technology Agency, SafeEntry requires visitors to scan their identification card so that the system can record their arrival and departure times. The system reduces the manual effort needed by businesses to track visitor movements and eases crowds at entry points, according to the SafeEntry website.

> On May 2, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said businesses allowed to operate from May 12 as part of the Government's easing of COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"" measures would be required to use the SafeEntry app.

> ""As a start, deployment will be made mandatory for places where individuals are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods or in enclosed spaces, or where there is higher traffic,"" said the Government in Saturday's joint release.

> ""To date, SafeEntry has been deployed at more than 16,000 premises,"" the authorities said, adding that a list of the facilities where SafeEntry must be deployed from May 12 can be found on the SafeEntry website and will be updated as more activities and services resume.

> Among these venues are workplaces including offices and factories, schools, healthcare facilities, community care facilities, hairdressers, supermarkets, popular wet markets, malls and hotels.

> SafeEntry will also be progressively rolled out to taxis from May 12 to better support contact tracing for street-hail trips.

> Retail outlets such as convenience stores and pharmacies, as well as take-out F&B outlets, are not required but encouraged to use SafeEntry.

> ""Employees and visitors should check in and check out of workplaces and other venues using SafeEntry to help our contact tracers establish cluster links and transmission chains.

> ""It is important that everyone plays their part and uses SafeEntry, so that we can collectively prevent new clusters from forming,"" the release added.

I'm not sure why people are focusing only on the Supermarket part then applying the same understanding to every other sector. Also, its not mentioned whether SafeEntry will replace/work alongside existing NRIC scanning for supermarket. Nonetheless, my point is not solely focused on supermarket.

Of course, the taxi driver can always give a paper/record book for customers to write down their details before they enter the cab =) I'm a little offended by the rude comment below, sry for the tone",2020-05-10 09:44:23,92

I don't disagree that it will cause unhappiness among the boomer generation though, best we can do is to help our family / people around us with a lot of patience, and take this as a lesson on how we must always keep up with technology (for when we get old lol).

And places such as workplaces and taxi who doesn't have/can't scan NRIC (I'm not sure the limitations around this) and now need to implement SafeEntry.

What you're looking up is a ""Good Class Bungalow"", which in laymen's terms is...a mansion. In the middle of a major city. To count as a GCB the lot (land, not interior) must be over 1400sqm, or 15,000 sqft, and on top of that it must be in one of a few select locations that are particularly desirable. For the record, Dyson (of vacuum fame) has a GCB in Singapore. So did the Saudi embassy, but they sold it. Might have been too rich for their blood./s I mean, look at who's selling the GCB you linked. It's Sotheby's. [The Sotheby's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby%27s). Sure, their realty is a franchise, but the fact that they're willing to attach their name to it means it's strictly UHNWI-only.

For a comparison of housing affordability, see: http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf
The median house price in Singapore is 4.6x the median household income. This is comparable to Salt Lake City and Durham, NC. In San Fran, it's 8.4. It should be noted that most people live in flats and condos, but that's par for the course in any large city. If you're ok with SF housing costs, you'd be fine in Singapore.

I believe for something to truly be airborne, it must stay suspended in the air for an amount of time rather than being spread  through the droplets alone.  


I keep using norovirus as an example of a virus that is not airborne and is not spread by droplets that can spread so quickly. Norovirus (common stomach bug) has had the ability to infect an entire cruise ship in days and cripple the thing. Its solely through vomit particles on surfaces, or fecal matter on surfaces. It can live for up to 2 weeks there, and even after a person is no longer showing symptoms, they excrete the live virus via fecal matter for up to 2 weeks. Thats how that one spreads so fast.  


Think of how your coworkers wouldn't show up to work vomiting, or with horrible diarrhea , but they will definitely be back once fever and symptoms are gone. All it takes is a flush of the toilet and improper handwashing to let that virus sit there for weeks.",2020-02-28 05:18:13,175

It's not traditional homeownership, but saying that you don't own anything is not true either. You actually 'own' it for 99 years. You can put holes in non-load-bearing walls, paint things, redo-the electricity (within your unit, obviously), re-tile the flooring, etc. You can do much more than renting, and the ability to do things to your flat (remodelling/renovating) confers a sense of ownership.

It's likely that the tax breaks for foreign ownership still apply due to the unique legal structure of long-term leasing.

Also, you can buy freehold if you want. The fact that there's only a small price premium (20% iirc?) shows that most people don't *really* care.",2020-02-28 22:16:08,106

Here's a glossary to the two words:
https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/glossary.htm

According to that glossary, you could say they're nearly the same.  The way I use them (I'm not a health professional) is different.  Bathroom spray is an aerosol.  It's a fine mist in the air that eventually falls out of suspension.  It's not going to travel out a window and down the street.  Whereas, when something gets airborne, I think of it as being able to be carried along for long distances.  That's the way I use them.  Maybe I'm wrong though.",2020-02-28 05:32:12,100
76,Singapore Health Ministry Doesn't See Any Evidence of Airborne Spread of COVID-19,2020-02-28 05:06:57,"I'm pretty sure you are wrong.

Aerosols start out as tiny water droplets, they will dry in air in under 1 second and leave behind a sub micron husk of solid material which virus can stick to. These tiny solids, being so light can float in air for hours and can be easily carried by air movement. Almost anything you do, including breathing will release aerosol, but aerosol is particularly heavily released when doing things like intubation.

Large droplets like a spray or what people release when they cough are much larger and will land on the ground in several seconds due to gravity, they do not travel nearly as far and is not really considered ""airborne""",2020-02-28 05:36:09,115

78,Singapore Health Ministry Doesn't See Any Evidence of Airborne Spread of COVID-19,2020-02-28 05:06:57,"Is there a mistake in your definition for aerosol?

Airborne is the one that can travel large distances and be carried by air.

Aersols are droplets that don't go further than a few feet.

SARS-CoV-2 is definitely spread by respiratory droplets, those are the big droplets hence the 6 ft thing. However at the time that diagram was made it was not yet suspected that SARS-CoV-2 could spread via aerosol, this is now very strongly suspected, at least in an ICU environment with intubation. Outside of that setting though aerosol transmission is not likely to be a serious danger with SARS-CoV-2.

Measles is truly airborne, meaning aerosol transmission is a main transmission route.",2020-02-28 09:04:30,93

Less-short answer: 

1. Singapore refuses to shutdown non-essential travel to, well, basically all other countries.  Assuming infections continue to occur in other countries (especially at a growing rate), Singapore is gauranteed to import more infections.

2. Singapore refuses to shutdown its schools, which may likely result in several huge, possibly uncontainable clusters.

3. Singapore is still encouraging people to physically leave home and visit clinics if/when they are ill.  Even a short amount of travel will increase infection vectors both for that individual as well as others, and may result in further infections.

I'm pretty sure as new cases come out, it will be easier to trace down the clusters for those without links. The government has been very thorough with the contact tracing thus far.

Free masks at subway offices and free handsanitizer too. Expansion of testing facilities and clear explanations of what to do if you have symptoms. I’m not sure who’s following whose example but Korea’s been putting out the same type of reports following cases and their whereabouts from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization. Can’t say the same so far of American media, maybe it’s the fact that both are relatively small countries but Korea’s been on top of tracking and reporting the information. 

On the other hand Korea’s still not yet blocked flights from China and there are some other complaints about giving foreign tourists money for quarantine compensation. Korean people are heavily criticizing the government but overall I feel like the response has been organized.

Singapore is much more relaxed when it comes to maintaining a permanent resident status, but as with anywhere, including the US, committing a crime can result in revocation of permanent resident status.

> SINGAPORE: A Singapore Airlines (SIA) cabin crew member on a turnaround flight was among the 11 new imported COVID-19 cases reported in Singapore as of noon on Tuesday (Feb 9).

> Of the 11 imported cases, 10 were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its preliminary daily update.

> The remaining case is the SIA cabin crew member who had not disembarked from the aircraft at the overseas destination. She developed symptoms a few days after returning to Singapore, said MOH.

> No locally transmitted cases were reported in the community or in foreign worker dormitories.

> 

> Details of the new cases will be released on Tuesday night, MOH said.

> BGC Group, which manages the deployment of some taggers, ushers and administrators at Changi Airport, will increase the frequency of temperature taking and disinfecting counters after an employee tested positive for COVID-19.

> The case involved a 43-year-old Singaporean man who works at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3. He was the sole community case reported on Sunday.

> His job involved issuing electronic monitoring devices to people who will be serving stay-home notice outside dedicated facilities. He also helped them put on the devices.

> While on duty, he wears a surgical mask, face shield and gloves, MOH said.

> Advertisement

> BGC Group told CNA on Monday that the infection was detected during a routine, bi-weekly swab, and that he had tested negative in the prior round of testing.

> “BGC Group will continue to closely monitor the health of 12 negatively tested employees who have been in contact with our affected employee,” said the firm.

> “We are treating this unfortunate first incident very seriously and BGC Group will be increasing the frequency of temperature taking to a three-hourly reporting. Our frequency of disinfecting our counters will also be strictly stepped up so to ensure an even safer environment for all employees under our care.”

> Since the man's positive test on Feb 5, BGC Group has reviewed its healthcare and safety standard operating procedures and found “no breaches”.

> The man’s identified close contacts, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period.

> As of Tuesday, Singapore has reported a total of 59,732 COVID-19 cases and 29 fatalities from the disease.

317,Too big a price to pay for Singapore to achieve ‘natural herd immunity’ against Covid-19: MOH official,2020-05-12 18:46:07,"Yes and no. Our migrant workers (\*in the construction sector, i.e. those being isolated at the moment) make up \~5% of our entire population. Herd immunity is only possible once 70-90% of the population has been infected. With our healthcare capacity, that would mean many more deaths if we rush this. Do remember that we have migrant workers who have died due to non-covid19 reasons (even though they were diagnosed with it). The more our healthcare capacity is stretched, the more people will die or suffer. We can't just keep looking at the covid-19 related death toll.

If the foreign workers remain isolated, it's likely that they'll achieve herd immunity within that population. We can't tell, conclusively, if someone can get covid-19 more than once.

Here's a good article that explains herd immunity well  [https://www.healthline.com/health/herd-immunity#natural-immunity](https://www.healthline.com/health/herd-immunity#natural-immunity)

Sweden always gets brought up as a ""success story"", but they have 3000 deaths. People saying that this is a good price to pay don't realise that the lives of their parents or loved ones are the ones they're most likely to be gambling.

E.g. Sweden’s economy might not do any better than those of neighboring countries taking stronger measures against the virus:

Countries that do ultimately succeed in containing the virus will be attractive destinations for people and businesses to move to (e.g. I live in the US and am strongly considering relocating somewhere).

The wellbeing of most people are tied to the economy. Would you say you wouldn't be stressed out and uncertain about the future if you lost your job today and have no idea when you'll get another job? Now add an entire family to the mix, with multiple people you need to feed. This is going to add to the mental tolls of a lot of people. 

Moreover, we're already seeing a reversal of close to 20 decades of progress wrt to economic development. 1B people who we got out of abject poverty are about to re-enter poverty (there are defined levels for poverty if you were wondering). Not to mention the 130mm++ people who are now projected to be food insecure as a result of the lockdowns. 

Looking at this in a Singaporean context, Singapore is not big enough to sustain itself. My dad works in the O&G industry, and it is currently getting absolutely ravaged by lockdowns across the world. The O&G industry makes about 20% of Singapore's GDP. Now you have to understand that most industries are interconnected. If one fails, it'll drag down other industries along with it. For example, my bank is projecting a fair number of job listing portals to go bankrupt soon. Why? Lack of job postings. If the airline industry fails, it'll drag the entire hotel industry, car rental industry, tourism industry etc etc along with it.

Moreover, supply chains being ravaged is definitely not going to bode well for a tiny island that exports most of its food. 

This entire situation is not quite as simple as lives vs economy. We're on the verge of destroying the QOL for a large segment of the world population real soon for the next decade if things don't change. There is no script for a massive depression in this interconnected world. It's going to be real bad. Plus you gotta understand the the one thing that has prevented multiple countries from imploding or going to way with one another was money. Take that away and we're facing even more death and suffering.

There are fates worse than death. The best course would be to tell the old and vulnerable to quarantine and let the rest get on with their lives (especially given that fatality rates for those below 70 is 0.08% according to a Danish study and even lower for even younger people). 

I've said this before but we're in a very classic trolley problem. People are going to die either way. But the economic toll and the pandora's box it is going to open kill far more than the virus ever will.",2020-05-13 04:32:34,431

We take the hurt now, it could be protracted for months, but it’s controlled. We do the best we can WFH and with essential services operating. Economically, it’s hurting, lots of workers are not getting paid. They need support. People need help with the stress and anxiety of not being allowed out.

We rip the bandaid off and resume as normal. It’s great for the economy. But the hurt has to come later, the hurt comes later when healthcare services are overworked, people panic buy, refuse to leave; straight up don’t go to their work because the choose is stay home away from everyone else. Business fail because a majority of their workforce are sick. People won’t go outside where it’s a bloody pandemic going on that people are dying from.

Opening up too soon to help the economy causes a much larger problem down the line imo, you think this is bad enough? Consider the alternatives.",2020-05-13 00:33:59,180

&#x200B;

First off, since you seem to have never done NS or is a foreigner, NS men goes through basic training, vocational training, operational readiness assessment and military exercises. All this takes up a good year or so of the NS life, after attaining operational readiness would be the guys on standby in times of war. By the time all that is over the unit is almost ready to ORD. Obviously since the training time has now been cut, our manpower 1.5 years from now would be compromised due to the delay training now. However assuming a delay of 3-4 months training, most of the recruits who had their training delayed today would still be operationally ready by that time. It's a crisis situation, a compromise of sorts is expected

&#x200B;

2ndly I already pointed out, everyone is being ravaged by the virus, even it if goes away over the next few months, our potential aggressors will still have to due with an impending recession. They won't have that kind of time, money and energy to deal with us

&#x200B;

3rd, there is good reason why we keep a huge reservist force and why we do ICT for so long. In the event where manpower is an issue, the reservist can be called up

&#x200B;

ALL THESE are compromise in times of crisis. We don't want to have to compromise in normal times.

The latest confirmed infected individual had visited gardens by the bay, marina bay sands, and orchard, which are all VERY CROWDED places. I believe there are infected individuals walking among us whom Sg can't find by tracing because how will they know who visited all those three places at the same time???

It's a critical period for Singapore. Let's play our part by taking extra precautions and going to the hospital when you have a fever. PLEASE do not assume you just have a cold and infect more people.

For those who have managed to buy the masks, please do share with others who couldn't buy them cuz some stores went out of stock. Sharing is caring :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: The reason why I said it has started spreading since there are a few of you questioning it, it's just my belief. I'm not trying to scare anyone. This is just my personal opinion, you can choose to disregard it. For those interested, here are my reasons why:

The first man to have been confirmed to have the virus, in Singapore did probably get infected in Wuhan, but his son didn't show any symptoms until his dad was tested and after he was quarantined, which could mean that he got it from his dad after arriving in singapore(honestly this point doesn't matter). What it means is the fact that there is a possibility people could get infected from him despite him staying inside the hotel this entire time(possibly the hotel staff or the cleaning staff who came in contact with their room. What about the people at the airport? At that time, he didn't have any fever so he could have had a few interactions with other people?). But I doubt this will be an issue since they were isolated soon after.

And the fact that the third case, a lady from Wuhan didn't show any symptoms till arriving in Singapore means that most who could have been possibly infected could show symptoms at a much later time from the time they were in contact with an infected person(in her case, probably a day or two since she left Wuhan). This just means that there is a high possibility someone could have been infected during the time she was strolling around Singapore and wouldn't know about it till a week or so later when he/she start showing the symptoms.

The fact that Singapore has disclosed the whereabouts of all three cases since they had arrived in Singapore could also mean they haven't excluded the possibility of Singaporeans/travellers getting infected from these people at the places they have been to. They want us to be careful and be aware.

If you all just want to believe in statistics, go ahead. I trust in Sg stats since they are openly telling us a lot of things. But if you are like me, you would probably think, stats are only showing reported cases. What about the unreported cases?

**If you know of anyone who has a fever or has similar symptoms to the virus, please do advise them to check it out at the hospital/a nearby clinic. All it takes is one person's negligence.**",2020-01-24 16:11:27,528

> SINGAPORE: Two more people have tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases to three, the Ministry of Health announced on Friday (Jan 24).

> The new patients include the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case, MOH said in media briefing on Friday afternoon.

> The second new confirmed case is a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on a Scoot flight at 5.30am on Jan 21, and developed a fever, cough and chills in the afternoon, said MOH.

> She sought medical attention at Raffles Hospital the next day and was later taken to the emergency department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was immediately isolated.

> MOH was notified of a suspect case at 3am on Jan 23. The woman subsequently tested positive for the virus at midnight.

> The woman stayed at J8 Hotel and visited Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay, MOH said.

> She is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and is in a stable condition.

> There have been a total of 44 suspect cases in Singapore; the patients are aged between 1 and 78 years old. Thirteen of them have tested negative.

> The latest update comes after Singapore announced on Thursday its first confirmed case, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Jan 20.

> He is in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and in a stable condition, authorities said.

> Contact tracing has been initiated to identify about 30 people seated near the man during his flight to Singapore. His nine travel companions have also been identified. One of them was his 37-year-old son, who is now confirmed as having the virus. The other eight have left Singapore.

> The man stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa and indicated that he kept within the hotel vicinity.

> The news of Singapore's first confirmed case came a day after Health Minister Gan Kim Yong announced the formation of a multi-ministerial task force to deal with the situation.

> Authorities also announced on Thursday that border screening will be expanded to all land and sea checkpoints, while a travel advisory has been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located.

> Earlier on Thursday, schools in Singapore sent out a notice to parents asking that they declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend beginning on Friday.

> Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines' budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan as a precautionary measure.

> Singapore businesses with a presence in Wuhan have also taken measures. ST Engineering, which has rail projects in Wuhan, has stopped all business commutes there.

> On Friday, China reported that the number of people infected by the SARS-like virus had exceeded 800, with 25 deaths.

> The National Health Commission said authorities were also examining 1,072 suspected cases of the virus that first emerged in central city of Wuhan.

> The markedly higher numbers were released just hours after the World Health Organization called the outbreak ""an emergency in China"", but stopped short of declaring the situation a global health emergency.

> China has effectively quarantined more than 20 million people across Wuhan and some nearby cities in response to the virus, and announced measures to curb its spread nationwide as hundreds of millions of people began travelling across the country this week for the Chinese New Year holiday.

> Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan, a major industrial and transport hub, are now eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the city of 11 million, where most of the cases have been identified.

> The virus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. That market has since been shut down.

> The virus has spread to Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, as well as provinces in northeastern, central and southern China.

> Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

Perhaps there are some protocols in place before a government will consider rejecting inbound flights from a country/state/city. Because if you think about it, there will be a lot of unhappy tourists.

> “She is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and her condition is stable,” MOH said.

> The Chinese national was “asymptomatic” during her flight to Singapore, MOH said, adding that she later developed symptoms on Jan 24 and taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Jan 26.

> “She was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated at NCID,” MOH said.

> “Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 27.

> “She has no known links to the other confirmed imported cases.”

> MOH said on Monday at noon, 62 of the suspect cases tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and four tested positive. The fifth case involving the 56 year-old female was confirmed at 2pm.

> Test results for the remaining 57 cases are pending, the health authority said.

> As of Monday at 12pm, MOH identified 115 close contacts from the first four confirmed cases. Of the 86 who are still in Singapore, 75 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated.

> The authority added efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 11 close contacts.

> “Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts,” MOH explained.

> “As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient.

> “In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.”

> The deadly virus has killed 81 people in China so far, with more than 2,700 confirmed cases.

> Earlier on Monday, a newly formed multi-ministry task force announced Singapore will have a new set of stringent measures in an effort to contain the Wuhan coronavirus. These measures include enhanced temperature screening and leave of absence for some.

The scary part is that 5 million of them left Wuhan before the lockdown, and they might be coming to Singapore from elsewhere and there's nothing we're going to really do about it short of monitoring their temperatures @ arrival...

> Banning visitors is pretty much a middle finger to China, and for a country of our size we really can’t afford to do that.

I really don't get this sentiment eh. China itself has been willing to lockdown entire cities to prevent the virus from spreading. Why would they be offended by us parroting the CCP's behaviour? 

So many Asian countries are doing this, if Carrie Lam is willing to do it for even Hong Kong, of all places, surely that means most of these governments do not perceive border-shutting as something that might incite CCP wrath?

1. Even Singapore doesn't get 100% of the cases, so there could be some mild cases that slip under the radar, making whatever ""found"" cases seem lower, but the severe cases as a % may be higher. 
2. The numbers on most websites show total cases. Some might recover faster, or are in the process of recovery before they are found, and others might have recovered but still be counted as an infected case. 

Thus, it may be 10% based on total patients at a quick glance, but may be higher. That said, I'm not a medical professional, just someone who's too free and keep looking at the numbers daily.

> Another patient could be discharged in the next few days, the ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak told a press conference yesterday.

> The patient discharged yesterday is a 35-year-old Chinese national who arrived in Singapore on Jan 23 and stayed at Marina Bay Sands.

> He developed symptoms the next day and was later warded at the NCID. He tested positive for the virus on Jan 27 and became the seventh case to be confirmed here. He is the first to be discharged.

> ""The patient was discharged well. All symptoms had fully resolved and he had tests over three consecutive days that were all negative,"" Associate Professor Mak said.

> ""We're quite confident that he's no longer got any infection.""

> Prof Mak noted that there are a number of other patients who have the virus but are well, including at least three who are not showing any symptoms. Many continue to make good progress, he added.

> Two of the patients without symptoms were among the six new confirmed cases announced yesterday. There were 24 confirmed cases in Singapore as of last night.

> Prof Mak said five patients required oxygen and breathing support, but added that this is ""not surprising"", given that they had pneumonia.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Get latest updates

> ""None of the patients are in the intensive care unit and none are critically ill at this point in time,"" he said.

> MOH's chief health scientist Tan Chorh Chuan, who was also at the press conference yesterday, said a ""small number"" of coronavirus patients in Singapore have been treated with a combination of antiretroviral drugs, namely lopinavir and ritonavir.

> The drug cocktail is usually used to treat patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes Aids. It is unclear if the patient who was discharged yesterday was given the drugs.

> Professor Tan said clinical trials are under way in China to test the efficacy of the drugs in treating patients with the new coronavirus.

> Related Story Wuhan virus: China using HIV drugs in treatment plan for patients

> On Sunday, Thailand's health ministry said Thai doctors who gave the drugs to coronavirus patients have reported promising initial results.

> ""We are waiting to see how the trials are proceeding and we hope, in the weeks ahead, we will have some indication,"" Prof Tan said.

> ""In the meantime, among the different drugs that have been tested, these agents appear to be effective, but we can't be certain at the moment. They appear promising and the trials will help us understand how effective they can be.""

> Facebook has also been instructed to publish a correction notice on the post by Singapore States Times.

> SINGAPORE: Health Minister Gan Kim Yong has instructed that a correction direction be issued to Singapore States Times over a Facebook post about his ministry's reporting of COVID-19 cases, said the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office on Saturday (Apr 18).

> The Facebook post, published on Saturday, contained ""multiple false statements"", said the POFMA Office.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> It alleged that the number of new COVID-19 cases in Singapore on Friday was 1,146, and that the total number of confirmed cases was 5,573.

> 

> It also claimed that Mr Gan ordered the reported numbers to be halved to minimise public panic by reporting numbers in the afternoon instead of later at night, alleging a ""cover up"" by authorities.

> The Health Ministry on Friday confirmed 623 new cases of the virus, publishing the numbers in the evening instead of later at night as it usually does.

> The allegations made by Singapore States Times are false, said the POFMA Office.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Government website Factually said: ""There was no instruction given by the Minister for Health or the Government to halve or under-report the number of cases. For the purpose of updating the number of new cases of COVID-19 per 24-hour period, MOH has always used 12pm as the cut-off time since the onset of COVID-19.

> ""There is no cover-up by the Government or MOH.""

> 

> Authorities also explained that the Health Ministry will now release ""top line numbers"" in the afternoon of new COVID-19 cases, and share further updates later that same night.

> ""Contact tracing is a rigorous and time-intensive process, especially as case numbers increase,"" stated the Factually website.

> ""As there is significant public interest particularly in the number of new COVID-19 infections daily, MOH has started releasing top line numbers (i.e. the gross number of new cases which have been preliminarily confirmed) in the afternoon of each day, even as contact tracing and investigations continue.""

> 

> It advised members of the public not to speculate and spread unfounded rumours.

> Mr Gan also ordered that a targeted correction direction be issued to Facebook - meaning the social media site will be required to communicate a correction notice to all Singapore users who access the falsehood on its platform.

> 

> Earlier this month, a correction direction was ordered against a post on the Singapore States Times Facebook page claiming that foreign workers quarantined for COVID-19 will not be paid their salaries.

> 

> A similar order was ordered against the Temasek Review on Friday over a post alleging that a GrabFood driver was fined by police officers for wearing a cloth as a mask and for illegal parking.

SINGAPORE - In an ""utopian situation"" with an infinite supply of masks, everyone wearing one regardless of their health status will help contain the coronavirus swiftly.

But as this is not possible, and given the Covid-19 outbreak is a ""marathon"", healthy people under the age of 60 should not wear masks on a daily basis, infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam told The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 1).

The day before,The New York Times reported that the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was reviewing its guidelines on who should wear masks.


On Monday, Austria made the wearing of masks in supermarkets mandatory in a bid to stem the spread of the virus. The Czech Republic went a step further, making mask-wearing mandatory outside of the house.

Readers had also written in to ST asking that people be advised to wear masks despite not showing symptoms.

At a media conference on Tuesday, the Health Ministry's (MOH) Director of Medical Services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said the ministry was looking at evidence ""very carefully"" and conducting a review of its stance on masks, as it does with its other policies.

""As far as masks are concerned, we are in fact in the process of continuing to review the data that's available, both in the literature as well as the international experience,"" he said.


He added that recommendations would be made after the review is completed.

Dr Leong, who practices at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said on Wednesday the need for everybody to wear a mask regardless of their health might eventually be a requirement if Singapore is unable to control the spread of the virus here.

But, he noted, masks are still in short supply around the world.

"" I think it's a moot point to get people to wear masks when they're still in scarcity. It's like telling the poor, the way to get out of poverty is to get more money - but I don't tell you how to get that money,"" he said.

""The mask situation has improved, but we're not seeing endless supplies of masks. If all of us had to mask up today for one week, we might finish all our stock of masks immediately.

""The real science of it is, if everyone maintains their 2m distance, watches their hand hygiene, doesn't go out when they're sick, then we may not even need the mask. By keeping 2m away, I would have done what the mask can do,"" he added.


Those older than 60 can use a mask when they go outdoors as they are more vulnerable, he said, adding that they also have to bear in mind the need to conserve their own supply of masks as the outbreak may last for another six to nine months.

Infectious diseases expert Paul Tambyah from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine said at the moment, data on mask use is not entirely clear.

He noted that new data suggests the receptor for the virus which causes the Covid-19 disease, may be present in the nose and not just in the lungs.

""If this is confirmed, then (using) something which covers our noses may turn out to be important,"" he said, adding that more information would likely be available in a week or so.

Dr Wong Tien Hua, family physician at Mutual Healthcare Medical Clinic, said there is a need for ""situational usage"" of masks at the moment.

""On the bus, on the MRT... when you're queuing up or in a crowded place, wearing a mask is the smart thing to do,"" he said.

He noted, however, that Singapore has taken a multi-pronged approach to fight the virus, including using social distancing measures and closing down entertainment outlets.

""If you tell everybody to wear masks, it's kind of missing the point, because we have other measures,"" he said.

Another family physician, Dr Leong Choong Kit of Mission Medical Clinic, felt that getting everyone to a mask up might backfire.

""If mass wearing of masks is advised, the cost of masks will rise again and the public will buy them from unreliable sources. If they are of dubious quality, they will not serve their function. So it will end up as a futile attempt to control the virus,"" he said.

There is no need for a blanket call to mask up unless there is more community spread here, he added.

A growing number of people online had also called for people to make their own face masks from improvised materials.

Dr Leong Hoe Nam noted that cloth masks have proven to be less effective than proper surgical masks. However, he added: ""But I believe it confers some advantage rather than none, so if I couldn't get a decent surgical mask, I'd use at least a cloth mask.""

Dr Wong said: ""Wearing any kind of barrier is better than no barrier, especially for those who are talking or sneezing.""

But Prof Tambyah and Dr Leong Choong Kit disagree.

""Wearing an ineffective mask is far worse than not wearing one,"" said Dr Leong.

""If I do not have a mask at all, I will consciously avoid certain places, but i f I were to wear one, I may be less conscious and put myself at risk.""

Prof Tambyah said very few studies had tested different types of masks in clinical settings, and he did not know of any that involved patients coughing or sneezing.

""I don't think we should be specifically encouraging people to make their own masks, until there is good objective data on how effective such masks are under clinical conditions,"" he added.

No data exist yet that suggest asymptomatic transmission should be a concern, said the infectious disease experts.

Prof Tambyah said that while epidemiological data may suggest that people could be infectious the day before their onset of symptoms, more detailed molecular evidence had not yet been publicised on these cases.

Dr Leong Hoe Nam said that while asymptomatic cases of transmission may exist, they play a ""very, very small"" role in the transmission of the virus.

""If the epidemic were driven by many asymptomatic transmitters, the Chinese authorities wouldn't have been able to control it so quickly,"" he added.",2020-04-01 20:54:31,1040
