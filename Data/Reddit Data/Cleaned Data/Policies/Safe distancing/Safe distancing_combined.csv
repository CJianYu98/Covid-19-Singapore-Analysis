> SINGAPORE - There can be more easing of pandemic control measures, including the limit of five people for social gatherings, if everyone can work together and keep their guard up, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament on Monday (Oct 5).

> Allowing larger groups to meet would allow bigger families or groups of friends to meet and have meals together, he said in responding to questions from several MPs on the loosening of Covid-19 rules here.

> Singapore has gradually eased some of its pandemic control measures over the past few months, leading some to question when the cap of five people for social activities - especially when eating out together - would be lifted.

> Mr Gan said on Monday: ""We are particularly concerned about dining as we need to remove our masks so as to eat and drink, but we tend to also talk at the same time. The risk is considerably higher than activities which we can keep our masks on and maintain a safe distance.""

> He pointed out that Singapore has already made big steps towards restoring economic and social activities - in a safe manner.

> For instance, from Sept 28, more employees who have been working from home were allowed to return to their workplaces.

> But in order to keep workplaces safe and minimise crowding, such employees are to continue to work from home for at least half their working time, with no more than 50 per cent of such employees at the workplace at any point in time.

> Work-related events, including conferences, seminars, and meetings, have also been allowed to resume with a 50-person limit to reduce the risk of transmission.

> The authorities have also taken steps to support the resumption of a few very targeted and specific areas, said Mr Gan.

> These include the increase in group size limits for key life events such as weddings and religious activities to 100 persons, but in multiple zones or time slots of at most 50 persons each to limit potential risk exposure.

> The Government had also earlier allowed the resumption of physical exercise classes in common community spaces, and an increase in capacity for cinemas and leisure attractions such as the Singapore Zoo and Bird Park.

> Related Story Places of worship slowly open up to more worshippers as Covid-19 rules eased

> Museums and libraries have also reopened, and small-scale live performances are being trialled to prepare Singapore to eventually be able to resume such activities safely, added Mr Gan.

> He added that the authorities here are being careful in reopening society, as they have learnt from the experiences of other countries.

> ""When restrictions are lifted prematurely, or too hastily, a resurgence of cases may occur, resulting in partial reimposition of restrictions. On the other hand, it is not sustainable to maintain tight restrictions for a prolonged period which will severely impact our economy and our lives,"" he said.

> So the Government has taken a carefully calibrated approach in moving towards phase three, and will share more details in the coming weeks.

> Minister for Education Lawrence Wong also said earlier on Monday that his ministry is studying how to resume more activities, and will share more details when ready.

> But Mr Gan cautioned: ""The low number of community cases currently is not accidental but has come about due to our collective hard work and sacrifices. Even as we move towards Phase Three, the new normal will be different from what we were used to in the pre-Covid days.""

> He added: ""As overseas travel restrictions are progressively eased and more activities resume, it has become even more critical that each of us plays our part to exercise social responsibility and adhere to the safe management measures, in order to keep our family and friends safe.""

Very simple, was he at that point of time in the official capacity of a safe distancing ambassador or not? Yes or no question.

If no, which of the exceptions to the circuit breaker measures did he use to justify his actions?

> SINGAPORE: Member of Parliament Seah Kian Peng has explained why he was out and about at his constituency on Sunday (Apr 26), after netizens questioned his Facebook post that said he was ""playing the role of a safe distancing ambassador"".

> 

> The Marine Parade GRC MP raised eyebrows after he said that he spoke to residents at coffee shops and at a wet market.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Netizens questioned if he was keeping to stay-at-home requirements during the ""circuit breaker"" period, and some pointed out that he was without the red armbands and passes worn by safe distancing ambassadors.

> Others noted that the People's Action Party had announced earlier this month that it would suspend ground engagements and face-to-face Meet-The-People sessions.

> In response to CNA queries, Mr Seah said he has been working from home ""almost the entire week"", and that he was out on Sunday as he had to sign some documents at the community club.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""I also went to check on how things were at the two FairPrice supermarkets in vicinity (this is part of my job to find out from time to time how operations were and situation is on the ground),"" said Mr Seah, who is also group CEO of NTUC FairPrice.

> ""At same time as I walked through the estate, I would pass by the kopitiams in (the) estate, wet market too. And I thus made those observations. At all times observing safe distancing rules. Based on what I saw, happy that things are all in order,"" he explained.

> ""One or two merchants in wet market had some feedback for me as well. All short conversations. Another two residents who saw me had some enquiries for me which I gave them my advice accordingly. All parties concerned observed the safe distancing rules.""

> 

> As part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, authorities have asked residents to stay at home except for essential activities such as to buy food or groceries. Even then, people should go out alone and not in groups. It is compulsory to wear masks once they leave their homes.

> Safe distancing ambassadors have been appointed to remind people of these rules. Those who do not comply will be issued a fine.

> In his Facebook post on Sunday, Mr Seah said he observed that compliance with safe distancing measures was high, and temperature screening and crowd control measures were in place at popular places like supermarkets and wet markets.

> ""Take care and stay safe,"" he wrote, adding hashtags like #socialdistancing and #walkabout.

> 

> Responding to online criticism of his post, Mr Seah told CNA on Monday: ""I hope we don’t politicise this matter. It appears that some are clearly wanting to do so.""

> 

> He added: ""If people want to volunteer as a SDA (safe distancing ambassador), it takes a few hours a day and some of them especially during the initial period had it rough. So it is work for them.

> ""Let’s focus on what we all need to do. And work as a team whether you are part of those providing essential services or WFH. If I can make a call out, I hope all of us make things easy for the essential workers and also SDA and let us continue to show our appreciation to all those who are going to work day in, day out to provide these essential services for us.""

> 

> Another MP, Liang Eng Hwa of Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, also posted about being a safe distancing ambassador on Sunday. He was seen wearing a yellow vest like the other ambassadors.

> Mr Liang wrote: ""Joined as one of the Safe Distancing Ambassador (SDA) this evening. With the exception of a few, by and large residents are in compliant of the circuit breaker measures.""

> SINGAPORE - A safe distancing ambassador was fined $300 for not wearing a mask while he was conducting surveillance checks at a shopping mall, after photos of him failing to wear the mask were shared on social media.

> In response to media queries, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) said on Saturday (April 18) that it had deployed the safe distancing ambassador to conduct surveillance checks at shopping malls.

> Based on its investigations, the man had gone to the restroom during his break and forgot to put his mask on after leaving it, which was when the photos were taken.

> The images of the safe distancing ambassador not wearing his mask were taken at White Sands shopping mall on Wednesday and posted by Facebook user Daniel Wong.

> The man is seen talking to another safe distancing ambassador, who is wearing a mask, and riding on an escalator with him. The Facebook post with the photos, which was uploaded on Thursday, has been shared about 850 times as of early Saturday afternoon.

> ESG said that the man put on his mask immediately after other safe distancing ambassadors reminded him to do so.

> It added that it takes a serious view of such infringements and has issued a stern warning to the man, in addition to the $300 fine.

> ""This is consistent with the penalty imposed on individuals who are found not wearing a mask in public, as we expect our safe distancing ambassadors to uphold the same standards,"" it said, adding that the man has accepted the penalty and apologised for his mistake.

> ESG said it has reminded all safe distancing ambassadors about the requirement to wear masks at all times when they are not at home.

> SINGAPORE: Member of Parliament Seah Kian Peng has explained why he was out and about at his constituency on Sunday (Apr 26), after netizens questioned his Facebook post that said he was ""playing the role of a safe distancing ambassador"".

> 

> The Marine Parade GRC MP raised eyebrows after he said that he spoke to residents at coffee shops and at a wet market.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Netizens questioned if he was keeping to stay-at-home requirements during the ""circuit breaker"" period, and some pointed out that he was without the red armbands and passes worn by safe distancing ambassadors.

> Others noted that the People's Action Party had announced earlier this month that it would suspend ground engagements and face-to-face Meet-The-People sessions.

> In response to CNA queries, Mr Seah said he has been working from home ""almost the entire week"", and that he was out on Sunday as he had to sign some documents at the community club.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""I also went to check on how things were at the two FairPrice supermarkets in vicinity (this is part of my job to find out from time to time how operations were and situation is on the ground),"" said Mr Seah, who is also group CEO of NTUC FairPrice.

> ""At same time as I walked through the estate, I would pass by the kopitiams in (the) estate, wet market too. And I thus made those observations. At all times observing safe distancing rules. Based on what I saw, happy that things are all in order,"" he explained.

> ""One or two merchants in wet market had some feedback for me as well. All short conversations. Another two residents who saw me had some enquiries for me which I gave them my advice accordingly. All parties concerned observed the safe distancing rules.""

> 

> As part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, authorities have asked residents to stay at home except for essential activities such as to buy food or groceries. Even then, people should go out alone and not in groups. It is compulsory to wear masks once they leave their homes.

> Safe distancing ambassadors have been appointed to remind people of these rules. Those who do not comply will be issued a fine.

> In his Facebook post on Sunday, Mr Seah said he observed that compliance with safe distancing measures was high, and temperature screening and crowd control measures were in place at popular places like supermarkets and wet markets.

> ""Take care and stay safe,"" he wrote, adding hashtags like #socialdistancing and #walkabout.

> 

> Responding to online criticism of his post, Mr Seah told CNA on Monday: ""I hope we don’t politicise this matter. It appears that some are clearly wanting to do so.""

> 

> He added: ""If people want to volunteer as a SDA (safe distancing ambassador), it takes a few hours a day and some of them especially during the initial period had it rough. So it is work for them.

> ""Let’s focus on what we all need to do. And work as a team whether you are part of those providing essential services or WFH. If I can make a call out, I hope all of us make things easy for the essential workers and also SDA and let us continue to show our appreciation to all those who are going to work day in, day out to provide these essential services for us.""

> 

> Another MP, Liang Eng Hwa of Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, also posted about being a safe distancing ambassador on Sunday. He was seen wearing a yellow vest like the other ambassadors.

> Mr Liang wrote: ""Joined as one of the Safe Distancing Ambassador (SDA) this evening. With the exception of a few, by and large residents are in compliant of the circuit breaker measures.""

> SINGAPORE: More than 7,000 written advisories were issued on the first day of a nationwide ""circuit-breaker"", a month-long period of enhanced safe-distancing measures to curb the spread of COVID-19.

> Most of these advisories were issued to members of the public in hawker centres and markets, said the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) in a media release on Tuesday (Apr 7).

> Advertisement

> MEWR said the breaches included failure to maintain safe distances when queuing or making payments by following floor markings. The ministry also cited a stallholder who was issued an advisory for selling drinks intended for dine-in at a hawker centre.

> Under the enhanced measures, F&B outlets are only allowed to offer takeaway or delivery services.

> Safe Distancing measures at Singapore's Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre on Apr 7, 2020. (Photo: MEWR)

> ""If a member of public is found in breach of these measures, an enforcement officer will issue a written advisory immediately,"" said MEWR.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""If the member of public does not comply or returns to commit the same offence, the enforcement officer will take down his or her particulars and issue a written stern warning. The police may also be contacted for follow-up action.""

> Under a new Bill passed in Parliament on Tuesday, first time offenders can be fined up to S$10,000 or imprisoned up to six months, or both. The penalty for second or subsequent offences is a fine of up to S$20,000 or imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.

> More than 2,000 Safe Distancing and SG Clean Ambassadors, and enforcement officers were sent to HDB estates across the island on Tuesday. The personnel were deployed in town centres, hawker centres, coffee shops, transport nodes, parks, and community clubs.

> SINGAPORE: The number of abuse cases against safe distancing enforcement officers and ambassadors has gone up since elevated measures kicked in, with multiple cases of abuse reported to the police in recent days, the authorities said on Friday (Apr 17).

> As of Thursday, the police have received 12 reports of members of the public physically or verbally abusing enforcement officers and ambassadors while they were carrying out their duties, said the Singapore Police Force and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources in a joint release.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""We will not tolerate this, and will take offenders to task,"" said the authorities.

> One of these cases involved a 40-year-old man, who headbutted an enforcement officer after he was told to stop playing basketball at a cordoned-off multi-purpose hall in Khatib.

> In another case on Wednesday along Havelock Road, a 79-year-old man punched an enforcement officer who told him to wear his face mask properly.

> Also on Wednesday, a 72-year-old man slapped an enforcement officer who asked for his particulars after he saw the man eating food at a hawker centre along Circuit Road.

> Other cases involved verbal abuse against officers.

> On Thursday, a 37-year-old man insulted a police officer who had fined his friend for not wearing a face mask outside The Cathay shopping mall.

> Meanwhile on Tuesday, a 35-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman ""hurled vulgarities"" at three safe distancing ambassadors who had told the man not to sit on a crossed-out seat at a hawker centre along Toa Payoh Lorong 5.

> Police investigations are ongoing.

> Anyone found guilty of using abusive language against a public servant could be jailed for up to 12 months, fined up to S$5,000, or both.

> Anyone who voluntarily causes hurt to deter a public servant from the discharge of their duty could be jailed for up to seven years, fined or caned.

> Those who use criminal force to deter a public servant from the discharge of their duty could be jailed for up to four years, fined or both.

> ""The police would like to remind members of the public that it is an offence not to furnish their personal particulars and residential address when required by an enforcement officer,"" added the release.

> The authorities also advised members of the public to take official identification with them when they leave the house.

> Since elevated safe distancing measures kicked in on Apr 7, as part of a ""circuit breaker"" to curb the spread of COVID-19, around 3,000 enforcement officers and ambassadors have been deployed daily to public places and Housing and Development Board estates across Singapore, said the authorities.

> Under the tighter precautions, non-essential workplaces and schools have closed across the island and strict physical distancing measures have been put in place.

> It is also mandatory to wear a mask when leaving the house, apart from a few exceptions.

(1) Check everyone's temperature before letting them into the house.

(2) Continue to wear mask and sit further apart during the gathering.

(3) Make sure everyone washes their hands before eating.

(4) Serve individual portions and don't share food, and minimise talking during eating.  Also try to seat everyone further apart, if possible.

(5) Continue to keep in touch with everyone who has visited your house and whose house you have visited for two weeks.  At the first sign of someone having flu-like symptoms, quickly inform everyone, and make sure everyone in your household monitor their health carefully.  Importantly, avoid socialising to minimise spread to the larger community, until you are certain that there is minimal risk.

BTW, there is a bit of data buried in AZ's vaccine trial in South Africa. Essentially, prior infections to the OG SARS-CoV-2 strain provides no protection to the newer SA's strain. This means vaccines for the OG strain won't be effective for the new one.

So we have 2 ways to go from here:

\- Lockdowns and border controls become the norms or

\- Update the vaccines every year and hope that whoever makes the vaccines guess the right upcoming strain. We guess wrong flu vaccines all the time.

So while I get anxious about the sort of things you detail here, it's important to balance things out. Governments know that not everyone will strictly follow rules. They know the extent to which their particular population will tend to comply (fortunately, here, we're pretty compliant).

These factors are already built into policy and are part of the risk management.

The problem is not a policy issue. The problem is how the policies are translated on the ground - in other words, we need to see if there are lapses that have occurred that allowed the virus to break through our defenses. That is the part that no matter how much government involvement you have, you can never be sure that no breach in protocol won’t occur. 

Ultimately, the government can only lead, but it is the people who enact these policies or procedures that have to ensure it’s all followed. These include the everyday people who need to follow social distancing policies, shn rules, reporting sick guidelines. It’s like driving a car, government tell you what the speed limit is but if you choose to speed and kena accident, whose fault? By all means grab the pitch fork but make sure you point it at the right person.

and if youre one of those whose intent is to say to limit all entry to foreigners, i beseech you to consider other factors other than covid numbers alone. entire economies will go bust if we do so. not just tourism but other economies that rely on foreign labour. remember that Covid is here for the long run, not just another year or two. how long you want to keep the seclusion before opening up the borders again?

>Also, it's easy to sit on a high horse and deride people for not ""following guidelines"". All I'm saying is, stop being so quick to bash Singaporeans just because they bend a few rules here and there.

allow me to hit the ball back into your court. it's easy to sit on a high horse and deride the government for not being prudent when you only make considerations upon a small window of factors. 

and also, please hold everyone to the same, equal standards - if the government must be prudent in its decision making, so must the people. can't ""bash singaporeans"" just because they decide to relax a bit? don't ""bash the government"" because they also relax. 

and don't get me wrong, i hold the govt of singapore to the same high standards i hold the people of singapore. if they're shit, i'll be the first to raise my pitchforks. but to say that the people should not shoulder blame for becoming complacent, for not sticking to the same standards we could and did uphold the past year, is the start of a slide down a slippery slope. this growing ""superiority complex of the collective people"" idea needs to be kept in check, otherwise it can lead to our own downfall. recognizing our own problems and shortcomings is a strength, not accepting our own faults is a weakness. and especially in times of a crisis like we are in now, a weakness like this only spells greater trouble for the future.",2021-02-10 01:31:49,392

I see nothing in the text that gives that impression. OP is merely stating a possibility, and a warning of what could come if we get complacent, which, according to the article he linked, seems to be the case.

I think it's oversensitive of you to assume that OP is on a high horse and that he is smug because he's ready for cases to spike after CNY. I am also expecting a spike, because people simply will not follow instructions if they're not monitored.

This is the same reason why we need the safe distancing people sitting at the entrance of every location. Because people can't be trusted to do the right thing. See the Chinatown situation, for example. 

Another example: people who will not use the safe entry if the shops themselves don't employ a person to stand at the entrance and force people to do it. I have seen many a person just walk into the shop without scanning. Sure, I try to ask them to do it, but I can't catch every person. It's personal responsibility, which, unfortunately, a lot of Singaporeans lack. This is why we need to be nannied. 

This is why I (and probably OP) have no faith that the capacity limit will be followed during CNY. Or the house visitation limit, for that matter. It simply boils down to a lack of personal responsibility.",2021-02-08 15:29:53,195

> Nigel&#039;s fianc&eacute;e, Agatha Maghesh Eyamalai, who was not in quarantine but who had booked another room in the same hotel, was also charged with abetting Nigel&#039;s breach of the quarantine requirements, per ICA. Singapore has kept its COVID-19 numbers low in recent months by strictly enforcing a 14-day quarantine for incoming foreign workers and citizens.

> The quarantine period has helped Singapore greatly reduce its overall number of COVID cases and deaths.

You get sentenced with 5 lashes, let’s say.  We understand it that they hit you 5 times and you walk out pretty sore. But that’s not how it’s done. 

They hit you once, on bare skin, really hard and send you back to your cell. You heal fairly well with some swelling and maybe a scar or two. Once you e healed, they do it again. Same place. This time as the split came comes back together it gabs hold of scar tissue and rips it off. And back to your cell you go to heal. Longer healing now in a dirty cell. Maybe infection sets in. More damage. But you heal, eventually and they bring you in fir the third set. 

By the fifth set, they’re pulling out muscle tissue and you are hobbling, if able to stand at all. The infection you get in your dirty cell will probably kill you. If not, you’re maimed and crippled for life. 

That’s why there is very little crime in Singapore. 

That’s why that teenager years ago who was caught spray painting walls was so scared for his life. He got like 7 lashes in a sentence and the parents got President bush to help him with a “get out of jail free” card before the sentence was carried out!!!",2021-01-18 14:29:44,233

We are one of the countries with the highest population density in the world (>8000 people per square kilometre). We are also very dependent on the economy running. We've managed to keep deaths below 30 in total, and our new daily infections, mostly people coming from other countries, are averaging around 10-20 a day in a nation of 5.5 million (and about 1 case of community spread per day on average for the past month or so). [The total number of infections in Singapore is now 59,083. Of these, 58,784 people have fully recovered and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/24-new-covid-19-infections-singapore-including-4-community-cases-and-1-foreign-worker-dorm) So we only have about 300 active cases.

What happens if he gets out, no one notices, and passes the illness to 3 random people in the hotel? And what if they're asymptomatic when they start becoming contagious (which is usually the case), and spread it to wider society?

Who's going to answer for the people who fall ill? Who's going to answer for those who may potentially die? What happens to peoples' livelihoods if we are forced to go back under lockdown?

Britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last five hundred years: to create a disunited Europe. In that cause they have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. 

Now in modern times to break the whole EU thing up, they had to get inside. If they tried to break it up from the outside, that wouldn't work. Now that they were inside they could make a complete pig's breakfast of the whole thing — set the Germans against the French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch... it's just like old times.

They were originally pushing for an increase in the membership at the start so it would be just like the United Nations, in fact; the more members it has, the more arguments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes.

And then, BREXIT.

The former commonwealth counties however won't rejoin in a union with the UK because we know where it would lead to and exactly why.  After all, we do have our own parliaments based on Britain's own.

3. If, for some reason, the form still indicates you need to quarantine, please do so. You will have to take time off from work if you can't work from home. Also, the system that is responsible to list the names & addresses of those needing to quarantine, is not yet online.

Edit: as a PSA I’m having trouble finding a source so it’s possible I’m conflating incidents. I remember the story shocked me though, because I came across it while doing a research project for graduate school a couple years ago

Double Edit: I have concluded I must be conflating stories. However the Singaporean government has executed two “westerners” for drug trafficking the last three decades, one Dutch man and an Australian man. They also executed a Singaporean national in 2005 who was known for being the country’s national jet ski chamion in 1995. He was smuggling ~2lbs of cannabis from Malaysia. Also it turns out that if you commit a capital crime in Singapore, you are executed by hanging.

This is a hotel quarantine, much more serious that a house quarantine. Food is served to you to ensure you don't interact with \*anyon\* for 14 days. And no, I never breached a hotel quarantine.
2. Regarding ' Im sure you’ve left your house more than 3 times since March 202 0', you're clueless about Singapore ain't you? Our lockdown ended in July. Even during lockdown, people were allowed to leave their house for exercise. Hotel quarantine is specifically for people incoming from other countries because we have it under control in SG.

So yes, the dude should to punished harshly for violating a hotel quarantine order. Singapore is could be like Australia/NZ and simply ban all foreign nationals from coming to into country. Instead, we are lenient and put in these policies in place. A bad apple like this spoils for everyone else.",2021-01-18 14:40:10,137

Many incidences of police being attacked in Geylang. The police still have to perform their ""raids"" but most of it is a show as the real criminals get a heads up before the raid so there will be no danger to the police.

You can read what the police chief said about geylang here. And these quotes were on govt sanitised media so one can guess the real situation on the ground: 

i) CP Ng on the ""hint of lawlessness"" in Geylang. He said that a police officer was beaten up while detaining a gambling store operator on a recent occasion and that a police car parked in Geylang was also vandalised and had its windscreen smashed. 

1. ""Today, despite the riot in Little India, I worry more for Geylang.. If Singaporeans are irked by the littering, the noise and the jaywalking in Little India, they'll certainly and quickly sense that there exists a hint of lawlessness in Geylang"" (""1,000 more cops needed to boost force: Police chief"", The Straits Times, A2)

2. ""Most worry about Geylang is that there is an overt hostility and antagonism towards the police.. All in all, Geylang presents an ecosystem which is complex, which is tinged with a certain criminal undertone."" (""Geylang is more of a worry"", The New Paper, p.8)

Your dad could literally be Hitler but that wouldn’t factor into how I judge you. I agree that the west has a bad history, but its effects are more pronounced because of how technologically dominant it was. Before the current times, the world was filled with atrocities, it was basically the norm. 
The Aztecs enslaved other peoples and forced them to pay tribute in the form of human sacrifice. 
A few centuries ago, China indiscriminately massacred Dzungars, 80% of them were wiped out and nearly all of their land/culture were gone and replaced. 
Much of Southern Africa was dominated by Pigmy, Khoi, and San peoples that were almost entirely wiped out by Bantus.
Just look up a list of the largest genocides and you’ll see that the West doesn’t stand out in this regard. 

As for COVID, you can find a few examples of westerners breaking laws in other countries but there are examples of non westerners breaking the same laws all the time.

All clubs are alcohol focused cause that's pretty much the only option. And no, the punishment for buying or possessing drugs isn't death, the authorities don't really care about small fry recreational drug users. They target traffickers and dealers and people who possess huge amounts. I have a friend who's about to be released (yay!) after 5 years in prison for possession of a variety (yup, not just one type) of drugs. Whilst awaiting trial, he was sent to rehab. So don't believe the fearmongering from foreign journalists who don't have in depth knowledge of what truly goes on in the country.

 Anyway, I'm pretty sure the police knows which clubs/parties they'll find recreational drug users and if they wanted to arrest anyone at any point, they would've done so. So far, I haven't seen anyone getting arrested in any club. But that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I know people who've been to prison for either possession, consumption, dealing. Depending on the quantity and type of drug they had on them at the time, the sentence is anywhere between 12 months to... well, years. These people are also educated, functional, intelligent people who go on to lead normal lives after release. There's nothing wrong with a little fun now and then, and the war on drugs needs to end. 

With all that said, drugs are very expensive in Singapore and really not worth doing, considering the risk. But $50 for a pill that'll give you euphoria for hours vs $50 for 3 drinks, I'm sure most would choose the former if there were no consequences.",2021-01-19 07:49:18,254

Pale skin and big eyes have been a standard of beauty in Asia for thousand of years. The ""pale skin"" that's a standard of beauty in our countries is a lot whiter than white people's, funnily (and you guys tan on top of that, we avoid sun).

Our declining birth rates are not going to have much impact until about 2060, and even by 2100 we will still account for almost 3 times the world's population you will be. If you add to this Southeast Asian that's 6-7 times the population.

China's growth is bound to massively slow down but that will only be after they've overtaken America, which will continue its decline.

Let's look at many peer reviewed studies that are being censored and suppressed which are showing that the lockdowns may not actually have any benefits at all.

He is known on r/singapore as a master practitioner of r/enlightenedcentrism and authoritarian apologetics, to the extent of making up irrelevant strawmen.

As a Singaporean that identifies as centre-left, I will tell you the country has a regressive, anti-intellectual stand towards drugs, capital punishment and corporal punishment. It is a huge blind spot of an administration that crows about its technocratic, evidence-based policymaking. It is founded on the dubious assumption that extant research and case studies on failed drug wars are fundamentally irrelevant to the Singaporean experience (as an island city-state), and that a drug war can not just be won, but is desirable. And also that harsh punishments are something demanded by the majority of the populace - ignoring that fact that reverence of authority and a retributive streak were socially engineered by the government.

That said, some of this apologism, I think is a symptom of overcorrection. Tired, Orientalist caricatures have not kept up with the social development of Singapore (eg. the whole chewing gum thing), and there is therefore a desire to leap in the country's defense. Hell, they were caricatures even when they first emerged. Flawed, yes, but to have a realistic image of when and where torture and brutality happens.

Progressive activism is also viewed as a neo-colonialist enterprise by the West by too much of the population. The legacy of colonialism is fraught in this region. There is much trauma. To some extent the government has cultivated this trauma to their advantage to malign progressive activism, especially when such activism first gained traction in global culture through discourses in ex-colonial powers in the West. Even if there *is* a homegrown tradition in progressive causes.",2021-01-18 20:44:25,279

There is of course a more complex view to take like the fact Singapore has a lot of the basic necessities really nailed. Housing is subsidised for almost every citizen who wants to buy into government housing ( I own one with my wife. It's a flat. It's great and is actually designed to make it possible to own a home. Singaporeans will debate the benefits and cons of HDB due to its 99 year lease system but compared to back home... I don't think id ever have been able to peruse being a designer and still get to own a home in a city that I can find work )

The food is subsidised, local hawker culture is some of the tastiest and cheapest food around. Nothing compares to it in the UK. The idea that you can go out everyday and it's cheaper to eat and sit down with family and friends than to eat at home (unless super frugal) still blows my mind. 

The national insurance equivalent, CPF is usable for more than just your eventual pension. You can use it for medical bills ( on top of already subsidised healthcare. Albeit as someone who suffers from a lot of health issues I do miss the NHS ), you can use it to pay for your home loan and your employer has to match you monthly contribution as well. 

Education is some of the best in the world, the school rankings here leave me feeling stupid as hell when I meet kids who are in 'not as good' schools who are still brighter and more educated than I could ever say I was at that age. Albeit that this comes with the cost of extreme child stress, which is the problem Singapore is now trying to work out how to address. Maybe a bit slower than it should be...

I think Singapore just looked at a lot of the things that make crime common, you know... poverty and access to basic needs. 

I'm a big old SNP voting lefty, so take all this as you will. I just feel like if the UK gov actually wanted to be like Singapore, I hope the low tax bit isn't the thing they take. I hope it's the subsidised housing, the food support etc etc.",2021-01-18 18:55:46,394

>**The law creates a presumption of trafficking for certain threshold amounts**, e.g. 30 grams of [cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)). It also creates a presumption that a person possesses drugs if he possesses the keys to a premises containing the drugs, and that ""Any person found in or escaping from any place or premises which is proved or presumed to be used for the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been smoking or administering a controlled drug in that place or premises."" Thus, one runs the risk of arrest for drug use by simply being in the company of drug users. The law also allows officers to search premises and individuals, without a [search warrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant), if he ""reasonably suspects that there is to be found a controlled drug or article liable to seizure"".

What's the point of going through all the trouble of creating rehab centers, of jailing people, of making the 15 gram distinction, of creating rebuttable legal presumptions, if the intent is just to execute drug users? Shouldn't Singapore be executing 2000 people a year instead of 3, if all they wanted was for drug users to die, to ""save face"" as you say?

The case against capital and corporal punishment - in general beyond drug trafficking - is just as strong as the case against cannabis.

Saying that the drug policy is uniformly regressive, as are its punishments, is not the same as equating potential of damage of cannabis vs opioids or meth.

Is your defense of the emprisonment of jpurnisys like Julian Assange or whistleblower Edward Snowden that it doesn't impact you?,2021-01-19 01:15:40,78

The first comment I responded to said ""and all I gotta do is not be an asshole"", to which I responded ""...and not be gay"".

You could have just said, ""yeah being gay can hinder certain things."" Or ""that's not really relevant to cheap food and internet""
Or even like your comment above""for the average person that is enough"" Instead you respoded that a famous gay comedian wasn't in jail, as if that was somehow proof that discrimination isn't a thing?

The topic was regarding a man who is going to be jailed for breaking strict quarantine and visiting his fiance in the same building. It's completely fair for people to contribute to this discussion who both agree with and disagree with the authorities response. Your attempts to remove me from this discussion is amusing though.

First thing to note is that you are working under the assumption that these laws save lives. I have shown you evidence that they don't, and they are largely detrimental. Are you willing to even consider the opportunity cost involved? The lockdowns on a global scale are very literally going to result in massive deaths in poorer nations due to starvation, and you don't think that the scale and scope is comparable?

You are working off of the false premise that ""if it only saves one life it is worth it"" but you selectively ignore all of the data that shows this is quote the opposite. And if that is true then shouldn't we ban everything, literally anything can cause harm. Forget about seatbelt laws, let's ban cars all together. My questions are where do you draw the line and what's the appropriate balance. You are allowed to have a different opinion, but the more you defer to government to choose where that line is you better believe they will keep moving that line year after year, and crisis after crisis. Not to mention, once they have that level of control, how can you then continue to even believe the information they are providing you with? We all know that China has kept the real death numbers hidden, so which governments are open and transparent and which aren't?

Lastly, stop giving about ours to island nations that have the pandemic under control, there is an inherent advantage geographically that is doing far more work than any government response.",2021-01-19 02:22:26,315

If a significant proportion of the population don’t get vaccinated, we start to see a resurgence in previously controlled diseases, but at their core, vaccines are still essentially selfish - people get them primarily to protect themselves. 

Masks are similar in the sense that they require herd compliance to be effective, but not to the same degree - the protection a mask offers the individual wearing it is pretty minimal. It’s value is in preventing droplets becoming airborne, which is generally more of a benefit to other people (at least for the strips of cloth worn by the average shopper). 

The difference is, the general population aren’t really affected by antivaxxers. The fact that they’ve been vaccinated themselves protects them. It still significantly increases the risk to the vulnerable who can’t have a vaccine, but the vaccinated majority severely limits the ability for it to spread. 

That’s not yet the case with Covid. Antimaskers put everybody else at risk every time they enter an enclosed space without a mask. If they have it, they can easily spread it to 2-3 people in every shop they visit. If one of those are staff, or somebody who works closely with many others, that one trip to Tesco can easily start a wave that infects literally thousands.

If we had a reliable way to confirm actual, valid, exemptions, that number would probably be small enough to be acceptable. Unfortunately, the vast majority of antimaskers are perfectly capable of wearing a mask, they’re just being dickheads for the sake of rebellion. And I don’t have a lot of faith in those kind of dickheads to be following the other rules, like not mixing household or not going to Tesco after a positive test.",2021-01-19 05:28:21,312

> SINGAPORE — With commuter numbers expected to rise when Singapore’s circuit breaker period ends on Monday (1 June), there “will be times when safe distancing will not be possible” on public transport, said Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan.

> “We have been able to ensure safe distancing so far because commuter numbers have plunged. From tomorrow onwards, it will be more challenging,” he said in a Facebook post on Monday.

> In the post, Khaw shared pictures of himself and a public transport worker removing safe distancing notices from seats on an MRT train and a bus, respectively. In another image, Khaw seen next to a poster at an MRT station for the SafeEntry app, with the minister describing its use as part of “the new normal”.

> “We still urge Singaporeans to work from home and for those who need to leave home, to stagger their time and avoid traditional peak hours,” said Khaw, who stressed the importance of commuters wearing masks “all the time”.

> Khaw also advised commuters to refrain from conversations and observe personal hygiene.

> Noting that many are looking forward to the end of the circuit breaker, which began on 7 April, he added that the easing of measures needed to be done “gradually and carefully”.

> “Unnecessary haste may lead to an uncontrollable spike and cluster. We do not want to have to hit the circuit breaker again,” said Khaw.

> From Tuesday, Phase 1 of Singapore’s re-opening will see businesses in sectors deemed at low risk of COVID-19 transmission being allowed to resume operations. Households will also be allowed to receive two visitors per day, while places of worship will be re-opened for private worship sessions. Primary and secondary school students who are in graduating cohorts will also be returning to school.

I can't really give a comprehensive answer to that, but I'll say it's definitely within the realm of plausibility. Lower traffic during peak hours due to WFH schemes and not running certain bus lines allows redirection of manpower and buses to other lanes. Trains would be the one seeing the bottleneck, although that's presuming that 3min frequency is optimum give and take, and we want higher frequency to translate to similar travel time. We can have more trains on hold in between lanes, but that will be on the expense of time to take a more preventive measure. 

I think we shouldn't translate higher frequency to being faster too. It's just spreading the people to break them apart from crowding spots such as bus stops and train stations.

> SINGAPORE - Stricter safe distancing measures will be introduced to reduce the risk of further local transmission, the authorities announced, as Singapore reported another 40 Covid-19 cases on Friday (March 20).

> Keeping a safe space around individuals is especially important for vulnerable segments of the population, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said at a press conference.

> All events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.

> Events with fewer than 250 people and operators of venues accessible to the public, such as restaurants and cinemas, are also required to implement measures to ensure separation of at least 1m between patrons.

> The measures will apply across the board for all events, including religious and private gatherings.""

> Employers have also been strongly advised to allow their employees to work from home, or implement staggered working hours where telecommuting is not possible.

> Non-critical work events should be deferred and critical ones scaled down to no more than 250 participants at any one time.

> ""When combined with good personal hygiene, safe distancing measures can help to slow the spread of Covid-19"", said Mr Gan, who is co-chair of a multi-ministry task force to fight the coronavirus.

> He added : ""Our healthcare professionals are working hard to take care of patients. We don't want to add to their load, and therefore, it is important to add these measures to ensure our healthcare workers have the capacity to look after our patients.""

> Singapore has witnessed a recent uptick in new cases daily that has been largely due to a sharp increase in imported cases, as Singaporeans studying and working abroad return home from other countries where the number of infections continue to rise.

> Of the 40 cases confirmed on Friday, three-quarters were imported.

> There were only 33 imported cases from Jan 23 to March 9, with this number rising to 156 from March 10 to March 20.

> Imported cases have also nearly caught up with non-imported ones for Singapore's total of 385 cases.

> Stressing that is cannot be business as usual, task force co-chair Lawrence Wong, the Minister for National Development, said that the aim was to have fewer people out and about, and a reduction in social gatherings and any activity that could be a potential social vector for the virus.

> On how the safe distancing measures will be enforced, Mr Wong said this can be done in several ways.

> For example, food and beverage outlets that are licensed will have to close some tables.

> ""So it is not an option, it is not advisory, it is mandatory,"" he said.

> ""We will start tomorrow and it will take some time to roll out fully but we will aim to do so as quickly as possible.""

> He added: ""We do not want to see crowded venues, we do not want to see packed event halls. We should see more work from home, more takeaways.""

> ""We will be enforcing the rules. There will be some inconvenience but we also need all Singaporeans to cooperate. And if we are all very disciplined about this it will give us better control and enable us to control spread of virus.""

> Mr Gan had announced on Wednesday that non-Covid patients could be transferred to private hospitals to free up capacity at public hospitals.

> He also said there are plans to convert normal wards into isolation wards, and quarantine facilities into care centres for Covid-19 patients with less severe symptoms if the number of cases here continue to rise.

The 4th subject had a lower viral load to begin with, so ND. But that's not relevant to presymptomatic cases, just pointing out. 

On the positive side, this paper found that viral load was decreased at least 10 fold by wearing a mask. While inadequate for reducing PPE recommendations in healthcare settings - which could be a relevant takeaway for stakeholders - it would reduce exposure during transient contact while breathing, especially in well ventilated areas like queuing for bubble tea outdoors facing the open air.

>  My suggestion is based on international consensus recommendation from  experts, while you are taking what amounts to a case study to jump to a  recommendation for everyone.

I made no such recommendation. You did, though.

>  On the positive side, this paper found that viral load was decreased at  least 10 fold by wearing a mask. While inadequate for reducing PPE  recommendations in healthcare settings - which could be a relevant  takeaway for stakeholders - it would reduce exposure during transient  contact while breathing, especially in well ventilated areas like  queuing for bubble tea outdoors facing the open air.

You don't get it, do you? People shouldn't be queuing for bubble tea thinking that their mask protects them, or others from them.

>  The government is recommending against visiting malls anyway. So that  hopefully relieves some anxiety over some frivolous non-ideal physical  distancing.

These measures were made based on data in the 1970s in one source I could find. We have an updated MIT article that suggests that these recommendations are outdated. 

> Also, in our conversation you equate presymptomatic transmission as asymptomatic transmission.  

I stand corrected. Thank you for pointing that out.

But personally my takeaway from what you shared is that the cloth masks that authorities are now recommendating to use worldwide would reduce the distance our breath could travel, thus addressing the implication that we need to stay further away from each other.

Due to the sheep like mentality of a portion of Singaporeans, they're only going to follow what's most convenient to them. This is why the government has introduced stricter and stricter measures (CB, now the new bill).

I think the social distancing, while a good idea, is implemented poorly. You have people queuing to get into a shopping mall and being crammed outside, ignoring social distancing. Not only this, but others have mentioned, but the trains and busses are places where social distancing clearly cannot be done unless the government takes much more serious measures, such as mandating work from home. 

The claim is that public transport is transient contact only, and that the risk is minimal. However, for many people, they might be on the train for 30 minutes, an hour, or even more.

Second, lack of social distancing in transport systems. Businesses and schools still have to go on, so that means cramping in trains/buses each morning/evening. This is not something that can be tackled unless you stop all activities, because “limit number of passengers in bus” and other reasons are unrealistic.

This essentially negates my whole day of effort in distancing. 

Just like how in uni (e.g NIE), they closed the students’ lounge because ‘no gathering > 10 people’ but students >20 are cramped into one classroom for 3hours lesson. It negates all the efforts of social distancing. 

MOE should consider allowing all tertiary students to do home based learning.

Unlike Wuhan, we don't have other provinces to channel supplies to us. Already other countries like Thailand are slowly turning off the tap on essentials like food. If we ""lockdown"" in the manner you suggest, how are we going to pay, and what can we offer in return? And if we *do* run out of these supplies we're gonna be in a *much* more sticky situation than with the virus alone. It's not trendy these days to mention this, but *thrashing the economy also results in loss of life*.

Then theres the issue of what a lockdown actually means. Its easy to say ""well, lets just give exceptions for essential services, like healthcare workers, people working in critical industries like water, telecoms etc"". But the devil is in the details: where do you draw the line? Obviously, clubs and pubs aren't essential. But what about hotels where you house the people in SHN: these need to be somewhat staffed as well, right? What about our military --- is that essential? And then you come to hawkers and restaurants: our frontline workers need to eat too, right? Even if you allow only for takeouts, the eateries still have to be open. Or our ports: we've got to ship in food and supplies from *somewhere*. Once you think about it further, you'd realize that after provisioning for these exemptions, you get something that is not too different from what we already have (and most certainly something that we're heading to).

And don't even get me started on the chaos which would ensue if this is declared immediately. If DORSCON orange already led to panic, what would a lockdown lead to?

The gov can come up with new rules/ measures, but if people don't cooperate then this situation is just going to take longer to blow over. Need to strike fear into them somehow.

But from what I know, people finish their workday lunch in 15-20 mins and leave while a bus ride is easily 30 mins +. 

That's why I think we might as well bite the bullet and lock down. The Covid situation is fluid and we must adapt, just like how one moment we were told to support local attractions and the next moment to stay at home. Our infection graph was quite nice in Feb but started to spike once the overseas Singaporeans returned.

Singapore is a small country and our enforcement is good. From the generous budget, we know the govt can afford to pay full wages up to median salary for more than 2 mths (ie 25% salary over 3 quarters). With the borders as good as closed, just focus on clearing the virus from SG. Even if our curve has a long tail, I'll bet my last penny it will be shorter than the messy Europeans / Americans and our even messier neighbours.

With things under control, at least life can get back to some normalcy. Everyone will still have to scrape by, some are still screwed but at least we are not in this not-here-not-there limbo. During this time, the govt can also take the time to ponder how we ""leap ahead"" once the virus is over world wide.

Note: If you disagree with my opinion, that's ok. But rebut with thought out opinions and not just personal insults.",2020-03-27 10:11:36,275

> SINGAPORE — Those who intentionally sit on a seat or stand in a queue less than one metre away from another person in public venues can be fined up to $10,000 or jailed a maximum of six months, or both.

> Such penalties also apply to those who intentionally sit on a fixed seat that is demarcated as not to be occupied in public venues, as well as those who take part in events held anywhere here with more than 10 participants.

> These and other social distancing regulations, along with penalties, were included in one of several updates made by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to the Infectious Diseases Act.

> These were published in the electronic version of the government gazette at 11pm, Thursday, less than an hour before all entertainment venues were to be closed till end-April.

> The same penalties apply for those who flout other social distancing regulations during the period between 27 March and 30 April, inclusive of both dates. Such regulations do not apply to proceedings of the Parliament or the courts.

> During this period, all events, regardless of size, must be deferred or cancelled, while social gatherings are to be limited to 10 people or fewer at any time.

> Public venues, such as retail malls, museums, and attractions, where contact is more transient, may remain open but only with precautionary measures in place.

> Separately, all centre-based tuition and enrichment classes have been suspended to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools. All religious services and congregations have also been suspended.

> The scope of violation for the regulations includes:

> This excludes any event that is conducted for business at a workplace or providing education in an educational institution.

> Among the 55 places of attractions that must comply are the Arts House, Asian Civilisations Museum, Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore Zoological Gardens and Gardens By The Bay.

> In an earlier update made by the MOH to the Act, patients who are issued a five-day medical leave by a medical practitioner certifying that they have acute respiratory symptoms are not allowed to leave their homes starting on the day the certificate is issued.

> Similarly, those who do not comply and leave their homes during the five-day period will too face a maximum fine of $10,000 or a maximum jail term of six months, or both. They can only leave their homes to seek medical attention.

> The same penalties apply to anyone who flouts the 14-day stay-home notice by leaving the place of accommodation or residence they are serving the notice in.

> Of the 683 COVID-19 cases here, 172 have fully recovered. 18 patients remain in the intensive care unit while two – a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man – have died.

> Two groups, each comprising 20 people or more, are under investigation for allegedly breaching safe distancing rules at Singapore's nature reserves.

> One involved 26 hikers who had attempted to go off-trail illegally in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the largest on the island.

> The other was a group of 20 who had gathered for a birthday celebration at Labrador Nature Reserve in the south-west of Singapore.

> Of greater concern is that these two groups are not the only ones being investigated for possible violation of Covid-19 safety measures, nor are they even the biggest group.

> The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) revealed yesterday that a group of 50 people is also being investigated. The New Paper understands this is the largest group linked to a breach since safe distancing measures were put in place in March.

> Responding to queries from TNP, an MSE spokesman said these incidents are among a spate of recent cases involving 12 to 50 people intermingling in large groups at various parks, birthday celebrations, baby showers, food and beverage outlets, and basketball and football games in Housing Board estate courts.

> These cases are under investigation and the appropriate enforcement action will be taken, she added.

> Noting the recent increase in such gatherings, the spokesman added: ""It is important for all of us to remain vigilant and adhere to safe distancing measures to avoid a resurgence of cases as seen in other countries.

> ""We have been able to keep the number of Covid-19 cases low due to the majority playing their part.

> ""With the festive season coming up, and as we make the transition to phase three, it is even more crucial for us to adhere to these measures so that we can continue to keep our community safe.""

> Under the current phase two of the country's reopening, social gatherings of up to five people are allowed with safety measures such as the wearing of masks.

> The Government has signalled that the country could move into phase three by the end of the year.

> But Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force of Covid-19, reiterated on Tuesday that three criteria must be met for this to happen.

> Two of them are sufficient testing capabilities - in which Singapore is ""proceeding well"" - and a participation rate of 70 per cent in the TraceTogether programme, up from the current rate of less than 50 per cent.

> The third is an overall sense of compliance with safe management measures.

> ""We do need to see Singaporeans taking today's measures seriously because if people are not even responsible enough to uphold (them), then going for further relaxation is going to be very risky,"" Mr Wong stressed.

> Separately, on Tuesday, Minister of Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said on Facebook: ""I am concerned to see an increasing number of flagrant violations of the rules. I urge you to continue to observe the measures to keep your family and friends safe from infection.""

> Infectious disease experts warned that this was not the time for complacency despite the drop in community cases.

> With reciprocal green lanes established between Singapore and countries like Malaysia and Japan and the imminent air travel bubble with Hong Kong, an undetected case of the virus could slip through, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, a specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said.

> ""Our defence of masks and social distancing must hold. If not, we will see a new wave of community spread,"" he added.

> ""I would encourage everyone to not give up the huge gains that we have achieved.""

> Another expert, Dr Ling Li Min, who is also based at Mount Elizabeth Novena, said the recent rise in breaches suggested that people may be suffering from Covid-19 measures fatigue.

> However, she stressed the importance of remaining socially responsible, as studies have shown that gathering in large groups in close proximity results in an estimated secondary infection rate of up to 53 per cent should someone in the group have the virus.

> ""Getting to where we are now with our low community infection rates has been a challenge, and we have seen from the experiences of other countries how easy it is for a new cluster of infections to form,"" she added.

> ""Let us not be tempted to let our guard down now.""

> Some of the women had uploaded several videos on Instagram, showing themselves play-fighting with pillows and clothes on beds.

> Social gatherings of more than five people are prohibited due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

> Responding to queries from The New Paper yesterday, Mr Chew Tiong Heng, executive director of infrastructure planning and management at the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), said it was aware of the alleged incident and was investigating.

> ""STB takes a serious view of any breach in safe management measures,"" he said.

> ""Hotels are required to comply with all safe management measures, including ensuring that gatherings do not exceed five people if they are not from the same household.""

> An RWS spokesman said it takes a serious view of non-compliance and requires all guests to be registered with the hotel front desk.

> Safe management measures are highlighted to guests during check-in, and signs are displayed at common areas as a reminder.

> He said: ""We strongly urge all guests to strictly observe and adhere to all safe management measures for the health, safety and well-being of the Singapore community.""

> This is the second such gathering at RWS that has allegedly breached safe management rules in as many months.

> Last month, it was reported that a group of at least 10 people, mostly women, were seen drinking and dining together in a hotel suite there. Investigations over the incident are ongoing.

> A reader tipped off TNP on the latest alleged incident and claimed it involved six women and two men who held significant influence over youth here.

> One of the women involved has about 57,000 followers on Instagram.

> Individuals who breach safety measures may be fined up to $10,000, or jailed for up to six months, or both.

> The maximum sentence is doubled for repeat offenders.

> Asked what possible action may be taken if such breaches repeatedly occur at the same location, Mr Chew said hotels that are found to be non-compliant may face closure of its premises.

> Businesses that do not comply may also be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other forms of assistance.

> Rules for staycations at hotels

> Staycations are allowed at hotels approved by the Singapore Tourism Board and Ministry of Trade and Industry.

> The hotels must comply with existing safe management measures, such as the wearing of masks and practice of safe distancing in public and common areas.

> Gatherings, even those in private rooms and adjoining rooms, must be limited to five persons or fewer.

> The exception is if the gathering consists only of people who have already been living in the same household, each with the same address.

> All hotel guests are required to register themselves and use SafeEntry for entry and exit. The use of TraceTogether is encouraged.

> There must be staggered timings for guests to be at the hotel lobby and at guest facilities, as well as employees at the back-of-house work environment.

> SINGAPORE: Two men who took part in a social gathering at Robertson Quay during Singapore's COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"" period have had their work passes revoked, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Thursday (Sep 24).

> Britons Daniel Olalekan Olasunkanmi Olagunju, 30, and Alfred Jon Veloso Waring, 34, were also permanently banned from working in Singapore.

> On May 16, photos of people gathering in Robertson Quay went viral on social media. Olagunju and Waring were part of a group of people who met at the steps near Limoncello restaurant that day to chat and drink alcohol.

> 

> Seven other people who also gathered in the area were fined in June. All were barred from working in Singapore except for one who is a Singapore permanent resident.

> Both Olagunju and Waring were also fined earlier this week for flouting COVID-19 circuit breaker measures. Olagunju was fined S$8,500 and Waring was fined S$8,000.

> Singapore implemented a circuit breaker from Apr 7 to Jun 1 to stem local transmissions of COVID-19. During this period, people who were not living in the same residence were not allowed to meet for social purposes.

> 

> In response to CNA’s queries, a spokesperson from MOM said on Thursday it would not “hesitate to take action against those who have been convicted of breaking the law”. This includes revoking work passes.

> “All work pass holders in Singapore must abide by the law, regardless of nationality and pass type,” said the spokesperson.

But no one takes pictures of them.

> SINGAPORE - Authorities are investigating shoe retailer Foot Locker, following large crowds that gathered on Friday evening outside its Orchard Gateway @ Emerald outlet.

> The Singapore Tourism Board said early Saturday (Dec 5) morning that investigations are under way, as Foot Locker stores have continued to hold events that draw large crowds, despite repeated advisories about crowd management.

> On Friday night, crowds had gathered at its Orchard outlet, apparently for Saturday's release of limited edition Adidas sneakers, which can fetch a tidy profit on the secondary market due to high demand.

> Eyewitnesses saw at least four red Police Tactical Unit anti-riot trucks parked outside 313@somerset mall, and police tape used to cordon off shop fronts. Police officers were also seen dispersing the crowd, which consisted mainly of youths.

> Photos that circulated on social media at about 8pm showed a crowd of around 100 people packed shoulder to shoulder outside the footwear store.

> The crowds were dispersed shortly after 8.30pm after safe distancing ambassadors and police officers arrived, STB said in a statement.

> ""STB takes a serious view of any breach in safe management measures, and will not hesitate to take actions against individuals and businesses that do not comply with them,"" said STB's director for safe management operations Ms Ranita Sundramoorthy.

> Adidas' Yeezy sneaker line, the product of a collaboration between rapper Kanye West and the sports shoe brand, has drawn large crowds in Singapore and abroad during past launches.

> Last June, the launch of the limited edition Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V created a long queue many hours before the release time at Foot Locker's Jewel Changi Airport outlet.

> Sole Superior Singapore, a sneaker and streetwear community, called on Foot Locker to shift to a contactless system for ""hyped"" - or very popular - releases, and that a traditional queue system ""is not the way during such dangerous times"".

> ""All we need is just one case to create a cluster,"" it said on Facebook. ""Then, inevitably, the public will look at the streetwear community in general in disgust.""

> Adidas Singapore had held an online ballot for Saturday's limited release shoes, but many sneaker aficionados who missed out appeared to have been trying their luck at Foot Locker given the high resale value of the shoes.

> ""These trainers are hot - the hype is real...Foot Locker is at the head of the latest trends, so you know it'll stock Yeezy boost trainers online and in select stores,"" it said on its website prior to the launch.

> The Foot Locker Singapore website was down as of Friday evening.

> Netizens took to social media to voice their displeasure at the lack of social distancing among the crowd.

> Former NMP Siew Kum Hong shared pictures of those gathered outside Foot Locker on his Facebook on Friday with the caption: ""Few cases does not mean no cases.""

> Under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament in April, those found flouting safe management measures face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Repeat offenders can be fined up to S$20,000, jailed for up to one year, or both.
