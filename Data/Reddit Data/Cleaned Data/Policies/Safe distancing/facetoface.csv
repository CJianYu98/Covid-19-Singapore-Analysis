> A 52-year-old British man who was charged in court on Friday with violating Singapore&#039;s notoriously strict quarantine rules could face up to six months in prison or a fine of about $7,500- or both - according to the city-state&#039;s immigration authority.

> Nigel&#039;s fianc&eacute;e, Agatha Maghesh Eyamalai, who was not in quarantine but who had booked another room in the same hotel, was also charged with abetting Nigel&#039;s breach of the quarantine requirements, per ICA. Singapore has kept its COVID-19 numbers low in recent months by strictly enforcing a 14-day quarantine for incoming foreign workers and citizens.

> The quarantine period has helped Singapore greatly reduce its overall number of COVID cases and deaths.

In Singapore, we can count the number of daily transmissions on one hand. We have an astoundingly low death rate (a grand total of 29 people have died in a country of about 6 million). We don't have people crying on the grocery store floors because they have to wear a mask. No service worker has been attacked. Now we can have guilt-free dinner parties and open tourist attractions. When it comes to viruses, we're doing  it right. Just bloody stay in a comfortable hotel room for 14 days. It's the frigging Ritz Carlton. It's not hard.",2021-01-18 15:26:34,123

You get sentenced with 5 lashes, let’s say.  We understand it that they hit you 5 times and you walk out pretty sore. But that’s not how it’s done. 

They hit you once, on bare skin, really hard and send you back to your cell. You heal fairly well with some swelling and maybe a scar or two. Once you e healed, they do it again. Same place. This time as the split came comes back together it gabs hold of scar tissue and rips it off. And back to your cell you go to heal. Longer healing now in a dirty cell. Maybe infection sets in. More damage. But you heal, eventually and they bring you in fir the third set. 

By the fifth set, they’re pulling out muscle tissue and you are hobbling, if able to stand at all. The infection you get in your dirty cell will probably kill you. If not, you’re maimed and crippled for life. 

That’s why there is very little crime in Singapore. 

That’s why that teenager years ago who was caught spray painting walls was so scared for his life. He got like 7 lashes in a sentence and the parents got President bush to help him with a “get out of jail free” card before the sentence was carried out!!!",2021-01-18 14:29:44,233

Interesting that New Zealand appears to have achieved a similar result without a possible 6 months in jail.

Given, Singapore is a densely populated international travel hub, New Zealand not so much.

Some real double standards imo.

We are one of the countries with the highest population density in the world (>8000 people per square kilometre). We are also very dependent on the economy running. We've managed to keep deaths below 30 in total, and our new daily infections, mostly people coming from other countries, are averaging around 10-20 a day in a nation of 5.5 million (and about 1 case of community spread per day on average for the past month or so). [The total number of infections in Singapore is now 59,083. Of these, 58,784 people have fully recovered and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/24-new-covid-19-infections-singapore-including-4-community-cases-and-1-foreign-worker-dorm) So we only have about 300 active cases.

What happens if he gets out, no one notices, and passes the illness to 3 random people in the hotel? And what if they're asymptomatic when they start becoming contagious (which is usually the case), and spread it to wider society?

Who's going to answer for the people who fall ill? Who's going to answer for those who may potentially die? What happens to peoples' livelihoods if we are forced to go back under lockdown?

Britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last five hundred years: to create a disunited Europe. In that cause they have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. 

Now in modern times to break the whole EU thing up, they had to get inside. If they tried to break it up from the outside, that wouldn't work. Now that they were inside they could make a complete pig's breakfast of the whole thing — set the Germans against the French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch... it's just like old times.

They were originally pushing for an increase in the membership at the start so it would be just like the United Nations, in fact; the more members it has, the more arguments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes.

And then, BREXIT.

The former commonwealth counties however won't rejoin in a union with the UK because we know where it would lead to and exactly why.  After all, we do have our own parliaments based on Britain's own.

1. Fill out a ""Passenger location form"" after returning from abroad. This is mandatory, but there is no way to check if people did it.
2. Based on the information on that form, you have to self-quarantine in your home. If you indicate on that form you did not engage with other people, you don't have to quarantine. Suddenly a LOT of people went on holiday to cabins in the middle of the woods....
3. If, for some reason, the form still indicates you need to quarantine, please do so. You will have to take time off from work if you can't work from home. Also, the system that is responsible to list the names & addresses of those needing to quarantine, is not yet online. So the local authorities that need to check up if quarantine is being violated, don't even know who to check.

Edit: as a PSA I’m having trouble finding a source so it’s possible I’m conflating incidents. I remember the story shocked me though, because I came across it while doing a research project for graduate school a couple years ago

Double Edit: I have concluded I must be conflating stories. However the Singaporean government has executed two “westerners” for drug trafficking the last three decades, one Dutch man and an Australian man. They also executed a Singaporean national in 2005 who was known for being the country’s national jet ski chamion in 1995. He was smuggling ~2lbs of cannabis from Malaysia. Also it turns out that if you commit a capital crime in Singapore, you are executed by hanging.

You can read what the police chief said about geylang here. And these quotes were on govt sanitised media so one can guess the real situation on the ground: 

i) CP Ng on the ""hint of lawlessness"" in Geylang. He said that a police officer was beaten up while detaining a gambling store operator on a recent occasion and that a police car parked in Geylang was also vandalised and had its windscreen smashed. 

1. ""Today, despite the riot in Little India, I worry more for Geylang.. If Singaporeans are irked by the littering, the noise and the jaywalking in Little India, they'll certainly and quickly sense that there exists a hint of lawlessness in Geylang"" (""1,000 more cops needed to boost force: Police chief"", The Straits Times, A2)

2. ""Most worry about Geylang is that there is an overt hostility and antagonism towards the police.. All in all, Geylang presents an ecosystem which is complex, which is tinged with a certain criminal undertone."" (""Geylang is more of a worry"", The New Paper, p.8)

The Aztecs enslaved other peoples and forced them to pay tribute in the form of human sacrifice. 
A few centuries ago, China indiscriminately massacred Dzungars, 80% of them were wiped out and nearly all of their land/culture were gone and replaced. 
Much of Southern Africa was dominated by Pigmy, Khoi, and San peoples that were almost entirely wiped out by Bantus.
Just look up a list of the largest genocides and you’ll see that the West doesn’t stand out in this regard.

[“Nonetheless, prison conditions are still inhumane and violate many international standards. Inmates spend 23 hours a day inside their cells. They must sleep on the floor; their access to media, work or recreational activities is restricted. Caning is a common sanction, imposed upon inmates who commit aggravated prison offences.”](https://www.prison-insider.com/countryprofile/prisons-singapore)",2021-01-19 01:12:04,109

And, of course, all of this either costs the taxpayers more over time (in countries with public healthcare) or economically breaks the person affected and possibly their family too, and depending on how badly broken they are, *still* costs the taxpayers if they’re so broke that they end up on either the state or government public healthcare programs (in the US).

All clubs are alcohol focused cause that's pretty much the only option. And no, the punishment for buying or possessing drugs isn't death, the authorities don't really care about small fry recreational drug users. They target traffickers and dealers and people who possess huge amounts. I have a friend who's about to be released (yay!) after 5 years in prison for possession of a variety (yup, not just one type) of drugs. Whilst awaiting trial, he was sent to rehab. So don't believe the fearmongering from foreign journalists who don't have in depth knowledge of what truly goes on in the country.

 Anyway, I'm pretty sure the police knows which clubs/parties they'll find recreational drug users and if they wanted to arrest anyone at any point, they would've done so. So far, I haven't seen anyone getting arrested in any club. But that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I know people who've been to prison for either possession, consumption, dealing. Depending on the quantity and type of drug they had on them at the time, the sentence is anywhere between 12 months to... well, years. These people are also educated, functional, intelligent people who go on to lead normal lives after release. There's nothing wrong with a little fun now and then, and the war on drugs needs to end. 

With all that said, drugs are very expensive in Singapore and really not worth doing, considering the risk. But $50 for a pill that'll give you euphoria for hours vs $50 for 3 drinks, I'm sure most would choose the former if there were no consequences.",2021-01-19 07:49:18,254

Pale skin and big eyes have been a standard of beauty in Asia for thousand of years. The ""pale skin"" that's a standard of beauty in our countries is a lot whiter than white people's, funnily (and you guys tan on top of that, we avoid sun).

Our declining birth rates are not going to have much impact until about 2060, and even by 2100 we will still account for almost 3 times the world's population you will be. If you add to this Southeast Asian that's 6-7 times the population.

""Turns out, the CDC says that 61,000 number is an estimate. If you count flu deaths the way we now count COVID-19 deaths, the actual number of reported flu deaths is only about 3,000-15,000 a year – making the other figure a drastic overcount – which is why Faust says the comparison between the flu and COVID-19 should never be made.""

992,A British man who snuck out of his Ritz-Carlton hotel room to see his fiancée while in quarantine in Singapore faces up to 6 months in jail,2021-01-18 09:46:25,"I suggest you ignore him. He is known on r/singapore as a master practitioner of r/enlightenedcentrism and authoritarian apologetics, to the extent of making up irrelevant strawmen.

As a Singaporean that identifies as centre-left, I will tell you the country has a regressive, anti-intellectual stand towards drugs, capital punishment and corporal punishment. It is a huge blind spot of an administration that crows about its technocratic, evidence-based policymaking. It is founded on the dubious assumption that extant research and case studies on failed drug wars are fundamentally irrelevant to the Singaporean experience (as an island city-state), and that a drug war can not just be won, but is desirable. And also that harsh punishments are something demanded by the majority of the populace - ignoring that fact that reverence of authority and a retributive streak were socially engineered by the government.

That said, some of this apologism, I think is a symptom of overcorrection. Tired, Orientalist caricatures have not kept up with the social development of Singapore (eg. the whole chewing gum thing), and there is therefore a desire to leap in the country's defense. Hell, they were caricatures even when they first emerged. Flawed, yes, but to have a realistic image of when and where torture and brutality happens.

Progressive activism is also viewed as a neo-colonialist enterprise by the West by too much of the population. The legacy of colonialism is fraught in this region. There is much trauma. To some extent the government has cultivated this trauma to their advantage to malign progressive activism, especially when such activism first gained traction in global culture through discourses in ex-colonial powers in the West. Even if there *is* a homegrown tradition in progressive causes.",2021-01-18 20:44:25,279
993,A British man who snuck out of his Ritz-Carlton hotel room to see his fiancée while in quarantine in Singapore faces up to 6 months in jail,2021-01-18 09:46:25,"I mean sure. If you want to pretend that Singapore executes and canes literally everyone who does something wrong or illegal. 

There is of course a more complex view to take like the fact Singapore has a lot of the basic necessities really nailed. Housing is subsidised for almost every citizen who wants to buy into government housing ( I own one with my wife. It's a flat. It's great and is actually designed to make it possible to own a home. Singaporeans will debate the benefits and cons of HDB due to its 99 year lease system but compared to back home... I don't think id ever have been able to peruse being a designer and still get to own a home in a city that I can find work )

The food is subsidised, local hawker culture is some of the tastiest and cheapest food around. Nothing compares to it in the UK. The idea that you can go out everyday and it's cheaper to eat and sit down with family and friends than to eat at home (unless super frugal) still blows my mind. 

The national insurance equivalent, CPF is usable for more than just your eventual pension. You can use it for medical bills ( on top of already subsidised healthcare. Albeit as someone who suffers from a lot of health issues I do miss the NHS ), you can use it to pay for your home loan and your employer has to match you monthly contribution as well. 

Education is some of the best in the world, the school rankings here leave me feeling stupid as hell when I meet kids who are in 'not as good' schools who are still brighter and more educated than I could ever say I was at that age. Albeit that this comes with the cost of extreme child stress, which is the problem Singapore is now trying to work out how to address. Maybe a bit slower than it should be...

I think Singapore just looked at a lot of the things that make crime common, you know... poverty and access to basic needs. 

I'm a big old SNP voting lefty, so take all this as you will. I just feel like if the UK gov actually wanted to be like Singapore, I hope the low tax bit isn't the thing they take. I hope it's the subsidised housing, the food support etc etc.",2021-01-18 18:55:46,394

>**The law creates a presumption of trafficking for certain threshold amounts**, e.g. 30 grams of [cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)). It also creates a presumption that a person possesses drugs if he possesses the keys to a premises containing the drugs, and that ""Any person found in or escaping from any place or premises which is proved or presumed to be used for the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been smoking or administering a controlled drug in that place or premises."" Thus, one runs the risk of arrest for drug use by simply being in the company of drug users. The law also allows officers to search premises and individuals, without a [search warrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant), if he ""reasonably suspects that there is to be found a controlled drug or article liable to seizure"".

Kind of dishonest to pretend like they don't execute you for possession when they do, they just redefine ""trafficking"" to mean ""possession of a certain amount, whether or not they actually...uh...*possess* the drugs.""

Tell that to every fucking person whose parents and friends are dead because of COVID.

 I couldn't give a fuck if you told me you had covid or know people who have had covid and did not have many ill effects, because I know perfectly nice young people who stayed isolated and only went out to get groceries and still got Covid because of these very people who break the law. Now one of them is dead and a few can't even taste anything for god knows how long.

This guy met the love of his life ILLEGALLY, it was stated clearly when AND before we landed in Singapore that we are being isolated for other people's safety. Its not for our families, but for people that can't fight the virus as well as we can. Are you telling me that he so desperately needed to see his fiancé that he had to break the law and possibly infect a whole slew of people who have already followed the rules and are now enjoying this ""freedom"" that you say has been stolen? He couldn't even wait the same 2 weeks that every single visitor and returning citizen endured because he was selfish and couldn't wait, jeopardising people's safety in the process? Personally I think he should be kicked the fuck out of the country for not adhering to the rules, which we already have done to expatriates breaching the quarantine rules. 

It's exactly due to this ""muh freedom/rights"" bullshit that idiots like you spew which is why the COVID situation is so fucking terrible in other countries now.

Every year thousands of drug users get arrested in Singapore. The vast vast majority of them get rehab if it's a first offense, the rest get jail time. What's the point of going through all the trouble of creating rehab centers, of jailing people, of making the 15 gram distinction, of creating rebuttable legal presumptions, if the intent is just to execute drug users? Shouldn't Singapore be executing 2000 people a year instead of 3, if all they wanted was for drug users to die, to ""save face"" as you say?

I just don't get the logic here.

The case against capital and corporal punishment - in general beyond drug trafficking - is just as strong as the case against cannabis. And nowhere in my post did I equate drugs of different harm to each other. Saying that the drug policy is uniformly regressive, as are its punishments, is not the same as equating potential of damage of cannabis vs opioids or meth. It just means that the gradations should be preserved, but the punishment (and other aspects of justice like rehabilitation) should be relooked.

>I think you underestimate the activist and grassroots capabilities of Singaporeans as a whole, and paint it with a very Western brush.

The topic was regarding a man who is going to be jailed for breaking strict quarantine and visiting his fiance in the same building. It's completely fair for people to contribute to this discussion who both agree with and disagree with the authorities response. Your attempts to remove me from this discussion is amusing though.

First thing to note is that you are working under the assumption that these laws save lives. I have shown you evidence that they don't, and they are largely detrimental. Are you willing to even consider the opportunity cost involved? The lockdowns on a global scale are very literally going to result in massive deaths in poorer nations due to starvation, and you don't think that the scale and scope is comparable?

You are working off of the false premise that ""if it only saves one life it is worth it"" but you selectively ignore all of the data that shows this is quote the opposite. And if that is true then shouldn't we ban everything, literally anything can cause harm. Forget about seatbelt laws, let's ban cars all together. My questions are where do you draw the line and what's the appropriate balance. You are allowed to have a different opinion, but the more you defer to government to choose where that line is you better believe they will keep moving that line year after year, and crisis after crisis. Not to mention, once they have that level of control, how can you then continue to even believe the information they are providing you with? We all know that China has kept the real death numbers hidden, so which governments are open and transparent and which aren't?

Lastly, stop giving about ours to island nations that have the pandemic under control, there is an inherent advantage geographically that is doing far more work than any government response.",2021-01-19 02:22:26,315

If a significant proportion of the population don’t get vaccinated, we start to see a resurgence in previously controlled diseases, but at their core, vaccines are still essentially selfish - people get them primarily to protect themselves. 

Masks are similar in the sense that they require herd compliance to be effective, but not to the same degree - the protection a mask offers the individual wearing it is pretty minimal. It’s value is in preventing droplets becoming airborne, which is generally more of a benefit to other people (at least for the strips of cloth worn by the average shopper). 

The difference is, the general population aren’t really affected by antivaxxers. The fact that they’ve been vaccinated themselves protects them. It still significantly increases the risk to the vulnerable who can’t have a vaccine, but the vaccinated majority severely limits the ability for it to spread. 

That’s not yet the case with Covid. Antimaskers put everybody else at risk every time they enter an enclosed space without a mask. If they have it, they can easily spread it to 2-3 people in every shop they visit. If one of those are staff, or somebody who works closely with many others, that one trip to Tesco can easily start a wave that infects literally thousands.

If we had a reliable way to confirm actual, valid, exemptions, that number would probably be small enough to be acceptable. Unfortunately, the vast majority of antimaskers are perfectly capable of wearing a mask, they’re just being dickheads for the sake of rebellion. And I don’t have a lot of faith in those kind of dickheads to be following the other rules, like not mixing household or not going to Tesco after a positive test.",2021-01-19 05:28:21,312

As an outbreak grows, the responsibility lies with the authority in charge of that reason. When it's a lab, it's the company, when it expands to that district, it's the district authority, when it becomes the city, the city authority etc. etc. etc.

Which is it?

Either there is responsibility for an entire chain of events, or there is only responsibility for the initial event in a chain of events and the rest of the people in that chain are responsible for the following actions?",2021-01-19 01:48:09,74

I do know the point you are making it's that humans should be allowed to selfishly do what they want risking others for their own small gratification with zero consequences. And I think that's a bullshit attitude and exactly what I'm calling out. 

If everyone was held more accountable for their own actions a lot of countries would be in a lot better place and have a lot less death.",2021-01-19 01:57:54,75

And you can't really quantify it with transmission reports because people aren't honest, and we aren't tracing backwards.
