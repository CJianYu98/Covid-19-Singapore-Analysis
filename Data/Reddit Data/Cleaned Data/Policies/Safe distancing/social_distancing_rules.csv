> ""Large crowds had gathered at the outlet for a product launch on Dec 4, despite repeated advisories by public enforcement agencies on crowd management,"" said the agencies.

> 

> The suspension will last until Dec 14.

> During this period, the Foot Locker outlet is not allowed to conduct physical retail activities but may continue to continue selling products online.

> ""STB and Enterprise Singapore are also engaging Foot Locker Singapore on the measures it will take for future product launches, including the potential cessation of all such physical launches at Foot Locker locations across Singapore,"" said the agencies.

> Retail businesses are ""strongly advised"" to hold virtual or online sales, instead of organising physical product launches that may attract large crowds, said STB and ESG.

> 

> ""The Government takes a serious view of any breach in safe management measures, and will not hesitate to take action against individuals and businesses that do not comply with them, including fines and temporary store closures.""

Obviously gathering of any large groups is highly irresponsible especially in the midst of an active pandemic.... right? Evidently so in the case of this footlocker incident. But can i also point ur attention to another large gathering taking place every sunday night for the past months? Yes, its all our army personnel booking into camp. Im talking of upwards of hundreds of people queuing where social distancing is just no longer viable. To make matters worse? This same hundreds of people will all eventually touch the same finger print scanner with no form of decontaminating. I mean army personels are immune to covid right?",2020-12-07 06:01:42,121
