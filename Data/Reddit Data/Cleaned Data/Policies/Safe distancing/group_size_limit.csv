To be honest, look at the streets. Even with the 5 person rule, you can easily sight violations of this rule. Ultimately, the government has to relax the rules at some point in time and the virus will not disappear. We can't keep having overly strict rules when the infection rate is now quite low. 

For the self, we can do what needs to be done to protect ourselves. Wear a mask, wash your hands and avoid touching your face.",2020-10-05 13:00:18,91

> SINGAPORE - There can be more easing of pandemic control measures, including the limit of five people for social gatherings, if everyone can work together and keep their guard up, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament on Monday (Oct 5).

> Allowing larger groups to meet would allow bigger families or groups of friends to meet and have meals together, he said in responding to questions from several MPs on the loosening of Covid-19 rules here.

> Singapore has gradually eased some of its pandemic control measures over the past few months, leading some to question when the cap of five people for social activities - especially when eating out together - would be lifted.

> Mr Gan said on Monday: ""We are particularly concerned about dining as we need to remove our masks so as to eat and drink, but we tend to also talk at the same time. The risk is considerably higher than activities which we can keep our masks on and maintain a safe distance.""

> He pointed out that Singapore has already made big steps towards restoring economic and social activities - in a safe manner.

> For instance, from Sept 28, more employees who have been working from home were allowed to return to their workplaces.

> But in order to keep workplaces safe and minimise crowding, such employees are to continue to work from home for at least half their working time, with no more than 50 per cent of such employees at the workplace at any point in time.

> Work-related events, including conferences, seminars, and meetings, have also been allowed to resume with a 50-person limit to reduce the risk of transmission.

> The authorities have also taken steps to support the resumption of a few very targeted and specific areas, said Mr Gan.

> These include the increase in group size limits for key life events such as weddings and religious activities to 100 persons, but in multiple zones or time slots of at most 50 persons each to limit potential risk exposure.

> The Government had also earlier allowed the resumption of physical exercise classes in common community spaces, and an increase in capacity for cinemas and leisure attractions such as the Singapore Zoo and Bird Park.

> Related Story Places of worship slowly open up to more worshippers as Covid-19 rules eased

> Museums and libraries have also reopened, and small-scale live performances are being trialled to prepare Singapore to eventually be able to resume such activities safely, added Mr Gan.

> He added that the authorities here are being careful in reopening society, as they have learnt from the experiences of other countries.

> ""When restrictions are lifted prematurely, or too hastily, a resurgence of cases may occur, resulting in partial reimposition of restrictions. On the other hand, it is not sustainable to maintain tight restrictions for a prolonged period which will severely impact our economy and our lives,"" he said.

> So the Government has taken a carefully calibrated approach in moving towards phase three, and will share more details in the coming weeks.

> Minister for Education Lawrence Wong also said earlier on Monday that his ministry is studying how to resume more activities, and will share more details when ready.

> But Mr Gan cautioned: ""The low number of community cases currently is not accidental but has come about due to our collective hard work and sacrifices. Even as we move towards Phase Three, the new normal will be different from what we were used to in the pre-Covid days.""

> He added: ""As overseas travel restrictions are progressively eased and more activities resume, it has become even more critical that each of us plays our part to exercise social responsibility and adhere to the safe management measures, in order to keep our family and friends safe.""

Ask to the workers in the restaurant business or entertainment if this is the best of both worlds.

The cases will spike up for sure, but as long as they are manageable from an ICU perspective and hospital load, we are more than fine.
We are not in a situation similar to Europe, and we do not have a lot of Europeans freedom, which makes it easier for us to managing the pandemic without keep killing certain industries more than how we already do.

If someone wants to say something about the hospital workers who would be overloaded: my girlfriend works in an hospital as a nurse, and she is quite an advocate of the same relaxation I speak about.

Likewise with social distance. But the group limit is much easier to enforce than social distance.

If the limit is now increase from 5 to say 50 and the social distance is still applied, technically FnB is supposed to keep a 1m distance between this group of 50 with another group. But there is a loophole now. FnB can then just sit 2 groups of 20 and 25 (or n groups as long the sum of people in the n groups are less than 50) without any regard on the 1m social distance. FnB could still claim that this 2 groups are actually the same group.
