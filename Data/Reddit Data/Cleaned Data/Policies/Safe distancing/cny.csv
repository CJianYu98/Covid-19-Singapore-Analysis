7,"Away from their families, Malaysians in Singapore brace themselves for a quiet Chinese New Year",2021-01-25 17:37:34,"Not cutting onions here but honestly not returning to your homeland during the festive period to see your relatives is just saddening on all levels.

Even worse when you cannot return to your homeland and hearing news that you lost one of your close relatives at Malaysia just before the festive season. You feel like you lost everything in life and having a heavy breakdown that could go on for weeks or months.

To all Malaysians who are unable to return to your homeland during this festive season and also some on this sub, treasure your loved ones and keep them in contact every now and then cause you will never know until when they will be around in this world.

Stay safe and cheer up!",2021-01-25 20:00:02,126

The fight began on 25th day of fasting.My mum put on the family Whatsapp group to make a list(2 person each day).Then all her siblings started fighting who visit on 1st day when you have the whole month to celebrate.

Anyway my dad suggested to used Zoom since my mum siblings can't be pleased.

(1) Check everyone's temperature before letting them into the house.

(2) Continue to wear mask and sit further apart during the gathering.

(3) Make sure everyone washes their hands before eating.

(4) Serve individual portions and don't share food, and minimise talking during eating.  Also try to seat everyone further apart, if possible.

(5) Continue to keep in touch with everyone who has visited your house and whose house you have visited for two weeks.  At the first sign of someone having flu-like symptoms, quickly inform everyone, and make sure everyone in your household monitor their health carefully.  Importantly, avoid socialising to minimise spread to the larger community, until you are certain that there is minimal risk.

So, perhaps the weigh up for your family could be between, on the one hand, risking infection as well as following all the lechey restrictions listed above, and on the other hand, keeping everyone safe and don't have to deal with the lechey restrictions listed above.",2021-01-20 21:29:24,189

To them, CNY is a big deal because it used to be one of the few occasions in their youth when they could indulge themselves. When so many of your loved ones have passed away, you don't really care about the dangers of catching COVID-19 

May I suggest that we indulge them for just one day? The rest of us will just have to be extra-vigilant and give up on socializing so that our elders can get their socializing. As a young person, you can wear a face mask throughout visits and wash your hands. Stay home unless absolutely necessary.

BTW, there is a bit of data buried in AZ's vaccine trial in South Africa. Essentially, prior infections to the OG SARS-CoV-2 strain provides no protection to the newer SA's strain. This means vaccines for the OG strain won't be effective for the new one.

So we have 2 ways to go from here:

\- Lockdowns and border controls become the norms or

\- Update the vaccines every year and hope that whoever makes the vaccines guess the right upcoming strain. We guess wrong flu vaccines all the time.

So while I get anxious about the sort of things you detail here, it's important to balance things out. Governments know that not everyone will strictly follow rules. They know the extent to which their particular population will tend to comply (fortunately, here, we're pretty compliant).

These factors are already built into policy and are part of the risk management.

The problem is not a policy issue. The problem is how the policies are translated on the ground - in other words, we need to see if there are lapses that have occurred that allowed the virus to break through our defenses. That is the part that no matter how much government involvement you have, you can never be sure that no breach in protocol won’t occur. 

Ultimately, the government can only lead, but it is the people who enact these policies or procedures that have to ensure it’s all followed. These include the everyday people who need to follow social distancing policies, shn rules, reporting sick guidelines. It’s like driving a car, government tell you what the speed limit is but if you choose to speed and kena accident, whose fault? By all means grab the pitch fork but make sure you point it at the right person.

155,I'm ready to see COVID-19 cases here spike after CNY,2021-02-07 21:35:26,"you can list all the airport related acquired infections but do you even know what you are trying to imply here? the common link is the location - the airport. the government does not run the airport, changi airport group does. its more likely that the problem will come in lapses from operation than lapses in immigration policy, which is where the government comes in. changi airport group is not the government.

and if youre one of those whose intent is to say to limit all entry to foreigners, i beseech you to consider other factors other than covid numbers alone. entire economies will go bust if we do so. not just tourism but other economies that rely on foreign labour. remember that Covid is here for the long run, not just another year or two. how long you want to keep the seclusion before opening up the borders again?

>Also, it's easy to sit on a high horse and deride people for not ""following guidelines"". All I'm saying is, stop being so quick to bash Singaporeans just because they bend a few rules here and there.

allow me to hit the ball back into your court. it's easy to sit on a high horse and deride the government for not being prudent when you only make considerations upon a small window of factors. 

and also, please hold everyone to the same, equal standards - if the government must be prudent in its decision making, so must the people. can't ""bash singaporeans"" just because they decide to relax a bit? don't ""bash the government"" because they also relax. 

and don't get me wrong, i hold the govt of singapore to the same high standards i hold the people of singapore. if they're shit, i'll be the first to raise my pitchforks. but to say that the people should not shoulder blame for becoming complacent, for not sticking to the same standards we could and did uphold the past year, is the start of a slide down a slippery slope. this growing ""superiority complex of the collective people"" idea needs to be kept in check, otherwise it can lead to our own downfall. recognizing our own problems and shortcomings is a strength, not accepting our own faults is a weakness. and especially in times of a crisis like we are in now, a weakness like this only spells greater trouble for the future.",2021-02-10 01:31:49,392

>It's almost as if he wants cases to spike so he can tell us ""I told you so""

I see nothing in the text that gives that impression. OP is merely stating a possibility, and a warning of what could come if we get complacent, which, according to the article he linked, seems to be the case.

Are you sure you're not projecting?",2021-02-08 15:02:49,68
157,I'm ready to see COVID-19 cases here spike after CNY,2021-02-07 21:35:26,"Yes I'm sure. Are you sure you are not by accusing me of that? 

""I'm ready for cases to spike after CNY"", I don't see how it comes across anything other than smug. Why not a simple ""I'm worried that cases might spike""? Isn't that more neutral than whatever he used?",2021-02-08 15:15:37,46
158,I'm ready to see COVID-19 cases here spike after CNY,2021-02-07 21:35:26,"Yeah, well, you're entitled to your opinion, even if it's wrong.

I think it's oversensitive of you to assume that OP is on a high horse and that he is smug because he's ready for cases to spike after CNY. I am also expecting a spike, because people simply will not follow instructions if they're not monitored.

This is the same reason why we need the safe distancing people sitting at the entrance of every location. Because people can't be trusted to do the right thing. See the Chinatown situation, for example. 

Another example: people who will not use the safe entry if the shops themselves don't employ a person to stand at the entrance and force people to do it. I have seen many a person just walk into the shop without scanning. Sure, I try to ask them to do it, but I can't catch every person. It's personal responsibility, which, unfortunately, a lot of Singaporeans lack. This is why we need to be nannied. 

This is why I (and probably OP) have no faith that the capacity limit will be followed during CNY. Or the house visitation limit, for that matter. It simply boils down to a lack of personal responsibility.",2021-02-08 15:29:53,195
