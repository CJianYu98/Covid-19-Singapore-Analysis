No biggie because it's worth the risk for some. The price they pay is small compared to the negative externalities that others incur.

Slightly more people can go to attractions. There's a higher mall/shop capacity but it seems to me that malls stopped limiting capacity before Phase 2 ended. Other than that, Phase 3 just allows for larger religious congregations, ceremonies, and live performances.

There need to be an increasing heavier penalty for people to understand it‚Äôs better off if they take responsibility for their own actions, sooner rather than later. Some people are not capable of behaving socially responsibly voluntarily, hence rules and penalty are required.
