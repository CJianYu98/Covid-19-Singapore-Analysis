That will really only be possible when a vaccine or drug is available.

6,Months before phase 3 can begin: Lawrence Wong,2020-06-16 10:35:50,"Singapore already had an imported case within the first week of Phase 1. Beijing found the virus on a cutting board because of food imports. New Zealand just got their first imported case after 25 days of zero cases. 

who knows how many more imported cases there will be (or worse, another cluster) once Phase 2 opens.

ultimately you can't stop this virus from spreading no matter how hard you try, you just have to hope a vaccine will be out before everyone gets infected.",2020-06-16 13:25:27,81

24,Months before phase 3 can begin: Lawrence Wong,2020-06-16 10:35:50,">Beijing found the virus on a cutting board because of food imports.

I'd be cautious repeating this as it is highly unlikely that this was an imported case - most likely source would be a local seller or buyer who had contact with the board. 

""""At present, it is hard to determine the infection source in the market,"" Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.

""We cannot conclude that salmon is the source of infection just because novel coronavirus was detected on a chopping board of a seller,"" the expert said, adding that the chopping board could be contaminated by infected owner or guests, or other products that carried the virus.""

""However, the virus can survive on the surface of an object for hours to a few days, and chilled salmon was transported by air in a low temperature, under which condition ""it is theoretically possible for the virus to survive, but the possibility is low,"" said Zhong.""

Why? I'm more hopeful because so many people are trying to make cures. The hard truth is that most experimental medical treatments don't work the first time. Even if a given treatment will eventually work (some will never work), it may need years of refining. But with so many attempts globally, there's a higher chance that at least some researchers create a working vaccine/treatment for COVID.",2020-06-16 23:09:12,114

&#x200B;

>full incubation period? and the likely-hood of mutation for longer incubation period? 

IIRC 5 days is the mean and 14 days will capture 98%. There were some outliners in China who went longer. SARS-CoV-2 also appears to be a stable virus that has not mutated much so far that there is hope a single vaccine will work against all the strains.",2020-06-16 18:11:12,76
