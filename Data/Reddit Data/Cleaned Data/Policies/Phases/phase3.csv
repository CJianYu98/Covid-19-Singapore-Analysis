Nobody is going to be taking the rules more seriously than they currently are, unless cases spike dramatically.

>First, the TraceTogether programme must have a participation rate of about 70 per cent, up from the current rate of less than 50 per cent.

>Second, there must be an overall sense of compliance with safe management measures.

>""We do __need to see Singaporeans taking today's measures seriously__ because if people are not even responsible enough to uphold (them), then going for further relaxation is going to be very risky.""

>The authorities will assess this condition through safe distancing ambassadors, who will continue to observe the situation on the ground at such places as restaurants and parks, he said.

>Finally, Singapore's testing capabilities must be sufficient, an aspect in which the country is ""proceeding well"", he added.

>""We do have the testing capabilities in place, so we just need the contact tracing - TraceTogether - to be up. We need compliance with safe management measures to also be up there, and then with all three indicators showing the green light, we would be in a position to enter phase three.

What's the limiting factor here?

>The second point. The one which has no quantifiable target.

I'm actually starting to get worried that the more they try to browbeat people by using something that we can't control (no phase 3 unless you collect tokens which you are not allowed to collect), people will start to actively act out against the current measures ""since we're not gonna get phase 3 anyway, do for what"".

> SINGAPORE: Singapore may be able to enter Phase 3 before the end of the year “if all the stars are aligned”, said Minister for Education Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Nov 10).

> Responding to a question at a multi-ministry task force press conference on when Singapore may be able to enter Phase 3 , Mr Wong said the timing will be “contingent” on individuals doing their part.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> In particular, he said, Singapore needs to see higher participation in the TraceTogether programme, as well as continued cooperation and compliance with all prevailing safe distancing measures.

> ""So if all the stars are aligned, we might be able to enter Phase 3 before the end of the year,"" said Mr Wong.

> ""There’s still some time before the end of the year. I do not know whether all the stars can be aligned, but we continue to monitor and we will give you updates if so.”

> As Singapore gradually transitions into Phase 3, it can also expect the number of its COVID-19 cases in the community to rise, said Mr Wong.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> With more activities resuming, community cases may rise “perhaps to the low teens, maybe even to the 20s, or upwards in the 30s”, said Mr Wong.

> “We have to be mentally prepared for that and be ready to ensure that even if the local cases in the community were to rise, they do not form large clusters that are out of control. The key to doing that is to step up our testing capabilities which we are doing and now we are making testing more accessible to everyone,” he added.

> While one case in the community currently “may not have much of a chance” to cause a large COVID-19 cluster, there will be “a lot more” activities in the community when Singapore enters Phase 3.

> “People dining in groups of eight, weddings of larger sizes, places of worship with larger gatherings, events with a larger (number of) people coming together. With all of these activities in Phase 3, the risks of clusters forming will go up. It is inevitable, as we have seen in countries everywhere around the world.”

> Advertisement

> On top of strengthening testing capacities, contact tracing capabilities must also be strengthened through the expansion of SafeEntry and TraceTogether, he added.

> “If we all cooperate and do our part, we can move confidently towards Phase 3. And even in Phase 3, ensure that the reopening of our borders and the resumption of activities do not result in large classes forming again, because all of us do not want to have to go through another circuit breaker.”
