Key advantage is battery life and privacy.

The battery will last many months before replacement is needed.

The data stays encrypted only with you. There are no complicatged cotnrols.

Just switch on once - that's it.

28,ft9uj8q,t3_gy9a1x,"The reason why people are skeptical about government tracking is because 1. Lack of transparency and 2. Misuse of the data. 

For 1, not saying that Sg govt has done enough, but they are already relatively transparent and increasing transparency is possible, so it is not a unsolvable limitation to government tracking. 

2, also unlikely in Singapore given past policing - you may disagree with the criteria for action, but it is fair. 

Data leaks in this specific case is also unlikely if the device only collects proximity data which what was is planned for the device.

I also find the reaction quite the irrational overreaction when people can agree with giving up a significant degree of personal freedom by staying at home to keep the virus at bay or using a contact tracing app but not agree to a tracking device. Especially so when nation-wide tracking may allow people to move more freely since clusters can be tracked more easily.

31,ftbc0vd,t3_gy9a1x,"I don't get why people are so upset by this....

Everyone is complaining that the MRT, the buses, the supermarkets are too crowded and they fear getting infected. So obviously you would want to be contacted if you were in close proximity to a confirmed case.

Now how should the government trace you. Cameras/CCTV are hard to monitor and time consuming to trace people as you have to either hope they look directly into a camera and hope you can match the face in a database or you need to trace them all the way home, find out who they are and then contact them. This is not only inefficient, but costly as well.

So the best choice is tracing through an app or through a wearable device. Firstly you can't really make an app obligatory. Even if it is highly unlikely, what about people who don't have a phone? Does the government buy you a phone then? It's also hard for enforcers to check if people have downloaded the app. Additionally, if you contact trace through an app it sets a precedent for the government to track you through your cellphone. People such as Edward Snowden have warned that apps such as contact tracing apps will be useful during crisis, but will remain a part of life even after the pandemic. That's when people privacy is really violated. For people who aren't tech savvy (all our aunty and uncles) who don't know much about allowing location data access and such, this will really breach their privacy. A wearable device is a good option because you know when they are tracking you, and after the crisis you can throw out the device or return it. There's no fear of the government still tracking you. Enforcers can also easily see if you are wearing your device without having to stop you and talk to you.

Overall I think the wearable device is a good option. Where are you going that you don't want the government to know? Your friends house? A party? If that's why you don't want to wear the device then you are the biggest problem we have right now. Wearing the device would be as much hassle as remembering to wear a mask when you leave the house. After coronavirus passes you can ditch the device and chuck it out or give it back. Simple.

Edit: I really like my privacy, but I don't care if the government knows where I'm going in these times. Wow, I go out for my daily jog and go out once a week to get groceries at the nearest supermarket. Even if the data was hacked it's not useful. Giving up this tiny bit of data is such a small thing compared to knowing if you've been in close proximity to a COVID-19 case. And like I said, after the crisis you can throw out the device, or stop wearing it. If it's an app then only tech savvy people will truly know if the app has been completely deleted or if it's still secretly tracking you.

Edit 2: If you guys think that somehow wearing this device is a huge step up from what the government is already doing to track you, then I have some bad news for you.",t3_gy9a1x,2020-06-08 07:09:10,Fearghas2011,-14,Singapore's move to introduce wearable devices for contact tracing sparks public outcry,t3_gy9a1x,455,gy9a1x,https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapores-move-to-introduce-wearable-devices-for-contact-tracing-sparks-public-outcry/,208,2020-06-07 17:38:44,0.95,"['get', 'peopl', 'upset', 'everyon', 'complain', 'mrt', 'buse', 'supermarket', 'crowd', 'fear', 'get', 'infect', 'obvious', 'would', 'want', 'contact', 'close', 'proxim', 'confirm', 'case', 'govern', 'trace', 'hard', 'monitor', 'time', 'consum', 'trace', 'peopl', 'either', 'hope', 'look', 'directli', 'camera', 'hope', 'match', 'face', 'databas', 'need', 'trace', 'way', 'home', 'find', 'contact', 'ineffici', 'costli', 'well', 'best', 'choic', 'trace', 'app', 'wearabl', 'devic', 'firstli', 'ca', 'realli', 'make', 'app', 'obligatori', 'even', 'highli', 'unlik', 'peopl', 'phone', 'govern', 'buy', 'phone', 'also', 'hard', 'enforc', 'check', 'peopl', 'download', 'app', 'addit', 'contact', 'trace', 'app', 'set', 'preced', 'govern', 'track', 'cellphon', 'peopl', 'edward', 'snowden', 'warn', 'app', 'contact', 'trace', 'app', 'use', 'crisi', 'remain', 'part', 'life', 'even', 'pandem', 'peopl', 'privaci', 'realli', 'violat', 'peopl', 'tech', 'savvi', 'aunti', 'uncl', 'know', 'much', 'allow', 'locat', 'data', 'access', 'realli', 'breach', 'privaci', 'wearabl', 'devic', 'good', 'option', 'know', 'track', 'crisi', 'throw', 'devic', 'return', 'fear', 'govern', 'still', 'track', 'enforc', 'also', 'easili', 'see', 'wear', 'devic', 'without', 'stop', 'talk', 'overal', 'think', 'wearabl', 'devic', 'good', 'option', 'go', 'want', 'govern', 'know', 'friend', 'hous', 'parti', 'want', 'wear', 'devic', 'biggest', 'problem', 'right', 'wear', 'devic', 'would', 'much', 'hassl', 'rememb', 'wear', 'mask', 'leav', 'hous', 'coronaviru', 'pass', 'ditch', 'devic', 'chuck', 'give', 'back', 'simpl', 'edit', 'realli', 'like', 'privaci', 'care', 'govern', 'know', 'go', 'time', 'wow', 'go', 'daili', 'jog', 'go', 'week', 'get', 'groceri', 'nearest', 'supermarket', 'even', 'data', 'hack', 'use', 'give', 'tini', 'bit', 'data', 'small', 'thing', 'compar', 'know', 'close', 'proxim', 'case', 'like', 'said', 'crisi', 'throw', 'devic', 'stop', 'wear', 'app', 'tech', 'savvi', 'peopl', 'truli', 'know', 'app', 'complet', 'delet', 'still', 'secretli', 'track', 'edit', 'guy', 'think', 'somehow', 'wear', 'devic', 'huge', 'step', 'govern', 'alreadi', 'track', 'bad', 'news']","I don't get why people are so upset by this....

This could work exact same way [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/gpgv.html#Examples-5) and [OpenBSD's Signify](https://man.openbsd.org/signify.1#EXAMPLES) do.

Google **has** the authority to unilaterally add this to the spec, Android, or its environment; they could decide to support reproducible builds for a trivial effort. They could even store sha512 mappings of all APKs in their store with a corresponding signature, so that downloading a valid APK from *anywhere* would verify appropriately.

The fact they don't is an indication of maliciousness.

> Roughly how long maybe, but not the exact time, plus only up to a limited amount of days.

The only ""maybe"" is if the devices register each other at all. How exact the time granularity will be ultimately depends on how often the IDs are rotated. If you do it too seldom, you can trace people passively because it becomes much easier to tie IDs to individuals. Typically it's in 5-15 minute increments.

Not with respect to the policy that the article concerns. It does not allow passive/mass surveillance, but specifically concerns the power of officers to compel users to give their data up. Why do I need to say this again?

> Roughly how long maybe, but not the exact time, plus only up to a limited amount of days.

The only ""maybe"" is if the devices register each other at all. How exact the time granularity will be ultimately depends on how often the IDs are rotated. If you do it too seldom, you can trace people passively because it becomes much easier to tie IDs to individuals. Typically it's in 5-15 minute increments.

No, not with respect to the policy in the article, which is what I said in my first response to you, so my goalposts remain steady in place. Don't blame me for your waxing on and on about the same refuted points over and over again.

> I don't think you understand how it works.

Then please explain your take to me so that I can correct you.

In my understanding, users generate ephemeral IDs that are broadcasted over BLE. The IDs are rotated at regular intervals so as to prevent the correlation between users and their used IDs, and only the user's device can derive the sequence of ephemeral IDs used. The devices record broadcasted ephemeral IDs and store them locally on the device. Tracing is enabled by voluntary submission of reports of the seeds used to generate the ephemeral IDs. These reports are then distributed to all users so that they can check whether and when they were in contact with the user by correlating them with their contact log containing ephemeral IDs they've encountered.

Naturally, if an adversary can retrieve both the seeds from which the ephemeral IDs were generated and the contact logs of two users, they can know whether and when the users were in contact.

I suggest reading the DP-3T whitepaper if you want to be able to say ""I don't think you understand how it works"" without talking out of your ass.

> Stupid pedantry.

360,giobubb,t1_gio6o2s,"To keep track of who came into contact with confirmed covid cases, the govt has 2 systems:

1) safe entry: when entering malls and stalls, we must scan a QR code and enter our identity number

2) at first it was an app but then now given as a tictac-box sized token, tracetogether: it actively pings its presence to nearby phones/tokens. Each device is suppose to keep a log of the time and id of each recent device it got pinged. If one is confirmed with covid, their token gets checked to see the list of recently pinged devices that coincide during the duration of the infection. Then it gets checked against the registered database to see who owns that device id. Then the relevant persons get informed to come for a swab


-----

So you can see how the latter can get abused. Many were reluctant to install tracetogether on phone. Hence the tokens.

So recently police have been fiddling on using tracetogether data to locate criminal and/or confirm where suspects were (most probably by comparing with data saved in the device logs of known MOP in the vicinity at the time of the event, or maybe confirm alibi was with suspect)


So ye.


That's pretty sus. Before we know it, we become monitored and social credit score rating based on time spent at home or not at home 🤔


Of course we can trust that the govt, even if not in good faith, will certainly not bother with manpower and resource to track everyone, but if data leaks, or evidence planted meticulously to indict an innocent, that's dangerous.

436,ftrqanr,t3_h7dfw8,"> # Measures to tackle COVID-19 cases in dorms early on were 'insufficient': Teo Chee Hean

> SINGAPORE — Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore’s migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures “turned out to be insufficient”, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

> During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.

> In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date. Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.

> “On 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,” said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.

> “However, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.”

> While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, “no two crises are the same”, Teo said. The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is “a major challenge”, he added.

> On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.

> “But they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines”, he noted.

> The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH’s overall medical support plan.

> Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.

> “The operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak. About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,” he added.

> Teo’s delivery is the third in a series of national speeches by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday. Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing is scheduled next to deliver his speech on Sunday.

> In his speech on “Resilience in a changing external environment”, Teo also spoke at length about Singapore’s efforts in providing community care facilities for patients who have mild or no symptoms.

> “We had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and had started to build them. We accelerated these plans and scaled them up, adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April,” he said.

> At the peak on 12 May, some 20,000 patients were being cared for at community care and similar facilities, with as many as 1,000 are admitted daily, Teo said.

> “This is more than the total number of beds in all our public acute hospitals. We mobilised resources from across our public service, government-linked companies, and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities. Healthcare volunteers stepped forward to help man them,” he stressed.

> “This is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our healthcare system and putting lives at risk.”

> The clear lesson learned during the COVID-19 outbreak is that Singapore needs to plan in peace-time “on facing the unknown, and build deep reserves of people and capabilities, so that when we face a crisis, we can act decisively, and respond flexibly and rapidly”.

> He referred to past challenges in Singapore’s history such as in 1967 when the British announced the withdrawal of their troops from the city-state. With the move, Singapore was poised to lose 20 per cent of its gross domestic product and 70,000 jobs at a time when the population was half of what it is today, Teo said.

> “We are far more resilient today than in 1967, and better positioned to create new markets, businesses, and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.”

> Singapore also rode out the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Asian and global financial crises. “COVID-19 is an even bigger test,” he added.

> The outbreak is the first major crisis for many of the new generation of ministers and civil servants taking the lead in efforts to tackle the situation.

> The ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of their older Cabinet colleagues as well as consulted widely within and outside the government, Teo said.

> He added, “Over the past few months, I have worked very closely with them. We speak daily and exchange views freely. They have stepped up to the task, worked together as a team, and led from the front. This is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore.”

464,funktw4,t1_ful7vjv,"Truth be told, Covid-19 is quite different from SARS, and while I think the government learnt a lot from SARS, we didn't pivot fast enough this time. Covid-19 is a lot more infectious than SARS, which led to the large numbers of infections seen all over the world, as well as in Singapore. 

As for what Minister Jo Teo's did / said, I think the lapses under her ministry, while not directly responsible for Covid-19, did contribute to the rapid spread of the disease amongst our migrant worker population. Had she been more amiable, less arrogant, I think more people would have given her a pass (She seems to be trying for Minister Shanmugam's style, without having his charisma). Covid-19 has really wrecked havoc all over the world. Again, all of the above are my opinions. 

With regards to Ho Ching, I wholeheartedly agree with you. It's embarrassing to see the wife of our PM act in such a childish and classless manner. So far in this crisis, I see PM Lee only when he's giving speeches, but he has been reassuring, and his messages in different languages tailored to the audience. His speeches have been lauded, on reddit, on my facebook feed from my foreign friends, as well as on the news. So, to see Mdm Ho Ching act in such an infantile manner is really disappointing.

Grabbing the data from [a recent report](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-b_16-4.pdf) (when they were still reporting some details of individual cases), the 25th, median and 75th percentile ages are 29, 34, and 39 respectively, compared to a median age of 42 for Singaporeans, so your estimation is quite accurate.

569,fp64svo,t3_gbdjuv,"Some thoughts - given the high level numbers and the disparity between cases in the various categories (dorms only, Singaporeans/PRs, work pass holders, work permit holders etc), I barely pay too much attention anymore to the preliminary high level number that comes out at \~3pm everyday. We have to wait for the detailed updates at night to get a better sense of how the situation is progressing.

In particular, I'm paying close attention to community cases and work permit holders not living in dorms (I'm conservatively assuming these people are still part of the community, but most should be serving 14 day SHNs). I reckon we need to see both community cases only (Singaporeans/PRs + work pass holders) AND community cases + work permit holders not in dorms stay low for at least 2 weeks before we start getting our hopes up. Dorm cases pretty straight forward there - given the tight living conditions and aggressive testing, i reckon we see high numbers for a while more before we start seeing the results of the distancing measures that were implemented about 2 weeks back for the dorms.  


Also - keeping brief track of unlinked cases is also somewhat important. In particular, both the absolute number of unlinked cases on a particular day AND following up the next day or couple to see if those unlinked cases have been linked (they do tend to take a while to link some cases because contact tracing etc is a VERY tough job). This is important because if they can link a specific case to an existing cluster and/or infected person, there is a lower possibility of there being existing further community spread that the authorities don't yet know about. Ideally would like to see those unlinked numbers stay low AND have the authorities constantly being able to link cases on a daily basis (which they have).

when got good news can talk cock about how this is due to good governance by pap. ask ppl to look at countries with bad govt like malaysia or leaders like trump. say its good sg got no free media or multi party goverment to distract pap.   

but if got bad news its somehow its the collective responsibility of all singaporeans. like millions of ppl petitioned manpower ministry to ignore their cramped overcrowded conditions for decades. or if got referendum where ppl voted that josephine teo should listen to dorm/biz owners and just leave rules up to dorm owners. who told govt to dismiss ngo's concerns for dorm conditions for years. 

some human decency should say that give these ppl a decent accommodations. at least army standard bunks with space and furnishing. 

some foresight would show that fw living in cramped conditions and deterred for years to report sick would have been prime target for virus cluster

> SINGAPORE - Cruise ships are being assessed for their feasibility as temporary housing for foreign workers who are recovered from Covid-19 and tested negative for the virus.

> SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius, mid-sized cruise ships operated by Genting Cruise Lines, will be checked for consideration by the Government for factors such as ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures.

> If deemed feasible, the two cruise ships may be used to complement other interim facilities such as Singapore Armed Forces military camps and vacant Housing Board blocks that have been refurbished to house healthy workers.

> By reducing numbers of workers in existing dormitories, health measures can be implemented more effectively, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in a media statement on Friday (April 17) morning.

> Cruise ships are being considered for use as temporary housing as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact, added STB.

> SuperStar Gemini, which arrived from Hong Kong on Friday, is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SuperStar Aquarius may be activated for assessment at a later date.

> If deemed suitable, the two ships may accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers in total.

> STB said that ""if activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times"".

> Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

> Related Story Coronavirus: 3 more foreign worker dormitories declared isolation areas

> Related Story Coronavirus: Floating facilities ready to house healthy foreign workers

> While the spread of the coronavirus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially.

> As of Friday morning, the total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689, which is about 60 per cent of all Singapore's cases.

> There are now a total of 12 dormitories declared as isolation areas where workers at these lodgings must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.

I know our Frontlines in charge of Covid containment is overwhelmed with work but this has to be said:  

**Edit: ignore the first 3 points. Cruise for recovered FW.**  
1.They will do swap test first on those being relocated to these cruise- **but tests are known to have turn out negative initially** so they can still be infected.
   
2.These FW aren’t fully quarantined, **they are still going to work**.  
(Another concern, are we asking FW to continue wearing mask throughout work? again, if not then it’ll obviously be more likely to spread Covid. Perhaps their work already requires them to wear a mask idk.. I’ll just point this out so anyone in the know can work it out so no FW faints doing  labour work because of a suffocating mask whole day.)
   
3. Bad publicity worldwide. Once an outbreak occurs on this cruise(unless it’s contained very well, which is just betting ur luck.)
   
4. We should be applying lockdown for all FW living in crowded/shared dorm for at least 14days to make sure our healthcare doesn’t get strained more.
   
5. Imo, It makes no sense to let our FW continue work during this CB and Dormitory spike. We should solve the crowded dorm issues first, since we currently have community spread going on we shouldn’t react as if FW bringing Covid back to temporary dorm or causing further spread in community isn’t likely. 
   
My suggestion: I don’t know the capacity our country can do to house as many of them separately. But if surveillance is an issue, we can make mid shift shelters and get general public to help monitor via camera(we report to authorities if anyone try to sneak out) hopefully this will help slow the spread and we can get some breather for our frontlines.  
(For the sake of everyone, We will have to endure and work together if rubbish and cleaning or other essentials done by FW is disrupted.)
   
Before *you* start flaming aimlessly. Lockdown and surveillance means, **temporary** build a fenced shelter/tents for few weeks so the dormitory issues doesn’t turn tragic(we will only monitor the fences to make sure no one flout).

Edit: just realised it was for recovered FW, heard on TV and saw the comments hence I didn’t check the article first sorry. But some of my points can be considered.

These workers are one of the bases of your economy, when I see heavy duty workers on construction sites, I rarely see a Singaporean, I see hardworking people that are deemed less because they are not from a higher ""cast"" in the Singaporean society. Sure, make the companies act, but its  YOUR government that is enabling this, don't treat them as not your problem because they are, it's your government allowing this to exist, it's companies contributing to SINGAPOREAN economy that hire these workers. So don't treat as it's not Singapore's problems because it is."
672,fnbzr8x,t3_g0mek9,"I truly believe this is a cumulation of public infrastructure bidding practices, demand for lower cost projects by all parties, high land cost, and lack of innovation in the construction industry both in Singapore and as a whole.

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins.

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be.

739,fnc7rda,t1_fnbzr8x,"Thanks for this reply. Too many Singaporeans ignore the economics of the situation.

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company.

Too many Singaporeans ignore the economics of the situation.

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

They aren't living in inhuman conditions. I doubt they will be fined except for if safe distancing law applies to the dorm supervisors. The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well.

While living conditions were not stellar, they were livable. There were no major issues prior to Covid. So the majority of this outrage is stemming from *distancing issues.*

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

3. Lastly, why must the solution fall on us? Govt sets the law and the market should be left with its own devices to come up with solutions. That is the beauty of capitalism. Maybe if we had more stringent regulations on FW housing then companies will finally trade in hiring worker en masse to buying technology."

812,fncydjo,t1_fnct5u6,"1) Bringing in 10 foreign workers using a hammer is just disingenuous to the work they are doing. Give some actual level of research if you want to make a proposal that upgrading tech will significantly reduce the need for foreign workers.

How many skilled workers are needed to operate the vehicle, what is the lump-sum cost of investment and what is the upkeep cost? How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce? How much training is necessary and how long will it take to implement?

""Just upgrade lah"" is something you hear too often from ignorant bosses and ignorant masses. It provides absolutely zero solution, and zero steps towards the solution. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.

2) I can agree with this. However, you talk about capitalism in your third point. Don't allow the successful to have landed property, lose the successful. This disgusting world you are living in is controlled by the 1%.

Then again, how much landed space do you really think that will clear up?  I don't think that shit will be the solution to this problem here.

3) You don't need to solve the problem, but unless you actually tried to tackle the problem you don't understand why this is a problem that's so damned hard to solve. Logistic is everything.

Give some actual level of research if you want to make a proposal that upgrading tech will significantly reduce the need for foreign workers.

How many skilled workers are needed to operate the vehicle, what is the lump-sum cost of investment and what is the upkeep cost? How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce? How much training is necessary and how long will it take to implement?

""Just upgrade lah"" is something you hear too often from ignorant bosses and ignorant masses. It provides absolutely zero solution, and zero steps towards the solution. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.

2) I can agree with this. However, you talk about capitalism in your third point. Don't allow the successful to have landed property, lose the successful. This disgusting world you are living in is controlled by the 1%.

Then again, how much landed space do you really think that will clear up?  I don't think that shit will be the solution to this problem here.

3) You don't need to solve the problem, but unless you actually tried to tackle the problem you don't understand why this is a problem that's so damned hard to solve. Logistic is everything.

We can spew rhetorics about for 10,000 years about how you think tech could magically cut down the amount of foreign worker necessary by half so we suddenly only need to cram 6 instead of 12 to a room, but clustering was never an issue until today and it was necessary for the foreign workforce. The point being argued is that clustering was inhumane.

It isn't.

842,fnfwe1b,t1_fneblfb,"1) Literally difference in belief once again. Like I said, I don't believe in capitalism. Negative externalities will never be covered by the market, are you insane? How much compromised rivers and seas polluted by waste and natural water resources occupied by private enterprise do you need before you realize government intervention is needed to mitigate that shit?

2) Sure you can be critical, the hell are you on about. I didn't try to censure you or attack your freedom of speech. I can simply attempt to shoot down your criticism if it's a stupid criticism. I think your proposal that tech would magically solve the problem is unrealistic, and I think your proposal that simply putting in regulation is stupid. 

Your entire argument boils down to this: prodding the market will fix it.

You are underestimating the shithole the market is.

3) Again I think you're being dumb. You back yourself into a corner if you criticise coal but provide zero alternatives. What do you do when asked so what? You just tell them to have the market find alternative for you. Meanwhile the market is doing everything in their power to fund the notion that coal is a necessary evil through fudged bias studies, and that coal isn't that bad.
