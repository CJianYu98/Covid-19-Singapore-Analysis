16,gkpdz3d,t3_l4nwwi,"> # COVID-19 pandemic could last 4 to 5 years: Lawrence Wong

> SINGAPORE: It may take four to five years before the COVID-19 pandemic ends and the world can look to a ""post-COVID normal"", said Education Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday (Jan 25).

> ""At some point in time the pandemic will pass, but it may take four to five years before we finally see the end of the pandemic and the start of a post-COVID normal. What will this new post-COVID world look like? No one can tell,"" he said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Mr Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce, was speaking at the Singapore Perspectives 2021 conference hosted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS).

> In a 30-minute speech on the final day of the four-day conference, the minister highlighted how there are still many uncertainties to contend with in the next few years, while sharing his hopes about how the future can be ""reset"" once the pandemic is over.

> ""Reset"" was the theme of the hybrid conference, held online and in-person at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, which sought to imagine how Singapore could look like in 2030.

> Mr Wong said there was still ""great uncertainty"" about how the coronavirus will shape society in the coming years. Adhering to safe management measures like mask-wearing and avoiding crowds will continue for this year and ""maybe a good part of next year"", he said.

> ""Beyond that, the availability of COVID-19 vaccinations will progressively restart global travel, but getting the world vaccinated won't be quick or easy,"" he added.

>

> The Government has planned for everyone in Singapore to be vaccinated by the third quarter of this year, but Mr Wong said that there could still be ""bumps along the way"".

> Advertisement

> He noted that the current vaccines may not be so effective against new mutant strains of the virus, and will have to be modified to counter them.

> ""In the positive scenario, this means the vaccine becomes a bit like an annual flu jab ... or perhaps we develop a vaccine that works for all strains. But in the worst case, we end up always a step behind an evolving virus, and you will not be able to catch up in time,"" he said.

> ""So there are still tremendous uncertainties ahead of us. And the bottom line is that we live in a shared world and no one is safe until everyone is safe.""

> 

> When asked later by moderator Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez on whether 2021 will be a re-run, a sequel or a re-make of 2020, Mr Wong said there are important differences between the situation now and last year - mainly that Singapore is better prepared to fight the virus and that there are now vaccines available.

> 

> ""What we need to do really is to tide through now until the point where everyone in Singapore is vaccinated, maybe the third quarter of the year. Perhaps at the end of the year, there is a solution.""

> 

> ""REBOOT"" FOR THE FUTURE

> Looking ahead to the post-pandemic future, Mr Wong said the current crisis can set the stage for a ""software update"" or a ""reboot"" of Singapore after the damage inflicted the virus.

> ""We must reset our social compact to emerge as a fairer and more equal society. The pandemic may be indiscriminate about who it infects but its impact is anything but equal. It has, in fact, widen the gulf between the haves and the have-nots,"" he said.

> He said that Singapore started to prioritise reducing inequality a decade ago, and that last year, many emergency measures were introduced to help lower-income groups. But this year, the temporary measures will have to ""taper down"" as the economy improves.

> However, he foresees that Singaporeans will need more assurance and support in a more uncertain and volatile world.

> ""The impact of the pandemic has created an added impetus to strengthen our social support system. There will be a permanent shift towards further strengthening of our social safety nets in Singapore to protect the disadvantaged and vulnerable,"" he said, adding that it will have to be done in a ""sustainable manner over the long term"".

> The minister added that meritocracy in Singapore should not ""ossify into a hereditary system"".

> ""We start by intervening early and uplifting our children from birth. That's a key focus and priority for me in the Ministry of Education - that's why we're making significant investments in pre-school,"" said Mr Wong, who took over the education portfolio this year after the General Election in July.

> Expanding on his outlook for Singapore's education system, he said the country is making ""fundamental shifts"" in its model to facilitate education for life.

> ""We want to have multiple entry points across the age distribution and across the entire skill spectrum. And thereby enable everyone to reskill, upgrade and continuously improve to be the best possible version of themselves,"" he said.

> GREENER, MORE UNITED SINGAPORE

> Mr Wong said that the pandemic has also thrown a spotlight on the unequal value society places on different types of workers, and added that this needs to change.

> ""Merit has become narrowly defined by academic and cognitive abilities but there's a wide range of abilities and aptitudes needed for societies to thrive,"" he said.

> ""We've come to better appreciate the contributions of our essential workers ... We must honour them for their work and accord them the dignity and respect they deserve. We must ensure they receive fair remuneration for the important work they do.""

> Mr Wong highlighted two more ways Singapore can ""reset"" - to become greener and to strengthen solidarity among its people.

> He said that the pandemic led to a temporary fall in carbon emissions when human activity came to a standstill, and the natural world began to heal.

> ""We cannot go back to the status quo ante ... climate change will be the existential emergency of our time. So we must build a greener economy and society that's more environmentally sustainable.""

> He said that while the pandemic sharpened divisions in some counties, it has brought Singaporeans together.

> ""I am confident that we will prevail and emerge stronger from this crucible, and I do not say this lightly. I speak from my own conviction of seeing the best of Singaporeans over the past year in the face of adversity and very tough conditions,"" he said.

> A renewed sense of solidarity is important as it will help Singapore build a better society, said the minister.

> ""My hope is for Singapore to emerge as a fairer, greener and more equal country with a much stronger spirit of solidarity and shared purpose,"" he said.

>Then he talks about how meritocracy shouldn’t ossify into a hereditary system.

Might not necessarily for the topic at hand, but here's my 2 cents. The government itself set the precedent for this. LHL should never have been made prime minister. I do not doubt his capabilities nor his qualifications, but having him as the PM really throws out everything that the government has been saying about meritocracy unfortunately because he is LKY's son.

Regardless of his academic qualifications, his achievements and rank in the army (he was a general I think) that was no doubt gained through his own abilities, those will not be what the average Singaporean will look at first. 

It is because LKY, the founding father of Singapore had left such a significant imprint on public consciousness that LHL will never be able to escape from. That he is LKY's son, serving in the exact same post that LKY had, has tainted the idea of meritocracy in Singapore society.

> SINGAPORE: It may take four to five years before the COVID-19 pandemic ends and the world can look to a ""post-COVID normal"", said Education Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday (Jan 25).

> ""At some point in time the pandemic will pass, but it may take four to five years before we finally see the end of the pandemic and the start of a post-COVID normal. What will this new post-COVID world look like? No one can tell,"" he said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Mr Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce, was speaking at the Singapore Perspectives 2021 conference hosted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS).

> In a 30-minute speech on the final day of the four-day conference, the minister highlighted how there are still many uncertainties to contend with in the next few years, while sharing his hopes about how the future can be ""reset"" once the pandemic is over.

> ""Reset"" was the theme of the hybrid conference, held online and in-person at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, which sought to imagine how Singapore could look like in 2030.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Mr Wong said there was still ""great uncertainty"" about how the coronavirus will shape society in the coming years. Adhering to safe management measures like mask-wearing and avoiding crowds will continue for this year and ""maybe a good part of next year"", he said.

> ""Beyond that, the availability of COVID-19 vaccinations will progressively restart global travel, but getting the world vaccinated won't be quick or easy,"" he added.

>

> The Government has planned for everyone in Singapore to be vaccinated by the third quarter of this year, but Mr Wong said that there could still be ""bumps along the way"".

> Advertisement

> He noted that the current vaccines may not be so effective against new mutant strains of the virus, and will have to be modified to counter them.

> ""In the positive scenario, this means the vaccine becomes a bit like an annual flu jab ... or perhaps we develop a vaccine that works for all strains. But in the worst case, we end up always a step behind an evolving virus, and you will not be able to catch up in time,"" he said.

> ""So there are still tremendous uncertainties ahead of us. And the bottom line is that we live in a shared world and no one is safe until everyone is safe.""

> 

> When asked later by moderator Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez on whether 2021 will be a re-run, a sequel or a re-make of 2020, Mr Wong said there are important differences between the situation now and last year - mainly that Singapore is better prepared to fight the virus and that there are now vaccines available.

> 

> ""What we need to do really is to tide through now until the point where everyone in Singapore is vaccinated, maybe the third quarter of the year. Perhaps at the end of the year, there is a solution.""

> 

> ""REBOOT"" FOR THE FUTURE

> Looking ahead to the post-pandemic future, Mr Wong said the current crisis can set the stage for a ""software update"" or a ""reboot"" of Singapore after the damage inflicted the virus.

> ""We must reset our social compact to emerge as a fairer and more equal society. The pandemic may be indiscriminate about who it infects but its impact is anything but equal. It has, in fact, widen the gulf between the haves and the have-nots,"" he said.

> He said that Singapore started to prioritise reducing inequality a decade ago, and that last year, many emergency measures were introduced to help lower-income groups. But this year, the temporary measures will have to ""taper down"" as the economy improves.

> However, he foresees that Singaporeans will need more assurance and support in a more uncertain and volatile world.

> ""The impact of the pandemic has created an added impetus to strengthen our social support system. There will be a permanent shift towards further strengthening of our social safety nets in Singapore to protect the disadvantaged and vulnerable,"" he said, adding that it will have to be done in a ""sustainable manner over the long term"".

> The minister added that meritocracy in Singapore should not ""ossify into a hereditary system"".

> ""We start by intervening early and uplifting our children from birth. That's a key focus and priority for me in the Ministry of Education - that's why we're making significant investments in pre-school,"" said Mr Wong, who took over the education portfolio this year after the General Election in July.

> Expanding on his outlook for Singapore's education system, he said the country is making ""fundamental shifts"" in its model to facilitate education for life.

> ""We want to have multiple entry points across the age distribution and across the entire skill spectrum. And thereby enable everyone to reskill, upgrade and continuously improve to be the best possible version of themselves,"" he said.

> GREENER, MORE UNITED SINGAPORE

> Mr Wong said that the pandemic has also thrown a spotlight on the unequal value society places on different types of workers, and added that this needs to change.

> ""Merit has become narrowly defined by academic and cognitive abilities but there's a wide range of abilities and aptitudes needed for societies to thrive,"" he said.

> ""We've come to better appreciate the contributions of our essential workers ... We must honour them for their work and accord them the dignity and respect they deserve. We must ensure they receive fair remuneration for the important work they do.""

> Mr Wong highlighted two more ways Singapore can ""reset"" - to become greener and to strengthen solidarity among its people.

> He said that the pandemic led to a temporary fall in carbon emissions when human activity came to a standstill, and the natural world began to heal.

> ""We cannot go back to the status quo ante ... climate change will be the existential emergency of our time. So we must build a greener economy and society that's more environmentally sustainable.""

> He said that while the pandemic sharpened divisions in some counties, it has brought Singaporeans together.

> ""I am confident that we will prevail and emerge stronger from this crucible, and I do not say this lightly. I speak from my own conviction of seeing the best of Singaporeans over the past year in the face of adversity and very tough conditions,"" he said.

> A renewed sense of solidarity is important as it will help Singapore build a better society, said the minister.

> ""My hope is for Singapore to emerge as a fairer, greener and more equal country with a much stronger spirit of solidarity and shared purpose,"" he said.

The Great Reset is a proposal by the World Economic Forum (WEF) to rebuild the economy sustainably following the COVID-19 pandemic. It was unveiled in May 2020 by the United Kingdom's Prince Charles and WEF director Klaus Schwab. It seeks to improve capitalism by making investments more geared toward mutual progress and focusing more on environmental initiatives. A petition in Canada to stop it gained 80,000 signatures in less than 72 hours.

277,g6jcpu9,t3_izdnbt,"IMO really well. Have friends & colleagues overseas counting the actions from their government and comparing them to ours, and sometimes the difference is really striking.

Previously I posted that the difference will show around Sep - Oct timeframe, after all the FWs are tested in the dormitories. I think we are starting to see them now.

I am especially appreciative of these, just off the top of my head. Of course, an elite civil service is also key to enabling all these to happen:

* healthcare workers did not have to worry about lack of PPE at any point in time
* no HCW got infected so far through caring for patients who were Covid positive
* no lack of testing reagents and swabs for the tests
* interventions to prevent spread in schools, pre-schools, nursing & care homes and prisons
* they really do seem to be putting in great efforts in protecting our seniors
* our supply chains remained largely intact during the worst period (Feb - May)
* the massive effort to enable CCFs in record time in places like Expo, Tanjong Pagar & CEC. Just thinking of how to get the required number of beds then, was mind-boggling to me.
* scaling up testing & contact tracing capacities during the CB period
* the govt actually formed a MMTF quickly before the coronavirus reached our shores, and it did well. Especially think Minister Lawrence Wong who acts as the coordinating minister for all the ministries & agencies has stepped up to the task & has been very clear in his communications to the public during the updates in their press conferences.

Probably can only ding the government for the masks, SHNs not enforced that strongly at the beginning and the dorms? I do think they made the best possible decisions under the circumstances there and then.

Finally, a bit about the dorms. I am of the opinion that the outbreak in the dorms is not only caused by the living conditions, but the nature of their working conditions as well. Indeed some of the conditions of the dorms needs to be improved, but IMO even if the workers had been housed 4 or 6 per room prior to the outbreak, I think it would still had happened. The entire design of the dorms has to change, it is not only about the density. Remember case 42 who is linked to a cluster from Seletar Aerospace Heights?

Have friends & colleagues overseas counting the actions from their government and comparing them to ours, and sometimes the difference is really striking.

Previously I posted that the difference will show around Sep - Oct timeframe, after all the FWs are tested in the dormitories. I think we are starting to see them now.

I am especially appreciative of these, just off the top of my head. Of course, an elite civil service is also key to enabling all these to happen:

* healthcare workers did not have to worry about lack of PPE at any point in time
* no HCW got infected so far through caring for patients who were Covid positive
* no lack of testing reagents and swabs for the tests
* interventions to prevent spread in schools, pre-schools, nursing & care homes and prisons
* they really do seem to be putting in great efforts in protecting our seniors
* our supply chains remained largely intact during the worst period (Feb - May)
* the massive effort to enable CCFs in record time in places like Expo, Tanjong Pagar & CEC. Just thinking of how to get the required number of beds then, was mind-boggling to me.
* scaling up testing & contact tracing capacities during the CB period
* the govt actually formed a MMTF quickly before the coronavirus reached our shores, and it did well. Especially think Minister Lawrence Wong who acts as the coordinating minister for all the ministries & agencies has stepped up to the task & has been very clear in his communications to the public during the updates in their press conferences.

Probably can only ding the government for the masks, SHNs not enforced that strongly at the beginning and the dorms? I do think they made the best possible decisions under the circumstances there and then.

Finally, a bit about the dorms. I am of the opinion that the outbreak in the dorms is not only caused by the living conditions, but the nature of their working conditions as well. Indeed some of the conditions of the dorms needs to be improved, but IMO even if the workers had been housed 4 or 6 per room prior to the outbreak, I think it would still had happened. The entire design of the dorms has to change, it is not only about the density. Remember case 42 who is linked to a cluster from Seletar Aerospace Heights? It was successfully isolated, or is there a remote possibility that it all stemmed from this cluster? We will never know, but at that point in time there were no further transmissions identified from the cluster. Recently in some interviews, it was revealed that MOM & the dorm operators actually put in place isolation facilities and safety measures after this cluster in an attempt to prevent future similar events, but the massive outbreaks later proved that those measures were inadequate."

If you tried doing something similar in US, **it would mean imprisoning 16 million people (5% of population)** \- that's 2 times more than total amount of covid cases that were detected in US.

Basically, if you're a government that wants to have a low covid death rate, you should aim to isolate working age people away from the population, and get as many of them infected with covid as possible. This is just basic math.

329,fsd00mv,t3_gt9agi,"To quote Yong Han Poh in her facebook post (that was well written and linked to two other interesting opinions on this matter which I unfortunately can't link to because this subreddit doesn't allow for Facebook links):

""I don’t agree with many things in Dr. Tan’s post, but that doesn’t mean I fully agree with Dr. Leong’s post either.

On the first two points, yes, I understand that there are numerous policy considerations and the apparent “U-turn” came because of a mix of changing epidemiology and strategic / security concerns relating to mask supply and so forth. Like Dr. Leong, I don’t blame the government for revising their policies given changing circumstances. I also think we have remarkable testing capacity, and I don’t doubt that many contingency plans have been put in place to avoid over-straining our healthcare system. On these fronts, I applaud the government.

It’s really his third point that I want to critique. Dr. Leong says that his ""hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases.” He even throws in a thought experiment: “Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?” 

What is the counter-factual here? I recognize neither of us have any data, but since Dr. Leong uses a thought experiment to make his assertion, I’m going to use his logic to illustrate my own speculations. Imagine that migrant workers lived six people to a room (don’t need single room lah horh), attached with their own kitchen and toilets (don’t need sauna also). When Covid hit (and when everyone has been ordered to stop working because of CB), they are able to practice social distancing, and cook for themselves in their own kitchens. They don’t have to be cramped - sometimes thirty-five people to a room - trying to practice social distancing, or rely on MOM to provide them food (dorms typically only have communal kitchens, and some dorms / FCDs don’t have kitchens at all).  I think this could have help stemmed the rapid transmission rates, even if some transmission was still inevitable because of asymptomatic carriers, as Dr. Leong pointed out. The difficulties of practicing social distancing in these dorms and warnings of a possible contagion have been sounded out as early as February by healthcare professionals such as Dr. Jeremy Lim, and echoed again by migrant groups like Geylang Adventures and TWC2. Why weren’t they heeded? This is what I would like to know, and hopefully there will be a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry convened post-crisis to explore this, and highlight the government’s own considerations and practical constraints for the public. (And if the government already knew it was so infectious, why did it take them so long to commit to distributing free reusable masks and sanitizers for the migrant workers?) 

Dr. Leong also writes, ""I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying. This is not the time.” I normally try to avoid emotive language in such discussions, but since you used the word, I think it is “despicable"" to accuse NGOs for being opportunistic or having an agenda. By definition, the mission of these NGOs and advocacy groups /is/ to advocate for better migrant rights. What do you want them to do - remain silent amidst a by the way, /national/ crisis? So it’s okay for them to lobby for better rights for migrant workers before Covid but not during? What about the fact that actually, Singapore is having a national conversation about migrant worker policy post-crisis now, and that their voices, together with those of migrant workers’, are very important in helping to shape that? 

Dr Leong also criticizes big mouths for having ""no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.”  This may be fair. Of course everything entails trade-offs. But I don’t think we should fault NGOs or advocacy groups or whichever “big mouths” you might be alluding to for clamouring for migrant rights or better dormitory conditions, even if you find them utopian. The job of the policymaker is to try and achieve “balance” and negotiate between somtimes competing interests and translate utopian ideals into realistic policy. The job of the advocate is to try and push the boundaries of what is possible, to shift mindsets that everything is a cost-based calculation, to introduce rights-based language into public discourse, and to push for a human-centered approach in policy-making. Everyone has a different part to play in the ecosystem. The policy maker has the unglamorous (and sadly, thankless) job of deciding how best to navigate those practical constraints, and what kinds of costs are reasonable. But this is not just an empirical question - it is also a normative one - and it is precisely the normative aspect that these “big mouths” are speaking to, by making us as a public reflect on the principles by which we arrive at these answers in the first place. 
 
Finally, Dr. Leong calls for us to “have a sense of perspective”. He writes, “We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment.”

I’m having trouble fully distinguishing between ""having perspective"" and outright “whataboutism”. It is true that many other countries struggle with Covid infections in their dorm equivalents, and Singapore certainly isn’t the worst in the world. But this doesn’t make the current situation right, or absolve the G of responsibility, even if it does seem to make these failings appear reasonable. We can, and should, aspire to better. I don’t think the G has done terribly on these counts, but it doesn’t mean I think they have done brilliantly either. The PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers - great. But let’s not conflate these reassurances post-crisis with Singapore’s treatment of migrant workers more generally, and let us not forget the hard work of NGOs and advocacy groups who have been crucial in pushing for more migrant worker protections both before and during this crisis. 

Of course, to quote Dr. Leong, “Don’t just believe what people tell you. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles”. Don’t believe me either. And unlike Dr. Tan and Dr. Leong, I don't have a PhD in anything and certainly don’t claim expertise - these are just my personal thoughts as a humble citizen.""",t3_gt9agi,2020-05-31

'humbl', 'citizen']","To quote Yong Han Poh in her facebook post (that was well written and linked to two other interesting opinions on this matter which I unfortunately can't link to because this subreddit doesn't allow for Facebook links):

""I don’t agree with many things in Dr. Tan’s post, but that doesn’t mean I fully agree with Dr. Leong’s post either.

On the first two points, yes, I understand that there are numerous policy considerations and the apparent “U-turn” came because of a mix of changing epidemiology and strategic / security concerns relating to mask supply and so forth. Like Dr. Leong, I don’t blame the government for revising their policies given changing circumstances. I also think we have remarkable testing capacity, and I don’t doubt that many contingency plans have been put in place to avoid over-straining our healthcare system. On these fronts, I applaud the government.

It’s really his third point that I want to critique. Dr. Leong says that his ""hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases.” He even throws in a thought experiment: “Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?” 

What is the counter-factual here? I recognize neither of us have any data, but since Dr. Leong uses a thought experiment to make his assertion, I’m going to use his logic to illustrate my own speculations. Imagine that migrant workers lived six people to a room (don’t need single room lah horh), attached with their own kitchen and toilets (don’t need sauna also). When Covid hit (and when everyone has been ordered to stop working because of CB), they are able to practice social distancing, and cook for themselves in their own kitchens. They don’t have to be cramped - sometimes thirty-five people to a room - trying to practice social distancing, or rely on MOM to provide them food (dorms typically only have communal kitchens, and some dorms / FCDs don’t have kitchens at all).  I think this could have help stemmed the rapid transmission rates, even if some transmission was still inevitable because of asymptomatic carriers, as Dr. Leong pointed out. The difficulties of practicing social distancing in these dorms and warnings of a possible contagion have been sounded out as early as February by healthcare professionals such as Dr. Jeremy Lim, and echoed again by migrant groups like Geylang Adventures and TWC2. Why weren’t they heeded? This is what I would like to know, and hopefully there will be a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry convened post-crisis to explore this, and highlight the government’s own considerations and practical constraints for the public. (And if the government already knew it was so infectious, why did it take them so long to commit to distributing free reusable masks and sanitizers for the migrant workers?) 

Dr. Leong also writes, ""I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying. This is not the time.” I normally try to avoid emotive language in such discussions, but since you used the word, I think it is “despicable"" to accuse NGOs for being opportunistic or having an agenda. By definition, the mission of these NGOs and advocacy groups /is/ to advocate for better migrant rights. What do you want them to do - remain silent amidst a by the way, /national/ crisis? So it’s okay for them to lobby for better rights for migrant workers before Covid but not during? What about the fact that actually, Singapore is having a national conversation about migrant worker policy post-crisis now, and that their voices, together with those of migrant workers’, are very important in helping to shape that? 

Dr Leong also criticizes big mouths for having ""no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.”  This may be fair. Of course everything entails trade-offs. But I don’t think we should fault NGOs or advocacy groups or whichever “big mouths” you might be alluding to for clamouring for migrant rights or better dormitory conditions, even if you find them utopian. The job of the policymaker is to try and achieve “balance” and negotiate between somtimes competing interests and translate utopian ideals into realistic policy. The job of the advocate is to try and push the boundaries of what is possible, to shift mindsets that everything is a cost-based calculation, to introduce rights-based language into public discourse, and to push for a human-centered approach in policy-making. Everyone has a different part to play in the ecosystem. The policy maker has the unglamorous (and sadly, thankless) job of deciding how best to navigate those practical constraints, and what kinds of costs are reasonable. But this is not just an empirical question - it is also a normative one - and it is precisely the normative aspect that these “big mouths” are speaking to, by making us as a public reflect on the principles by which we arrive at these answers in the first place. 
 
Finally, Dr. Leong calls for us to “have a sense of perspective”. He writes, “We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment.”

I’m having trouble fully distinguishing between ""having perspective"" and outright “whataboutism”. It is true that many other countries struggle with Covid infections in their dorm equivalents, and Singapore certainly isn’t the worst in the world. But this doesn’t make the current situation right, or absolve the G of responsibility, even if it does seem to make these failings appear reasonable. We can, and should, aspire to better. I don’t think the G has done terribly on these counts, but it doesn’t mean I think they have done brilliantly either. The PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers - great. But let’s not conflate these reassurances post-crisis with Singapore’s treatment of migrant workers more generally, and let us not forget the hard work of NGOs and advocacy groups who have been crucial in pushing for more migrant worker protections both before and during this crisis. 

Of course, to quote Dr. Leong, “Don’t just believe what people tell you. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles”. Don’t believe me either. And unlike Dr. Tan and Dr. Leong, I don't have a PhD in anything and certainly don’t claim expertise - these are just my personal thoughts as a humble citizen."""

345,fsalbt5,t1_fsajc8x,"I see, those are interesting counterpoints to what was said by other commenters. 

If the govt initially told people there's no need to wear masks due to fear of panic-buying of masks, then it does make sense why they would say that. Not that it excuses them from preparing a readily-available supply of masks for an epidemic, but I could see why they did it regardless.

The dorm situation coming about due to a super-spreading is understandable as well. Nevertheless, when criticising the govt, many commenters here are pointing out the lack of preparation on the FW dorms to prevent spread of infectious diseases as a whole. They did a lockdown in the end, so at least they did something even if it was a little too late. Seems to be a case of lack of foresight rather than malevolence.

The impression I am getting is that the main issue lies with the preparation for this epidemic, though it's harder to criticise them on this alone. I'm sure this situation is not benefitting the govt at all (with GE coming up) so they probably did what they thought was the best thing to do, even if the consequences were damaging to smaller businesses, for example.

If the govt initially told people there's no need to wear masks due to fear of panic-buying of masks, then it does make sense why they would say that. Not that it excuses them from preparing a readily-available supply of masks for an epidemic, but I could see why they did it regardless.

The dorm situation coming about due to a super-spreading is understandable as well. Nevertheless, when criticising the govt, many commenters here are pointing out the lack of preparation on the FW dorms to prevent spread of infectious diseases as a whole. They did a lockdown in the end, so at least they did something even if it was a little too late. Seems to be a case of lack of foresight rather than malevolence.

Then some organisations had warned, at the start of covid, the risks again. Still no visible action.

Then one FW got Covid. They managed to isolate him. This was back in Feb.

At that time there wasn't any indication of CB happening in future, and masks were not yet mandated, SHN had breaches and many who had to serve SHN were saying instructions were unclear. I believe you know this part.

Then all of a sudden our cases started picking up, with the dorms starting to get affected. Then CB, up to now.

Basically, everything that was done and wasn't, as above, led to the situation we see in the dorms now.
