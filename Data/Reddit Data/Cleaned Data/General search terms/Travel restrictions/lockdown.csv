1,No need to lockdown S‚Äôpore‚Äôs borders if we carry out Covid-19 measures effectively: Lawrence Wong,2020-03-17 21:09:56,at the very least they should impose restrictions for people coming from the uk/us since these countries are clearly not handling the outbreak well,2020-03-17 21:25:27,25
2,No need to lockdown S‚Äôpore‚Äôs borders if we carry out Covid-19 measures effectively: Lawrence Wong,2020-03-17 21:09:56,"honestly the implementation of SHN is sufficient to mitigate the spread from potential carriers‚Ä¶ but perhaps we need to consider widening the scope to *ALL* incoming travellers

and if you think about it, a SHN is essentially a ban on tourists‚Ä¶ if you have no business to stay here for more than 14 days then you definitely won't be coming‚Ä¶ I have no qualms with ""medical tourists"" since they will be paying for their treatment and the SHN would ensure they don't spread the virus‚Ä¶ plus it's good publicity for us on the whole anyway",2020-03-17 21:39:51,91
3,No need to lockdown S‚Äôpore‚Äôs borders if we carry out Covid-19 measures effectively: Lawrence Wong,2020-03-17 21:09:56,"Ive seen people disagreeing with these statements all the time. All these people wishing for a lockdown in Singapore despite our situation being stable have no idea the consequences that awaits. People will lose their jobs, business shuts down. Think laaaaaaaa bodo.",2020-03-17 21:14:09,42

5,No need to lockdown S‚Äôpore‚Äôs borders if we carry out Covid-19 measures effectively: Lawrence Wong,2020-03-17 21:09:56,"The million-dollar question is: how do you stop the asymptomatic spreaders coming in from overseas and spreading the disease to the local community unknowingly? Because this is a pandemic with severe undertesting just about everywhere, you cannot assume that someone flying in from India, Kenya or Ecuador is clear of the virus.

At least give every visitor enough masks  to wear (and make him/her do so) for the duration of his/her visit so that he/she doesn't spread the disease unknowingly if you cannot enforce a quarantine on them.",2020-03-18 13:26:34,89

8,No need to lockdown S‚Äôpore‚Äôs borders if we carry out Covid-19 measures effectively: Lawrence Wong,2020-03-17 21:09:56,"The ""medical tourists"" still endanger people on their trip here, and they take up our beds. Sure we're not drowning in cases now, but nobody can tell how bad it's going to get. It's definitely not something to encourage. In any case the latest measure requiring health clearance for ~~Indo~~ASEAN countries is a pretty clear signal that we don't want more of such cases.",2020-03-17 23:14:26,61
9,No need to lockdown S‚Äôpore‚Äôs borders if we carry out Covid-19 measures effectively: Lawrence Wong,2020-03-17 21:09:56,As long as there's still new cases appearing we're not stable. We're just having it under more control as compared to other countries. A new case may trigger a new cluster.,2020-03-17 21:48:51,28

13,No need to lockdown S‚Äôpore‚Äôs borders if we carry out Covid-19 measures effectively: Lawrence Wong,2020-03-17 21:09:56,"With asymptomatic transmission more than possible, it is hard to completely stop the spread. Still, the measures placed to delay and slow down the spread is definitely working right now as it is completely within the capacity of the medical system in Singapore to treat and isolate the confirmed cases. 

The measures are there to flatten the curve of number of infections. 

Right now we are stable, but we still must be alert.",2020-03-17 22:18:10,73

16,No need to lockdown S‚Äôpore‚Äôs borders if we carry out Covid-19 measures effectively: Lawrence Wong,2020-03-17 21:09:56,Yes we are handling it well for now. But it is certainly not stable. We just beat the record for number of cases a day for 2 days in a row. We‚Äôre getting at least 3 times of new cases than those recovered. How is that slowing things down?,2020-03-18 00:26:01,48

The increase in number of cases means that we have yet to reach the peak number of cases before it falls back down.",2020-03-18 09:16:09,41
