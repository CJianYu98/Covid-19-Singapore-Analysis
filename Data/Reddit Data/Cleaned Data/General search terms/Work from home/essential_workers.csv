1,"Essentially, no one is saying that painters, actors, singers and writers contribute nothing",2020-06-16 20:43:51,"I have asked someone I know who studied designing about the non-essential thing. Naturally, he agreed that in Singapore there has been a lack of focus on the importance of a designer.

He quoted the news on Singapore polytechnic combining 8 programmes into one multidisciplinary course. In his opinion, this can result in a lack of specialisation that is important as foundations for a career, despite the fact that from 2nd year onwards specialisation is available. Another issue is that despite SP wanting to allow their students to become more adaptable, my friend did say that different disciplines have different requirements.

Plus he also mentioned that in Singapore, many people discredit the role of designers just because 'some people who know photoshop' prefer their own designs rather than one done by a graphic designer who has, through his course of studies, learnt the best placement for texts and infographics to help people get the message that is desired. 

Other examples he stated was the fact (from his point of view) that engineers in Singapore require designers to work within engineering constraints, while it is important that engineers should work to accommodate for the design constraints. To be fair, he did acknowledge that the work of an engineer and a designer should come hand in hand, instead of one party having veto power over the other, which he thinks is lacking in Singapore.

Hence, he thinks many people don't put importance on the work of a designer because many people with some skills (photoshop, illustrator) think that they are able to achieve the same result without a designer. However, a designer comes with a suite of skills that cannot be self-taught for most people.

He explains that some designs of apps or user interfaces in various places are not designer-standard and are ugly (in his opinion), and that it could have been done by a non-designer. This can have a negative effect from what is desired. A design that doesn't catch the eye, or is too plain, with mismatched colours would not attract people.",2020-06-16 21:12:56,335

> SINGAPORE: Singapore and Indonesia have agreed to set up a reciprocal green lane (RGL) for essential business and official travel between both countries.

> Applications for the RGL will open on Oct 26 and travel will start soon after, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on Monday (Oct 12).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The agreement comes less than two months after MFA said on Aug 25 that Singapore and Indonesia planned to begin talks for a reciprocal green lane.

> Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi told CNA in an exclusive interview last week the two countries were in the final phase of negotiations for the green lane, and that preparations were being made on the ground to facilitate arrivals.

> OPEN TO INDONESIAN CITIZENS, SINGAPOREANS AND SINGAPORE RESIDENTS: MFA

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> MFA said on Monday that Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Mdm Marsudi have reaffirmed the “excellent and longstanding relations” between Singapore and Indonesia in a telephone conversation.

> They also recalled their discussion in August this year on the importance of strengthening mutually beneficial cooperation in overcoming common challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

> This includes the resumption of essential travel while safeguarding public health and safety in both countries.

> ""In this context, the ministers welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations,"" said MFA.

> Advertisement

> Indonesian citizens as well as Singapore citizens and residents are eligible for the RGL, also referred to by Indonesia as the travel corridor arrangement (TCA), said MFA.

> Travellers will have to abide by COVID-19 prevention and public health measures agreed by both countries, including pre-departure and post-arrival polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests from mutually recognised health institutions.

> Operational details regarding the RGL, including the procedural requirements, health protocols and application process will be announced ""in due course"".

> TWO POINTS OF ENTRY EACH IN INDONESIA AND SINGAPORE

> Mdm Marsudi said at a press conference on Monday that there will be two points of entry in Indonesia for the RGL: Batam Centre Ferry Terminal and Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.

> The two entry points for Singapore will be Tanah Merah ferry terminal and Changi Airport, she added.

> Travellers will have to take the first PCR test 72 hours before departure, and the second test upon arrival at the airport or ferry terminal. Travellers will bear the costs of the tests, said Mdm Marsudi.

> Eligible travellers must also download and register themselves on the TraceTogether and SafeEntry mobile applications while in Singapore, or on the e-HAC and Peduli Lindungi applications while in Indonesia, she added.

> Mdm Marsudi said applicants from Indonesia must have a sponsor from a government agency or enterprises in Singapore and request for a SafeTravel pass.

> Singaporeans wanting to enter Indonesia must have a sponsor from the government or business entity and apply for a visa online.

> As Singapore progressively reopens amid the COVID-19 pandemic, special travel arrangements have been made with some countries and regions.

> It now has reciprocal green lane arrangements for essential business and official travel with China, Malaysia, Brunei, South Korea and Japan.

> It has also unilaterally lifted border restrictions for some visitors from Australia, excluding Victoria state, Vietnam, Brunei and New Zealand.

> Earlier this month, Singapore Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said pursuing more green lane arrangements and negotiating air travel bubbles with countries that had low COVID-19 infection rates were among the plans to ""revive"" Changi Air Hub.

> Mr Ong said in a ministerial statement a facility has been set up at Changi Airport to swab up to 10,000 passengers a day.

> In the next few months, there are plans to set up a dedicated COVID-19 testing laboratory at the airport to support aviation recovery, he added.

> Indonesia reported 4,497 new COVID-10 infections and 79 new deaths on Sunday, the lowest daily fatality count since Sep 27. It now has a total of 333,449 COVID-19 cases, with 11,844 deaths.

> Singapore reported 10 new cases on Sunday, taking its national total to 57,876 infections and 27 deaths.

46,"Singapore, Indonesia agree to launch green lane for essential business and official travel",2020-10-12 11:38:34,"please read about what's going on before using numbers to justify your argument. 

1) Indonesia has a very low testing rate - i believe they only test \~10,000 people per day. High % of people that they test turn out positive (>20%). Compared to <1% for Singapore. This shows that there is potentially a large pool of untested infected in the community

2) I've spoken to people in Indonesia & while a large percentage of the urban population understands the potential severity and extent of COVID-19, there are many, especially those in the rural areas who do not believe that the virus is a threat and want life to continue as per normal.

3) There are currently widespread demonstrations in Jakarta over new labor laws. Thousands are out in the streets not wearing masks (situation is similar to the US). There is also local election campaigning going on and rallies are attracting large number of people confined in a very small area

The net of it all is that there is rampant community spread of the virus in Indonesia and the situation is not being managed effectively by the government. As an example, just look at how many people were at the closing ceremony of a Mcdonald's in Jakarta. This just demonstrates how poorly the authorities are managing the spread.

Just saying when regimes with expansionist agendas have been given an inch, they usually go ahead and take the entire mile. You can look at history if you don't believe me.

There are already propoganda online that Sg is a good friend of china because of its Chinese majority. Who knows what they can do in the future. Personally it scares me because I live in Sg. Thats all",2020-05-30 00:06:21,69

145,"Singapore, China to launch 'fast lane' arrangement with COVID-19 measures for essential business, official travel",2020-05-29 22:59:02,"And if we look at history, we can see that China has never tried to expand its territory beyond its current day borders, give or take a border country or two. It has certainly never tried to claim any land south of Vietnam, let alone Singapore so many miles away. 

Heck, even when China was at its most expansionary during the Zheng He era, it never colonized the territories it landed on. Contrast that with the Western powers, which you very rightly pointed out have taken the entire mile when they were given inches through colonialism.",2020-05-30 00:39:08,96

148,"Singapore, China to launch 'fast lane' arrangement with COVID-19 measures for essential business, official travel",2020-05-29 22:59:02,"First you say ""China has NEVER tried to expand its territory beyond its current day border"", then you immediately contradict that statement by saying ""give it take a border country or two"". So is it never or not?

Claims on the South China Sea? China is part of UN but doesn't want to adhere to the international rulings against its claim.

Border dispute with India's Ladakh region and China recently flew their helicopter to the border. Tension rise between military on both sides starts brawling and throwing stones at one another? China tries to push its border into Ladakh but was pushed back by the Indians, is this not border expansion?

Taiwan? Yes, Taiwan was part of China, last when KMT was the government. CCP has never ruled Taiwan for a single day. So in terms of history yes Taiwan was part of China but not under the CCP's administration. Thus CCP is indeed expanding their rule into Taiwan.

Remember when our Terrexes was held in Hong Kong in late 2016? Singapore has been training with Taiwan under Project Starlight since LKY was PM. But when President Xi took office it wasn't an issue until Taiwan's newly elected pro independent president Tsai was inaugurated in early 2016. All of a sudden our military equipment has been taken hostage on the same year. Singapore has since been threading precariously politically and coerced into picking sides by the CCP. Being neutral meant picking the opposite side in the eyes of the CCP. Expanding into our borders? No. Expanding their ideology and influencing on how our government rule the country? Yes. 

Singapore needs diversity and neutrality in the world's stage to survive and prosper, we aren't even able to self sustain our population in terms of food supply. If we were to pick side it leaves us with less wiggle room to do internationally for cooperation.",2020-05-30 04:46:23,304
