Speaking to reporters at a briefing on the ongoing Wuhan situation, he said: “Such behaviours are not appropriate. They are selfish and they are not helpful for collective defence.

“Collective defence is our strongest defence. We must all act in unison, act together and not jeopardise the system by doing things that we think might benefit ourselves, protect ourselves, but to the detriment to everyone else in the society.”

The warning came after the Government released 5 million masks from the national stockpile to retailers in the past nine days, only to see them snapped up within hours of their release.

Some sellers have also tried to profit from the surge in demand. Authorities have, for instance, issued warning letters to Deen Express, a shop at 313 Somerset, which was said to be selling masks at S$68 or S$88 for a box of 20 N95 masks.

Sellers on online marketplaces Carousell and Qoo10 have also been spotted selling masks at about up to 20 times their usual retail price.

Mr Chan said Singaporeans should not support such profiteers, and should be more judicious about their use of masks, pointing out that people should only use masks when they are feeling unwell and need to leave the house to seek medical attention.

“If we do this systematically, calmly, pace ourselves, we will be able to manage our stockpile, manage the usage rate and the uncertainties,” he said.

His comments came as the Government announced it would distribute masks to all households in Singapore from Feb 1.

HOW THE GOVT MANAGES MASK STOCKPILE

The Government’s management of Singapore’s national stockpile of masks is based on three factors, said Mr Chan.

They are: How much Singapore currently has in its stockpile, how fast Singaporeans are using up the stockpile, and how many or how frequently masks can be resupplied.

But the usage rate in the past one week had greatly surpassed what would be reasonably expected, upsetting the equation, he said.

“We understand that when people are fearful, there’s a tendency to panic buy or hoard. But this is not very useful to the entire system,” he said.

“If we do not manage the private usage rate and prioritise the allocation, we will deprive our essential services, especially the healthcare services, of the masks, and this will in turn jeopardise our entire healthcare system, not allowing us to take care of those who need it the most.”

At the same briefing, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said that Singapore’s current rate of consumption of masks is “not sustainable”, especially with a global shortage of masks and likely export bans that other countries might implement, as the Wuhan situation unfolds and face their own mask supply shortages.

Pointing out that this is a “global contingency” with no signs of abating at this point, Mr Chan said Singapore cannot assume that supply lines will remain unconstrained and unaffected by “the competition of others who are taking action to secure their own supply lines”.

He cited recent news of mask producers prioritising China, the epicentre of the virus, and Taiwan banning the export of surgical masks.

He added that there are other uses of face masks now, including in Australia where a bushfire crisis continues to brew.

“Prepare for the long haul, but never, never succumb to the short-term fears and panic buying and hoarding behaviours, because these will destroy the entire system that we have,” said Mr Chan.

Mr Wong said: “Remember: At the end of the day, masks do not confer automatic protection against the virus… The best thing that every Singaporean can do to protect himself, herself and their family members is to uphold good personal hygiene.”

He added: “Wash your hands regularly with soap. Don’t touch your face with your hands, because when your hands are dirty and you touch your face without realising it – the mucous membranes, your eyes, your nose, your mouth, that is how viruses spread.”",2020-01-31 11:02:05,773

This is not wrong. We have sufficient masks for those who need it, and we still do.

1) more educated than average Singaporean 

2) younger and generally less bought in by fake news compared to older folks

1) Surgical masks prevent things from coming out, not going in. If you wear masks but someone cough at you you are still equally gg. 

2) We need masks for unhealthy people who are coughing and sneezing - all these stockpile that we have should have been ready to be given to those who need masks but do not have before they get on public transports - be it bus or trains. 

3) It's very rare that stray airborne virus in low quantities can cause sickness. One does not get a train full of people sick just because he sneeze, at least that is influenza. If it's so easy to be sick normally all your GP will be wearing hazmat suits for their daily work. But no they don't.

That is exactly the problem, everyone is only selfishly only interested in ""protecting"" themselves or their immediate friends and family. That's why they hoard masks regardless of information proving that masks are immensely more useful to prevent spread than to protect. So there's not enough masks, the genuinely sick people can't get masks, and spread to more people who are wearing useless masks even though they're not sick.. Everyone sees the number of cases increasing and hoard masks like they're 100% foolproof, less masks in supply, more cases, more panic.

This is a vicious cycle. Be knowledgable, you're on the internet with a ton of information at your fingertips.

And also 
>""“**People believe wearing masks will protect them against a novel organism they’re scared about**,” says Saskia Popescu, a senior infection prevention epidemiologist at a private healthcare system in Phoenix, Ariz. “**I understand the fear, but the U.S. is at a very low risk for this right now**.”""

>""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) **does not** currently recommend that people in the U.S. wear face masks in public to prevent infection.""

Actually, that is really how it is, unless healthy people go out in hazmat headgear or suit.

It's mindblowing how few people understand, or choose to accept, the hard truth that almost all the responsibility lies on the sick people to keep their pathogens to themselves, and **this responsibility is non-transferable**. The only little thing that healthy people can do is stop hoarding the masks so that sick people can have some.

Each mask will contribute so much more to the greater good if it is worn by a sick person, than if it is worn by a healthy person. In light of the shortage, every mask worn by a healthy person falls short of its maximum potential to help us fight this outbreak and is a gross inefficiency in the allocation of resources.

Basically, like your BCP - what to do when crisis hits, when your building is bombed, when there is a national disease outbreak, etc. etc. For the NSmen out there, I'm sure you know what I mean - we do exercises because we envisage all scenarios and how we react. Those who are involved with the HQ type of planning (e.g. S2-S4), know that the HQ always plans for every time of scenario so that there are drawer plans for them.

I'm sure the good people at MTI have long thought of the many contingencies that Singapore can face, and how to prepare for that. Things like, what if water from Malaysia is suddenly cut off, what if water is polluted, etc etc., and I'm 100% sure food supply from Malaysia is one of them.

68,"Yes, r/Singapore, I was one of the people who joined in one the second wave of panic-buying. Here is what I have to say and stories I heard from the people I met in the queue.",2020-03-17 10:03:33,"Let me respond to all of your points. They are, if true, definitely very legitimate concerns. But this predicate on them being true. 

(1) I assume by ""food service"", you are solely referring to them as frontline workers who sells cooked food (if you are referring to it as their involvement in our food supplies, see next point). While I do not have the data, I'd believe that there is a good mix of food services offered by people of various nationality in Singapore. Nonetheless, suppose I am wrong, it still does not justify for panic buying since the reduction in food services does not have any impact on our food supplies (again, see next point). 

(2) I really wish you would provide more concrete evidence that Singapore is solely reliant on Malaysia for food export. I highly doubt that any 1st-world government will be so unwise as to place all their dependency on one country for their essential needs. I'd, instead, rather believe that this is a bunch of hearsay which a bunch of boomers, with their vast experience theorizing conspiracies, have you believe. 

(3) Agree that the elderly shouldn't eat fast-food, if possible. But suppose we are truly at a stage of food shortage, who gives a shit about what anyone eats so long as it is food? Even if we are still compassionate when we reach that stage, how long can you keep the minced meat fresh? Longer than the food shortage is going to be here? If no, I really don't see why this line of reason justifies panic buying. 

(4) So what if those that are buying the food are Malaysians? I'd argue that a little kindness towards our neighboring country in this time is not bad diplomacy strategy. Besides, it is probably a one-off incident for people like this since they will be bringing the food back and wouldn't be allowed to come back in the near future. You might argue that they will deliver the food back through other means and continue staying in SG. Well, chances are this is not a majority of them and if they are, I'm sure our the government will step-in in due time to curb this problem. It is not a justification for Singaporeans to panic buy! If anything, we should be ""whistleblowing"" such people to the authorities so that they will intervene. 

(5) With regard to CCS being out-of-touch, please back up this claim because it seems like another sweeping statement boomers have you believe. 

(6) But even IF this is true (which is a big IF), please note the fallacy in the argument that CCS doesn't grocery shop and therefore we need to panic buy. So what if he is out-of-touch with grocery shopping? Does it mean there will be insufficient food for Singaporeans because he doesn't know what's in our NTUC? Heck, he is probably one of the few who actually saw how much food we have left physically in our food reserves! So even if he doesn't know what grocery shopping is like anymore, it really is NOT a legitimate reason to panic buy; if CCS doesn't know how much food we have in our reserves, then it is time to panic buy! 

(7) Let's consider a bigger IF that you raise, ""everything happens at once with all the countries we are involved in"". Please lah, this is a pandemic, not an apocalypse! It is not everyone for themselves, every countries for themselves. Furthermore, we have enough food to last Singaporeans at least 3 months. And in the case that it really does become somewhat of an apocalypse, I kid you not that if you have food supplies, you ain't gonna get away with not being hijacked/robbed. After all, that world would be a lawless one. 

You might say I am naive for trusting our government, but I am sure as hell proud of what our government has done so far with the virus that I am willing to cooperate with them in moving our society — as a whole — forward. I truly believe that if Singapore can't do it, no one can. So please stop sowing uncertainties in our society by fallaciously passing them off as ""legitimate"" reasons. Singapore government invest money into the education system in hopes that we will all learn to think logically, so please don't let their investments go to waste.

> SINGAPORE — The “irrational” panic buying of provisions in response to the raising of the country’s outbreak response level shows a “lack of trust” in the government telling Singaporeans what is the right thing to do especially during a crisis, said Jalan Besar GRC Member of Parliament Professor Yaacob Ibrahim on Wednesday (26 February).

> “Rumours and misinformation about the lack of supplies help to fuel senseless hoarding. It shows a lack of trust; chaos could have broken out leading to unimaginable losses. This is something we all don't want to happen in Singapore,” said the former communications and information minister during his Budget 2020 debate speech in Parliament.

> He noted that the rush to stock up supplies over the weekend following the 7 February announcement that the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorson) level will be raised from yellow to orange due to the COVID-19 outbreak is a reminder that “getting communications right is very important”.

> “During SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003), there was no social media. Today, we are inundated by news of all sorts of various platforms, and from friends and strangers alike,” Prof Yaacob explained.

> “The fundamental question is whether we trust the government in telling us what is the right thing to do, especially during a crisis.”

> FairPrice Group CEO Seah Kian Peng spoke in Parliament earlier on the same day about the “shopping frenzy” during the period, saying the cooperative’s measures to limit purchase of some items attracted criticisms from “a minority group”.

> Another issue of trust in the government concerns the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which some view as an attempt to stifle dissent on the internet, said Prof Yaacob.

> “There is a sense among them that the government is using this legislation for its own agenda, rather than serving the needs of all people,” he added.

> Last month in Parliament, Minister of Communications and Information S Iswaran had called it “a coincidence” that the first few cases brought under the law were against political figures and parties.

> Prof Yaacob noted that he is “all too familiar” with such concerns, citing his move to license online news sites in 2013 when he was still in the Cabinet.

> Several internet groups had then alleged that the move would kill the diversity of voices on the internet, said Prof Yaacob.

> “As it turns out, the licensing scheme did not stifle the internet at all. Many groups continue to flourish on the internet,” he added.

> “All we wanted – and I'm sure all of us can agree to this – is responsible behaviour on the internet, especially when the issues affect the lives of so many Singaporeans.”

> Prof Yaacob stressed that the issue of trust “will continue to arise” as Singapore grapple with increasingly complex issues, such as climate changes and technological advances.

> Dealing with the effects of climate change will “raise many questions” about how the government should best use its limited fiscal resources for the good of Singapore, he noted.

> “And the government would need to build trust that it is doing what is right for people, even though it means spending significant resources for a very long term period to benefit future generations,” Prof Yaacob added.

> On technology, while Singaporeans trust that the government is using the data captured – from closed-circuit television cameras in void decks and other common areas – for good, it is not the case in other countries.

> “In places like San Francisco, the residents have voted against having videos in public places. For our own digitisation efforts to succeed, people must trust that the data is collected solely for the purpose of developing useful services for them,” he said.

> By all accounts, while Singapore has done well in this area thus far, Prof Yaacob pointed out that it is not inconceivable for some people to raise the issues of data privacy.

> The emergence of data protection legislation overseas, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, may also cause some to wonder whether Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act is sufficiently rigorous.

> “My intent in raising this issue is that for all of us to be cognisant of the potential hazards awaiting us in our journey towards digitalising of our economy and society,” said Prof Yaacob.

> The questions of trust brought about by the use of technology in everyday lives can range from whether the government can protect Singaporeans from being manipulated by the big tech giants to whether Singaporeans can trust the government to use “personal data for the benefit of all Singaporeans and not (for) some political agenda”.

> “We have seen how trust is broken down in other societies leading to the rise of populism and with social media, and the rise of misinformation and alternative facts, sometimes it is unclear whether the lack of trust in government is an effect of these developments, or is it the cause of the rise of other alternative centres of trust,” he noted.

> Citing Singaporeans’ high trust in public institutions here to do what is right, Prof Yaacob suggested for the Republic to consider creating an independent digital commission to build trust in ensuring new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the use of machine learning algorithms, are used correctly.

> “We cannot avoid the nagging concerns of privacy and transparency that digitalisation will bring. If we do not deal with this early, then trust in government can be eroded,” he added.

Commentary piece by Assoc Prof Eugene K.B. Tan (SMU):  
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/fear-and-panic-singapore-wuhan-virus-12425832
> The fear and anxiety among Singaporeans has probably little to do with a lack of trust and confidence in Singapore’s ability to fight. It is perhaps more the belief that individual self-help, on top of government’s efforts, is preferred.

&nbsp;

Also from the same parliamentary budget debate session (but not mentioned in OP's Yahoo News report) ... it seems that the stockpilers, after realizing that they purchased XX-XXX kilograms of old stock (thanks to Chan Chun Sing's snarky revelation), have been requesting for refunds for their ancient rice & starting-to-mildew toilet paper. Now this is *sia suay* to the umpteeth degree ...

Udon, fresh noodles or even dried beehoon/meesua type noodles are easier digested. There was a camera pill experiment on how long instant noodles stays in the gut compared to fresh noodles and it takes way longer to digest. On one hand it fills your stomach longer, on the other hand like all processed foods it triggers more stomach acid to digest which over a long time is irritating to your gut and causes ulcers and gut cancer. Eating it occasionally is fine but eating it daily like rice is not good for your digestion.

I still see people (unsurprisingly, tends to be people of a certain age group) coughing loudly into the air in crowded areas, spitting phlegm in drains, etc. Some of them might not even give a damn, because they think if its their time to go then its fated to be so!

What’s worse, have any initiatives meant to educate these people ever worked well? Just look at the initiative trying to educate those boomers not to use bus seats as leg rest.

Now that the Wuhan virus appears to be spreading locally in our community, these people are the worst and most irresponsible! We all know how fast this virus is spreading (compared to SARS). At this stage, we are starting to be unable to trace missing links and carriers. They could potentially be dangerously spreading the virus around, before they turn to medical help (if they even have a decent medical common sense)!

With the number of cities quarantined in China, do you seriously just think this is only one “bad” flu? Such a disproportionate action means a lot. What kind of damage could these people potentially contribute to?

They could spread to someone who would then end up dying from it. They could spread to someone who then end up with permanent lung damage due to it. They will harm more than themselves. These kind of irresponsible individuals will harm us all. 

What’s worse? Many such people will never listen! They won’t care. They won’t understand. They can’t even read a pictogram, let alone understand a concept!

147,CCS to the Hoarders,2020-02-07 21:27:09,"My unpopular opinion. 

I get it that many rational people don’t want hysteria, but is there really nothing to fear about this disease? Many people are trying to equate this to flu, saying the current low single digit mortality rate (~2%) means its nothing like SARS, that this is just a “bad flu”, that the media are just fearmongering, sensationalising.

I see a lot of comments around reddit downplaying this disease, because everyone think it doesn’t concern them, thus the media is fearmongering by making it sound serious to begin with. Westerners think its just some Asian disease and the media shouldn’t report much to scare them. Younger people think the disease only kill older people with comorbidities. Etc. 

But look at the stats. The US CDC published information about influenza’s hospitalisation rate this season, which is 35.5 cases out of 100,000. Wuhan virus has a reported severe condition rate of ~15%. What is considered severe? I highly doubt it just refers to anyone requiring just hospitalisation. I’m talking about things like perhaps requiring oxygen to even being admitted to the ICU.

If there’s too many cases and if the medical system is too overwhelmed to treat those serious cases, they could die. That’s why Wuhan’s mortality rate is so much higher compared to anywhere else. This virus seemed to have a similar rate of severe disease as SARS, but unlike SARS, it can spread much faster.

We need to be very vigilant and keep it in our mind that this is not just flu. Don’t downplay this disease! We definitely shouldn’t be emptying shelves, but we definitely shouldn’t dismiss the severity and just assume media is just fearmongering. This virus is not a joke, not just some “nasty flu”.

After all, what kind of public health policy is sealing off 50 cities and 3 provinces? Is that a normal response to let’s say, flu? This response is unprecedented! Is this just something of an overkill, or is it really something serious enough to warrant this?

Tldr: don’t panic, don’t empty shelves, but most importantly, don’t just dismiss the severity of this virus. Too many people around reddit are obsessed with just reading the death rate and think this virus is nothing much. Be vigilant.",2020-02-08 08:27:42,384

All businesses save for essential services are told to work from home to stop community spread.  It makes perfect sense for households to want to stock up so that they too can do the responsible thing - ie stay at home and not head out every time the food or supplies run out. 

I was at my local 24 hr NTUC last night stocking up on fresh vegetables, so I wouldn’t have to head out every other day. People were calmly shopping, obeying the social distancing lines, and most people just had small green baskets worth of groceries (and not heaving trolleys full of toilet rolls or masks). 

That’s not hoarding - I think the majority of shoppers were just responsible citizens preparing to stay home.. 

Btw I had to queue for almost 20 mins (spaced one metre apart) cos they only had three cashiers open. Apparently the self checkout machines are closed after midnight cos of stock taking. Thought it might have eased the load for the three cashiers to open some of the self checkout lines.

It’s also not really hoarding that is an issue, but everyone having the same idea to go buy groceries at the same time, a sorta compounded, individual panic. NTUC doesn’t stock up like one egg tray per resident per day, right? Most supermarkets don’t, because buying is spread out across a week (some buy on Wed, some on Sat).

So if all residents near that NTUC thought, “Hmm, I’m gonna buy eggs now, since I’m worried about supply”, of course there’s not enough supply. Of course the NTUC going to be full. But nobody is hoarding. One person just buy one egg tray only nia. And a dozen eggs is not a lot you know?

242,Just a rant about Singapore Citizens' attitude towards this crisis.,2020-04-04 07:32:25,"Bro, if you are speaking from your heart, this is my view on the issue.

If you remember in Jan when Covid started in Wu Han many were already asking them to be stringent or restrict access of residents from Wu Han or China from coming in. They only implemented it way way later when it hit our shores already. 

Then came the mask issue. Our government has claimed that they have learned their lessons from SARS and are prepared if the next epi/pandemic arrives. Then why is there not enough mask for everybody to use on a daily basis should a epi/pandemic strikes ? To dodge the arrow, they claim that hand washing is more useful than wearing a mask. I’m not too sure if such claims are true, but I do know that if we mandate everyone to wear a mask, the infection would definitely be stopped. Then now, policy U-turn to say that mask might help. Apa ini ? Today is coronavirus, if it is some fucking infectious and deadly virus or bacteria then a certain percentage of our population would be wiped already. However, I do have to give it to them that they were willing to do a policy u turn as long as it is the right thing to do. 

The hand sanitizer is same story as the mask. Say clean hands important but when need sanitizer they ask you to wash hands. Please if I can wash hands I wash already. Can I wash hands while taking mrt or bus ? 

Now back to essential items, after the mask incident, you think the majority will still trust the government? They might have stockpiled enough essential food but what if they start bleeding out eventually and the populace is unable to get the food they require ? It is human instinct to protect themselves first if they could not trust their leader. The tribe mentality would only work if the populace has enough faith in their leaders. Which in our case is obvious that Singaporeans do not trust their leaders enough and our leaders have not truly exemplified that they are entirely trustworthy and could be relied upon.",2020-04-05 02:47:00,362

As you say. The stores are crowded. And as they panic buy, then there isn't enough for others, so there is a risk that once an item is back on the shelf (From the storage in the back or where the government is keeping it's stockpile), others will start to hoard as well, as they don't want to risk being without.

But it isn't only the buyers fault. Yes, people are idiots, and like idiots they need rules. So the shops should maybe set up specific guidelines on how much people are allowed to buy of a specific item.

As the government is handing out masks (Started with 4 per household back in February), no matter the size of the household, maybe similar restrictions would be placed in shops on things. 

1 bag of rice, 1 pack of toilet, kitchen towel and facial tissue, 5 tins, 2 packs of pasta, 3 packs of noodles, 2-3 kg of frozen meat, 0.5-1 kg of vegetables (potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes and such) and maybe 1-2 kg of fruit per purchase. or something along those lines.

A leader must be trustworthy, credible and able to tell the truth. A leader is also supposed to be able to recognise a problem before it becomes an emergency. 

A leader does not blame his followers for being sia suay when it was clear as bright as day that other countries were also panic buying. He ought to have the foresight to anticipate this and implement measures to forestall this from being the situation that it is.

If a leader inspires trust, the followers will go where he wants them to go. If a leader inspires trust, he won't have to keep flipping his stance every few days or weeks. That reeks of incompetence and being unreliable and not credible.",2020-04-04 14:00:30,159

The promise literally was that they would get upgrades first.

>At its inception in 2001, the Government made it clear that the LUP was not free of political considerations - quite the opposite.

>In announcing the LUP, then National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said that ""upgrading programmes are possible only because our people continue to support the Government"" which generates budget surpluses. ""That is why... the Government has given priority to those who have actively supported these programmes,"" he said.

>Two months before the 2001 General Election in November, Mr Mah was more blunt: ""It's only fair that we give those constituencies that have given us support, higher priority.""

This policy was abandoned in 2009

>Yet, between that election and the next, the LUP's political significance receded. The Government abandoned its earlier stance that lift upgrading would be completed in all PAP wards first.

>In 2009, it was announced that precincts in the opposition wards of Hougang and Potong Pasir would be selected for LUP, rather than be sent to the back of the queue.

China, the epicentre of the virus, and also the most strongly hit country initially, strongly implemented mask-wearing guidelines and certain provinces even made it compulsory to do so in public. that masks can provide varying degrees of protection is also something most medical students know about. 

Given how infectious and disruptive we knew the virus could be, given the available data points at that time (Wuhan China, and later on South Korea), it should be obvious that leaning towards the side of caution should be preferable. If there is yet no scientific evidence pointing either way, do you base policy on whether or not to take reasonable precautions (wearing a mask) or not given the potential consequences? 

If you chose to take unnecessary precautions, at worst you waste perhaps a few million dollars in masks. If you chose not to take necessary precautions, you end up with a currently escalating situation that costs millions if not billions to the economy, lives disrupted and for some, lost.",2020-04-04 23:21:56,169

It takes any educated guess to understand that the supply will never be able to meet the demand during this crisis. What we need is trust, see what happens yesterday? Government did their due diligence and sourced for reusable mask for everyone.
