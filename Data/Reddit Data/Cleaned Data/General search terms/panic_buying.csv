5,fg2716i,t3_ewhoco,"SINGAPORE — Singaporeans should never succumb to short-term fears and behaviours such as panic buying and hoarding of masks, as these will ""destroy the entire system"" that the Government has built to counter infectious diseases, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday (Jan 30).

Speaking to reporters at a briefing on the ongoing Wuhan situation, he said: “Such behaviours are not appropriate. They are selfish and they are not helpful for collective defence.

“Collective defence is our strongest defence. We must all act in unison, act together and not jeopardise the system by doing things that we think might benefit ourselves, protect ourselves, but to the detriment to everyone else in the society.”

The warning came after the Government released 5 million masks from the national stockpile to retailers in the past nine days, only to see them snapped up within hours of their release.

Some sellers have also tried to profit from the surge in demand. Authorities have, for instance, issued warning letters to Deen Express, a shop at 313 Somerset, which was said to be selling masks at S$68 or S$88 for a box of 20 N95 masks.

Sellers on online marketplaces Carousell and Qoo10 have also been spotted selling masks at about up to 20 times their usual retail price.

Mr Chan said Singaporeans should not support such profiteers, and should be more judicious about their use of masks, pointing out that people should only use masks when they are feeling unwell and need to leave the house to seek medical attention.

“If we do this systematically, calmly, pace ourselves, we will be able to manage our stockpile, manage the usage rate and the uncertainties,” he said.

His comments came as the Government announced it would distribute masks to all households in Singapore from Feb 1.

HOW THE GOVT MANAGES MASK STOCKPILE

The Government’s management of Singapore’s national stockpile of masks is based on three factors, said Mr Chan.

They are: How much Singapore currently has in its stockpile, how fast Singaporeans are using up the stockpile, and how many or how frequently masks can be resupplied.

But the usage rate in the past one week had greatly surpassed what would be reasonably expected, upsetting the equation, he said.

“We understand that when people are fearful, there’s a tendency to panic buy or hoard. But this is not very useful to the entire system,” he said.

“If we do not manage the private usage rate and prioritise the allocation, we will deprive our essential services, especially the healthcare services, of the masks, and this will in turn jeopardise our entire healthcare system, not allowing us to take care of those who need it the most.”

At the same briefing, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said that Singapore’s current rate of consumption of masks is “not sustainable”, especially with a global shortage of masks and likely export bans that other countries might implement, as the Wuhan situation unfolds and face their own mask supply shortages.

Pointing out that this is a “global contingency” with no signs of abating at this point, Mr Chan said Singapore cannot assume that supply lines will remain unconstrained and unaffected by “the competition of others who are taking action to secure their own supply lines”.

He cited recent news of mask producers prioritising China, the epicentre of the virus, and Taiwan banning the export of surgical masks.

He added that there are other uses of face masks now, including in Australia where a bushfire crisis continues to brew.

“Prepare for the long haul, but never, never succumb to the short-term fears and panic buying and hoarding behaviours, because these will destroy the entire system that we have,” said Mr Chan.

Mr Wong said: “Remember: At the end of the day, masks do not confer automatic protection against the virus… The best thing that every Singaporean can do to protect himself, herself and their family members is to uphold good personal hygiene.”

He added: “Wash your hands regularly with soap. Don’t touch your face with your hands, because when your hands are dirty and you touch your face without realising it – the mucous membranes, your eyes, your nose, your mouth, that is how viruses spread.”",t3_ewhoco,2020-01-31 11:02:05,FitCranberry,6,"Hoarding, panic buying of masks will wreck Singapore's efforts to fight spread of Wuhan virus: Chan Chun Sing",t3_ewhoco,56,ewhoco,https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/hoarding-panic-buying-will-destroy-singapores-system-fight-spread-wuhan-virus-chan-chun,58,2020-01-31 11:01:07,0.86,"['singapor', 'singaporean', 'never', 'succumb', 'fear', 'behaviour', 'panic', 'buy', 'hoard', 'mask', 'destroy', 'entir', 'system', 'govern', 'built', 'counter', 'infecti', 'diseas', 'trade', 'industri', 'minist', 'chan', 'chun', 'sing', 'said', 'thursday', 'jan', 'speak', 'report', 'brief', 'ongo', 'wuhan', 'situat', 'said', 'behaviour', 'appropri', 'selfish', 'help', 'collect', 'defenc', 'stori', 'continu', 'advertis', 'collect', 'defenc', 'strongest', 'defenc', 'must', 'act', 'unison', 'act', 'togeth', 'jeopardis', 'system', 'thing', 'think', 'might', 'benefit', 'protect', 'detriment', 'everyon', 'els', 'warn', 'came', 'govern', 'releas', 'million', 'mask', 'nation', 'stockpil', 'retail', 'past', 'nine', 'day', 'see', 'snap', 'within', 'hour', 'releas', 'stori', 'continu', 'advertis', 'seller', 'also', 'tri', 'profit', 'surg', 'demand', 'author', 'instanc', 'issu', 'warn', 'letter', 'deen', 'express', 'shop', 'somerset', 'said', 'sell', 'mask', 'box', 'mask', 'seller', 'onlin', 'marketplac', 'carousel', 'also', 'spot', 'sell', 'mask', 'time', 'usual', 'retail', 'price', 'read', 'also', 'govt', 'distribut', 'mask', 'million', 'singapor', 'household', 'amid', 'wuhan', 'viru', 'outbreak', 'mr', 'chan', 'said', 'singaporean', 'support', 'profit', 'judici', 'use', 'mask', 'point', 'peopl', 'use', 'mask', 'feel', 'unwel', 'need', 'leav', 'hous', 'seek', 'medic', 'attent', 'systemat', 'calmli', 'pace', 'abl', 'manag', 'stockpil', 'manag', 'usag', 'rate', 'uncertainti', 'said', 'read', 'also', 'economi', 'singapor', 'thailand', 'hardest', 'hit', 'asean', 'wuhan', 'viru', 'analyst', 'report', 'comment', 'came', 'govern', 'announc', 'would', 'distribut', 'mask', 'household', 'singapor', 'feb', 'govt', 'manag', 'mask', 'stockpil', 'govern', 'manag', 'singapor', 'nation', 'stockpil', 'mask', 'base', 'three', 'factor', 'said', 'mr', 'chan', 'read', 'also', 'wuhan', 'viru', 'onlin', 'firm', 'carousel', 'threaten', 'suspend', 'seller', 'charg', 'inflat', 'price', 'face', 'mask', 'much', 'singapor', 'current', 'stockpil', 'fast', 'singaporean', 'use', 'stockpil', 'mani', 'frequent', 'mask', 'resuppli', 'usag', 'rate', 'past', 'one', 'week', 'greatli', 'surpass', 'would', 'reason', 'expect', 'upset', 'equat', 'said', 'understand', 'peopl', 'fear', 'tendenc', 'panic', 'buy', 'hoard', 'use', 'entir', 'system', 'said', 'read', 'also', 'explain', 'resid', 'commerci', 'build', 'expos', 'wuhan', 'viru', 'disinfect', 'manag', 'privat', 'usag', 'rate', 'prioritis', 'alloc', 'depriv', 'essenti', 'servic', 'especi', 'healthcar', 'servic', 'mask', 'turn', 'jeopardis', 'entir', 'healthcar', 'system', 'allow', 'us', 'take', 'care', 'need', 'brief', 'nation', 'develop', 'minist', 'lawrenc', 'wong', 'said', 'singapor', 'current', 'rate', 'consumpt', 'mask', 'sustain', 'especi', 'global', 'shortag', 'mask', 'like', 'export', 'ban', 'countri', 'might', 'implement', 'wuhan', 'situat', 'unfold', 'face', 'mask', 'suppli', 'shortag', 'point', 'global', 'conting', 'sign', 'abat', 'point', 'mr', 'chan', 'said', 'singapor', 'assum', 'suppli', 'line', 'remain', 'unconstrain', 'unaffect', 'competit', 'other', 'take', 'action', 'secur', 'suppli', 'line', 'cite', 'recent', 'news', 'mask', 'produc', 'prioritis', 'china', 'epicentr', 'viru', 'taiwan', 'ban', 'export', 'surgic', 'mask', 'ad', 'use', 'face', 'mask', 'includ', 'australia', 'bushfir', 'crisi', 'continu', 'brew', 'prepar', 'long', 'haul', 'never', 'never', 'succumb', 'fear', 'panic', 'buy', 'hoard', 'behaviour', 'destroy', 'entir', 'system', 'said', 'mr', 'chan', 'mr', 'wong', 'said', 'rememb', 'end', 'day', 'mask', 'confer', 'automat', 'protect', 'best', 'thing', 'everi', 'singaporean', 'protect', 'famili', 'member', 'uphold', 'good', 'person', 'ad', 'wash', 'hand', 'regularli', 'soap', 'touch', 'face', 'hand', 'hand', 'dirti', 'touch', 'face', 'without', 'realis', 'mucou', 'membran', 'eye', 'nose', 'mouth', 'virus', 'spread']","SINGAPORE — Singaporeans should never succumb to short-term fears and behaviours such as panic buying and hoarding of masks, as these will ""destroy the entire system"" that the Government has built to counter infectious diseases, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday (Jan 30).

68,fkpncom,t3_fjx36o,"Let me respond to all of your points. They are, if true, definitely very legitimate concerns. But this predicate on them being true. 

(1) I assume by ""food service"", you are solely referring to them as frontline workers who sells cooked food (if you are referring to it as their involvement in our food supplies, see next point). While I do not have the data, I'd believe that there is a good mix of food services offered by people of various nationality in Singapore. Nonetheless, suppose I am wrong, it still does not justify for panic buying since the reduction in food services does not have any impact on our food supplies (again, see next point). 

(2) I really wish you would provide more concrete evidence that Singapore is solely reliant on Malaysia for food export. I highly doubt that any 1st-world government will be so unwise as to place all their dependency on one country for their essential needs. I'd, instead, rather believe that this is a bunch of hearsay which a bunch of boomers, with their vast experience theorizing conspiracies, have you believe. 

(3) Agree that the elderly shouldn't eat fast-food, if possible. But suppose we are truly at a stage of food shortage, who gives a shit about what anyone eats so long as it is food? Even if we are still compassionate when we reach that stage, how long can you keep the minced meat fresh? Longer than the food shortage is going to be here? If no, I really don't see why this line of reason justifies panic buying. 

(4) So what if those that are buying the food are Malaysians? I'd argue that a little kindness towards our neighboring country in this time is not bad diplomacy strategy. Besides, it is probably a one-off incident for people like this since they will be bringing the food back and wouldn't be allowed to come back in the near future. You might argue that they will deliver the food back through other means and continue staying in SG. Well, chances are this is not a majority of them and if they are, I'm sure our the government will step-in in due time to curb this problem. It is not a justification for Singaporeans to panic buy! If anything, we should be ""whistleblowing"" such people to the authorities so that they will intervene. 

(5) With regard to CCS being out-of-touch, please back up this claim because it seems like another sweeping statement boomers have you believe. 

(6) But even IF this is true (which is a big IF), please note the fallacy in the argument that CCS doesn't grocery shop and therefore we need to panic buy. So what if he is out-of-touch with grocery shopping? Does it mean there will be insufficient food for Singaporeans because he doesn't know what's in our NTUC? Heck, he is probably one of the few who actually saw how much food we have left physically in our food reserves! So even if he doesn't know what grocery shopping is like anymore, it really is NOT a legitimate reason to panic buy; if CCS doesn't know how much food we have in our reserves, then it is time to panic buy! 

(7) Let's consider a bigger IF that you raise, ""everything happens at once with all the countries we are involved in"". Please lah, this is a pandemic, not an apocalypse! It is not everyone for themselves, every countries for themselves. Furthermore, we have enough food to last Singaporeans at least 3 months. And in the case that it really does become somewhat of an apocalypse, I kid you not that if you have food supplies, you ain't gonna get away with not being hijacked/robbed. After all, that world would be a lawless one. 

You might say I am naive for trusting our government, but I am sure as hell proud of what our government has done so far with the virus that I am willing to cooperate with them in moving our society — as a whole — forward. I truly believe that if Singapore can't do it, no one can. So please stop sowing uncertainties in our society by fallaciously passing them off as ""legitimate"" reasons. Singapore government invest money into the education system in hopes that we will all learn to think logically, so please don't let their investments go to waste.

Heck, he is probably one of the few who actually saw how much food we have left physically in our food reserves! So even if he doesn't know what grocery shopping is like anymore, it really is NOT a legitimate reason to panic buy; if CCS doesn't know how much food we have in our reserves, then it is time to panic buy! 

(7) Let's consider a bigger IF that you raise, ""everything happens at once with all the countries we are involved in"". Please lah, this is a pandemic, not an apocalypse! It is not everyone for themselves, every countries for themselves. Furthermore, we have enough food to last Singaporeans at least 3 months. And in the case that it really does become somewhat of an apocalypse, I kid you not that if you have food supplies, you ain't gonna get away with not being hijacked/robbed. After all, that world would be a lawless one. 

You might say I am naive for trusting our government, but I am sure as hell proud of what our government has done so far with the virus that I am willing to cooperate with them in moving our society — as a whole — forward. I truly believe that if Singapore can't do it, no one can. So please stop sowing uncertainties in our society by fallaciously passing them off as ""legitimate"" reasons. Singapore government invest money into the education system in hopes that we will all learn to think logically, so please don't let their investments go to waste. To quote LHL, ""This is SG United, we are SG United"". 

P.S. I really hope this comment will age well...."

87,fitsb0s,t3_f9u8ln,"> # COVID-19: Panic buying shows 'lack of trust' in government's crisis messaging, says Yaacob Ibrahim

> SINGAPORE — The “irrational” panic buying of provisions in response to the raising of the country’s outbreak response level shows a “lack of trust” in the government telling Singaporeans what is the right thing to do especially during a crisis, said Jalan Besar GRC Member of Parliament Professor Yaacob Ibrahim on Wednesday (26 February).

> “Rumours and misinformation about the lack of supplies help to fuel senseless hoarding. It shows a lack of trust; chaos could have broken out leading to unimaginable losses. This is something we all don't want to happen in Singapore,” said the former communications and information minister during his Budget 2020 debate speech in Parliament.

> He noted that the rush to stock up supplies over the weekend following the 7 February announcement that the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorson) level will be raised from yellow to orange due to the COVID-19 outbreak is a reminder that “getting communications right is very important”.

> “During SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003), there was no social media. Today, we are inundated by news of all sorts of various platforms, and from friends and strangers alike,” Prof Yaacob explained.

> “The fundamental question is whether we trust the government in telling us what is the right thing to do, especially during a crisis.”

> FairPrice Group CEO Seah Kian Peng spoke in Parliament earlier on the same day about the “shopping frenzy” during the period, saying the cooperative’s measures to limit purchase of some items attracted criticisms from “a minority group”.

> Another issue of trust in the government concerns the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which some view as an attempt to stifle dissent on the internet, said Prof Yaacob.

> “There is a sense among them that the government is using this legislation for its own agenda, rather than serving the needs of all people,” he added.

> Last month in Parliament, Minister of Communications and Information S Iswaran had called it “a coincidence” that the first few cases brought under the law were against political figures and parties.

> Prof Yaacob noted that he is “all too familiar” with such concerns, citing his move to license online news sites in 2013 when he was still in the Cabinet.

> Several internet groups had then alleged that the move would kill the diversity of voices on the internet, said Prof Yaacob.

> “As it turns out, the licensing scheme did not stifle the internet at all. Many groups continue to flourish on the internet,” he added.

> “All we wanted – and I'm sure all of us can agree to this – is responsible behaviour on the internet, especially when the issues affect the lives of so many Singaporeans.”

> Prof Yaacob stressed that the issue of trust “will continue to arise” as Singapore grapple with increasingly complex issues, such as climate changes and technological advances.

> Dealing with the effects of climate change will “raise many questions” about how the government should best use its limited fiscal resources for the good of Singapore, he noted.

> “And the government would need to build trust that it is doing what is right for people, even though it means spending significant resources for a very long term period to benefit future generations,” Prof Yaacob added.

> On technology, while Singaporeans trust that the government is using the data captured – from closed-circuit television cameras in void decks and other common areas – for good, it is not the case in other countries.

> “In places like San Francisco, the residents have voted against having videos in public places. For our own digitisation efforts to succeed, people must trust that the data is collected solely for the purpose of developing useful services for them,” he said.

> By all accounts, while Singapore has done well in this area thus far, Prof Yaacob pointed out that it is not inconceivable for some people to raise the issues of data privacy.

> The emergence of data protection legislation overseas, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, may also cause some to wonder whether Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act is sufficiently rigorous.

> “My intent in raising this issue is that for all of us to be cognisant of the potential hazards awaiting us in our journey towards digitalising of our economy and society,” said Prof Yaacob.

> The questions of trust brought about by the use of technology in everyday lives can range from whether the government can protect Singaporeans from being manipulated by the big tech giants to whether Singaporeans can trust the government to use “personal data for the benefit of all Singaporeans and not (for) some political agenda”.

> “We have seen how trust is broken down in other societies leading to the rise of populism and with social media, and the rise of misinformation and alternative facts, sometimes it is unclear whether the lack of trust in government is an effect of these developments, or is it the cause of the rise of other alternative centres of trust,” he noted.

> Citing Singaporeans’ high trust in public institutions here to do what is right, Prof Yaacob suggested for the Republic to consider creating an independent digital commission to build trust in ensuring new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the use of machine learning algorithms, are used correctly.

> “We cannot avoid the nagging concerns of privacy and transparency that digitalisation will bring. If we do not deal with this early, then trust in government can be eroded,” he added.

> SINGAPORE — The “irrational” panic buying of provisions in response to the raising of the country’s outbreak response level shows a “lack of trust” in the government telling Singaporeans what is the right thing to do especially during a crisis, said Jalan Besar GRC Member of Parliament Professor Yaacob Ibrahim on Wednesday (26 February).

> “Rumours and misinformation about the lack of supplies help to fuel senseless hoarding. It shows a lack of trust; chaos could have broken out leading to unimaginable losses. This is something we all don't want to happen in Singapore,” said the former communications and information minister during his Budget 2020 debate speech in Parliament.

> He noted that the rush to stock up supplies over the weekend following the 7 February announcement that the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorson) level will be raised from yellow to orange due to the COVID-19 outbreak is a reminder that “getting communications right is very important”.

> “During SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003), there was no social media. Today, we are inundated by news of all sorts of various platforms, and from friends and strangers alike,” Prof Yaacob explained.

> “The fundamental question is whether we trust the government in telling us what is the right thing to do, especially during a crisis.”

> FairPrice Group CEO Seah Kian Peng spoke in Parliament earlier on the same day about the “shopping frenzy” during the period, saying the cooperative’s measures to limit purchase of some items attracted criticisms from “a minority group”.

> Another issue of trust in the government concerns the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which some view as an attempt to stifle dissent on the internet, said Prof Yaacob.

> “There is a sense among them that the government is using this legislation for its own agenda, rather than serving the needs of all people,” he added.

> Last month in Parliament, Minister of Communications and Information S Iswaran had called it “a coincidence” that the first few cases brought under the law were against political figures and parties.

> Prof Yaacob noted that he is “all too familiar” with such concerns, citing his move to license online news sites in 2013 when he was still in the Cabinet.

> Several internet groups had then alleged that the move would kill the diversity of voices on the internet, said Prof Yaacob.

> “As it turns out, the licensing scheme did not stifle the internet at all. Many groups continue to flourish on the internet,” he added.

> “All we wanted – and I'm sure all of us can agree to this – is responsible behaviour on the internet, especially when the issues affect the lives of so many Singaporeans.”

> Prof Yaacob stressed that the issue of trust “will continue to arise” as Singapore grapple with increasingly complex issues, such as climate changes and technological advances.

> Dealing with the effects of climate change will “raise many questions” about how the government should best use its limited fiscal resources for the good of Singapore, he noted.

> “And the government would need to build trust that it is doing what is right for people, even though it means spending significant resources for a very long term period to benefit future generations,” Prof Yaacob added.

> On technology, while Singaporeans trust that the government is using the data captured – from closed-circuit television cameras in void decks and other common areas – for good, it is not the case in other countries.

> “In places like San Francisco, the residents have voted against having videos in public places. For our own digitisation efforts to succeed, people must trust that the data is collected solely for the purpose of developing useful services for them,” he said.

> By all accounts, while Singapore has done well in this area thus far, Prof Yaacob pointed out that it is not inconceivable for some people to raise the issues of data privacy.

> The emergence of data protection legislation overseas, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, may also cause some to wonder whether Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act is sufficiently rigorous.

> “My intent in raising this issue is that for all of us to be cognisant of the potential hazards awaiting us in our journey towards digitalising of our economy and society,” said Prof Yaacob.

> The questions of trust brought about by the use of technology in everyday lives can range from whether the government can protect Singaporeans from being manipulated by the big tech giants to whether Singaporeans can trust the government to use “personal data for the benefit of all Singaporeans and not (for) some political agenda”.

> “We have seen how trust is broken down in other societies leading to the rise of populism and with social media, and the rise of misinformation and alternative facts, sometimes it is unclear whether the lack of trust in government is an effect of these developments, or is it the cause of the rise of other alternative centres of trust,” he noted.

> Citing Singaporeans’ high trust in public institutions here to do what is right, Prof Yaacob suggested for the Republic to consider creating an independent digital commission to build trust in ensuring new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the use of machine learning algorithms, are used correctly.

> “We cannot avoid the nagging concerns of privacy and transparency that digitalisation will bring. If we do not deal with this early, then trust in government can be eroded,” he added.

147,fguiira,t1_fgsfq43,"My unpopular opinion. 

I get it that many rational people don’t want hysteria, but is there really nothing to fear about this disease? Many people are trying to equate this to flu, saying the current low single digit mortality rate (~2%) means its nothing like SARS, that this is just a “bad flu”, that the media are just fearmongering, sensationalising.

I see a lot of comments around reddit downplaying this disease, because everyone think it doesn’t concern them, thus the media is fearmongering by making it sound serious to begin with. Westerners think its just some Asian disease and the media shouldn’t report much to scare them. Younger people think the disease only kill older people with comorbidities. Etc. 

But look at the stats. The US CDC published information about influenza’s hospitalisation rate this season, which is 35.5 cases out of 100,000. Wuhan virus has a reported severe condition rate of ~15%. What is considered severe? I highly doubt it just refers to anyone requiring just hospitalisation. I’m talking about things like perhaps requiring oxygen to even being admitted to the ICU.

If there’s too many cases and if the medical system is too overwhelmed to treat those serious cases, they could die. That’s why Wuhan’s mortality rate is so much higher compared to anywhere else. This virus seemed to have a similar rate of severe disease as SARS, but unlike SARS, it can spread much faster.

We need to be very vigilant and keep it in our mind that this is not just flu. Don’t downplay this disease! We definitely shouldn’t be emptying shelves, but we definitely shouldn’t dismiss the severity and just assume media is just fearmongering. This virus is not a joke, not just some “nasty flu”.

After all, what kind of public health policy is sealing off 50 cities and 3 provinces? Is that a normal response to let’s say, flu? This response is unprecedented! Is this just something of an overkill, or is it really something serious enough to warrant this?

After all, what kind of public health policy is sealing off 50 cities and 3 provinces? Is that a normal response to let’s say, flu? This response is unprecedented! Is this just something of an overkill, or is it really something serious enough to warrant this?

Tldr: don’t panic, don’t empty shelves, but most importantly, don’t just dismiss the severity of this virus. Too many people around reddit are obsessed with just reading the death rate and think this virus is nothing much. Be vigilant."

please drink more water and regularly exercise.

peace and love."

242,fmff9l0,t3_fuj1b5,"Bro, if you are speaking from your heart, this is my view on the issue.

If you remember in Jan when Covid started in Wu Han many were already asking them to be stringent or restrict access of residents from Wu Han or China from coming in. They only implemented it way way later when it hit our shores already. 

Then came the mask issue. Our government has claimed that they have learned their lessons from SARS and are prepared if the next epi/pandemic arrives. Then why is there not enough mask for everybody to use on a daily basis should a epi/pandemic strikes ? To dodge the arrow, they claim that hand washing is more useful than wearing a mask. I’m not too sure if such claims are true, but I do know that if we mandate everyone to wear a mask, the infection would definitely be stopped. Then now, policy U-turn to say that mask might help. Apa ini ? Today is coronavirus, if it is some fucking infectious and deadly virus or bacteria then a certain percentage of our population would be wiped already. However, I do have to give it to them that they were willing to do a policy u turn as long as it is the right thing to do. 

The hand sanitizer is same story as the mask. Say clean hands important but when need sanitizer they ask you to wash hands. Please if I can wash hands I wash already. Can I wash hands while taking mrt or bus ? 

Now back to essential items, after the mask incident, you think the majority will still trust the government? They might have stockpiled enough essential food but what if they start bleeding out eventually and the populace is unable to get the food they require ? It is human instinct to protect themselves first if they could not trust their leader. The tribe mentality would only work if the populace has enough faith in their leaders.

i would rather stock up on gold bars so that in critical moment use the gold and take flight to a safe haven. maybe no $$ to buy gold so go buy toilet papers??? also buy what.",t3_f1mo1y,2020-02-11 03:40:50,Hanzar,2,Did fake news cause the recent food hoarding problem in Singapore?,t3_f1mo1y,1,f1mo1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f1mo1y/did_fake_news_cause_the_recent_food_hoarding/,14,2020-02-10 14:58:28,0.52,"['dorscon', 'orang', 'announc', 'real', 'news', 'hoarder', 'mode', 'activ', 'overreact', 'kiasi', 'group', 'media', 'show', 'long', 'queue', 'news', 'worthi', 'report', 'hoarder', 'alarm', 'sound', 'herd', 'mode', 'activ', 'deplet', 'stock', 'suppli', 'vs', 'demand', 'gener', 'shopper', 'disappoint', 'last', 'roll', 'toilet', 'paper', 'finish', 'replenish', 'moral', 'stori', 'peopl', 'bent', 'scare', 'save', 'skin', 'peel', 'skin', 'label', 'world', 'citizen', 'btw', 'still', 'understand', 'stock', 'toilet', 'paper', 'save', 'emerg', 'situat', 'would', 'rather', 'stock', 'gold', 'bar', 'critic', 'moment', 'use', 'gold', 'take', 'flight', 'safe', 'mayb', 'buy', 'gold', 'go', 'buy', 'toilet', 'paper', 'also', 'buy']"," \- DORSCON Orange  announced (Real news)

\- Hoarders mode activated ( Overreaction from kiasi group)

\-Social media show long queue ( news worthy, out-of-proportion reporting, ownself-scare-ownself)

\-Generate more hoarders (Alarm sounded. Herd mode activated).

\-Triggered depleted stock. (Supply vs Demand)

\- General shoppers disappointed  i.e. last roll of toilet paper finished and cannot replenish.

Moral of story - If your people is bent on scaring themselves and saving their own skins by peeling on your skin, you label them as 3rd world citizens.
