> The two new community cases are the Chinatown Complex stall owner's 33-year-old son and 62-year-old wife.

> The 66-year-old stall owner and his other son, 32, were reported as COVID-19 cases on Thursday.

> The four of them form a new cluster linked to the stall owner, identified as case 60138, said MOH.

> Advertisement

> The 33-year-old son, who is unemployed, was identified as a close contact of case 60138. He was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on Feb 10.

> The Singaporean man was tested for COVID-19 on Feb 11 even though he was asymptomatic. His test result came back positive on the same day, and he was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) by ambulance.

> His serology test result has come back positive.

> The stall owner's wife, a homemaker, was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on Feb 10 when case 60138 was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection.

> The Singaporean woman was tested for COVID-19 on the same day even though she was asymptomatic. Her test came back positive on Feb 11 and she was taken to NCID in an ambulance.

> Her serology test result came back negative, indicating that this was likely a current infection.

> Epidemiological investigations are ongoing, said MOH.

> 

> EFFECTIVE CONTACT TRACING KEY: MOH

> All the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine.

> They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that asymptomatic cases can be detected.

> MOH said it will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.

> ""Effective contact tracing is an important enabler to ringfence community transmission,"" added the ministry.

> MOH noted that both stall owner's wife and 33-year-old son do not use the TraceTogether app, and while they both have TraceTogether tokens, they did not carry their tokens with them.

> ""Individuals are reminded to turn on their TraceTogether app or carry their TraceTogether token at all times so that we can quickly identify and isolate the close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and limit further infections,"" said MOH.

> Two supermarkets within shopping malls in Pasir Ris were added to MOH's list of places visited by COVID-19 cases during their infectious period.

> The NTUC FairPrice at Pasir Ris West Plaza was visited on Feb 3, Feb 6 and Feb 10, while the Sheng Siong Supermarket at Elias Mall was visited on Jan 29, Feb 5 and Feb 9.

> 16 IMPORTED CASES

> One of the imported cases, a long-term visit pass holder who arrived from Indonesia, arrived from Indonesia on Nov 26 last year and served stay-home notice at a dedicated facility until Dec 10, said MOH.

> His swab done on Dec 6 while serving his notice was negative.

> He was asymptomatic and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on Feb 10 in preparation for his return to Indonesia.

> His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, although the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load.

> His serological test result has also come back positive.

> ""He reported that before his trip to Singapore, he had interacted with his sibling in Indonesia who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection in October 2020.

> ""Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others,"" said MOH.

> Three permanent residents who returned from India and Indonesia were also among the 16 imported cases.

> One imported case is a dependant's pass holder who arrived from the UAE.

> There were also four work-pass holders who arrived from Myanmar, the Philippines and UAE among the imported cases.

> The remaining seven imported infections involved work permit holders who arrived from India, Indonesia and Myanmar. All except one of them are domestic workers.

> 11 MORE CASES DISCHARGED

> MOH said on Friday 11 more COVID-19 cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. A total of 59,569 patients have fully recovered from the infection.

> There are now 31 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, with one patient in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

MOH believes that he was not infectious while he was in Singapore. He was exposed to a Covid-positive sibling in October, recovered and was PCR-negative during his SHN in December. He must be one of those guys who on-and-off sheds viral remnants for a long time after recovery.

From the research done by NCID, MOH discharges people who continue to test slightly PCR-positive 21 days after their first positive test assuming symptoms have resolved. They have enough data to feel confident that these long-shedders are not infectious.

14,2 community cases among 18 COVID-19 infections in Singapore; new cluster formed at Chinatown Complex,2021-02-13 00:29:27,"An important question to ask is if we really want to reach the state of New Zealand or Australia, with absolutely zero transmission. Eventually, the world will reopen, and naturally, infections will happen again. The vaccine isn't 100% and some people can't get it because of allergies or preexisting conditions. However, we can manage the risk while opening up by slowly relaxing lockdown restrictions, rather than suddenly returning to 2019. Some people will still get sick, but we won't have a US or Europe style uncontrolled spread if we maintain some social distancing and vaccinate quickly. This way, the economy can still keep running, and the citizens can mostly resume our daily life.

New Zealand and Australia have a mostly self-sufficient economy and can survive as a hermit for years until their population is vaccinated. We rely on foreign workers to supplement our workforce, and foreign trade to supply our basic goods. Locking down completely will cause companies to close, jobs lost, and ultimately more suffering for workers. Once again, risk management is key. Our hospitals can cope with a small number of cases; the mortality rate in Singapore is tiny compared to overseas where hospitals got overloaded. As long as this low infection rate is maintained, and incoming foreigners tested and quarantined,  the current situation is sustainable.",2021-02-13 09:15:14,212

One is a symptomatic SG citizen who developed symptoms the same day after her test, but did not report her symptoms and only went to NUH 1 day after SHN ended.

Another imported case is a work permit holder who arrived on 28 Dec. His SHN ended on 11 Jan and had 3 negative tests. The latest test is positive but with low viral load, indicating it's likely past infection.

1 of the community cases is unlinked, symptomatic, and works at Kallang. This appeared out of nowhere once again, which is quite worrying. It might be an indication of a wider hidden community spread than we realise.

3 of the linked cases are not that surprising, given that they are close contact.

1 of the linked case is a primary school kid who went to school two days before testing positive. However, MOH says that he tested negative the day before so there is ""no risk of transmission"" to other students. I'm not so sure about that because the test could have been a false negative and the time frame is too close.

However, if you CB earlier to squash any existent cases before it spreads too far, you might save yourself from an even longer (potentially months long) CB further down the line. Like maybe a 2 week CB right now, monitoring the cases, would be sufficient to allow for this mini-bubble of cases to peter out.

CB is needed when there are too many unidentified source infections in the community, which is now. Most of the recent cases, other than being labelled as linked to each other, they’ve failed to identify the source of the infection and isolate it. Therefore, CB need to comes in, to break everyone up for 2 weeks to minimise spread. You can have your social lives back when this outbreak is nipped at its bud.

> His result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day and he was taken to NCID. His Ct value is ""very high"", which is indicative of a low viral load, and his serology test result has come back positive.

> 

> INCREASE IN UNLINKED COMMUNITY CASES: MOH

> Since Jan 13, seven community cases have been linked to a police K-9 unit.

> On Tuesday, two of the newly reported community cases were linked to a food processing worker at Golden Bridge Foods Manufacturing who tested positive last week, forming a new cluster.

> 

> Amid an increase in the number of community cases, a pilot programme for some nightclubs and karaoke outlets to reopen has been deferred until further notice.

> This is to prevent the risk of further community transmission and formation of clusters in ""high-risk settings"", said the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Trade and Industry on Tuesday.

> Such settings entail people coming into close contact for prolonged periods of time and in enclosed spaces, the ministries added.

> The ministries said it was uncertain when the pilot would be able to start given the ""dynamic public health situation"", and that it would review the start of the pilot at a suitable juncture.

> SINGAPORE: The last COVID-19 cluster in a migrant worker dormitory has closed, meaning there are no active clusters in Singapore since the pandemic began.

> 

> The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced the closure of the cluster at Cassia @ Penjuru dormitory on Tuesday (Nov 24), after 28 consecutive days with no new infection linked to it.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""With the closure of this cluster, there are no active COVID-19 clusters for the first time since Feb 3, 2020,"" said MOH on Tuesday.

> Since the first COVID-19 case was reported in Singapore on Jan 23, the tally of cases has grown to more than 58,000 cases, with 28 fatalities from the disease.

> The first cluster was reported on Feb 4, at the Yong Thai Hang Medical Hall, a Chinese medicine shop that primarily served tourists from China.

> Three days later, Singapore's Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level was raised from Yellow to Orange, as more local cases emerged without links to previous cases or travel history to China.

> 

> 

> Soon more clusters sprung up, including at the Life Church and Missions Singapore, the Grand Hyatt Hotel, the Grace Assembly of God church and the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.

> Contact tracing efforts drew a link between the Life Church and Missions and the Grace Assembly of God clusters, with serological testing used for the first time to uncover the link.

> Advertisement

> In the first week of March, a new cluster linked to an event at SAFRA Jurong was identified. The cluster, which included several elderly people, grew in numbers throughout the rest of the month.

> Even as more safety measures were enacted, including cancelling or deferring all ticketed cultural, sports and entertainment events with 250 participants or more, the number of local cases increased and surpassed 200 infections by mid-March.

> By the end of March, three people had died from COVID-19 in Singapore. Several new clusters are announced, including one at the S11 dormitory in Punggol.

> This would become the first of dozens of dormitory clusters as the coronavirus spread across the dormitories.

> 

> There have been more than 54,500 cases linked to foreign worker dormitories, since the first two infections were reported on Mar 29.

> The number of infections in the dormitories peaked at more than 1,000 a day, before it reduced slightly to hundreds of new cases daily.

> 

> Singapore entered a circuit breaker on Apr 7, with the aim of curbing the spread of the coronavirus in the community, while isolation measures were enforced to contain the growing clusters in the dormitories.

> 

> The cluster at the Thomson Lane branch of Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home was identified in April, the first involving a nursing care home.

> As the circuit breaker continued, local cases started to decline, leading to clusters closing.

> But in the dormitories, the rising COVID-19 cases did not ease immediately, despite stringent isolation measures and testing.

> RE-EMERGED CLUSTERS ALL CLOSED

> After months of testing and isolation, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Aug 19 declared that all dormitories were cleared of COVID-19.

> 

> But three days later, a new cluster was identified at Sungei Tengah Lodge, Singapore’s biggest purpose-built dormitory and one that was previously cleared of COVID-19 on Jul 21.

> The new cluster at Sungei Tengah would grow to 216 cases.

> 

> Worker dormitory Sungei Tengah Lodge at Old Choa Chu Kang Road was declared an isolation area after a spike of COVID-19 cases there.

> Less than a month later, 21 new clusters were identified at dormitories that had been previously cleared of COVID-19.

> The biggest of these new clusters was at Sungei Tengah, followed by Avery Lodge Dormitory, Westlite Toh Guan and CDPL Tuas Dormitory.

> Stringent routine testing began and about 900 new cases in total emerged from these clusters.

> It was “part of the plan” for cases to be detected through rostered routine testing, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.

> Hundreds of thousands of workers residing in dormitories were scheduled for rostered routine testing. Employers were warned by the authorities that workers who had not been scheduled for the testing were not allowed to return to work.

> 

> 

> The daily number of new cases at the dormitories fell into the single digits, and on Oct 13, Singapore reported no new case there for the first time in more than six months.

> New daily infections in dormitories then hovered between zero and two cases for the rest of October and into November, as MOH started closing the new clusters.

> On Tuesday, the last dormitory cluster – at Cassia @ Penjuru – was closed, bringing an end to active clusters in Singapore.

If you wanna talk about spreading covid-19 at schools: you should see how many students come in sick lol. The Teachers are at risk themselves but schools have placed much more social distancing rules than any other workplaces or public places out there.

This isn’t weak leadership. If anything, the government has put in due consideration. No plan is perfect and we’re still hoping things improve.

249,"Singapore reports 73 new COVID-19 cases, new cluster involving PCF Sparkletots centre linked to 18 cases",2020-03-25 22:09:29,"Actually the study recommends a full combination of measures if the end goal is to bring the cases down to lowest possible number quickly before it gets exponential. i.e. Quarantine + 50% workplace closure + school closure for 2 weeks. But of course this doesn't take into account economic impact. 

They do cite workplace closure as higher priority as identified work as a higher-risk area vs schools due to various factors (e.g. adults more likely to be symptomatic, kids more likely to stay home when sick), but have acknowledged kids could be transmitting virus within home community, which our recent cases and overseas situation have proven.

""The location of infection (school, workplace, or home community) was determined according to the site where individuals were exposed to the virus (table). Owing to behaviours of school absenteeism and work-distancing presenteeism, the number of infections acquired at work consistently exceeded those at school, although students could be transmitting the virus within the home community.""

At the time of writing their study, SG had 243 cases - this was ~16 March. The global and local situation has evolved rapidly since then. More cases around the world and in SG have shown kids to be a vector, and I think this is something the government is realising and starting to look into.

Work in frontlines? Work in F&B places? So if we mandate work from home - they won’t be able to keep an income. Our country does not function like other places where they give out generous welfare packages to employers. (Eg UK - where Boris has said to guarantee 80% of pay) although that would reaaaaaaallly help. 

Next, where do we get the extra staff who will work in childcare to fit in the extra demand then? So schools close but childcare centres are ok?

In other countries where schools shut down in short notice - most of them did not take as stringent measures initially as SG did, and this comes as a shock + whole load of work for teachers who did not have time to prep. Even so, those countries allow home tutoring. This is not new to them. Singapore has never been as strong in this although we have been introducing home based learning gradually. Of course, we can still learn if this is enforced.

The fact that now we have not closed schools yet, and have the time to prep for home based learning - is a luxury. I just hope to point this out that we are doing better than we thought but I agree such measures can be looked into if things get worse.

294,"Singapore reports 73 new COVID-19 cases, new cluster involving PCF Sparkletots centre linked to 18 cases",2020-03-25 22:09:29,"Lmao. Are you actually being serious? 

So kids can don’t go to school, but stay in a childcare for an extended period instead, and not learn anything as useful? Great argument. 

Companies can mandate that, whether they can maintain that and still keep up with KPI is another story. 

Parents who work from home are *working*. So do you expect them to put more kids in a childcare too? Or sacrifice their work to ensure kids learn?

Let me quote another country.
In UK - Oxford University researchers have also just argued that the predicted outcome by Imperial College London (that the Govt followed) has not counted in several factors and predicted death rates may be an exaggeration.
This means that the lockdown in UK might be a mistake as it may be an extremely disproportionate response to the virus. While they are still conducting more tests, if this lockdown is a mistake - It just cost them 350 billion pounds.


The whole point of not going into a lockdown rashly is to minimise all of these disruptions to folks from all kinds of background and economic losses that we might take years to recover from.

I’ve established plenty that to insist on a lockdown recklessly is selfish, limiting and stupid. 
It should only be done when we have no choice but to give up our personal freedom to fight this spread.

The infected areas or nearby areas are closed down immediately for disinfection and afterwards heighten their cleaning schedule (e.g. wiping 4 times a day). 

Contract tracing is also done so they call to track  but also notify all the people that has interacted with the infected person to self quarantine. The police are also involved to investigate cases when patient got it from unknown source which allows us to discover new clusters.

329,"Singapore's First 2 Covid-19 Clusters Offically Inactive, All Related Cases Recovered & Discharged",2020-03-12 12:25:35,"I can only speak to Taiwan as I'm not super familiar with the other Asian countries (though I expect there are quite a few commonalities).

(1) Travel restrictions AND SCREENING at ports of entry. Travel restrictions are just half the formula, because unless you shut down ALL travel all it does is reduce the potential incoming flow, it doesn't eliminate it altogether. It's fallacious to assume that only entrants from Wuhan were dangerous in late January, it's fallacious to assume that only entrants from China were dangerous in late February, and it's fallacious to assume that only entrants from China/Europe are dangerous today. Those are higher-risk regions, but even low-risk regions have some risk, so you need to reduce it further with proper screening.

(2) Widespread availability and utilization of health care resources, including testing. Taiwan has a robust public health care system. When I worked in Taiwan I often made fun of my coworkers for going to the doctor for every little thing. ""Why are you wasting your time, they'll just tell you to drink lots of liquids and get plenty of sleep,"" I'd joke before they went to see the doctor and inevitably got told to drink lots of liquids and get plenty of sleep. Of course from their point of view it makes perfect sense to see the doctor every time you have some sniffles if it costs you next to nothing. This may be somewhat wasteful in normal times (I can tell you a funny story about a coworker of mine who, locked out of his apartment, figured it would be cheaper to go to the hospital than call a locksmith so he cut himself up breaking into his own apartment through a broken window. Turns out he was right - the subsequent hospital visit was very cheap.) But this excess health care capacity gives you the flex to respond to a crisis. So Taiwanese default behavior - visit the doctor for even minor symptoms - was pre-optimized to identify and isolate cases quickly. Of course you need the testing capacity to make this work, but the government did a good job of anticipating the need here early.

(3) Good social distancing and disease containment measures practiced by the entire society. Public spaces were regularly cleaned by local governments/businesses/private individuals. Personal hygiene standards are high, etc.",2020-03-12 17:08:53,377

The only place Singapore has to worry about is Singapore. The United States, alone, has some 300+ cities with +100k populations each to damage control with in the event of a widespread epidemic. China has more cities with >1 million people than the EU and US combined.

Like if NYC is completely overwhelmed, you don't have an issue with NYC, you have an issue with the entire eastern seaboard because people travel and you've got to divide attention and resources between wherever these people decided to go.

Like look at Italy. Italy now has a problem with the entirety of fucking Italy because they couldn't contain it to the places it started. Italy can't use all their resources on one city because it's not one city that has a problem.

Singapore only has to fight on one front. There's only one major area you have to divide resources and attention between, not literally hundreds if not thousands of population centers seperated by hundreds and thousands of kilometers.",2020-03-12 17:13:33,164

I guess I needed to be clearer that I was referring to the earlier comment you responded to, specifically the portion on “living on the edge of a knife”. This does not “go for any city” (not nation).

NYC as a city will not divide resources (presumably) and pour those into effort to tackle problems within NYC. When that fails, presumably their backup is Federal resources and/or help from other more fortunate states.

Singapore (and any city state) does not have that luxury of backup, thus living on the edge of a knife. And hence it also tends to be more paranoid than “any city” in larger nations.",2020-03-12 17:59:58,135

The event is like a gathering event where people sing (could be a competition, could be not) whilst the audience have like dinner meals in banquet style (not buffet guaranteed), I foresee AT LEAST 10-15 tables of crowd. I think this actually raises the need of using sharing spoon for banquet meals... Not sure whether all the cases sitting on the same table (it’ll be good if it’s like that, at least the spread is contained somehow)

My parent were at Safra for another similar event (despite telling not to <facepalm>), I think a walkable distance between both. 

Temperature and crowd recordings were taken at the event for precaution measures and my parent received the contact tracing call from MOH too (for precaution even though it’s different event halls) after they discover the cluster.

Its like she scared to go to the doctor cause she thinks she might have something which is fucking irresponsible.

I feel like all these people with symptom legit scared to go down to the CDC to check because they know they arent well but they are trying to proof everyone they are well hence they go to event and work. WHICH IS FUCKING IRRESPONSIBLE!!

I feel like it's an office culture thing also. I offered to come back to work earlier when I recovered (I recovered after 2 days into the 5 days, so no symptoms anymore and not feeling sick) and/or work from home, but since I would need to retrieve my work laptop, they told me to just stay home and rest until my MC was done.

Then test everyone and those positive ones with mild symptoms dont get hospital stay or isolation ward. Instead get to go home by themselves so using public transport or cab or whatever and expect them to stay at home. Which obviously didnt work",2020-03-05 21:10:29,70

By doctor hopping, she was basically presenting with a standard URTI for the first time in each clinic. The final GP she went to had probably probed a lot more or the patient herself had volunteered more information which gave the doctor a good reason to look her up in the system. Doctor noticed a series of clinic visits, and decided to send her in for testing.

Always stick to the same doctor if you feel like you are not recovering. Best is to just have one primary care doctor that knows your entire history. Or polyclinic which can access. Everything electronically la..",2020-03-05 21:24:39,132

For example, the priest I chose to officiate my wedding has gone on sabbatical and will be replaced with another. Who am I to get upset over this? It literally feels like fate to me, something beyond my control.

However, we are also given free will to make our own choices. God helps those who help themselves. You can't just do whatever and then expect God to protect you. I see patients everyday and while I believe if I am meant to get infected, I will get infected, I still use my PPE at work and practice good hand hygiene etc. So yeah, I would just tell your fam that God gave them free will and a brain to think.

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (13 April) confirmed a record daily rise of 386 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total to 2,918 here.

> The announcement comes a day after authorities here announced 233 cases, the third single-day highest figure reported thus far, following last Thursday’s confirmation of 287 cases.

> On Sunday, 32 more patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing the total of recovered patients to 560.

> Most of the 976 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while 31 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. A total of 988 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Eight have died from complications due to COVID-19 infection, including a 90-year-old Singaporean man who succumbed to the disease on Saturday.

> At least 17 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including the largest cluster at S11 Dormitory@Punggol, which is linked to 365 cases.

> Eight such dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, including the newly confirmed cluster at Acacia Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.

> As of Sunday noon, the MOH has identified 28,140 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 12,088 are currently quarantined, and 16,052 have completed their quarantine.

> As of 7 April noon, 72,680 swab tests have been carried out, of which 47,486 of them involved unique individuals. 

> The COVID-19 Temporary Measures Act, passed in Parliament on Tuesday, gives authorities the power to ban events and gatherings, or impose conditions on how they are conducted, during the “circuit breaker” period lasting till 4 May.

> Those caught flouting these regulations will be fined $300 and subsequently face prosecution for repeated offences.

> Under the Act, the penalty for first-time offenders is up to a $10,000 fine, a jail term of up to six months, or both. For second-time or subsequent offenders, the penalty is a fine of up to $20,000 along with a possible jail term of up to a year.

> People who flout their five-day medical leave or stay-home notices and do not wear masks if they have to leave their place of accommodation to seek emergency medical treatment are also subjected to similar penalties.

> Part of the “circuit breaker” measures – announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Friday – include the closure of schools and most workplaces. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, transport, and key banking services will remain open during the month-long closure.

> In a Good Friday address, Lee reiterated his call for Singaporeans to stay home, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in foreign worker dormitories as well as in the general population.

> Over the weekend, the authorities issued a slew of measures, including the closure of beaches, facilities in parks and gardens and playfields.

> Wearing masks was also made compulsory for commuters on public transport, as well as while those visiting supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies, and shopping malls.

> Stadiums have also been closed, while parents are not allowed to drop off their children with grandparents on a daily basis.

> Separately, all Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning from overseas apart from Hubei province must serve the 14-day stay-home notice, while those returning from Hubei must serve a 14-day quarantine.

> All short-term visitors are barred from entering or transiting via Singapore.

> On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced an additional $5.1 billion Solidarity Budget to help businesses, workers and households.

> The government’s response to COVID-19 will total $59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product.

> To date, there are over 1.8 million COVID-19 cases globally. More than 115,000 have died from the virus, with the US holding the record for the highest global death toll at over 22,000.

> At over half a million cases, the country also holds the record of having the largest number of patients globally, followed by Spain at over 169,000 cases, Italy at over 156,000, followed by France at over 132,000.

> China, where the virus originated, has over 82,000 cases and earlier last Tuesday reported no new coronavirus deaths for the first time since it started publishing figures in January.

It isn't excessive or undue, but the result of people being over confident that the system will not and cannot fail.

What people really want to know is, is it dorms (or other migrant worker accommodations) or HDBs/condos? And local/PR vs WP is one way to estimate this.

Aside from a one off event where people were panic-buying, there hasn't really been much panic around it. This is largely also because of how transparent the Ministry of Health have been about the cases and the amazing work they did (contact tracing, testing etc), tracing most of the cases and taking many preventive measures. There isn't any panic-buying also because the government and supermarkets have come out to show their extensive stockpiles (9 million+ rolls of toilet paper, millions of instant noodles, extensive stock of rice etc).

So far there hasn't been any closing of entertainment venues but I think they've been disencouraging large scale gatherings, implementing measures in schools to reduce the gathering of large amounts of students.

Only thing is the government saying there's no need to wear masks unless we're sick so I would say but my observations only about 1/3 of the people wear masks on public transport etc. On the good side many people have been taking extra care of their personal hygiene and i've seen almost everyone taking their time to wash their hands properly in the toilet etc.",2020-02-29 10:51:31,214

> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 66 new COVID-19 cases on Monday (Apr 6), bringing the national total to 1,375, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily update.

> 

> One of the new cases is imported and the remaining cases are locally transmitted. Twenty-four more patients have been discharged, taking the total number of people who have fully recovered to 344.

> Among the local cases, MOH has established links to existing clusters for 35 cases. Of these, 24 are linked to clusters at foreign dormitories and 11 are linked to non-dormitory clusters.

> A total of 30 of the new cases are unlinked, and contact tracing is ongoing for these patients.

> 

> A total of 571 patients are still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, and 25 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Two new clusters were also identified, according to the Ministry. They are Little Gems Preschool and Kranji Lodge.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that Singapore has been conducting around 2,000 coronavirus tests daily. As of Monday, the country has conducted more than 65,000 tests.

> He provided these numbers in a written answer on Monday to a parliamentary question by Nominated Member of Parliament Walter Theseira.

> Assoc Prof Theseira had also asked if the Ministry of health will report any other national health statistics relating to COVID-19 to enable researchers to gather ""internationally comparable datasets"" on the pandemic.

> ""The Ministry of Health reports the relevant COVID-19 information and statistics regularly to keep Singaporeans updated. We also share information on the number of tests conducted from time to time where relevant,"" said Mr Gan in his reply.

> 

> THIRD SUPPORT PACKAGE TO SUPPORT SINGAPORE

> As part of the country's ongoing battle against COVID-19, a third support package announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Monday.

> The S$5.1 billion Solidarity Budget is aimed at saving jobs and protecting livelihoods during the four weeks when schools and non-essential businesses have to be shut as part of the “circuit breaker” distancing measures that will kick in from Tuesday.

> From Tuesday, most workplaces islandwide will be closed and schools will move to full home-based learning, as announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last week. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open.

> Mr Heng said on Monday the COVID-19 pandemic had ""exploded"" in Singapore in recent days. To date, Singapore has seen six COVID-19 fatalities.

> Singapore has “progressively” ramped up its measures but as the number of infections – especially local transmitted cases – kept rising in recent days, the Government decided to roll out an “extraordinary” set of “circuit breaker” measures to pre-empt the escalation, he said.

> 

> This is the first time that the Singapore Government has released three Budgets in less than two months, following the S$6.4 billion Unity Budget in February and the record-breaking S$48 billion Resilience Budget on Mar 26.

> To fund this third booster, the Government has sought permission from President Halimah Yacob to draw an additional S$4 billion from past reserves, on top of the S$17 billion tapped for the Resilience Budget.

> Altogether, Singapore will be committing S$59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), for this battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.

As a result, fomite spread is much more limited and thus the spread is more easily curbed.

AC rooms, office buildings and vehicles would still have fomites that last up to 9 days, however. It would not eliminate the spread, but it would lessen it.",2020-02-28 21:18:08,80

> The study concludes that temperature has significant impact on the transmission of COVID-19. 
There might be nonlinear dose-response relationship between the two, indicating that there is a best 
temperature contributing to its transmission and that low temperature is beneficial to the viral 
transmission. The emergence of the outbreak in Wuhan and its neighboring areas may be closely 
related to the local temperature. For countries and regions with a lower temperature, strict prevention 
and control measures should be continued to prevent future reversal of the epidemic.",2020-02-28 21:10:51,97

If your not a shill your a very sad person.

>In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1℃ increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. Conclusion The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan.

1℃ means less 0.86 less cumulative number, means thats *not a relevant factor.*

Thank-you for your comment, but unfortunately it has been removed because it links to Facebook. Facebook is designed to contain a lot of private and personal information, usually found in comments in the form of photos and names. This basically makes Facebook incompatible with the [rules of reddit](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183175-Is-posting-someone-s-private-or-personal-information-okay-). 

Here are some alternatives...

 * if it's a photo you want to show, you can download it or screenshot it and upload it to an anonymous image file hosting website like imgur.com or minus.com. If it has some personal info on it, you should probably block that out (blur, black rectangles).  And don't forget to read the image rules on /r/atheism before posting.
 
 * if it's a special Facebook page, you can just mention its name and remind users to use the inner Facebook search engine

 * if it's a discussion, you can take a screenshot (and color out or blur names and faces) and upload it to some image file hosting website...  or you can copy/paste the text content

 * if it's a video, try looking for a copy of that video on some other website, like YouTube, it may already be posted. If you can't find it and can't download and upload the video somewhere else, the best idea is to summarize the points in the video or describe the relevant parts of it.
