> The government has been ""transparent"" and ""upfront"" about the way it has dealt with Covid-19, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong stressed at a press conference on July 7.

> Wong was responding to a question about how Singaporean voters will assess the performance of the Covid-19 task force in the upcoming elections and whether the task force's handling of the Covid-19 situation will ""work in PAP's favour.""

> Wong replied:

> ""At the end of the day Singaporeans will have to judge. We are in election campaign now, we have been transparent, upfront with Singaporeans about the way we have dealt with Covid-19.""

> Covid-19 task force's achievements highlighted

> Wong then added that the task force had been meeting the media on a weekly basis, even during the campaigning period.

> ""We have been meeting the media, every week, even now during the campaign, we have continued to meet regularly and to deal with the situation as best as we can.""

> He also highlighted the outcomes that the task force had achieved thus far, such as:

> Bringing down infection rates in the community ""significantly"", and protecting Singaporeans, ""especially the vulnerable ones"",

> Achieving one of the world's lowest fatality rates from the virus,

> Mounting a massive effort to resolve the outbreak of Covid-19 among migrant workers.

> On the last outcome, Wong added,""We do not know of any other country that has mounted as significant an operation as Singapore has, taking care of their migrant workers.""

> Over 50 per cent of all migrant workers have been tested for Covid-19

> Emphasising that the government had ""moved in swiftly"" to deal with the situation, Wong said that the government was now in the process of testing all of the migrant workers, with over 50 per cent of the tests done.

> The tests were expected to be ""almost entirely completed by the end of this month, maybe slightly beyond that"".

> Wong also highlighted that apart from the migrant workers' health, the task force had also taken efforts to take care of their well-being, food and salaries, ensuring that they were still paid.

> As per the minister:

> ""We have done everything we can to ensure the overall well being of these workers because we know that they are an important part of our society. We want to do everything we can to take care of them, because they have contributed much to Singapore.""

> Wong then added that much still remained to be done and summed up the performance of the task as such:

> ""So whether it's community infections, fatality rates or migrant workers, these are the facts. This is what we have gone over the last six months working continuously.""

https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/2020/04/06/four-doctors-proven-right-to-have-advised-singaporeans-to-wear-masks-early-in-covid-19-outbreak/

SGreans are pretty trusting of the G, hence the majority didn't mask up and saw no need to DIY masks or procure cloth masks unlike the Taiwanese. Taiwan (both people and govt) were distrusting of China, that's why they mounted a strong and successful response.

> Prof Mak reminded people that the virus is spread via droplets with no evidence that it is airborne.

> “Be aware of things you commonly touch. The thing most commonly touched is your phone, so wearing a mask is not the most important thing,” he added.

In the end, we all have to mask up and the main purpose is to prevent spreading infectious droplets and to reduce/prevent breathing in other's droplets. While masking is not the most important thing, it is a very important thing and the early adoption was actively discouragement.

I'm not saying the G didn't respond well to COVID-19 at all fronts. I give it to you that the G mounted a strong coordinated response to COVID-19, but for masks at least, they screwed up initially (but will never admit). I have no opinion regarding the dorm cases, as I've not analysed the arguments from both camps. For masks, I should know because I've been following closely the unfolding of this pandemic for about 1-2 months* from (I think) mid-January, and know enough to advise on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fbsdup/short_of_melding_people_into_their_homes_masking/) the wearing of masks, any mask at all, on 1st March, which is 1 month before 3rd April when the G finally changed their stance on masks.

> The mask advisory was from WHO 

The use of WHO is appealing to authority. It's also used to devolve responsibility of one's action to.

> and not much was known about the virus

Anyone who saw videos of people being beaten up by the enforcers for not wearing masks, and people being welded into their apartments in China would know how infectious and dangerous it is, and see the measures their government took to be able to infer that wearing mask is probably something important to reduce infection while to the outside world, China kept downplaying the seriousness. To quote a redditors or someone, ""Do as they do, not as they say."" i.e. Don't blindly believe what the Chinese govt say, but look at what they are doing.""

>“What is the opposition’s job? It’s not to help the PAP do a better job! Their job is to make life miserable for me so that I screw up and they can come in and sit where I am here and take charge.

>“Right now we have Low Thia Khiang, we have Chiam, we have Steve Chia. So can deal with them, it’s ok. But supposing you had a Parliament with 10, 15, 20 opposition members out of 80.

>“Then, instead of spending my time thinking of what is the right policy for Singapore, I’m going to spend all my time – I have to spend all my time – thinking what is the right way to fix them, what is the right way to buy own my supporters over, how can I solve this week’s problem and forget about next year’s challenges?”

She is contemplating to vote for the opposition because ""people tell me it is OK to vote for the opposition because PAP will still run the government"".

* Does she really want to vote in the opposition? Or just because ""my friend said so""?
* Does she understand the point of voting in opposition and how it helps the country?
* Can she distinguish between a credible opposition candidate vs a clown?

And she went to SM Teo for advice? IMO this shows that she trusts him as her MP. So why is she even thinking about voting in the opposition?

In this example, this would not be very fair to the PAP. If everyone thinks this way, the PAP will lose votes even if they did a good job (I do think they are doing a good job generally, even though I have beef with some of their policies).

Ultimately, ""every vote counts"" is true, and everyone needs to consider very carefully what they think is best for the country forward. Take time to find out more if necessary, not because ""everyone else is doing it"".",2020-09-02 17:28:01,195

In this case, it’s unfair because then you’re not voting based on the merit of the candidate or how well the government has performed. 

I do see this kind of mentality online during the election period (on reddit as well) where people say vote for opposition even if your opposition is hopeless. Just because they want to narrow the vote margin and they think that “anyway PAP will win so just vote opposition” which I feel is unfair for the reasons I previously stated.

""The Singapore Constitution requires each term of Government to keep a balanced budget. This means that at the end of its term, a Government should not run into deficit.

However, it can accumulate surpluses over its term, which spans several FYs.

Under each term of Government, any surplus accrued at the end of an FY will be kept as current reserves which the Government can tap on, if necessary, in subsequent FYs during its term.""",2020-09-02 16:16:47,119

P.S. there are paid LA and volunteer LA. 

You are fucking insane if you think a sub 1.3k monthly LA is writing Pritam’s speech and doing actual research. Btw, I know LHL ex-speech writer also, he was earning 9k a month 10 years ago. 

WP research team and speech writers are full of lawyers and other industry leaders who were on volunteer, the new 1.3k x 3 is just going to help with buying food and other nice things for the already established research team. Even PAP uses volunteers to do their writing and research just that they have more paid full time staff because larger budget. Not to mention ministers have entire ministry machinery to help write their speech. For example my friend who wrote speeches for LHL was a civil servant so his bill is paid for by government budget and not PAP. To compare this vs the 1.3k x 3 for Pritam and thus saying Pritam now has full time paid staff is a joke. 

(Also not even sure the money has kicked in or if WP has even hired people with the money already not as it’s literally just a few weeks since the announcement. I’ll be impressed if the new hire can immediately start to write Pritam’s speech)",2020-09-02 19:24:58,221

Your whole response is basically giant strawman. You said
> Pretty sure for Pritam they are **all volunteers and not professionals whom are paid**.

I say there are **3 paid** LAs assigned to him. Part-time no doubt but clearly paid and not volunteers.
You then shift the goalpost and go on to say 
>there are paid LA and volunteer LA.

Congrats you are right, I never questioned that. So are you effectively admitting that Pritam does indeed have PAID LAs? You then go into a spiel about how much they are paid and since you seem to be in the know I'll take your word for it. So taking your word for it, if Pritam's volunteers are all as you say ""full of lawyers and other industry leaders"" then does it really matter much whether ministers have the entire ministry backing them? I'd rather have 1 industry leader than 10 LAs doing research for my speech. Also if all those LAs supposedly do for 1.3k a month is tapao food then sign me the fuck up cause i'm pretty sure on the JD at least doing research is part of their job.

And for your final kicker you say 
>To compare this vs the 1.3k x 3 for Pritam and thus saying Pritam now has full time paid staff is a joke.

I **NEVER** actually said he has ""full time paid staff"" anywhere in my earlier comments. I said ""Pritam has his own team and researchers now to prepare his speeches FYI"". If anything your anecdotes have shown that maybe he doesn't even need the LAs given the current team he has supporting him. All you've done is drawn up strawmans that I never said and shot them down.

724,[LIVE HD] PM Lee Hsien Loong speaks in Parliament on Singapore's response to COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-02 14:55:55,"There are no 3 paid LA assigned to him btw. Is allowance for 3 x 1.3k money.

I stand by my original statement. It’s 100% volunteers. And I know the research team of WP because I’ve met them b4. There is no full time LA in WP. At least not when I met them a couple years back and I don’t think anything has changed. This is very different from PAP who actually have full time LA and some part time LA + volunteers. 

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/unseen-backbone-of-parliament

So the only question is what has the 3 x 1.3k change anything. Honestly the increase in allowance means nothing and did not change anything meaningful to WP’s research team and Writers. The research team of WP now has better supper budget and transport allowance. Big whoop. You still can’t even afford 1 proper writer that LHL was using, and I’m sure he has more than 1. 

If you honestly think that 1.3k x 3 allowance = give Pritam full time staff to write his speech and do research you are just being disingenuous. I’ve already given you comparison to what LHL’s writer cost, and some more it’s not even paid out of the MP budget of 1.3k for LA given to each and every MP in the first place. 

On 2nd thought, it seems that you are of the opinion that Pritam now as 3 x 1.3k, and did not realise that actually each MP has the same fucking 1 x 1.3k in the first place. So are you bloody telling me that every single MP can afford full time speech writer just cuz they have this allowance? 

FFS get your facts right first rather than just read surface stuff, and then create your own stupid narrative. 


“To facilitate their work, Members of Parliament are given a $1300 allowance to engage a Legislative Assistant and $500 to engage a Secretarial Assistant. 

https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/how-much-is-the-allowance-for-singapore-member-of-parliament/

Lastly. Even if WP now can suddenly afford 1 or 2 full time LA because of the new GRC they won = 4 x 1.3k extra + Pritam 2 x1.3k extra, I’ll be impressed if they are already fully functional and wrote Pritam speech today.

Edit** btw in case u didn’t realise, PAP pool the 1.3k resources together and hire a few full time LA that does wad you say LA do. Something that WP was never really in a position to do due to the paltry number of MPs they have. 

P.S. LA is is not like some appointed person given by parliament. You are really fucking dumb to even think that. I mean, seriously? You really think is like some court appointed clerk given to judge ah? Gosh, imagine Pritam ask his team to research dirt on PAP, you think the LA will do if it’s someone sent by PAP government?

2)industrialized independently and did it faster and better than anyone else. (Their malaise since 1990 has to do with crazy central bank loan and quantitative easing policy and aging demographics, not decreased productivity).

You wanna explain where the fuck this assumption about me not realising MPs don't have a 1 x 1.3k LA in the 1st place? If anything if I want to go into semantics I would say Pritam technically can have 4 LAs since they say he now has budget for 3 MORE LAs. But clearly you think that number doesn't matter and maybe you're right, given that he has lawyers and industry leaders helping him. All that says to me is that with that kind of backing, he is still up against the Goliath that is the Govt but he's certainly no David either. 

I would have thanked you for sharing insight about the support MPs have if not for the fact that you create more fucking strawmans than old macdonald. So much for ""create your own stupid narrative."" You sure assumed and got alot about me in your head from ""Btw Pritam has his own team and researchers now to prepare his speeches FYI"".

727,[LIVE HD] PM Lee Hsien Loong speaks in Parliament on Singapore's response to COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-02 14:55:55,"Glad you chose to justify yourself. Here's some counterpoints:

>1) first asian nation to defeat an european power (1905 russia) back when every other asian country accepted colonialism and racial discrimination.

[The Japanese got lucky.](http://cimsec.org/trafalgar-of-the-east-why-the-russian-navy-failed-in-the-russo-japanese-war/39522) They fought an European power in her death throes. The Japanese won at sea, but Tsar Nicholas was a shit leader, and couldn't command a navy for nuts, and worse yet placed some inept relative of his to guard the Far East.

>2)industrialized independently and did it faster and better than anyone else. (Their malaise since 1990 has to do with crazy central bank loan and quantitative easing policy and aging demographics, not decreased productivity). Was the worlds second largest economy for a good long while and still one of its major currencies.

Again, they got lucky - but this time, by [sheer geopolitical placement](https://academic.oup.com/jah/article-abstract/69/2/392/835760?redirectedFrom=PDF). The US wanted to expand their influence to counter Russia and China in East Asia, and Japan was more than willing to be a forward operating base. So Korean War spending allowed for Japan's manufacturing industry to get started, and money the US poured into Japan during this time offset the startup cost for industrializing economies. 

They were first out the gate when it comes to industrialization, for sure, but industrialization takes *money*. (Also, no, the irony of the US bankrolling Japan after nuking them twice is not lost on me, but that's something most people overlook.)

>3)Tokyo has the most michelin starred restaurants of any city in the world and Japan has the 2nd most of any country.

No contest. Their cultural influence is something I don't think Singapore can match in a long while. But I wouldn't say we won't be able to get there.  I looked it up: Singapore has 44, Japan has 226. 

It all depends on how you want to set the goal posts, right? I can say that Singapore has more Michelin star restaurants per-square-meter than Japan.

>4) well represented in all kinds of sports and recreational hobbies. Whatever they take part in they tend to be decent.

No contest. Fuck Goal 2010, that was a joke. We do have imported players of course, but I understand if that's not the same in your eyes.

>5)huge cultural influence globally via anime, and manga. Japanese cinema is also extremely respected in high art circles.

Yes and no. They have the cultural cache that constitutes soft power, but to compete in influence with Japan is suicide; smaller nations need to compete in different ways. I had Japanese friends asking me about that one time we had both Trump and Kim coming to Singapore - to me it was nothing, to them it was *wow* that some fucking lunatic that gives them missile alert warnings and some built-for-TV personality like Trump could meet in our shitty little island.

I appreciate that you have a high opinion of the Japanese, but it's easy to gloss over the shitty things that will continue to bog down their economy (aging demographics, inertia to change).",2020-09-02 22:50:21,483
728,[LIVE HD] PM Lee Hsien Loong speaks in Parliament on Singapore's response to COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-02 14:55:55,"Pritam ALWAYS had a team. WP research team and speech writing team has been there since the beginning of time. Volunteers they have always been. 

I think ultimately it’s all about definition. When you pay 1.3k to the lawyer editing your speech, is that considered part time staff or volunteer? It’s a lawyer FFS, I paid 500 dollars just to have a simple draft just this week. 

Note that the person receiving the money also channel money back to the party via donations, or use it in full or in part for his/her fellow volunteers. Does it matter?

Anyway I think that’s the divide. I apologise if I sound GL as I assumed you were GL in your original fake news charge when it’s something so blatantly obvious to me. 

Let’s just agree to disagree if you don’t agree to the above scenario I gave. I say that’s equivalent to volunteer and I gave reasons and examples of what a full timer is doing. Feel free to disagree as technically it is “paid” in so far money is exchanged. When one say hire full time one has the impression of someone who is unaffiliated and is hiring a professional. Maybe that’s me. For example my friend who wrote for LHL, he was just working not because he supported PAP. I’m not sure that is applicable to WP’s team.",2020-09-02 22:28:33,238
729,[LIVE HD] PM Lee Hsien Loong speaks in Parliament on Singapore's response to COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-02 14:55:55,"1) ""they got lucky"" is a hindsight based cop out and you know it. They obviously needed to develop a top class navy,organise it well and have the gumption to take on the Russians in the first place. No one else was doing it. Not China, certainly not India. The world was SHOCKED when it happened.

Also, guess what they kicked the British's butt too. Im sure you'll tell me that that was lucky too, that the British were preoccupied with Germany,and the 110,000 men in Malaya and Singapore losing to Yamashita's 40,000 equally undersupplied troops was a stroke of dumb luck too i suppose. /s

Incidentally, all this European butt kicking and subsequent  japanese cruelty did wonders for the nationalists movements of SEA. That was not their intention, but their influence on politics in this region is undeniable.


2) yes they relied on geographical location and foreign money. Sound familiar? Sounds like Singapore right? Did we get lucky too? Strange that Indonesia and Malaysia didnt get this wild dose of luck that seems to be floating around.  The point is the japanese siezed the opportunity, just like we did. Except in their case they were able to create huge local companies like Toyota and Sony that are still international powerhouses. The next best Asian tiger would have to be South Korea (who relied on American Largesse too)

3) the key difference between Singapore michelin restaurants and Japanese ones, is that the Japanese didnt have to import their michelin stars. The Japanese michelins were created and run by Japanese. Ours are mostly non local imports. The number of restaurants per sqkm is thus irrelevant.

4 and 5 dont need to be discussed any further.

Again, my original claim was ""the japanese achieved more by 1990 then we will by 2090.""  Can the validity of this claim still be in doubt?

 Im not saying the japanese are genetically superior or that man for man they are better. Im not saying they are perfect or that their practices have not resulted in stagnation. Im saying that regardless whether you want to credit them or historical circumstance, they have achieved more than we ever will.

AGAIN, focus on my claim. Do you seriously think it plausible that we will match Japans list of 'lucky' accomplishments in the next 70 years ? If the answer is no, and that is the only reasonable answer , then you should concede the point that my claim is correct.",2020-09-03 06:11:08,399
730,[LIVE HD] PM Lee Hsien Loong speaks in Parliament on Singapore's response to COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-02 14:55:55,"You make good points. By your claim, yes, they've achieved more than we have - but in lieu of the post-World War II situation repeating again, there's simply no purpose in having those metrics be our goalposts. See, what you quoted is:

* Militarily prevailed over a Western power (do you think we're even on track to do this? do you think that sometime in the next 70 years, a chance will crop up for me to prove you wrong?)  
* Industrialized quickly post-war (but like you said, this is familiar story - Singapore also industrialized in pretty much the same way, so who's to say Singapore can't do what Japan did?)  
* Have more ""local"" Michelin restaurant (we're a nation of migrants, so isn't it natural that we have 'migrants' helming our restaurants?)  

Singapore isn't even on a trajectory to seek to achieve those things. Hell I'd say no nation is simply because the days of American largesse are over - you want to be looking at Chinese investments in Africa to spot similar success stories.

So insofar as your statement ""Japan has achieved more than Singapore"" is true, the appended ""by 1990 than we will in 2090"" is something I can neither prove nor disprove simply because there aren't occasions for Singapore to compete in those areas in the next 70 years. You don't compare the Swiss to the Americans, saying the Americans have achieved more than the Swiss ever will - while that's true, that's also a purposeless comparison. They're different countries operating along different trajectories, and shine in different niche areas (good luck competing with the Swiss in watchmaking!).",2020-09-03 07:54:36,246
731,[LIVE HD] PM Lee Hsien Loong speaks in Parliament on Singapore's response to COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-02 14:55:55,"Sure. I agree that the timeframe if my claim makes disproving impossible, simply because singapore is not on a trajectory to repeat such feats. My hyperbolic phrasing was for impact, but to be debatable would need rephrading.

 I think we understand each other's point of view better now, which is all one can hope for in these conversations. Cheers!",2020-09-03 09:38:16,58
