1,"Exclusive: Half of Singapore's new COVID-19 cases are symptomless, taskforce head says",2020-06-08 21:53:17,">SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At least half of Singapore’s newly discovered coronavirus cases show no symptoms, the co-head of the government’s virus taskforce told Reuters on Monday, reinforcing the city-state’s decision to ease lockdown restrictions very gradually.

>Tiny Singapore has one of the highest infection tallies in Asia, with more than 38,000 cases, because of outbreaks in cramped dormitories housing thousands of migrant workers.  
>  
>It reopened schools and some businesses last week after a near two-month lockdown, but many residents are still required to work from home and mix socially only with their families.  
>  
>“Based on our experience, for every symptomatic case you would have at least one asymptomatic case,” said Lawrence Wong, adding that the discovery was made in recent weeks as Singapore ramped up testing.  
>  
>“That is exactly why we have been very cautious in our reopening plans,” Wong said.  
>  
>Singapore has not previously disclosed how many asymptomatic cases it has recorded. Wong did not reveal the number of asymptomatic cases in Singapore, which has reported 6,294 infections in the last two weeks, mainly among migrant workers.  
>  
>China said 300 symptomless COVID-19 carriers in its central city of Wuhan, the pandemic epicentre, had not been found to be infectious. But some experts say asymptomatic infections are common, making for a huge challenge in controlling the disease as countries start exiting lockdowns.  
>  
>Wong said that while asymptomatic individuals had fewer opportunities to spread the virus as they were not coughing or sneezing, there have been cases of asymptomatic transmission in Singapore, especially between patients living in close quarters.  
>  
>“People have commented - why are we not reopening the economy faster?” Wong said. “We have to take a more cautious approach. There are still asymptomatic cases which we may not have detected circulating in the community.”

>Singapore plans to give all its 5.7 million residents a small Bluetooth device, worn on a lanyard or carried in a handbag, to trace interactions with virus carriers.  
>  
>The first devices could be rolled out to a pilot group by month-end, Wong said, adding that the government would ensure the confidentiality of any data collected.

In fact, there's evidence showing that this virus is very stable showing very little mutation between various viral lineages (I believe out of it's 30,000 bases, lineages have shown variation of only up to 8 bases). However this isn't all bad news as this allows a successful vaccine to be more effective.",2020-06-08 23:09:37,52
13,"Exclusive: Half of Singapore's new COVID-19 cases are symptomless, taskforce head says",2020-06-08 21:53:17,"Important note from that post:

> Important Note: This WHO statement is referring to **asymptomatic spread** meaning transmission by someone who **never** develops symptoms as opposed to presymptomatic spread, i.e. transmission by someone before they develop symptoms. 

Asymptomatic vs pre-symptomatic is often hard to differentiate. People are quite infectious, maybe even most infectious, just before displaying symptoms. 

Nevertheless, I think with the weight of accumulated scientific evidence, SG will slowly fine-tune strategies to allocate fewer resources to digging up every asymptomatic case. One place where they can save a lot of money and effort is BCA's requirement of testing every working construction worker every 2 weeks (insane number of swabs to be tested). Maybe can just test them once before releasing for work, then keep a temperature and symptom log and no need to re-swab if everyone in the work unit is fine? Or randomly select 10% of the workers to be swabbed every 2 weeks?",2020-06-09 09:22:54,149
