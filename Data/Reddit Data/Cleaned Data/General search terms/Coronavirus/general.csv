First, he talks about now the vaccines may not work because of mutation. I mean, you want people to take vaccine but you also say maybe not effective? Lest we forget, mutated strains have already started appearing already.

Then he talks about how meritocracy shouldn’t ossify into a hereditary system. #1 it kinda already is. #2 focusing on preschool isn’t a cure. The rich send their kids to the expensive preschools.

> SINGAPORE: It may take four to five years before the COVID-19 pandemic ends and the world can look to a ""post-COVID normal"", said Education Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday (Jan 25).

> ""At some point in time the pandemic will pass, but it may take four to five years before we finally see the end of the pandemic and the start of a post-COVID normal. What will this new post-COVID world look like? No one can tell,"" he said.

> Mr Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce, was speaking at the Singapore Perspectives 2021 conference hosted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS).

> In a 30-minute speech on the final day of the four-day conference, the minister highlighted how there are still many uncertainties to contend with in the next few years, while sharing his hopes about how the future can be ""reset"" once the pandemic is over.

> ""Reset"" was the theme of the hybrid conference, held online and in-person at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, which sought to imagine how Singapore could look like in 2030.

> Mr Wong said there was still ""great uncertainty"" about how the coronavirus will shape society in the coming years. Adhering to safe management measures like mask-wearing and avoiding crowds will continue for this year and ""maybe a good part of next year"", he said.

> ""Beyond that, the availability of COVID-19 vaccinations will progressively restart global travel, but getting the world vaccinated won't be quick or easy,"" he added.

> The Government has planned for everyone in Singapore to be vaccinated by the third quarter of this year, but Mr Wong said that there could still be ""bumps along the way"".

> Advertisement

> He noted that the current vaccines may not be so effective against new mutant strains of the virus, and will have to be modified to counter them.

> ""In the positive scenario, this means the vaccine becomes a bit like an annual flu jab ... or perhaps we develop a vaccine that works for all strains. But in the worst case, we end up always a step behind an evolving virus, and you will not be able to catch up in time,"" he said.

> ""So there are still tremendous uncertainties ahead of us. And the bottom line is that we live in a shared world and no one is safe until everyone is safe.""

> 

> When asked later by moderator Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez on whether 2021 will be a re-run, a sequel or a re-make of 2020, Mr Wong said there are important differences between the situation now and last year - mainly that Singapore is better prepared to fight the virus and that there are now vaccines available.

> 

> ""What we need to do really is to tide through now until the point where everyone in Singapore is vaccinated, maybe the third quarter of the year. Perhaps at the end of the year, there is a solution.""

> 

> ""REBOOT"" FOR THE FUTURE

> Looking ahead to the post-pandemic future, Mr Wong said the current crisis can set the stage for a ""software update"" or a ""reboot"" of Singapore after the damage inflicted the virus.

> ""We must reset our social compact to emerge as a fairer and more equal society. The pandemic may be indiscriminate about who it infects but its impact is anything but equal. It has, in fact, widen the gulf between the haves and the have-nots,"" he said.

> He said that Singapore started to prioritise reducing inequality a decade ago, and that last year, many emergency measures were introduced to help lower-income groups. But this year, the temporary measures will have to ""taper down"" as the economy improves.

> However, he foresees that Singaporeans will need more assurance and support in a more uncertain and volatile world.

> ""The impact of the pandemic has created an added impetus to strengthen our social support system. There will be a permanent shift towards further strengthening of our social safety nets in Singapore to protect the disadvantaged and vulnerable,"" he said, adding that it will have to be done in a ""sustainable manner over the long term"".

> The minister added that meritocracy in Singapore should not ""ossify into a hereditary system"".

> ""We start by intervening early and uplifting our children from birth. That's a key focus and priority for me in the Ministry of Education - that's why we're making significant investments in pre-school,"" said Mr Wong, who took over the education portfolio this year after the General Election in July.

> Expanding on his outlook for Singapore's education system, he said the country is making ""fundamental shifts"" in its model to facilitate education for life.

> ""We want to have multiple entry points across the age distribution and across the entire skill spectrum. And thereby enable everyone to reskill, upgrade and continuously improve to be the best possible version of themselves,"" he said.

> GREENER, MORE UNITED SINGAPORE

> Mr Wong said that the pandemic has also thrown a spotlight on the unequal value society places on different types of workers, and added that this needs to change.

> ""Merit has become narrowly defined by academic and cognitive abilities but there's a wide range of abilities and aptitudes needed for societies to thrive,"" he said.

> ""We've come to better appreciate the contributions of our essential workers ... We must honour them for their work and accord them the dignity and respect they deserve. We must ensure they receive fair remuneration for the important work they do.""

> Mr Wong highlighted two more ways Singapore can ""reset"" - to become greener and to strengthen solidarity among its people.

> He said that the pandemic led to a temporary fall in carbon emissions when human activity came to a standstill, and the natural world began to heal.

> ""We cannot go back to the status quo ante ... climate change will be the existential emergency of our time. So we must build a greener economy and society that's more environmentally sustainable.""

> He said that while the pandemic sharpened divisions in some counties, it has brought Singaporeans together.

> ""I am confident that we will prevail and emerge stronger from this crucible, and I do not say this lightly. I speak from my own conviction of seeing the best of Singaporeans over the past year in the face of adversity and very tough conditions,"" he said.

> A renewed sense of solidarity is important as it will help Singapore build a better society, said the minister.

> ""My hope is for Singapore to emerge as a fairer, greener and more equal country with a much stronger spirit of solidarity and shared purpose,"" he said.

>Then he talks about how meritocracy shouldn’t ossify into a hereditary system.

Might not necessarily for the topic at hand, but here's my 2 cents. The government itself set the precedent for this. LHL should never have been made prime minister. I do not doubt his capabilities nor his qualifications, but having him as the PM really throws out everything that the government has been saying about meritocracy unfortunately because he is LKY's son.

Regardless of his academic qualifications, his achievements and rank in the army (he was a general I think) that was no doubt gained through his own abilities, those will not be what the average Singaporean will look at first. 

It is because LKY, the founding father of Singapore had left such a significant imprint on public consciousness that LHL will never be able to escape from. That he is LKY's son, serving in the exact same post that LKY had, has tainted the idea of meritocracy in Singapore society.

I firmly believe that a government leads it's people by example. If the government itself having a kind of hereditary system for the office of prime minister had set the precedent for other Singaporean to do the same. Imo they really dug their own grave for it.",2021-01-26 09:51:11,206

> SINGAPORE: It may take four to five years before the COVID-19 pandemic ends and the world can look to a ""post-COVID normal"", said Education Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday (Jan 25).

> ""At some point in time the pandemic will pass, but it may take four to five years before we finally see the end of the pandemic and the start of a post-COVID normal. What will this new post-COVID world look like? No one can tell,"" he said.

> Mr Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce, was speaking at the Singapore Perspectives 2021 conference hosted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS).

> In a 30-minute speech on the final day of the four-day conference, the minister highlighted how there are still many uncertainties to contend with in the next few years, while sharing his hopes about how the future can be ""reset"" once the pandemic is over.

> ""Reset"" was the theme of the hybrid conference, held online and in-person at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, which sought to imagine how Singapore could look like in 2030.

> Mr Wong said there was still ""great uncertainty"" about how the coronavirus will shape society in the coming years. Adhering to safe management measures like mask-wearing and avoiding crowds will continue for this year and ""maybe a good part of next year"", he said.

> ""Beyond that, the availability of COVID-19 vaccinations will progressively restart global travel, but getting the world vaccinated won't be quick or easy,"" he added.

> The Government has planned for everyone in Singapore to be vaccinated by the third quarter of this year, but Mr Wong said that there could still be ""bumps along the way"".

> He noted that the current vaccines may not be so effective against new mutant strains of the virus, and will have to be modified to counter them.

> ""In the positive scenario, this means the vaccine becomes a bit like an annual flu jab ... or perhaps we develop a vaccine that works for all strains. But in the worst case, we end up always a step behind an evolving virus, and you will not be able to catch up in time,"" he said.

> ""So there are still tremendous uncertainties ahead of us. And the bottom line is that we live in a shared world and no one is safe until everyone is safe.""

> 

> When asked later by moderator Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez on whether 2021 will be a re-run, a sequel or a re-make of 2020, Mr Wong said there are important differences between the situation now and last year - mainly that Singapore is better prepared to fight the virus and that there are now vaccines available.

> 

> ""What we need to do really is to tide through now until the point where everyone in Singapore is vaccinated, maybe the third quarter of the year. Perhaps at the end of the year, there is a solution.""

> 

> ""REBOOT"" FOR THE FUTURE

> Looking ahead to the post-pandemic future, Mr Wong said the current crisis can set the stage for a ""software update"" or a ""reboot"" of Singapore after the damage inflicted the virus.

> ""We must reset our social compact to emerge as a fairer and more equal society. The pandemic may be indiscriminate about who it infects but its impact is anything but equal. It has, in fact, widen the gulf between the haves and the have-nots,"" he said.

> He said that Singapore started to prioritise reducing inequality a decade ago, and that last year, many emergency measures were introduced to help lower-income groups. But this year, the temporary measures will have to ""taper down"" as the economy improves.

> However, he foresees that Singaporeans will need more assurance and support in a more uncertain and volatile world.

> ""The impact of the pandemic has created an added impetus to strengthen our social support system. There will be a permanent shift towards further strengthening of our social safety nets in Singapore to protect the disadvantaged and vulnerable,"" he said, adding that it will have to be done in a ""sustainable manner over the long term"".

> The minister added that meritocracy in Singapore should not ""ossify into a hereditary system"".

> ""We start by intervening early and uplifting our children from birth. That's a key focus and priority for me in the Ministry of Education - that's why we're making significant investments in pre-school,"" said Mr Wong, who took over the education portfolio this year after the General Election in July.

> Expanding on his outlook for Singapore's education system, he said the country is making ""fundamental shifts"" in its model to facilitate education for life.

> ""We want to have multiple entry points across the age distribution and across the entire skill spectrum. And thereby enable everyone to reskill, upgrade and continuously improve to be the best possible version of themselves,"" he said.

> GREENER, MORE UNITED SINGAPORE

> Mr Wong said that the pandemic has also thrown a spotlight on the unequal value society places on different types of workers, and added that this needs to change.

> ""Merit has become narrowly defined by academic and cognitive abilities but there's a wide range of abilities and aptitudes needed for societies to thrive,"" he said.

> ""We've come to better appreciate the contributions of our essential workers ... We must honour them for their work and accord them the dignity and respect they deserve. We must ensure they receive fair remuneration for the important work they do.""

> Mr Wong highlighted two more ways Singapore can ""reset"" - to become greener and to strengthen solidarity among its people.

> He said that the pandemic led to a temporary fall in carbon emissions when human activity came to a standstill, and the natural world began to heal.

> ""We cannot go back to the status quo ante ... climate change will be the existential emergency of our time. So we must build a greener economy and society that's more environmentally sustainable.""

> He said that while the pandemic sharpened divisions in some counties, it has brought Singaporeans together.

> ""I am confident that we will prevail and emerge stronger from this crucible, and I do not say this lightly. I speak from my own conviction of seeing the best of Singaporeans over the past year in the face of adversity and very tough conditions,"" he said.

> A renewed sense of solidarity is important as it will help Singapore build a better society, said the minister.

> ""My hope is for Singapore to emerge as a fairer, greener and more equal country with a much stronger spirit of solidarity and shared purpose,"" he said.

>Then he talks about how meritocracy shouldn’t ossify into a hereditary system.

Might not necessarily for the topic at hand, but here's my 2 cents. The government itself set the precedent for this. LHL should never have been made prime minister. I do not doubt his capabilities nor his qualifications, but having him as the PM really throws out everything that the government has been saying about meritocracy unfortunately because he is LKY's son.

Regardless of his academic qualifications, his achievements and rank in the army (he was a general I think) that was no doubt gained through his own abilities, those will not be what the average Singaporean will look at first. 

It is because LKY, the founding father of Singapore had left such a significant imprint on public consciousness that LHL will never be able to escape from. That he is LKY's son, serving in the exact same post that LKY had, has tainted the idea of meritocracy in Singapore society.

I firmly believe that a government leads it's people by example. If the government itself having a kind of hereditary system for the office of prime minister had set the precedent for other Singaporean to do the same. Imo they really dug their own grave for it.",2021-01-26 09:51:11,206

Previously I posted that the difference will show around Sep - Oct timeframe, after all the FWs are tested in the dormitories. I think we are starting to see them now.

I am especially appreciative of these, just off the top of my head. Of course, an elite civil service is also key to enabling all these to happen:

* healthcare workers did not have to worry about lack of PPE at any point in time
* no HCW got infected so far through caring for patients who were Covid positive
* no lack of testing reagents and swabs for the tests
* interventions to prevent spread in schools, pre-schools, nursing & care homes and prisons
* they really do seem to be putting in great efforts in protecting our seniors
* our supply chains remained largely intact during the worst period (Feb - May)
* the massive effort to enable CCFs in record time in places like Expo, Tanjong Pagar & CEC. Just thinking of how to get the required number of beds then, was mind-boggling to me.
* scaling up testing & contact tracing capacities during the CB period
* the govt actually formed a MMTF quickly before the coronavirus reached our shores, and it did well. Especially think Minister Lawrence Wong who acts as the coordinating minister for all the ministries & agencies has stepped up to the task & has been very clear in his communications to the public during the updates in their press conferences.

Probably can only ding the government for the masks, SHNs not enforced that strongly at the beginning and the dorms? I do think they made the best possible decisions under the circumstances there and then.

Finally, a bit about the dorms. I am of the opinion that the outbreak in the dorms is not only caused by the living conditions, but the nature of their working conditions as well. Indeed some of the conditions of the dorms needs to be improved, but IMO even if the workers had been housed 4 or 6 per room prior to the outbreak, I think it would still had happened. The entire design of the dorms has to change, it is not only about the density. Remember case 42 who is linked to a cluster from Seletar Aerospace Heights? It was successfully isolated, or is there a remote possibility that it all stemmed from this cluster? We will never know, but at that point in time there were no further transmissions identified from the cluster. Recently in some interviews, it was revealed that MOM & the dorm operators actually put in place isolation facilities and safety measures after this cluster in an attempt to prevent future similar events, but the massive outbreaks later proved that those measures were inadequate.",2020-09-25 22:23:48,468

282,Singapore's covid 19 management score - how do you think Singapore and the Government did?,2020-09-25 13:16:56,"There's a very easy way to get a low death rate.

1. Get a lot of people of working age, say 300,000 of them (5% of country population), and imprison them for 6 months, in rooms shared between 10-20 people.
2. Let covid spread across those facilities
3. Since survival rate for those under age of 50 is [99.996%](https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/predicted-covid-19-fatality-rates-based-age-sex-comorbidities-and-health-system-capacity.pdf) you are unlikely to get any deaths. For example in Sweden, out of 5900 deaths, only 70 were younger than 50.
4. Enjoy the very low death rate!

&#x200B;

If you tried doing something similar in US, **it would mean imprisoning 16 million people (5% of population)** \- that's 2 times more than total amount of covid cases that were detected in US.

Basically, if you're a government that wants to have a low covid death rate, you should aim to isolate working age people away from the population, and get as many of them infected with covid as possible. This is just basic math.

328,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"As someone who's been following the situation for a while now I'd say that you have to take things into context.

Many people say that the government should have made mask wearing mandatory earlier. Thing is, Singapore didn't have any factories of its own until February, and the countries it sourced masks from banned exports. (EDIT: Plus, while Singapore does have its own stockpile for healthcare workers, if the government were to provide everyone with surgical masks, they'd probably run out in a matter of weeks, if not days.) So at the time, it made perfect sense not to wear masks.

And also, regarding the situation in dorms: that was in large part due to a superspreading event at Mustafa Centre. 2 imported cases there eventually infected 80+ cases, many of which were migrant workers, who would later bring it into their dorms. And since the workers live communally, once 1 case was detected (a couple days after infection mind you) it'd've been almost impossible to stop. The government for their part did a total lockdown of dorms about a week after their first case. 

While there is room for improvement, the actions they took were understandable.

EDIT: Adding on, I don't quite agree with the narrative that the government ignored migrant workers - they stopped mass assemblies and staggered usage of communal facilities as early as [mid-February.](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2020/0210-mom-issues-updated-advisory-on-enhanced-precautionary-measure-for-dormitory)",2020-05-30 17:30:14,217
329,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"To quote Yong Han Poh in her facebook post (that was well written and linked to two other interesting opinions on this matter which I unfortunately can't link to because this subreddit doesn't allow for Facebook links):

""I don’t agree with many things in Dr. Tan’s post, but that doesn’t mean I fully agree with Dr. Leong’s post either.

On the first two points, yes, I understand that there are numerous policy considerations and the apparent “U-turn” came because of a mix of changing epidemiology and strategic / security concerns relating to mask supply and so forth. Like Dr. Leong, I don’t blame the government for revising their policies given changing circumstances. I also think we have remarkable testing capacity, and I don’t doubt that many contingency plans have been put in place to avoid over-straining our healthcare system. On these fronts, I applaud the government.

It’s really his third point that I want to critique. Dr. Leong says that his ""hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases.” He even throws in a thought experiment: “Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?” 

What is the counter-factual here? I recognize neither of us have any data, but since Dr. Leong uses a thought experiment to make his assertion, I’m going to use his logic to illustrate my own speculations. Imagine that migrant workers lived six people to a room (don’t need single room lah horh), attached with their own kitchen and toilets (don’t need sauna also). When Covid hit (and when everyone has been ordered to stop working because of CB), they are able to practice social distancing, and cook for themselves in their own kitchens. They don’t have to be cramped - sometimes thirty-five people to a room - trying to practice social distancing, or rely on MOM to provide them food (dorms typically only have communal kitchens, and some dorms / FCDs don’t have kitchens at all).  I think this could have help stemmed the rapid transmission rates, even if some transmission was still inevitable because of asymptomatic carriers, as Dr. Leong pointed out. The difficulties of practicing social distancing in these dorms and warnings of a possible contagion have been sounded out as early as February by healthcare professionals such as Dr. Jeremy Lim, and echoed again by migrant groups like Geylang Adventures and TWC2. Why weren’t they heeded? This is what I would like to know, and hopefully there will be a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry convened post-crisis to explore this, and highlight the government’s own considerations and practical constraints for the public. (And if the government already knew it was so infectious, why did it take them so long to commit to distributing free reusable masks and sanitizers for the migrant workers?) 

Dr. Leong also writes, ""I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying. This is not the time.” I normally try to avoid emotive language in such discussions, but since you used the word, I think it is “despicable"" to accuse NGOs for being opportunistic or having an agenda. By definition, the mission of these NGOs and advocacy groups /is/ to advocate for better migrant rights. What do you want them to do - remain silent amidst a by the way, /national/ crisis? So it’s okay for them to lobby for better rights for migrant workers before Covid but not during? What about the fact that actually, Singapore is having a national conversation about migrant worker policy post-crisis now, and that their voices, together with those of migrant workers’, are very important in helping to shape that? 

Dr Leong also criticizes big mouths for having ""no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.”  This may be fair. Of course everything entails trade-offs. But I don’t think we should fault NGOs or advocacy groups or whichever “big mouths” you might be alluding to for clamouring for migrant rights or better dormitory conditions, even if you find them utopian. The job of the policymaker is to try and achieve “balance” and negotiate between somtimes competing interests and translate utopian ideals into realistic policy. The job of the advocate is to try and push the boundaries of what is possible, to shift mindsets that everything is a cost-based calculation, to introduce rights-based language into public discourse, and to push for a human-centered approach in policy-making. Everyone has a different part to play in the ecosystem. The policy maker has the unglamorous (and sadly, thankless) job of deciding how best to navigate those practical constraints, and what kinds of costs are reasonable. But this is not just an empirical question - it is also a normative one - and it is precisely the normative aspect that these “big mouths” are speaking to, by making us as a public reflect on the principles by which we arrive at these answers in the first place. 
 
Finally, Dr. Leong calls for us to “have a sense of perspective”. He writes, “We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment.”

I’m having trouble fully distinguishing between ""having perspective"" and outright “whataboutism”. It is true that many other countries struggle with Covid infections in their dorm equivalents, and Singapore certainly isn’t the worst in the world. But this doesn’t make the current situation right, or absolve the G of responsibility, even if it does seem to make these failings appear reasonable. We can, and should, aspire to better. I don’t think the G has done terribly on these counts, but it doesn’t mean I think they have done brilliantly either. The PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers - great. But let’s not conflate these reassurances post-crisis with Singapore’s treatment of migrant workers more generally, and let us not forget the hard work of NGOs and advocacy groups who have been crucial in pushing for more migrant worker protections both before and during this crisis. 

Of course, to quote Dr. Leong, “Don’t just believe what people tell you. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles”. Don’t believe me either. And unlike Dr. Tan and Dr. Leong, I don't have a PhD in anything and certainly don’t claim expertise - these are just my personal thoughts as a humble citizen.""",2020-05-31 06:03:09,1262

If the govt initially told people there's no need to wear masks due to fear of panic-buying of masks, then it does make sense why they would say that. Not that it excuses them from preparing a readily-available supply of masks for an epidemic, but I could see why they did it regardless.

The dorm situation coming about due to a super-spreading is understandable as well. Nevertheless, when criticising the govt, many commenters here are pointing out the lack of preparation on the FW dorms to prevent spread of infectious diseases as a whole. They did a lockdown in the end, so at least they did something even if it was a little too late. Seems to be a case of lack of foresight rather than malevolence.

The impression I am getting is that the main issue lies with the preparation for this epidemic, though it's harder to criticise them on this alone. I'm sure this situation is not benefitting the govt at all (with GE coming up) so they probably did what they thought was the best thing to do, even if the consequences were damaging to smaller businesses, for example.

Sorry, but this is pretty damn naive. 

I'd rather the G respect the uncertainty inherent in this novel pandemic and admit the situation is fluid rather than commit themselves to a fixed timeframe or number of cases.

Regardless of whether they choose to use ""circuit breaker"" vs ""lockdown"", I think the govt in this case should not be at fault for not knowing how long the lockdown period should be. 

On the other hand, we should instead fault them if there was mismanagement that led to the lengthening of the lockdown period.

Yes, it would be bad for retailers, etc. Many people's livelihoods are affected. However, this sounds more like making COVID-19 a reason to blame the govt instead. It's not like the govt has directly made these people suffer. Has the govt changed any policies that contributed to these people suffering? If so, then that would be another possible discussion.

376,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"Firstly, before this covid started, there were already outbreaks of infectious diseases like chicken pox in the dorms, at least 3 years ago. No visible action was taken to prevent such issues from happening again.

Then some organisations had warned, at the start of covid, the risks again. Still no visible action.

Then one FW got Covid. They managed to isolate him. This was back in Feb.

At that time there wasn't any indication of CB happening in future, and masks were not yet mandated, SHN had breaches and many who had to serve SHN were saying instructions were unclear. I believe you know this part.

Then all of a sudden our cases started picking up, with the dorms starting to get affected. Then CB, up to now.

Basically, everything that was done and wasn't, as above, led to the situation we see in the dorms now.

But what could have been prevented was if clearer enforcement were in place, and if FW dorms policies were strict enough. Additionally, many FWs seem to have reservations about seeking medical treatment, but I think it's possible that they are afraid of their employers coming down on them. There were even cases of Employers who initially wanted to send all their workers for the free covid tests so that they could potentially get some money from the govt. So another thing about enforcement by the MOM. 

But the main thing was, if it wasn't for the fact that despite a track history of infectious disease outbreaks, nothing much was seemingly done (at least a documentation or open plans in place for such a situation for the dorms, that unfortunately has finally happened), we would be in a different situation today.

BBT shops tend to be tiny without much space to manoeuvre, and most do not have tables & chairs at all for dining in prior to the CB. If there's a queue, consumers plus delivery folks end up congregating in a group for the more popular outlets.

For those coffee outlets, with the lack of office workers nowadays I think their demand has went down. Even if they had more customers, there is likely space in their shops for them to do their waiting.

When I actually went to Toa Payoh Central once during the pre-tightened CB at 3pm (I'd assume this is not peak period), it was quite crazy looking at the stretch of 3 BBT shops in close proximity. Around 3-8 people in front of each shop, plus delivery folks waiting around. It became a congregation of about 30 people.

The Starbucks opposite the BBT shops on the other hand, was empty save for 1 customer.

Additionally, policies from a previous epidemic can be used, and were used for the community and country, in preparation for the covid, but there was a sense of over-reliance on what was done for SARS, that some areas were overlooked. SARS didn't have widespread community transmission, but Covid-19 did.

So in this aspect, the government had to think of the possibilities in which the Covid-19 situation could get worse, and plan policies from there. But because at each escalation of the situation, things were changing quite fast, they didn't evaluate properly (or at least that's what we think) the consequences of each action.

The govt isn't wholly incompetent in the handling of epidemics, in fact, we did some necessary steps, such as the banning of flights, but the parts where they didn't, it was a case of wrong timing, and various other factors. 

For us to discuss the incompetence, we also have to realise the amount of available information at that point in time when they planned a policy. We must realise also that when we are discussing a past event, we already know the consequences of the policies.

407,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"All McDonald's was closed mainly due to cases that happened and also due to the fact that they cross deployed their employees over their various branches. But that is different - govt didn't close the entire category of fast food restaurants because it's specific to the chain.

BBT no matter the brand, functions almost exactly the same way. I don't suppose the concern was that the staff would get infected, it's the people mass queuing and gathering due to their popularity. They had 3 (was it 3?) weeks to observe them for improvement but it doesn't look like things would, so they decided to close them.",2020-05-30 23:55:29,97
408,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"I don't believe theres no room for improvement. There wasn't any chance for any improvement.  Mcdonalds at least was given the chance to improve and reopen. Why not bbt? Its like some policy maker just hates bbt stores

Keep in mind  bbt is open if its in a food court, so its not about it functioning the same way.",2020-05-31 00:02:09,57
409,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"I don't think there is any intent of giving further chances for them to improve after 3 weeks, as the purpose for the tightened CB is to further reduce people movement and chances of forming a group while waiting. Given that they are really the most popular stalls around - they remain closed.

Indeed have heard of some opening new stalls at coffee shops..",2020-05-31 01:44:27,61
410,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"Ok where's their 2nd chance then? Its almost been a month and a half since they closed.  Even mcdonalds, a business with actual clusters associated with it reopened after 3 weeks. And like you said they didnt shut down all fast food cause of something mcdonalds did, but they did shut down all bbt over what some outlets may or may not have done. 

If they are only allowed to reopen the same time as other retail, thats not giving them a chance. 

I mean popularity isn't a valid reason to close the stores.",2020-05-31 12:24:14,90
411,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"I've mentioned, BBT shops had been fined, warned and there had also been lots of talk that some shops are seeing massive queues. I agree it's not their fault that they're so popular and creating queues, but to me their chance was before the tightened CB. If nothing changed in those 3 weeks even after some have been fined/warned, what can reasonably change after that? Most partnered with restaurants for delivery after shutting their physical stores down, not sure how they doing, or how the BBT lovers are doing with that arrangement.

McDonald's didn't close due to massive queues forming, so it's not exactly similar. And it's food compared to drink.",2020-05-31 12:57:52,104
412,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"Not all shops were fined, warned or even saw massive queues. The only massive queue I saw for BBT was the day they announced they were closing them for CB. Again, not all fast food chains was punished for Mcdonalds mistakes, why should all BBT stores be closed for some stores mistakes? If the store made a mistake, close that particular store for CB not an entire industry.",2020-05-31 13:02:24,68
413,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"Not all, but a lot did have queues (not that massive before they closed of course) prior to them shutting. I think a better comparison to BBT would actually be Singapore Pools outlets. Some outlets have massive queues, both are not essential.

Fast food chains will not shut because the others didn't cross deploy their staff.

I've argued my thoughts, I guess we can agree to disagree. Thanks for the discussion and stay safe :D",2020-05-31 13:10:46,72
414,Regarding COVID-19 Management,2020-05-30 14:08:59,"Yes but if you're allowing f&b to be considered essential, bbt is f&b not some weird nonessential category by itself where it's not allowed to open unless in a food court, at which point its suddenly considered as essential again. The mental gymanstics over the decision make no sense to me",2020-05-31 13:12:37,51
