> SINGAPORE: Following several cases of novel coronavirus without any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from yellow to orange on Friday (Dec 7).

> With immediate effect, schools will suspend inter-school and external activities until the end of the March holidays, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). These include the national school games, learning journeys and camps. All schools and teachers will also continue to implement already announced enhanced measures such as classroom-based assemblies.

> ‚ÄúI understand that Singaporeans are anxious, concerned and there‚Äôs much that we do not yet know about the virus,‚Äù said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong at a media briefing on Friday afternoon.

> 

> ‚ÄúNew information is emerging daily, we expect that this is likely to take time to resolve, maybe months, life cannot come to a standstill but we should take all the necessary precautions and carry on with life.‚Äù

> He added: ‚ÄúWe will do our best to contain the situation and keep Singaporeans safe.‚Äù

> The way Singapore deals with outbreaks like the novel coronavirus is guided by DORSCON. The colour coded system - which has green, yellow, orange and red categories - shows the current situation. It also indicates what needs to be done to prevent and reduce the impact of infections.

> DORSCON orange means that the disease is deemed severe and spreads easily from person to person, but has not spread widely and is being contained.

> ""This is not the first time which we've actually changed our DORSCON level and reached DORSCON orange,"" said Kenneth Mak, director of medical services, MOH.

> ""On the previous occasion (it was) in relation to the H1N1 influenza outbreak which actually occurred in many countries in the world, we had done the same as well.

> He added: ""As we had a better understanding of that illness and realised that in fact, its behaviour was very similar to what other forms of influenza was, it provided us with the opportunity to reassess the risk associated with this infection to our population and then lower our DORSCON accordingly, and then eventually back to normal.""

> 

> This announcement follows the confirmation of three new cases on Friday, all of which have not yet any links to previous cases or travel to mainland China.

> 

> On Thursday, Singapore confirmed two new cases, one of which was a 41-year-old Singaporean with no recent travel history to China and who did not appear to be linked with previous confirmed cases.

> 

> This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 33.

> 

> With the ‚Äúheightened risk posture‚Äù of DORSCON Orange, MOH said it will be introducing new precautionary measures.

> 

> ‚ÄúWe have planned for such a scenario that involves community spread,‚Äù MOH said.

> 

> Organisers of large events should take necessary precautions such as carrying out temperature screening, looking out for respiratory symptoms such as cough or runny nose and denying entry to unwell individuals. Individuals who are unwell, on leave of absence or have recent travel history to mainland China should not attend such events.

> 

> MOH also urged organisers to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events. At workplaces, employers should require their employees to conduct regular temperature taking and check whether they have respiratory symptoms.

> PRECAUTIONS AT WORKPLACE

> 

> Temperatures should be taken at least twice a day and anyone with a fever or who is unwell should leave the office immediately to see a doctor. Workplaces should also step up their business continuity plans and prepare for widespread community transmission, added MOH.

> 

> Such plans can include allowing telecommuting or dividing the workplace into segregated teams. MOH will be implementing temperature screening and closer controls for entry points into the hospitals.

>

> Hospitals will introduce measures to care for patients with pneumonia, separately from other patients to reduce risk of transmission. Preschools and social and eldercare services will also limit the number of visitors to their premises, said MOH.

> 

> ‚ÄúSince last month, the Government has implemented a series of defensive measures to reduce the risk of imported cases and community transmission. We have strengthened these progressively as the situation escalated, both globally and in Singapore,‚Äù said MOH.

> 

> DORSCON takes into account the current disease situation overseas, how transmissible the disease is, how likely it is to arrive in Singapore and what impact it may have on the local community.

> 

> This crisis management plan did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (H1N1) pandemic in 2009.

> 

> At its most severe, the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010 was at Orange status. According to the National Library Board‚Äôs Infopedia, an estimated 415,000 people were infected with the H1N1 influenza in Singapore, and there were at least 18 fatalities.

> 

> Singapore on Saturday widened travel restrictions to stop all new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China from entering Singapore. These visitors are also not allowed to transit in Singapore.

> The virus, believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 600 people and infected more than 30,000, the vast majority of them in China.

> The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency.

when I say your alert system is outdated and geared for sars  it's  because literally the system was created because of the sars epidemic. 
people still think like coronavirus spreads like Sars, where only people who've finished incubating and showing symptoms could transmit the disease when the new novel coronavirus can spread in 15 seconds from mist liquid and bodily fluids as well as hand to mouth transmission without the transmisser even having a fever or a cough . because he could be asymptomatic and only having touched a door knob and still transmit the virus. that's why it's dangerous to still have school in session in Singapore when the students and teachers aren't wearing a mask as I've seen in one of the videos about on orange alert of Singaporean primary schools where teacher are pretty much spitting distance from the student before taking the infrared temperature. that act alone is dangerous because what if either party was in the incubation period and accidentally spread the ncov virus through a cough or sharing of pencils and papers then teacher could pass it on to other students despite feeling well for a week and the children of the class going home and spreading it to their parents.

while Hong Kong and Macau are basically on ""red"" level you guys are still on moderate inconvenience. both Macau and Hong Kong have suspended all schools and social activities like pool and gym and the library as well as all government staff working at home instead of the office. with the 4 new confirmed patients that have no links to China or the patients, I would be quite worried since I have friends in Singapore because there is a high risk that a societal outbreak could and might have already happened.

I saw a post saying that the reason why there are so many cases in Singapore is because the government is smart in tracing each and other person who was related to the virus, but I'd say that is completely disproven with the 4 new uncorrelated local infection and one case spreading to UK.

your government is still too slow on the act and haven't properly educated it's citizens on what the n-cov really is and the 1 to 2.6 transmission rate as well as the complete cancellation of public events where everyone aren't wearing masks.

even red is not enough, I would advice following Taiwan and USA and block all those whove traveled to China from entering and only letting singaporeans in but having them stay in isolated ÂâØÂ£ìÁóÖÊàø for a 14 day quarantine.",2020-02-08 04:41:57,501

The picture you have right now is what happened 2-3 weeks earlier and whatever measure you take, it took 2-3 weeks to show. That's the incubation period.

Second, maybe it's because they don't wanna fucking die or see loved ones die.

Third, if you don't already know, Vietnam is doing aggressive quarantines of all arrivals in quarantine zones for free. The quarantined cases are fed and housed for free. First contacts with confirmed cases and contacts of first contacts are also quarantined in these zones. The military which runs these zones calculated the cost and basically said that the cost of feeding 10,000 quarantined people is cheaper than treating 1,000 COVID-19 cases in hospitals.

It's not that obvious, but think carefully. COVID-19 treatment duration seems to be a month or so and quarantine/shutdown duration need to be \~2-3 weeks. Feeding someone for free for 2-3 weeks is vastly cheaper than feeding and treating a sick COVID-19 cases for a month with expensive doctors, nurses, ventilators, medicines, and PPE. Just the PPE cost is amazing. You need to give the sick 2 masks/day which is already 4 bucks/day (market price). N95 masks for the doctors and nurses (5 bucks/piece, market price), multiply that by the number of doctors and nurses.

What is happening worldwide is a great disruption to supply chains, first in China, now elsewhere. If their economies are not doing well, we won‚Äôt do well either. We are a financial centre, thriving on the wealth they generate.

We are reliant on tourism. When flights and travel advisories are issued by others, we will be affected. When one billion people are in lockdown worldwide, our tourism industry will see red anyway. 

We are a port. But the cargo we are handling are mostly not produced by us. As I had said earlier, if supply chains are disrupted, our port will be affected.

DORSCON red, DORSCON orange, these are just how our public health view and treat this pandemic. How well our economy would do will have to depend on the DORSCONs of other countries that we cannot control. As long as our public health measures are not overdone, like locking down prematurely when others are not, then, the impact of our public health measures on the economy would not be that significant by itself.

The world economy is in trouble. China can reopen the factories, but they cannot do much when Europe is now in trouble. The US is in trouble, Trump had to pump trillions to keep it afloat, the Federal Reserves had to put in measures that they rarely had to use. The stock markets plunged, governments worldwide had to pay to keep companies from bankrupting and retrenching people. 

The economic impact is devastating, but it is not from DORSCON orange.

The idea is you protect the greater population from the arrivals, not necessarily the arrivals from each others. Visibly sick people are transferred to separate treatment facility. The quarantine zones are for visibly healthy people. A platoon worth of people are housed in one room (about 16). The quarantined are to wear surgical mask 24/7; this cuts down transmission drastically. By putting arrivals who arrive at the same time in one place, you ensure that later arrivals don't transmit to the earlier arrivals.

My counter-point of the Vietnam's experience was: ""quarantining all suspect cases, arrivals, contacts of confirmed cases"" in concentrated, designated quarantine zone cost 1/10 of the treatment cost of one COVID-19 patient. The specific cost calculation I outline was the cost of providing surgical masks for all quarantined people was a fraction of the PPE cost of all the doctors and nurses for one case.

My argument was strictly economic, then it got derailed. ""may not have the capacity to house 1000 returnees daily"". My answer was: ""empty out the barracks"". That's the facility.

Then you ""they are not suitable as quarantine facilities""; and I am also communicating the purpose, thinking, and reality in Vietnam. Those facilities are not to protect the quarantined arrivals, contacts, and suspected cases from each other. It is to prevent outbreak into larger hinterland.

You, as healthcare workers, think differently from political, community, or military leaders. Case in point, check out this 2017 CFR conference on ... pandemic preparation, around 31:00 minute mark
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQCjBk4AJKo

The question is assuming there's a new pandemic, then there's a vaccine, but there is a limited amount. Who should get it first. They lady with uniforms, medals, lapels, and badges that probably outranks either of us, point out that different groups, communities, and leaders have different answers and priorities. The medical community is relatively straightforward: immunise those who are the most vulnerable and at risk of death (the elderly, those with underlying diseases). On the other hand, community, social, and political leaders tend to think to immunise those who keep society moving; the show must go on. So immunise mission-critical workers first: food, water, electricity, transportation, etc ... (I'll add that many of these business in the USA are preparing to ask their workers to stay in the plant and don't come out. They are also isolated/quarantined in place).

I'll also add that another tactics, is ""ring vaccination""; to, for eg., deal with a potential small pox outbreak in the USA when the USA has about 15 million small pox vaccine doses. Or Ebola. You vaccinate the first contacts of the confirmed case, then the first contacts' contacts, and so on.

BTW, think about that question the lady at that 31:00 mark answered. I'm giving you a head start and cheat sheet already. In 2021, there may be a COVID-19 vaccine. Who should get it first? I can already predict the arguments in 2021. Those with money will get it first, I'm sure about that.

My counter-point of the Vietnam's experience was: ""quarantining all suspect cases, arrivals, contacts of confirmed cases"" in concentrated, designated quarantine zone cost 1/10 of the treatment cost of one COVID-19 patient. The specific cost calculation I outline was the cost of providing surgical masks for all quarantined people was a fraction of the PPE cost of all the doctors and nurses for one case.

The medical community is relatively straightforward: immunise those who are the most vulnerable and at risk of death (the elderly, those with underlying diseases). On the other hand, community, social, and political leaders tend to think to immunise those who keep society moving; the show must go on. So immunise mission-critical workers first: food, water, electricity, transportation, etc ...

Lawrence Wong.

Now, you guys are rich so you rent out hotels and quarantine people in individual rooms. Vietnam isn't that rich, so it has to do things the poor man's way; that is to convert military barracks, military schools, college hostels, etc ... into ""dedicated facilities"". It can't provide single rooms; so some decisions were made: like frequent sanitation, proper distancing between beds, discouraging the use of air conditioning, mandated 24/7 wearing of surgical masks, and increased ventilation. If one person in the room do get symptoms and is confirmed to be positive, too bad, everyone stay is extended for 2 weeks. Then followed up by a 7 days quarantine at home. The saving grace is food and everything is provided for free. Vietnam quarantine zones, as far as the data showed, does not have the same institutional spread rate as seen in US care homes (up to 80% infection rate) or prisons.

Diplomats and high-ranking foreigners can be quarantined in hotels, like what Singapore is doing; but these hotels are also dedicated facilities with guards outside. These are not free, however.

While I agree with Mr. Lawrence Wong, who now admits that there were too many fuckwits walking about flaunting quarantine rules, igniting clusters and unlinked cases (community transmission), thus the need for ""dedicated facility"", I will say it would have done much better to just do it from the beginning.

Vietnam recently got two clusters of cases and initial data suggested community transmission. The Vietnamese government basically decided to step on the brake as hard as it can and institute a de facto soft lockdown (a hard lockdown will be pulling the hand brake). No gathering of more than 2 people in the public. No movement between homes, unless absolutely necessary. Essential business and factories still opens but nothing else; as much work from home as possible. Schools have been closed since CNY. Mandatory nose and mouth covering (a measure being contemplated by the CDC, and decided on by Austria and the Czech Republic).",2020-04-01 13:21:01,384

Reality showed that not barracks, but foreign worker dormitories have become *de facto* quarantine zones now. Mrs Teo: MOM will improve the conditions after COVID-19. Right now, it's a quarantine zone. If you think it is not appropriate, please advise MOM, MOH and what not. Pick your responses carefully or you will sound like the next point.

Nixon promised all the support, he was kicked out of office, then Gerald Ford just left South Vietnam in the lurch. It was a bitter pill for people born in South Vietnam before 1975, my parents included.

Still, we need to look forward to the future. Even if all vaccines development fail (which 90% does), this pandemic will be a no problem in 10-15 years, at most. Climate change will be here with us for much longer. You can look into Cape Town's Day Zero crisis for a glimpse of what may happen and the steps advocated there 2 decades ago (in brief: give up  food, water, and energy security at the *national* level for food, water, and energy security at *regional* level. Don't squander precious water in arid regions to grow food or grapes \[Cape Town makes wine\], save it for industries and dense residential area.

> The government is clearly taking notes of other government's effective response at shutting down non-essential businesses. Aren't you glad they think other countries are relevant reference points?

Again, comparisons are fine, just that the comparison to the UK and US are flawed. We haven't locked down the country like the UK, so again what is contradiction here? 

> Yet you think ""You can still go out while being socially responsible""

How is this equivalent to ""everyone was perfectly going about social distancing""? In any event, even under the new restrictions, with F&B outlets and shopping malls still open, clearly we are still able to go out while exercising social responsibility.

> Clearly the government didn't think so today by closing down entertainment venues. It's almost as if with an aggressive disease like the ones we're seeing, half-measures don't work.

So... maybe not enough people were being socially responsible under the old measures? Again I don't make the point that everyone was perfectly adhering to social distancing - that's just a made up argument from you. 

Plus like I mention above, the Government's new measures still allow for F&B and malls to operate so... am I supposed to take that as evidence that ah ha u/puzzlingcomrade is still wrong!

1. My argument is that people should avoid non-essential activities, because being unnecessarily out in the community increases the number of transmission vectors for the disease.

2. Your argument is that no, people can and should still go out for non-essential activities, because hygiene and physical distancing within a venue is sufficient enough to prevent transmission. Avoiding non-essential activities hurts the economy.

3. I argue that hygiene and physical distancing is not sufficient to keep the transmission rates low. This is because of the nature of the disease (many asymptomatic carriers mean sick people don't realise they're sick, along with being contagious before symptoms) and also because you are heavily relying on strict discipline from every member of the public leaving the house (which we all know, doesn't work). Many other countries have attempted 'mitigation' measures over 'suppression' measures, and none have succeeded. Italy has warned others not to delay suppression methods (lockdowns).

4. Now it is just a matter of which is worse in the long run - we continue to let people attend non-essential gatherings, resulting in far more people getting sick and dying (the Hubei lockdown would have reduced the number of cases by 40,000 if it was done one day early - time matters) and businesses shutting anyway; or we discourage non-essential activities early, or shut down non-essential businesses like entertainment venues, have less sick and dying citizens, and the same economic impact. I don't know about you, but if I were the government I much rather deal with 40,000 unemployed for the next few months than 40,000 sick people (who can't work anyway).

5. We can discourage people from non-essential activities NOW, potentially saving us from a complete lockdown (no work in factories, offices, any non-essential workplace) at the loss of retail jobs, or keep them open for a few more weeks, have our medical system crash, and shut down all those businesses anyway.",2020-03-25 12:25:10,328

The problem with this is there are many more points of failure involved that if people are recommended to simply stay at home and avoid non-essential activities. You can feel healthy, and still spread the virus. You can forget to wash your hands. You may suddenly have a coughing fit you can't control. Staying at home avoids these issues. Humans aren't perfect, so control measures should not be reliant on discipline, especially with a disease this contagious.

> 3) I have also mentioned that comparing us to Italy, simply on the level of ""well Italy is did that and it failed and now they are doing this, so we should also do this"" is flawed, because social distancing is just one part of a wider series of mitigation measures against the virus.

The only functional epidemiological difference between Italy and us is that we have yet to have sustained community transmission, and I argue that it is simply a matter of time. Which is more probable - our contact tracing system is perfect, and we intercept every single case before it can spread to the community - or one single case (which is all we need) escapes into the community? Once contact tracing breaks down, the disease will spread through the community like it did in Italy - where weak mitigation measures did not work.

If you have the magic bullet solution of somehow saving businesses and reducing disease in some perfect min/max modelling solution, governments around will love to know. The UK tried and failed, Italy tried and failed, Australia is trying to do so (and is failing) NZ won't treat its population like an economic experiment so it doesn't bother and is going straight to stimulus + lockdown. 

Without going into the mathematics (which has been already explained here https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) trying to ease this virus into a 'slow burn' by progressively introducing measures is not as effective as introducing strict measures early and proactively, rather than reactively which is what Singapore is doing now (closing their entertainment venues after a spike).",2020-03-25 13:16:06,451

As such, new people will come in, we can't screen everyone for the virus, and eventually we will have to fall back on things like not going out when you are sick, washing hands, and so on.  If the present rates of infection allows us to have non-essential services, while at the same time emphasizing these social practices that we are going to need anyway in the long run, then this is a better option over shutting down everything temporarily and facing the very same problems a second time after non-essentials are opened up. 

2) We have not had sustained community transmission, because of many practices which differ from Italy. We actually have contract tracing, our social distancing measures are better, and we have closed the international boarder to just about everyone. It is a bit of a stretch to not take these into account when you say ""the only functional epidemiological difference"". Our mitigation measures aren't on the same level as pre-lock down Italy, and suggesting that our measures are ""weak"" similar to Italy is again a flawed comparison. 

3) We do not solely rely on contact tracing to prevent community spread, so there is no requirement for our tracing to be perfect. It isn't. That's why it is supplemented by things like preemptively sending all returning Singaporeans to a 14 day SHN, as well as social distancing practices. IF someone is infected by they are already working from home, the community spread chances are lower. 

4) The right balance between economic and public health interests is obviously unique to each country and the measures they are taking now. This should be obvious. Singapore has economic needs which are unique to Singapore. Just because the UK has failed does not mean that our current strategy is going to fail - again, this is a flawed comparison. 

5) You might want to read that article's comments on Singapore in more detail. It explains exactly why the comparisons you are making between Italy (etc) and Singapore are flawed. What can work in Singapore is different from what can work in the US/Italy, simply because of how we first responded to the first few cases. 

""Containment is making sure all the cases are identified, controlled, and isolated. It‚Äôs what Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan or Taiwan are doing so well: They very quickly limit people coming in, identify the sick, immediately isolate them, use heavy protective gear to protect their health workers, track all their contacts, quarantine them‚Ä¶ **This works extremely well when you‚Äôre prepared and you do it early on, and don‚Äôt need to grind your economy to a halt to make it happen**.

I‚Äôve already touted Taiwan‚Äôs approach. But China‚Äôs is good too. The lengths at which it went to contain the virus are mind-boggling. For example, they had up to 1,800 teams of 5 people each tracking every infected person, everybody they got interacted with, then everybody those people interacted with, and isolating the bunch. That‚Äôs how they were able to contain the virus across a billion-people country.
**This is not what Western countries have done. And now it‚Äôs too late**. The recent US announcement that most travel from Europe was banned is a containment measure for a country that has, as of today, 3 times the cases that Hubei had when it shut down, growing exponentially. How can we know if it‚Äôs enough? It turns out, we can know by looking at the Wuhan travel ban.""",2020-03-25 13:38:38,596

I don't see this as changed. 

The government's plans are clearly meant to balance businesses and public health needs. By allowing stores to remain open the government clearly expects people to still go buy goods and services. Heck the the regulations allow for the zoo to be open. These businesses can still operate but subject to new distancing rules.

Which is the point I also made in a separate post - it's possible to go out for non essential purposes and still be socially responsible. Non essential travel to malls (which have now become choke points which should be avoided) is a separate issue from all non essential travel.

Moreover just to take this all the way even if the government comes down with a full lock down tmr I don't see my opinion as changing either. The underlying point I made was the need to balance government regulations and keeping businesses alive. if the government decides that government regulations have to be strengthened to a full lock down, then the balancing exercise means that we should follow the rules of the lock down and support businesses in ways that still comply with the lock down (I've a separate thread talking about this).",2020-03-29 09:51:13,289

1) Masks should only be used for the sick.

2) People can still be carriers & transmitters of the virus even if they're not displaying any symptoms. 


Since you said the citizens need to be thinking ahead for themselves, so should we or shouldn't we have hoarded the masks to wear? Genuinely interested in your perception of this dilemma.

People were going to hoard either way. You can't expect people not to panic. It's in human nature. Some citizens who are more level-headed and/or well-informed will be able to read between the lines of what they're saying. But they're a small minority. We even had the advantage of seeing other countries do it first. Was there a single country whose majority of citizens did not panic buy? Why should any different to be expected of Singaporeans? 

Rather than bemoan human nature and admittedly, the lack of education for many of these people, we should try to account for it in our measures going forward. Closing our eyes to this issue won't make it go away. If we factor it into our measures, at least we won't keep getting blind-sided and then now the Gov has to repeat the importance of social distancing every single fucking announcement.

So many of the issues today stemmed from the fact that we didn't have enough supply to meet demand at first (not the government's fault) but you need to understand that for any critical thinking Singaporeans, they saw the paradox in this situation already. But they chose not to give in to panic buying anyway because they understood the dangers of that as well. Which pretty much leaves them no choice but to hope for the best because they see how they're damned if they do and damned if they don't. Giving vague instructions in the beginning naturally leads to misunderstandings. You can't have your cake (keeping business as usual, reduce panicking) and still eat it (stomping out the virus). 

But these things led us to the situation we're in today. We can only play with the cards we're dealt. Whether we made bad calls or good calls earlier, now is not the time to portion out the blame. 

Your mistake was in engaging your parents of blaming whichever side. Whether it's the people, the government or both - it literally doesn't affect your situation. Any conclusion you reach will not improve the situation. The dice has already been rolled. 

Instead, look forward and think of how to keep them safe. Educate them on the necessity and measures required for social distancing. We must believe that we can still recover. If we still want to point fingers, we can do it after we're over this hurdle.",2020-04-10 22:36:21,452

1st) The elderly care center that has a widespread case of covid-19. The government knew that there is a high risk for elderly to die from the virus, but they did not take proactive measure and now, a lot of elderly there are suffering 

2nd)With the dormitory cases, in February, there is a case of foreign worker getting the virus visiting Mustafa centre, they should have close it since there is no real social distancing there. And with the exploded dormitory cases they should also separate the well and unwell workers immediately after the cases in dormitory was found but they did not. They seem to not learn from the diamond princess cruise ship

3rd) They should be upfront on the mask issue. Instead of saying that healthy do not need mask, they should be upfront and say that we should leave mask to the frontline healthcare workers and if there are extra, we will give to the people. I don‚Äôt think we would blame them if they are upfront on this mask issue. And to add on why Taiwan can get lots of mask making machine but singapore can‚Äôt? 

4th)I don‚Äôt blame the people for actually raiding the supermarket. The government told us that we will have enough mask in the starting days, but to the honest, can anyone find mask in the early days, I can‚Äôt. Thus being lied once, people wouldn‚Äôt want to believe in a lie second time as the saying goes fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me, people will have the instinct to survive that‚Äôs why they raid the supermarket 

5th) By calling people to go out during march eg. Pm Lee bird park photo, this tells me that everything is ok and that we should be going out and going around doing normal stuff instead of being at home. But now, we knew this is wrong behavior.

6th) By having circuit breaker, I feel that it is the government fault. A lot of people on this subreddit suggest that lockdown is inevitable and that we are already late at it, instead why don‚Äôt we look in the direction that there shouldn‚Äôt be a lockdown in the first place, if the government acted urgently in the first place and studied stories around the world and act on it, we would not be in the situation now

Josephine Teo's response is weak at best. That's an example of how the G could have done better. Another instance would have been their lack of firmness in - for example - implementing a ban on incoming flights from China. Other countries did it earlier, and benefited from this. It's not xenophobic in this context, contra to what Lawrence Wong (I think it's him?) mentioned. 

On the other hand, sections of the population have shown a rather thick-headed disregard for the circuit breaker rules. Granted, it does take some getting used to for some.

This is one of the more puzzling things that I see. Why keep coming up with new phrases, new ways to call things? Call a quarantine order a quarantine order, and you won't have issues like this. To the older generation, it seems like they have something that prevents them from picking up things easily (see parents who ask you why can't they use F2 to edit cells in Google spreadsheet when they could in Excel at their desktop at work). That is the reason why if they don't call it a quarantine order, they assume it isn't.

> I argued that it would've caused mass panic if CB was straight up termed as a lockdown or if DORSCON was raised to red, seeing that people were already crowding super markets before PM Lee even made the CB announcement.

So Singapore came up with the DORSCON levels, and decided to include another level that they don't intend to use because it causes panic? If announcing PM Lee is going to give a speech drives panic through the population, we'll not pre-announce his speech in the near future?

I'm a bit confused myself with regards to the being obedient to the government, I've gone through a phase where I hated PAP (2011-ish, currently I'm meh on them) and I do think that being obedient to the government is actually how the government wants us to be.

You cannot say that it is common sense that SHN is effectively quarantine because we already have a use for that word, QO which is much more serious and carries severe legal power . Some would thus come to a logical conclusion that SHN is nowhere near that of a quarantine (remember, just because they are wrong does not mean it was illogical, hence the need for clear communication ). 

TBH, the policies could've been more proactive. E.g. HR people all over the country were having a massive headache trying to track and implement the guidelines put forward by Mom... Only for it to change a few days later.

This puts both the country and the govt in a deadlock, trying to balance moving forward with a less paternalistic approach while still having to be heavy handed to those who either unknowingly or flagrantly flout the rules and advices of the govt. Cant please everyone at the same time, but people really need to start to think beyond their own selfish impulses and see the bigger picture. The funny thing is that not going into a full fledge lockdown could possibly be seen as the govt trusting the people to self regulate and keep apart where possible/necessary while trying to keep our tiny economy afloat. But the slow implementation of various methods of punishment is their reaction to the population still not collectively doing enough.

Calling it a CB didn't really seem to get through to most people...with singaporeans you have to be direct. However, something else may have prompted the soft approach hehe.

I would argue a notice that is legally binding has to be worded unambiguously so it can be enforced without contention. Look at legal contracts, you can't go to court and argue the other party should read between the lines and not do x, y, or z. People only have to follow the letter of the law. Of course you can say that people should have common sense etc, etc, and I would agree with you, but this wouldnt negate the fact that the SHN was badly/hastily worded (if it was, I havent seen one, so going by what your mother said).

>I argued that it would've caused mass panic if CB was straight up termed as a lockdown or if DORSCON was raised to red, seeing that people were already crowding super markets before PM Lee even made the CB announcement

IMHO They should decide on measures in the interests of public health first, other issues (panic buying, hoarding) can be dealt with by how you implement the measures. E.g. why not work with the supermarkets to announce all of them will remain open regardless of lockdown status before we raised to DORSCON orange. This was only done at DORSCON CB. They can also implement limits to what people can purchase. This was only implemented on the second day of DORSCON Orange and/or closure of causeway IIRC.

>even with CB in place, some of the populace still refuse to listen

I would say this is besides the point and doesn't show whether the govt response was enough. Would anyone say ""might as well not have CB since some ppl will refuse to listen'? Similarly pointing out that people didnt follow the measures is not proof that the measures, if followed by everyone, are sufficient/effective etc.

>the only counter-argument I got was ""Aiya he's so stubborn don't bother arguing with him""

I feel you man. What I do when I got older was to ask myself if I'm arguing to voice my opinion or to try and get another perspective.

The latter is way harder because you have to separate your disapproval from your clarifying questions. It can be almost impossible to do it with older family members :(

Which makes me wonder why they're so stupid. The government already say don't go out. They explained why. It's not like there's no reason for this. As if they want to flex their dictatorial powers. There is a bloody reason. Still, they go out. 

I feel that only when the govt impose a very heavy price for going out would they stay at home.

I live and work in johor but I have extended family in singapore, and I am really surprised that somehow singaporeans are not taking this stay at home thing more seriously. not just the young, but the elderly!

singapore has about ~15% of malaysia‚Äôs population. the infected cases and the surge in new cases that singapore is seeing in the past week is so worrying.

I know a big portion of the numbers in singapore is from migrant workers. in malaysia, we have about ~500 positive cases from migrant workers. we are still testing them including undocumented ones like illegal migrants, refugees from rohingya and so on.

the point is, in proportion to singapore population, the covid numbers are big - but singaporeans are still not taking this as seriously as they should (?)

I watched PM Lee (speaks perfect Bahasa Melayu by the way, what a leader) on CNA and it is obvious he is frustrated that people are not taking him seriously on this covid threat. Almost as if he is saying, I am so sorry I am making your life inconvenient, but please!

anyway just a sharing from your neighbor in an MCO.

Seeing too many complaints about the queues at supermarkets (some variant of ""Stay home. Order delivery. Don't be the siasuay hoarder/idiot queueing for groceries"") and decided to post on the issue. 

Just think about it, most people are going from at least 1-2 meals eating out a day on average pre-COVID to 1 or less. That's going to be a minimum 30-50% decrease in prepared food purchases that have to be made up in groceries. Even if you are eating some hermit meal of instant noodles/plain rice/bread with instant coffee it's still an increase. Honestly I doubt if anyone is still maintaining a comparable schedule of takeaway purchases because of the inconvenience of having to bring it home to eat. 

That also means that volume purchased on regular pre-COVID grocery runs are going to last 30-50% less time than they would have. Hence people need to purchase extra volume to make up for it, on top of the double whammy of buying extra to reduce trips out of the house. Added to the fact that most people's refrigerators are not equipped to handle the increase in volume so they end up having to shop every 3-4 days. 

Also, from my experience delivery services are slammed at operational capacity so recommending them is not going to change aggregate demand at supermarkets in any way. If you disagree please direct me to an online supermarket that you believe has spare capacity (i.e. more delivery slots than people wanting to buy) so I can eat my hat

What sg is going through with the tightened measures is not uncommon or new, many in other countries put up such resistance too.

I agree that we are lucky, but I disagree with your saying that I am lacking in empathy. What I'm speaking about is based on observations that I've seen, in a country that had to go into lockdown way before things are happening back home; that I have seen these issues in this country and hope to provide perspectives for those back home. 

Similarly, a couple of weeks ago, before the daily highs, I've tried to convince friends and family back home (even in some groups I'm in) to slowly take stock of things that they would need and accumulate them gradually. I've asked them to prepare for an eventual lockdown. But the general answer is quite like yours ""you're overseas"", ""you dont understand"", etc. Like it or not, till a vaccine is found, countries would have to do temporary shutdowns.

But, perhaps it‚Äôs a misunderstanding on my part idk, the fact that you brought up your fridge and your household of 2 is implying that you are drawing comparisons. 

Like you said. It‚Äôs not representative. And I completely agree.

If you‚Äôre offended that I ‚Äúimplied‚Äù that you‚Äôre lacking in empathy. Then i apologise, because like yourself who didn‚Äôt make it clear that you‚Äôre referring to the fridge space, I was referring to the general nit picky population in Singapore for not empathising with people who really need the food supplies. 

But our entire ‚Äúdebate‚Äù, if it can even be called one, started from our different perspectives at how the Singapore government handled the situation and the populace response. Why I brought up the need to empathise is because none of us have the full picture. You have your perspective after looking at Italy firsthand and reading up on local news. Likewise, I‚Äôll have mine as I literally live here and read up on foreign news. 

Media will reflect the situation with tinted lens, regardless. And we process it by incorporate our own biases and views. To be really honest, the only reason why I even spend time giving my perspective is because of your initial comment on the ‚Äúdoomsday panic buyers‚Äù. 

Sure, some are. But not all. Hence, that‚Äôs where the empathy comes in. Not only for you, but for me and everyone else out there who decides to make a quick passing comment. Trust me, I do too.",2020-04-12 18:50:18,309

I'm not offended, just idk a bit tired of trying to read tones in online platforms and things like that so sorry if I jumped the gun, or appear aggressive. I'm just worried about things back home without being able to do anything, either from here or if I'm back home, because I can't get on the ground to work things out. 

Back to the fridge (lol) I suppose I'm speaking from the perspective of being a preschool teacher when  I was in sg. I've taught in both private and public preschools, and have visited the homes of my students. It was meant to be a general statement, which I guess can come off as blas√©. It's not that I think absolutely everyone can afford groceries for weeks on end, but I think that those who were crowding supermarkets aren't in the category that can't afford things.

Once again, I apologize if I sound like I'm speaking from a point of privilege,  but it is mostly concern for things back home.

> According to Gan, Dorscon Red will result in a lot of uncontrollable outbreaks, very widespread community transmission as well as an environment where it has become very difficult to do contact tracing and quarantines.

> Red would also mean that Singapore was relying ‚Äúpurely on safe distancing‚Äù.

> Gan stated that Singapore has not given up on contact tracing or quarantine, in fact, they are stepping up on their contact tracing efforts.

> They are trying to ring-fence the transmission to contain it, and gradually bring down the number of cases.

> Gan then said that he thinks Singapore is ‚Äúquite a distance‚Äù from Dorscon Red.

> He also outlined how important it is to have Singaporeans to cooperate. He pointed out how sometimes patients are forgetful or straight up untruthful about where they had been.

> SINGAPORE - The authorities have designated the status of the coronavirus outbreak here as Yellow - which generally means that, on the whole, life can go on as normal.

> However, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Tuesday (Feb 4) that the situation could change to Orange if there is widespread transmission from unknown sources.

> That would be just one level below Red, which signifies an out-of-control pandemic.

> The Dorscon or Disease Outbreak Response System Condition is part of Singapore's pandemic preparedness plan that describes the current situation and what has to be done.

> In the colour coding system, Green means there are just minor problems.

> Yellow - the status now - refers either to a mild infection, or a severe infection that is not spreading here, but of which the community needs to be careful.

> Orange means the disease is severe with transmission, but is generally contained, and has moderate to high public health impact - as was the case with Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003.

> Some have argued that with seven local residents infected here, Singapore is already in Orange.

> However, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has said the Dorscon categories are not cast in stone, but are general guidelines for action.

> So even though Singapore is at Yellow, some of the measures implemented, such as quarantine and temperature screening, are actually Orange measures.

> The reason Singapore has not officially moved to Orange is because there is now only one cluster, which if contained, could stop the spread of the virus here, said MOH.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Get latest updates

> Related Story Interactive: What we know so far about the coronavirus

> But even at Yellow, the Health Crisis Management Group (CMG) meets daily to coordinate medical and operational responses.

> The purpose of the Dorscon measures is to delay or limit the spread of the disease in the country. Moving to Yellow already alerts the whole of government to stand ready.

> To handle the current crisis, Singapore has gone a step further and set up a high-level, multi-ministerial task force to coordinate a whole of government response.

> But to succeed, every person has to do his or her part, said the authorities. Official measures alone, no matter how stringent, will not be enough.

> So far, the 24 people who were infected had all sought medical help.

> The Singaporean tour guide who had accompanied a group of Chinese tourists to the popular Yong Thai Hang medical hall had no signs of illness, but when she heard that two saleswomen from the shop had fallen ill, she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

> Tests showed that she had the virus.

> Related Story Relief measures expected amid coronavirus crisis

> Mr Gan said on Tuesday: ""We continue to be vigilant for more cases. There may be more with exposure to this particular travel group.""

> The health authorities said others who have had close contact with visitors from China, especially if those visitors appeared unwell, should monitor themselves and see a doctor if they feel ill.

As the only possibility is panic and economic collapse. It‚Äôs not like there is any other possibility, like governments taking it seriously, apply travel restrictions, test procedures, quarantines, unlock some funds for quarantined people so they can safely stop spreading rather than feeling pressured to hide it and go to work creating uncontrollable clusters, etc.

What is lacking here is better communication from the WHO about precautions regarding protection and prevention measures except simple advise like washing hands and putting some temperature control at airports.

This critical period in which a lot of infected mainland Chinese travellers got around the world, would have been exactly the right point of time in which actionable steps to contain the virus should have been communicated in guidebooks to various governments. Apparently this hasn't happened. It tells us that there is a reform of the WHO and global emergency network required

The activation of the PHPC system should've been a dead giveaway. They're effectively asking all people with respiratory symptoms to come forward, see the doctor, and get 5 days MC, and then stay at home with the MC (effectively self-isolating, though not from family.) GKY also mentions that he'd rather people go back to see the same doctor, since their medical history is already there, if they don't recover after 5 days, rather than bouncing between GPs.

The overall picture is that if you have a mild flu or cold, the 5 days MC should settle you; if you have mild COVID-19, they're not interested in catching you, and if you take the 5 day MC seriously, your ability to spread the virus will be limited. (Notice that this is similar to [what South Korea has done](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200224000754) by asking people with respiratory symptoms to stay home.)

But 'only severe cases' is a bit off - AFAIK, you will still be automatically tested if you have pneumonia, if you demonstrate respiratory symptoms *and* met the profile of a suspect case (this is been vague, but apparently includes people who have come from Daegu, Cheongdo, or China within the last 14 days, and presumably persons identified as direct contacts), or at your GP's discretion, which will likely be if you have respiratory symptoms that do not subside after 5 days - even if they are not more severe.",2020-02-25 22:53:53,235
