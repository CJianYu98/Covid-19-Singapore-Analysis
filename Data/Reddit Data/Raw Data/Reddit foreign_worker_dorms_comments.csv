> SINGAPORE: A resident of a migrant worker dormitory has become Singapore’s first likely case of COVID-19 re-infection, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday (Feb 6).

> 

> The case is a 28-year-old Bangladeshi work permit holder who lives in a dormitory at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Apr 12 last year, and on Jan 25 this year, he tested positive again.

> ""He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH’s surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their postinfection immunity,"" said the ministry.

> When the man was confirmed to have had COVID-19 last year, he was identified as Case 2513 and was part of the cluster of infections at Tech Park Crescent dormitory, which is located at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> He recovered from that infection and tested negative for COVID-19 from last June onwards.

> However, the man tested positive for COVID-19 once again on Jan 25 this year and he was isolated. ""Numerous repeat tests conducted subsequently were also positive for the virus,"" said MOH on Saturday.

> 

> The man's new infection was not previously stated in the ministry's situation reports. CNA has sought further information from MOH.

> 

> In its press release on Saturday, MOH said the man reported feeling unwell on Jan 22 and 23, but was otherwise asymptomatic.

> Advertisement

> He is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and all his identified close contacts have been isolated and quarantined. None have tested positive for COVID-19 so far.

> 

> “While re-infection is rare, the expert panel, which comprises infectious diseases and microbiology experts from NCID, Singapore General Hospital and the National Public Health Laboratory, has assessed that the clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that this is a likely case of re-infection,” MOH said.

> “In addition to his positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results, there was a corresponding marked increase in antibody titres compared to the period prior to the likely re-infection, suggesting that he was exposed to a new infection which boosted his antibody levels.

> “The virus detected in his samples taken in January 2021 is also genetically distinct from that associated with the dormitories outbreak in 2020, suggesting that this is likely a different and new infection.”

> 

> MOH said it will continue to monitor recovered COVID-19 cases to determine their post-infection immunity. No significant loss of post-infection immunity has been detected among recovered workers in dormitories so far.

63,fmlffzt,t1_fml3n3w,"Yeah it’s frustrating right?

There are a lot of worker dorms in Tuas cos of the shipyards and I really hope the virus won’t spread in there. Even before the circuit breaker measures, on any Sunday night, once you go all the way into Tuas, you’ll just see endless numbers of workers, most of whom will be lounging seated or lying down on the pavements using their phones. Imagine how cramped and stuffy their rooms are for them to prefer to lie down on the roadside pavements. 

(Source: I went in there before to distribute crowdsourced Christmas gifts as part of an initiative by ItsRainingRaincoats :))

From tomorrow onwards, with many of their work sites stopping work, it may possibly be the same scene all day every day. Hopefully it won’t be so crowded that even outside in the open air will put them at risk, especially since most of them aren’t provided masks.

But at least Mustafa will be closed for the time being. I have a feeling that it may later be discovered that Mustafa is the common link between all the worker dorm clusters.",t3_fvt91v,2020-04-06 23:02:16,thefibrobee,2

But that is why we have governments and laws. Governments job is to constrain corporations from doing bad things while allowing profits to flow. What can we people do? We have no power to riot or protest, government took those away from us. The only player here with any real power to constrain these companies is the government, not us. You literally cannot hold your pitchfork outside these dorms, you will go to jail for protesting. 

Additionally we have warned the Government many times that this has been happening. As an analogy, imagine if a murderer is running rampant in your neighbourhood. After the first murder, you can say its the murderer's fault. So you complain to the police to ask him to get caught. But the police does nothing. After the 5th or 6th murder, the neighbourhood would be faulting the police too right? And then you come along and tell your neighbours ""why are you blaming the police but dont  blame the murderer""? What can your neighbours do? 

First time it happens, can say its the dorm operators. But please la, we've known about this overcrowding and unhygienic problem for donkey years and have complained to MOM. They dont do anything about it.",t3_fvt91v,2020-04-06 22:50:10,ChinaWine_official,13

But sadly, you know how it is here in Sg, they’re just gonna keep with the status quo until the Govt slaps them with a warning. Cos even if the migrant workers or advocates sound out to the dorm’s building management, nothing happens. Which is why most of those who voice out about this issue (as well as other issues relating to migrant workers) direct it towards the Govt.

It’s just like how at least 10 (or more) years ago, companies that employ just a small number of foreign workers used to rent an entire HDB unit for their workers, and such “dorms” were often overcrowded as well, until HDB set down the maximum occupancy for each unit (no matter 3/4 room or bigger) to be 6. 

Back then, most worker dorms around were built and managed by the employers, usually large companies that employ a lot of workers, such as SembCorp, Keppel shipyard, etc. Those dorms usually have more amenities & facilities and generally offer a better living environment (but still cannot compare to SAF bunks la).

*Migrant worker NGOs have campaigned about overcrowding in dormitories for years. A 2014 medical sciences paper noted previous outbreaks of typhus and pneumonia, possibly due to dorms’ “high density” and “occasionally less than satisfactory sanitary living conditions”.*

*After the first cases in February, activists and NGOs sounded the alarm.

This is not hindsight. We all knew that bosses in construction companies were cutting corners by giving these workers shitty living conditions.

>SAF bunks are quite similar; 50-100 men sharing the same toilet facilities, 10-20 men sleeping in bunks with beds separated 1-2 metres apart. However, NSFs and NSmen are probably better educated with regards to hygiene practices and precautions to be taken against the virus, and are also likely to be less clustered in general.

Hence the danger and potential for a cluster to form in camps. Also, i'm sure stand by bunks are being conducted more rigourously now but still...i wouldn't exactly trust the standards of a typical NSF haha.
However he also makes a good point that NSFs are more probably more inclined to report sick as they have less to lose. Can refer to his comment for the full details.",t3_fvt91v,2020-04-06 17:59:51,Klubeht,24
79,fmkttxk,t1_fmkqjl1,"Yeah I’m surprised too that people think migrant worker dorms look like SAF bunks. Anyone who has seen how an average (read: not the worst) foreign worker dorm room looks like will surely not suggest such a comparison. IMHO, when compared to foreign worker dorms, SAF bunks will easily qualify as being five star standard. Not just the aspects of cleanliness or amenities (even just the basic need of having a working toilet), though those are very important factors, but I’ll put them aside since many would assume these aspects are due to the workers not taking care or keeping clean. 

I believe the key issue behind how fast the virus can spread in worker dorms, potentially making it a “petri dish” situation, aside from the lack of cleanliness and/or hygiene in a majority of the dorms, are the issues of poor ventilation and the severe lack of physical distancing. Most worker dorm rooms would pack say, three bunk beds within the size of a bedroom in an average HDB flat (the BTO ones, not the older flats), leaving only enough room for everyone to get up and down the beds. FWIK (from being a volunteer with ItsRainingRaincoats), most of the rooms also do not have any drawers/cupboards/wardrobes/storage. Most of the workers store their belongings in their one luggage bag which they store underneath the bottom bunks of their beds.

And by the way, about the issue of cleanliness, most migrant workers do clean up after themselves, but as with all communal living, it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for everyone else. Just to quote an example, I’ve once had a housemate (I’m a room renter) who was super gross, leaving food waste and used sanitary pads lying around in the open everywhere in the house, even all over the floor of her room. 🤮 *shuddering just from recalling 😖. So no, it’s not about one’s level of education. 

P.S. The general public will likely be surprised to know that a lot of migrant workers who are working here in Singapore actually have at least a diploma from their home countries.",t3_fvt91v,2020-04-06 18:20:17,thefibrobee,39

It’s how to balance everything with minimal effect to daily lives or minimal effort for recovery after all is over because damage is inevitable. It’s definitely not an easy task, and many people seem to glance over this point when they criticize the policies enacted. 

Sure, it’s easy to say close schools and work places. But that would have downstream effects which you need to plan for very carefully and prepare for. I think that secretly, they have been ramping up the efforts in the background without telling us exactly what they’re doing. For example the recently abandoned precinct near my place due to en bloc is now being refitted with many new facilities, with rumors that it will be a quarantine/SHN center. There’s absolutely no news about that, but residents are seeing the work done and the urgency of speed that it’s done at, it’s not hard to put two and two together.  Also when you start to look at everything from multiple angles you really start to fathom how critically complex the whole response and coordination is and that’s when you realize that the government has been many steps ahead of where they are. This is not something many people come to realize in the midst of of their criticism. So it’s easy to stand there and say “they should have done this and that” in hindsight, but it’s all people speaking from the limited knowledge they have. Granted, I do not know much too but I can understand and see why the policies and implemented the way they are. 

And to blame the government on such issues they are receiving heat for, it’s not all fair to them. At the end of the day, the government makes the policies but it is the people who enact them.

209,gg88691,t1_gg80ch8,">Agreed with you on the masks, the govt could have just be transparent (we don't have enough for everyone

The government wasn't lying. The scientific consensus in late Feb was that there wasn't convincing proof of asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission. 

[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/no-proof-of-asymptomatic-transmission-of-coronavirus-ncid](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/no-proof-of-asymptomatic-transmission-of-coronavirus-ncid)

It didn't help that a case study written up in Germany published in a very high profile scientific journal was retracted after it turned out that the woman had symptoms after all. And the other case studies of asymptomatic transmission were rather dodgy reports from China. 

If Covid was only transmitted by sick, coughing people (like the way it was with SARS), then only sick people and health workers would need to wear masks. Wearing a cloth mask to protect yourself didn't make a lot of sense because the holes are huge. Only when it was confirmed that Covid was quite infectious before symptoms emerged did it make sense for people to wear cloth masks to protect others from their flying droplets. Try holding your hand out in front of your face and blowing with and without a cloth mask on -- you won't feel the ""wind"" when you're wearing a mask, so even if your droplets make it through the cloth, they aren't traveling far.",t3_kfbgjm,2020-12-18 14:44:50,DuePomegranate,16
210,gg820io,t1_gg80ch8,"To add on to your point, even if the government was deliberately lying because they knew they didn’t have enough masks for everyone, the problem is basically that of the boy who cried wolf. You have public organisations like schools who take guidance from the government when it comes to this sort of thing. If they say no masks, then the schools are not going to enforce the wearing of them. You may also have teachers who end up reinforcing the same wrong messaging to the students, or who want to wear masks but are concerned it may lead to send the wrong messaging to others. 

So we have situations where teachers and students are facing each other the entire day, without face masks, because we trusted the government. It just didn’t help their (and our) credibility. 

Second, as a teacher, I will say that the best time to close schools and implement a CB would have been right at the start of the March holidays. To me, it’s not even hindsight, just plain common sense. You give everyone a grace period of a week to get ready what they need to prepare (eg: childcare arrangements for parents, teachers get time to prepare for HBL). Instead, the most moronic thing that could happen was that people continued to travel overseas (because what else would they do during the holidays?), despite knowing that we were in the midst of a pandemic, and the government said or did nothing! 

It was only after the holidays were almost over, that the govt slap a retroactive 2-week SHN notice on everyone who had left the country. But schools still remained open, so schools were taxed because you had staff who couldn’t show up for work, teachers were taxed because they had to prepare online lessons for students who didn’t show up for school, on top of conducting their normal classes. 

The situation was just messy and chaotic and it was clear the various ministries were not coordinating with one another. 

It’s easy to say that the government only did one or two things wrong, but these have ripple effects that affect a lot of other organisations and people, and us on the ground bore the brunt of the fallout. Just a lot of negative work that could have been avoid right from the get go, had the government been a lot more firm and decisive.",t3_kfbgjm,2020-12-18 13:26:57,ngrenjie,10

As for countries that reached quickly enough, Taiwan? Thanks to nature of their relationship with China, they rightfully suspected that China was trying to cover up the pandemic as early as in December, and so started screening passengers from China, as well as stocking up on sufficient quantities of PPE and mandating the wearing of masks early on. 

You are talking about a lag time of 3-4 months. 

Meanwhile, it was painfully clear early on that the WHO was in cahoots with China in covering up the spread of the virus, and our government still continued to listen to and adhere to their guidance like suckers.

The point isn’t that the money cannot be used for the benefit of our people and the economy of our country. You have to take it out, you have to take it out. I continue to stand by my initial assertion that the money wasn’t used as efficiently as it could because of missteps by the government.

I mean, look at the current situation. Our borders are still closed (more or less), but many businesses are still able to operate (shopping malls are packed), people are still able to WFH and connect with foreign businesses via Zoom or Webex, and life goes on.

Here's what I believe would have happened had we closed our borders earlier like what Taiwan did. It's like when a company recalls all their products because a small batch may be faulty. It's extreme, but you know that you won't have any more cases because of it. You can then focus on managing the issue internally, without having to worry about what's happening beyond your shores.

Yes, there would be companies that would suffer like SIA and tour agencies, but the amount of money that would need to be channeled towards propping them up would be a drop in the bucket compared to the 92 billion spent in total. Or just let them close, like what happened with Robinsons.

So people can't come in and out of Singapore (at least not easily). We can still import food and other necessities. The government would be able to focus all their energies on managing the dormitory situation because their attention is not split between 2 battles on two different fronts. We may not even have needed a CB in the first place if the cases were coming mostly from the foreign workers (whom the government continued to confine in the same places anyways).

Sometimes, all it takes is one wrong decision to have a domino effect. This may have been it. The decision to take China and the WHO at their word. And we have been paying for that mistake ever since.

They did not shift the goal posts. The case count goes up only if the person tests positive using a PCR test. They are not added in if they test positive only for serology. This is in line with international practice.

If anything I think MOH has been transparent in all their information provided. Of course, more information would be appreciated but still. IMO, look at the press releases instead of looking at the media reports. Prepare for more BTW, they still have 65k left to serology test.

To deal with an outbreak of an extremely infectious disease like COVID-19, we need to go beyond contact tracing and test. Atomise the group into mutually exclusive contact cells and forbid the cells from contacting each others. I know at least one Singapore hospital does this for its staff (from a radiology during COVID-19 conference); breaking up the staff into small 5-10 people teams that have no contacts with other teams.

> SINGAPORE: A new COVID-19 cluster was reported on Saturday (Aug 22) at Singapore's biggest purpose-built dormitory, about a month after it was declared to be ""fully cleared"" of the coronavirus.

> 

> Two of the newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore are linked to 55 previous cases to form a new cluster at Sungei Tengah Lodge dormitory at 500 Old Choa Chu Kang Road, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The cluster at Sungei Tengah Lodge was among the largest in Singapore before the dormitory was declared cleared of COVID-19 by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Jul 21.

> More than 2,200 confirmed cases had been linked to the cluster. MOH closed the cluster on Jul 18.

> Sungei Tengah Lodge is Singapore's biggest purpose-built dormitory, with about 16,000 workers living there.

> It was first declared an isolation area on Apr 9, and was among the first dormitories be gazetted as an isolation area under the Infectious Diseases Act. The notification was revoked on Jul 18.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> MOM and MOH said on Aug 18 that about 100 new COVID-19 cases have been detected in migrant worker dormitories that were previously given the all clear from the virus.

> Some of the new cases were picked up through routine testing that is conducted biweekly, and some of the workers had gone back to work.

> 

> EMPLOYERS MUST SCHEDULE SWAB TEST

> 

> On Saturday, authorities said employers must ensure their workers have completed a COVID-19 swab test in the past 14 days by Sep 5, as part of plans to ensure the safe restart of work. Those who have not done so will not be able to return to work.

> Workers who are staying in dormitories and those in the construction, marine and process sectors, as well as those going into the work sites, are required to undergo rostered routine testing every 14 days.

> To date, about 16,000 employers have scheduled their workers for rostered routine testing using the Health Promotion Board's swab registration system, the authorities said. About 102,000 workers who need to undergo routine testing have yet to be scheduled for a swab test.

> 

> “Employers are reminded to quickly schedule appointment slots for their workers if they have not done so, to avoid disruption to business operations,” the authorities said on Saturday.

> 

> There are currently about 13,700 workers who are still serving out their quarantine period, said MOH on Saturday, adding that they will be tested when their quarantine ends.

> ""We expect the case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter,"" the health ministry said.

> Singapore reported 50 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, including two in the community and five imported infections.

> This brings the total number of cases in the country to 56,266, with fatalities remaining at 27.

> 

> Both of the community cases are Singaporeans and are currently unlinked to previous cases, the health ministry said.

> 

> One of the cases, a 63-year-old woman, was tested after being admitted to a hospital for another medical condition. The other community case, a 56-year-old woman, had gone to work at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College Central. She was detected to have the coronavirus after she was diagnosed with acute respiratory infection.

> The five imported cases include a Singaporean man who returned from Iran on Aug 10, two dependant's pass holders, a student's pass holder and a work permit holder currently employed in Singapore.

> 

> The five imported cases were placed on stay-home notices upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their stay-home notices at dedicated facilities.

Only allow groups that are cleared to go back to work. And to be very clear about this too: no face-to-face interactions with non-dorms people at work. No, zero, nada.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946441/

No. What you wrote is not how it's done. In a larger country, we go by towns, cities, or districts. With Singapore, we can go by GRC boundaries or drawing boundaries base on the nearest supermarket. The idea is simple. Stop all public transports that go further than however far it is needed for people to get to the nearest supermarket and have everyone do grocery shopping there and there only. This limits everyone's movement range and ensure outbreaks occur in a geographically limited manner. Not this going across the island just to buy food.

Then we establish a red, yellow, green areas. Green = no community cases for 1-2 weeks + not bordering red zones. Yellow = no community cases in 1-2 weeks but bordering a red zone. Red = active community cases. in green zones, things can be pre-covid, except masks. In red zones = maximum restrictions. Yellow = some restrictions. 

Then how people get to work. Well most should work from home. For the essential workers that relied on public transports: use the freed up buses to perform pickups, business-by-business; or restrict MRTs to ""work only"". Within businesses, do like some Singapore hospitals do and split staff into small non-interacting teams.

No we don't. Oral-fecal (or inhaled fecal aerosol) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been established. Viral RNA is found in feces and sewage, but viability and transmissibility has not been demonstrated. Still a good idea to flush with the lid down though.   
Spread of SARS in Hong Kong due to flushing of toilets wasn't because of flushing with the lids up. It was because of a lousy plumbing system (since banned) where floor U-traps dried out and flushing of the toilet in one apartment caused aerosol to spew out of the floor drain of the apartment above.

Creating safe bubble from small unit, may be a town or hdb estate, since most are designed to be self sufficient. Within each bubble, people can live their new normal life.

Bubbles with no cases that are next to each other can be joint up to form larger bubble slowly. Safe bubbles can start to be productive and resume work. Then they can provide support to fulfill needs from bubbles under lockdown. 

However, this is definitely not as easy as it seem. A lot of issues to think about. What if certain essential service not available in the some bubble? How do you enforce it?

Tommy Koh is right - a first world society with third world values. This falls on society broadly, companies that employ and mistreat these foreign workers, and also importantly, the government. When I read Josephine Teo's remarks on the situation, I was extremely disheartened. It strikes me as unapologetic, quick to pin the blame on others, instead of taking accountability for policy (and human dignity) failings as minister of manpower. This time bomb has now exploded but we've known about the deplorable conditions and attitudes towards foreign workers for a long time - it was a error of commission, not ommission, in allowing the problem to fester. After this is resolved, we should not let a good crisis go to waste - let's amplify the voices pushing for positive change, let's uplevel our values, and let's hold our leaders to account.

313,fmvydi9,t3_fxrghv,"> # Record 287 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore, links found between Mustafa Centre and clusters in foreign worker dormitories

> SINGAPORE - Singapore saw a sharp spike of 287 coronavirus cases on Thursday (April 9), with the majority linked to foreign worker dormitories.

> This is the highest daily number reported to date and brings the total number of cases here to 1,910, as the global number of cases crossed the 1.5 million mark.

> Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean is now advising the multi-ministry taskforce on handling the Covid-19 situation in foreign worker dormitories, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that the police and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are involved in operations there.

> To cut the chain of transmission in dormitories, thousands of foreign workers who are healthy - especially those working in essential services - will be moved to army camps, floating hotels, and vacant Housing Board blocks.

> Singapore has also started active case finding and is swab-testing workers in various dormitories, said the Health Ministry's (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Thursday.

> Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories.

> Associate Professor Mak said the ministry believes that foreign workers had visited Mustafa Centre, where some employees had fallen ill, and gotten infected there.

> They then transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who subsequently infected others at their dormitories.

> ""Many had very mild symptoms and so they continued to work, that's why there was a delay in picking them up,"" said Mr Wong, who chairs the ministerial task force along with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. It is likely that the virus had been spreading in dormitories for some time, he said.

>

> 

> Mr Wong said Singapore is dealing with two separate infection spreads.

> In foreign worker dormitories, numbers are rising sharply, he noted. But in the wider community, numbers are more stable.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Sungei Tengah Lodge is 4th foreign worker dorm gazetted as isolation area

> ""This is a major and urgent issue that requires active intervention,"" he said. ""That is why we decided to put in more resources and set up a dedicated task force focusing on dorms.""

> On Tuesday, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) had announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory operators.

> The task force will ensure the well-being of workers and improve their living conditions by supporting dormitory operators as they implement ""circuit-breaker"" measures.

> MOM is supported by the Ministry of Health, National Environment Agency, the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, Migrant Workers' Centre and other agencies.

> Explaining the Government's decision to set up a task force, Mr Wong said: ""We cannot rely solely on dorm operators any more, given the current situation.""

> Manpower Minister Josephine Teo noted that there has been no cluster in dormitories until recently, even though a number of foreign workers have tested positive for the virus.

> ""Bear in mind that dorms are home to foreign workers,"" she added. ""Within dorms workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely, they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there.""

> Workers will now not be able to prepare their own meals, to reduce human contact, and cleanliness and hygiene have been stepped up. Existing sick bays will also be scaled up to take care of workers that need to be isolated.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that despite circuit breaker measures kicking in on Tuesday, social gatherings are still taking place. More than 10,000 written advisories have been issued over the past two days to those who did not observe safe distancing.

> ""This cannot continue,"" he said.

> Mr Wong added that enforcement efforts will be stepped up against those who continue to flout safe-distancing measures.

> ""We hope Singaporeans will comply not just because of enforcement efforts but really out of a necessity for all of us to do our part,"" he said.

Isn't this a convoluted reasoning? You are looking at it specifically from a time frame whereby it augments your statement.

ie There is community spread. The community spread has ALREADY reach the dormitory. Therefore an earlier lockdown, regardless, will still spread among the dormitory resulting in huge case numbers because of the conditions. Basically the only way for your statement to be true, you need a first spark to start the fire.

However, when ppl are talking about earlier lockdown, ppl meant it as a whole, to even prevent community spread(dormitory being an ideal hotspot does not equate to the virus will travel there by themselves) . Unless you are suggesting that an earlier lockdown WILL still result in spread because erm... magic? Because Taiwan definitely manage to prevent community spread by acting earlier.

You state that it's hard to maintain and order when trying to implement measures on FW and that it is the more practical way to enforce measures but again, that doesn't mean it's right to do so. I'd even argue that you are making many assumptions about FW and are underestimating their capicity to understand. Fuck off with practicality la, again, they are NOT CATTLE. 

And how is your last paragraph about Singapore being 'the best place to be' in any way related to how they are being treated? Unrelated comment that seems to be justifying the callous treatment they are receiving. 

Look, in the end of the day, NSF and FW are from totally different socio-economic situations. NSF can go back home to their mummy/daddy/maid/girlfriend/boyfriend easily, FW don't have that luxury and have to juggle the pressure of sending back enough money back home to their families. Do try to have some empathy for them.

I mean it doesn't really sound a lot like Omelas to me, sounds like they're actually trying hard to make it better.

Second point about hierarchy. I maintain that the Singpore government's first priority rightfully is, and always should be, Singaporean nationals. Does this mean that we should simply neglect everyone else and leave them to die in crowded conditions? Of course not! But consider if we quarantined all 20,000 workers identically to how we have been quarantining our own citizens. Our systems would be completely overwhelmed in no time. It would leave no margin whatsoever for future infections, many of whom would be nationals. If we had the space and the resources then of course they should give workers the same conditions, but sadly this isn't the case. I just want to put across the point that when we have such limited resources, no matter what couse of action you take there is always going to be someone who loses out.

Okay, as for the bit where you said this isn't just for the government, it's for everyone, I agree with you almost completely. However, it is incredibly difficult to see any kind of change coming about in the immediate future. And frankly, you should be the change that you want to see. If you're really passionate about this, then you should volunteer to cook/clean for the workers. You might say, ""oh I'm busy, I still have to work from home, etc etc"", all of which is perfectly understandable. Then maybe you should consider that this is the same situatiom which other Singaporeans are in. Now again, I'm not saying, ""you must be a volunteer, then only you can talk about how people should be more sympathetic"", I'm just saying that if everyone expressed concern online but never enacted any real change, people would be a lot more caring for our workers but the actual workers' situations would not improve.",t3_fxrghv,2020-04-10 10:39:08,lukeangmingshen,3

515,g1zbmxh,t3_ic1fuh,"> # 7,000 migrant workers quarantined after some 100 new COVID-19 cases detected in cleared dorms

> SINGAPORE — About 100 COVID-19 cases have been detected in foreign worker dormitories that were given the all-clear, resulting in some 7,000 workers being quarantined, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday (18 August).

> These cases – some of whom have resumed work – were detected through routine testing conducted bi-weekly for workers living in dorms as well as those who work in construction/production sites and the construction, marine, and process sectors, said the ministries in the joint statement.

> Over 100,000 workers have started on their biweekly routine tests to date, while seven in 10 employers have logged on and used an online swab registration system set up to schedule such tests.

> “We have taken timely actions to contain and isolate the COVID-19 positive cases. We have also taken aggressive actions to contain, trace, and isolate the close contacts. To date, over 60 per cent of cases have been closed,” the statement added.

> Out of some 7,000 workers quarantined from the new infection cases, less than two per cent were reported to be infected with COVID-19, said both ministries.

> The quarantined cases are “being managed according to strict protocols and reinforced with more centralised quarantine facilities made available through the completion of dormitory clearance”, they added.

> The new infected cases in cleared dorms and decant sites are a reminder of the need for vigilance, said the ministries.

> “As we gather more real-life data, we will be better able to assess the impact of safe distancing measures (SDM) and segregation measures. This will help us assess patterns in the spread of infections, and review the extent of quarantine required to contain a detected case,” they added. 

> Authorities here have completed the testing of all workers in the dorms, with around 18,600 of them currently serving out their quarantine period, including 800 who were announced by the MOH last Wednesday to be newly quarantined after the discovery of a COVID-19 case among them in a cleared purpose-built dorm block.

> Both ministries said that authorities are taking “a measured approach” to tackle such situations. It includes conveying immediate close contacts of the infected worker to serve a 14-day quarantine at a dedicated quarantine facility and testing the remaining residents.

> “We have quarantined the whole block in the first instance while the assessment is being made as a precautionary measure. We will rescind the quarantine subsequently for workers who are assessed to be not at risk,” the ministries said.

> “While this approach could affect up to a few hundred migrant workers for each case, it ensures that we contain the detected case and minimise spreading that could end up affecting thousands others,” they added.

> Other measures taken to prevent a second wave of infections in the cleared dorms include segregating workers staying in the dorms by the type of industry that they work in. Sector agencies will also work closely with the employers to assess the risk at the workplaces and put in place safety timeouts if necessary, with aggressive testing operations conducted.

> The MOH confirmed another 100 COVID-19 cases in Singapore on Tuesday, taking the country’s total to 55,938. Of the tally, some 95 per cent are foreign workers living in dorms.

543,ftrqanr,t3_h7dfw8,"> # Measures to tackle COVID-19 cases in dorms early on were 'insufficient': Teo Chee Hean

> SINGAPORE — Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore’s migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures “turned out to be insufficient”, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

> During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.

> In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date. Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.

> “On 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,” said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.

> “However, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.”

> While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, “no two crises are the same”, Teo said. The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is “a major challenge”, he added.

> On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.

> “But they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines”, he noted.

> The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH’s overall medical support plan.

> Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.

> “The operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak. About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,” he added.

> Teo’s delivery is the third in a series of national speeches by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday. Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing is scheduled next to deliver his speech on Sunday.

> In his speech on “Resilience in a changing external environment”, Teo also spoke at length about Singapore’s efforts in providing community care facilities for patients who have mild or no symptoms.

> “We had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and had started to build them. We accelerated these plans and scaled them up, adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April,” he said.

> At the peak on 12 May, some 20,000 patients were being cared for at community care and similar facilities, with as many as 1,000 are admitted daily, Teo said.

> “This is more than the total number of beds in all our public acute hospitals. We mobilised resources from across our public service, government-linked companies, and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities. Healthcare volunteers stepped forward to help man them,” he stressed.

> “This is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our healthcare system and putting lives at risk.”

> The clear lesson learned during the COVID-19 outbreak is that Singapore needs to plan in peace-time “on facing the unknown, and build deep reserves of people and capabilities, so that when we face a crisis, we can act decisively, and respond flexibly and rapidly”.

> He referred to past challenges in Singapore’s history such as in 1967 when the British announced the withdrawal of their troops from the city-state. With the move, Singapore was poised to lose 20 per cent of its gross domestic product and 70,000 jobs at a time when the population was half of what it is today, Teo said.

> “We are far more resilient today than in 1967, and better positioned to create new markets, businesses, and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.”

> Singapore also rode out the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Asian and global financial crises. “COVID-19 is an even bigger test,” he added.

> The outbreak is the first major crisis for many of the new generation of ministers and civil servants taking the lead in efforts to tackle the situation.

> The ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of their older Cabinet colleagues as well as consulted widely within and outside the government, Teo said.

> He added, “Over the past few months, I have worked very closely with them. We speak daily and exchange views freely. They have stepped up to the task, worked together as a team, and led from the front. This is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore.”

Another unlikeable personality, IMO, is Ho Ching. It’s made even worse by the seeming lack of restraint she has over her words on social media - the lack of class and empathy from someone of such a high standing is, frankly, quite embarrassing.

As for what Minister Jo Teo's did / said, I think the lapses under her ministry, while not directly responsible for Covid-19, did contribute to the rapid spread of the disease amongst our migrant worker population. Had she been more amiable, less arrogant, I think more people would have given her a pass (She seems to be trying for Minister Shanmugam's style, without having his charisma). Covid-19 has really wrecked havoc all over the world. Again, all of the above are my opinions. 

With regards to Ho Ching, I wholeheartedly agree with you. It's embarrassing to see the wife of our PM act in such a childish and classless manner. So far in this crisis, I see PM Lee only when he's giving speeches, but he has been reassuring, and his messages in different languages tailored to the audience. His speeches have been lauded, on reddit, on my facebook feed from my foreign friends, as well as on the news. So, to see Mdm Ho Ching act in such an infantile manner is really disappointing.

676,fp64svo,t3_gbdjuv,"Some thoughts - given the high level numbers and the disparity between cases in the various categories (dorms only, Singaporeans/PRs, work pass holders, work permit holders etc), I barely pay too much attention anymore to the preliminary high level number that comes out at \~3pm everyday. We have to wait for the detailed updates at night to get a better sense of how the situation is progressing.

In particular, I'm paying close attention to community cases and work permit holders not living in dorms (I'm conservatively assuming these people are still part of the community, but most should be serving 14 day SHNs). I reckon we need to see both community cases only (Singaporeans/PRs + work pass holders) AND community cases + work permit holders not in dorms stay low for at least 2 weeks before we start getting our hopes up. Dorm cases pretty straight forward there - given the tight living conditions and aggressive testing, i reckon we see high numbers for a while more before we start seeing the results of the distancing measures that were implemented about 2 weeks back for the dorms.  


Also - keeping brief track of unlinked cases is also somewhat important. In particular, both the absolute number of unlinked cases on a particular day AND following up the next day or couple to see if those unlinked cases have been linked (they do tend to take a while to link some cases because contact tracing etc is a VERY tough job). This is important because if they can link a specific case to an existing cluster and/or infected person, there is a lower possibility of there being existing further community spread that the authorities don't yet know about. Ideally would like to see those unlinked numbers stay low AND have the authorities constantly being able to link cases on a daily basis (which they have).

If you need any hard evidence and/or anecdotes that social distancing works, just look at the trend of community cases and work permit holders not in dorms over the past 2 weeks. So please. PLEASE STAY AT HOME AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.",t3_gbdjuv,2020-05-01 23:14:37,eddalton,1

when got good news can talk cock about how this is due to good governance by pap. ask ppl to look at countries with bad govt like malaysia or leaders like trump. say its good sg got no free media or multi party goverment to distract pap.   

but if got bad news its somehow its the collective responsibility of all singaporeans. like millions of ppl petitioned manpower ministry to ignore their cramped overcrowded conditions for decades. or if got referendum where ppl voted that josephine teo should listen to dorm/biz owners and just leave rules up to dorm owners. who told govt to dismiss ngo's concerns for dorm conditions for years. 

some human decency should say that give these ppl a decent accommodations. at least army standard bunks with space and furnishing. 

some foresight would show that fw living in cramped conditions and deterred for years to report sick would have been prime target for virus cluster

some humbleness would have allowed you to listen to ngo's who as recent as last month wrote letter to 154 about the dorm conditions. or not treat dissenting views as enemies

> SINGAPORE - Cruise ships are being assessed for their feasibility as temporary housing for foreign workers who are recovered from Covid-19 and tested negative for the virus.

> SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius, mid-sized cruise ships operated by Genting Cruise Lines, will be checked for consideration by the Government for factors such as ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures.

> If deemed feasible, the two cruise ships may be used to complement other interim facilities such as Singapore Armed Forces military camps and vacant Housing Board blocks that have been refurbished to house healthy workers.

> By reducing numbers of workers in existing dormitories, health measures can be implemented more effectively, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in a media statement on Friday (April 17) morning.

> Cruise ships are being considered for use as temporary housing as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact, added STB.

> SuperStar Gemini, which arrived from Hong Kong on Friday, is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SuperStar Aquarius may be activated for assessment at a later date.

> If deemed suitable, the two ships may accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers in total.

> STB said that ""if activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times"".

> Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

> Related Story Coronavirus: 3 more foreign worker dormitories declared isolation areas

> Related Story Coronavirus: Floating facilities ready to house healthy foreign workers

> While the spread of the coronavirus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially.

> As of Friday morning, the total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689, which is about 60 per cent of all Singapore's cases.

> There are now a total of 12 dormitories declared as isolation areas where workers at these lodgings must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.

746,fnr6fvj,t3_g2v9h8,"Came here to say, this will not help and it’s such a terrible decision.  
  
I know our Frontlines in charge of Covid containment is overwhelmed with work but this has to be said:  

**Edit: ignore the first 3 points. Cruise for recovered FW.**  
1.They will do swap test first on those being relocated to these cruise- **but tests are known to have turn out negative initially** so they can still be infected.
   
2.These FW aren’t fully quarantined, **they are still going to work**.  
(Another concern, are we asking FW to continue wearing mask throughout work? again, if not then it’ll obviously be more likely to spread Covid. Perhaps their work already requires them to wear a mask idk.. I’ll just point this out so anyone in the know can work it out so no FW faints doing  labour work because of a suffocating mask whole day.)
   
3. Bad publicity worldwide. Once an outbreak occurs on this cruise(unless it’s contained very well, which is just betting ur luck.)
   
4. We should be applying lockdown for all FW living in crowded/shared dorm for at least 14days to make sure our healthcare doesn’t get strained more.
   
5. Imo, It makes no sense to let our FW continue work during this CB and Dormitory spike. We should solve the crowded dorm issues first, since we currently have community spread going on we shouldn’t react as if FW bringing Covid back to temporary dorm or causing further spread in community isn’t likely. 
   
My suggestion: I don’t know the capacity our country can do to house as many of them separately. But if surveillance is an issue, we can make mid shift shelters and get general public to help monitor via camera(we report to authorities if anyone try to sneak out) hopefully this will help slow the spread and we can get some breather for our frontlines.  
(For the sake of everyone, We will have to endure and work together if rubbish and cleaning or other essentials done by FW is disrupted.)
   
Before *you* start flaming aimlessly. Lockdown and surveillance means, **temporary** build a fenced shelter/tents for few weeks so the dormitory issues doesn’t turn tragic(we will only monitor the fences to make sure no one flout).

Edit: just realised it was for recovered FW, heard on TV and saw the comments hence I didn’t check the article first sorry. But some of my points can be considered.

This is confusing though: 
>The STB said: ""If activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times.""

>Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

779,fnbzr8x,t3_g0mek9,"I truly believe this is a cumulation of public infrastructure bidding practices, demand for lower cost projects by all parties, high land cost, and lack of innovation in the construction industry both in Singapore and as a whole.

The government is the biggest developer in singapore due to infrastructural contracts. They also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure. Some news reports here: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116)

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins. [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/govt-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/govt-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders)

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

FWIW, I've commented on this a few times:

780,fnaf46i,t3_g0mek9,"Nice opinion, but this is literally a slap on the wrist. For companies, these construction workers are expendable. They get injured in the workplace, they get shipped back to their home countries after patching them up. You think a fine + bills is a ""wake up call"". Nah, it's just a ""one-off expense"", ""we got caught fine"", basically a gamble for them. The calculations for them is such that they can mistreat them and still be in the green (cos you know, these events don't happen every year).

They will just gladly pay up and mistreat them again. And you know what? They won't follow, they will try to bend the rules further (like people who flout SHN/CB rules) and that will result in worse conditions for the workers. For instance, if a worker gets XYZ communicable disease (assuming it isn't hard to test like COVID-19), instead of reporting, they will just quickly ship that worker back to this hometown on the grounds of ""slacking off at work"". There, we mitigated the spread, absolutely nothing happened in our dorms! Bring in the next healthy batch of workers.

What we need isn't punitive punishment only (not saying that they shouldn't foot the bill). What we need is regulations and oversight. Which is why I feel, just like our HDBs, housing for them should be government run. That way, the government has control over it and we have indirect control over how the government treats them (e.g. making it a voter issue for pete's sake).",t3_g0mek9,2020-04-14 00:46:43,skatyboy,52

About taxpayers' money being spent to treat the foreign workers, I think it's still going to be much lesser than the subsequent social and economic costs if the government did NOT intervene.

The last few weeks have shown that, no amount of appeals to common good is working... people just don't give a shit. Those who've run the dorms have been doing this years, and there's very little chance of them changing their ways, and if at all they do, there's a question of whether they'll do it fast enough.

In a pandemic crisis where time is critical, government intervention is the only way, imho

Minister of State & Manpower stated 
> Mr Zaqy said conditions at the dormitory were found to be satisfactory when the last inspection was done on March 4.

So if ""shitty conditions"" can pass MOM inspection standards.

Question to be asked:

* Are amenities adequate for the workers to use?
* Is the inspection criteria stringent to ensure liveability? (Electrical, plumbing etc) Or the inspection was done half fuck?
* Problem of deplorable living conditions have already been around from initial -> current ""satisfactory"" conditions. Are the laws/ standards created to hit the bare minimum of the workers ""rights""? Social workers working with them have already mentioned these issues over many years.

[Source](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-conditions-at-punggol-dormitory-could-have-been-better-maintained-as-it-was-made)

Even if the workers fuck shit up in the dorms, isn't inspection meant to uncover these teething problems and reflect it to ministry & dormitory providers?

I see all these moves by the governing agency to move them out as a way to 

* Solve current ""satisfactory but deplorable"" conditions on paper
* Solve the now exploding increase of infection rate
* Sweep their crap way of handling treating of FW from the past till current under the rug (inspection criteria) 
* Acknowledge but don't apologize for past failings wrt. handling of the foreign workers situation

Ultimately, we as a society need to pay the price for the situation mentioned above. Prices of HDB have remained pretty cheap while cost of workers have increased over time. We as a society have also chosen to push them away from general population areas in fear of losing property value etc.

I've not seen a deluge of posts on here complaining about the fact these guys are herded around Singapore in the back of pickup trucks like cattle being moved to the market. No one was complaining when their shit got cleaned or their HDB got built in record time. 

This is a fundamental issue of governance - these companies operated within the law (largely, I'm sure there are some that do not), therefore the problem does not lie with them, it lies with the executive branch that sets the law and the population that elects them and/or does not demand changes to this law.

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be. 

There are restrictions on how many beds you can put in a certain area, how many toilets per number of ppl, fire safety requirements, a sickbay separate from living qtrs must be planned, WiFi is compulsory, even entertainment is a must. These are all set out by big G not the dorm owners. Why will any dorm owner go beyond the basic requirement to make a loss? 

Most people will not believe it but the obscene environment is actually caused by the workers themselves. The best example is hanging clothes. By law, the dorm owner must specifically have an area just for hanging clothes because hanging clothes in your sleeping qtrs is asking for disease to spread but the workers would rather hang them in their own rooms for convenience. 

Many do not practice basic hygiene. My own employees said it was a living hell with bedbug infestations so we moved them out.

There's a limit to how much we can interfere with free market and more importantly, how nice should we treat the employees? Should the cost rise to 2-3k per employee? Our hdb and condo will be 3-4x more and nobody will be able to afford it. In other countries, bricklayers can be paid 5k a month. Will Singaporeans do it for 5k a month?

Collectively I still feel such situations could have been overall avoided if not for the fact that singaporeans have become an entitled nation. The hard truth is that no one would do their work for the meagre salary. Theres also the hard labour that is not enticing under the hot sun or stifled conditions within construction. We should have been learning from examples like Australia, where they pay their labour workers well and a huge bulk of the hard labour jobs consists of their own people. This also creates a sense of pride within our community.

Going back to the main point, if we as a nation has been in such a situation where we dont rely on foreign workforce, the housing situation might not have happened and any form of exploitation would have been greatly reduced which in turns lead up to the fact that when a pandemic occurs, which is does throughout history, such a scenario we see unfolding would not have occurred.

DOs usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels. What are the demands? How do we balance between quality and cost. I believe that you wouldn't expect DOs to operate at a loss unless they're doing charity and expected to make some profit.

Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others. Do you think that I will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other, lousier dormitories are charging?

Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price? Would DOs that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive? Those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general.

Then you might say that, why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better. Then again who is paying for it? If it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories, how do we get people to do it? If the cost increases, are the workers suppose to pay for the increase? Or are the employers expected to absorb the fee? Or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers. And we have another recurring problem.

Then how are we going to ensure that cost of housing and maintenance does not increase if the cost is passed on the employers? How are we going to help those whos affected by this change?

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

They aren't living in inhuman conditions. I doubt they will be fined except for if safe distancing law applies to the dorm supervisors. The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well. HUGE FINES like people are hoping for probably won't happen.

If it all adds up it might be substantial, but nothing big enough to invoke waves of change. Stricter supervision will become a thing, but I doubt they will suddenly be living in better homes. While living conditions were not stellar, they were livable. There were no major issues prior to Covid. So the majority of this outrage is stemming from *distancing issues.*

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

If anyone of you can solve these issues, and compile the math and financial budget required for any minister to undertake this task, be my guest. I'd love to see these workers living in good condition too.

IF our SAF soldiers and NSFs can stay in such ""inhuman"" bunks, why can't our foreign workers? The complaint, rather should be - maybe we should be making the dorm operators enforce some level of discipline. Maybe more ""stand by area"" and ""area cleaning"". Or hire more cleaners.

Living in a dormitory cluster is not inhumane. We are not throwing them into the slums where people have to literally live surrounded by their own waste with no readily available source of water or sanitary toilets. 

Just what kind of living conditions do you believe FW dorms to be?

They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers.

If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore. If you are saying people are dying because of the living condition, bring up evidence, because as far as I can tell, nothing has even come close to being negligent enough to cause death. 

Most if not all foreign worker death comes from workplace accidents.

Clearly that's not an accurate way to measure living conditions.

They live in humane conditions. Living in a bunk setting is far from inhumane. Amenities are provided to ensure they are living in humane condition.

How many skilled workers are needed to operate the vehicle, what is the lump-sum cost of investment and what is the upkeep cost? How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce? How much training is necessary and how long will it take to implement?

""Just upgrade lah"" is something you hear too often from ignorant bosses and ignorant masses. It provides absolutely zero solution, and zero steps towards the solution. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.

No. You set the floor, and let the companies do the work. That's the point of capitalism.

You are underestimating the shithole the market is.

You just tell them to have the market find alternative for you. Meanwhile the market is doing everything in their power to fund the notion that coal is a necessary evil through fudged bias studies, and that coal isn't that bad.

> The MOH had said on Monday that it picked up many more cases in dormitories because of extensive testing. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in community isolation facilities or the general wards of hospitals.

> The ministry added that the number of new cases in the community has decreased to an average of 20 per day in the past week from an average of 29 cases per day two weeks ago, while the number of unlinked cases in the community has also fallen to an average of 13 per day in the past week from an average of 19 cases per day two weeks ago.

994,fotosb1,t1_fotnzhu,"From my understanding they're not decreasing it, merely shifting the focus to other dorms since statistically by now if the workers in the highly affected dorms start presenting with symptoms it is safe to assume that they are infected.

995,fotpn2t,t1_fotnzhu,"The trends have been wildly misleading in the first place. When you have say, 3000 to 8000+  test kits avalible for testing per day, you cannot possibly test our 330k foreign workers all at once. These tests have to be rationed for our own PHPC/Hospital base load, testing in isolation facilities and active case finding.

If you encounter a sympomatic person in lets say, S11 dormitory. I think at this point you can just assume that he is infected without a test and that is pretty much what they have decided to do. Much better to utilize this test for someone in another dormitory/essential services to see if they are infected.  

  

TLDR basically testing more in other dorms, but testing less at heavily infected ones",t3_g9ij4z,2020-04-28 16:14:20,Eskipony,13
996,fotoc57,t1_fotn61a,"These 2 things are not mutually exclusive. Singapore can be increasing testing on foreign workers as a whole (what Gan Kim Yong said), and also not testing symptomatic foreign workers in dormitories with high number of infected cases. 

If they have found that specific dormitories have such a high rate of infected that there is a very high chance that anybody who is symptomatic has the disease, it makes sense to not spend the resource to test this patient and just treat them as if they had the disease. So instead of using 1 test on this patient (net testing =1), they now use 0 test on him, and 2 tests on asymptomatic foreign workers in this dorm or other dorms (net testing = 2). So both reports would be right.
