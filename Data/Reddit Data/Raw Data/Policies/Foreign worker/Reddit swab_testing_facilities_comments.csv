At the same time I wonder how many of these tests were done on the general community vs the dorms and essential workers? I think this is the figure that better indicates if community spread is prevalent. 

520k people tested is a lot, but if I recall correctly we have more than 300k foreign workers living in dormitories and an unknown number outside. This demography probably made up a huge chunk of the 520k, what is leftover that is done for essential workers and the general community might not be a lot.",t3_hs0257,2020-07-16 10:15:21,gamerx88,53

In this case, it seems to be lack of testing. And the government doesn't help, with arbitrary divides for community spread and proactive testing and all that jazz. 

Tests are prioritized based on risk - for individual and the society as a whole. Can we not trust one of the best medical systems in the world to do that well?

Similar issues were raised in parliament when it came to jobs - I think Pritam asked how many went to Singaporeans and how many went to PRs when given a combined number. Maybe next he could ask how many went to PRs who did NS and those who didn't. For a society this small and this diverse, we could do with less division.",t3_hs0257,2020-07-16 10:52:35,Speedz007,49

At times, this means scrutinising on a deeper level. However, I believe Pritam's question was legitimate because the availablity of PMET jobs for locals has been a point of contention in politics for nearly two decades. Retrenchments and job struggles which started as early as end of last year further magnified this problem. Personally, I think if you're an MP that has to constantly help citizens with job issues at Meet The People sessions but the government says 'Eh, more people employed what', you'd want to take a closer look at the numbers too.

31,fy7w368,t1_fy7qnmh,"Not sure I understand you, but let me clarify. I don't disagree with how our government is prioritizing our limited testing capacity. But I do have doubts if our testing is representative and that has implications for our strategy moving forward. e.g Can we safely move to phase 3 and when? 

I don't know how Pritam got dragged into this and I don't wanna politicize this issue. It is uncalled for. However, since you brought it up, I might as well clarify with my take as well. 

I don't see Pritam's question as ""divisive"", that is something that people projected onto it. There is nothing wrong with PRs landing good jobs in SG, especially if they bring along skills that our economy requires, but that is not what the debate was about. The request for a breakdown was relevant in that context since the debate was about the impact on Singaporean employment prospects. How else do we track if policies aimed at helping Singaporeans remain relevant in the jobs market are working?

Your point on Pritam’s question though, I take issue with. It’s only natural to want to know how the government’s policies are affecting Singaporeans - the people who actually call this island home by virtue of having no other home.

Prior to the dorm cases from Jan to March, suspected people were made to take 5 days MC and doctor jump before being tested. Despite the population pushing for test numbers, the testing numbers were hidden from the people when other countries were disclosing test numbers in Feb and March. It’s only after pressing from the people when the Govt disclose the test numbers 3 months later from the outbreak as a cumulative number. After the dorm case hit the fan, then we ramp up testing and only then they disclose the numbers.
