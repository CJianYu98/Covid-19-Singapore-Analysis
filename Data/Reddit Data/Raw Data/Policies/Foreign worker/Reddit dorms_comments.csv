Is it just me, or does cramming 20k workers in 2 dorms for entire days sound different from the usual situation?

It's like the situation of the circuit breaker, family tensions will surely rise among the economic devastation caused by businesses closing and bad family ties. 

So many bad policies these few weeks. 

The fact that Lawrence can say it's ""unpredictable"" shows how short-sighted and deaf the COVID-19 task force is. If such a simple thing echoed by so many overseas organisations like Amnesty International is ""unpredictable"", then I think they need to stop shutting their eyes and ears and start facing reality.

28,fmwae5i,t1_fmw6x41,"While your suggestions are nice... It has a rollover effect in other sectors that affects us more immediately - for example, are you ready to pay 50% more for your BTOs at a longer waiting period due to fair wages and humane working hours? Even at its ""exploitative"" stage now, we are already complaining it's too expensive and takes too long. Realistically speaking, do we even have Singaporeans who would want to take up these occupations considering the high risk, nature of work environment and skills required? We can't even get enough young hawkers to join, and now you want them to weld, screed, plaster, clear debris, scale scaffolds in an even more unbearable condition than hawker centres?  
  
A closer case study would be Australia, which has one of the highest construction costs in the world. On the other hand, their workers are mostly locals, very highly skilled, takes pride in work, and are extremely fairly paid.  
  
So I think the solution can't be something so simplistic. Foreign labour is inherently a neutral term. The exploitative nature can be eliminated if we make sure builders AND developers play a larger role in fair employment. Right now, it's just builders being held responsible and given demerit points for work safety issues - nothing about their housing condition, work environment, fair and prompt wages, fair and prompt medical attention. Moreover, developers are so insulated from all these that when a new project goes out for tender, demerit points of a builder is almost never a point of consideration.  
  
TL;DR: I'm not saying it's great now (in fact, I'm agreeing it's bad). But the solution can't be as simplistic as saying we must replace all foreign labour. There is economic benefit for both parties. The exploitative nature can be eliminated if more parties are held responsible for their workers' lives.",t3_fxsj8z,2020-04-09 22:34:17,kanteater,55

Ifpology


Attorney and business ethics expert Lauren Bloom, author of The Art of the Apology, mentions the ""if apology"" as a favorite of politicians, with lines such as ""I apologize if I offended anyone"". Comedian Harry Shearer has coined the term Ifpology for its frequent appearances on ""The Apologies of the Week"" segment of Le Show.[12]

One of the first references was in The New York Times by Richard Mooney in his 1992 editorial notebook ""If This Sounds Slippery ... How to Apologize and Admit Nothing"". This was mainly in regard to Senator Bob Packwood: ""Only in the event that someone should choose to take offense, why then he's sorry"". Mooney goes on to cite Bill Clinton, who said of Mario Cuomo: ""If the remarks on the tape left anyone with the impression that I was disrespectful to either Governor Cuomo or Italian-Americans, then I deeply regret it."" A famous example involved racially insensitive remarks made by golfer Fuzzy Zoeller about Tiger Woods; Zoeller's comments and his half-hearted ifpology were news for days and resulted in his being dropped from a commercial tie-in with K-Mart.[13] According to John Kador in Effective Apology, ""Adding the word if or any other conditional modifier to an apology makes it a non-apology.""[14]

A 2014 ifpology was made by CNN's Don Lemon, who said, ""If my question to [Joan Tarshis] struck anyone as offensive, I am sorry, as that certainly was not my intention."" This was about a question during his interview with Joan Tarshis where he suggested biting a penis as a way to avoid being orally sexually assaulted.[15]

On September 16, 2015, Matt Damon made what Salon termed a ""non-apology"" apology when he said, ""I am sorry that [my comments] offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood.""[16] This was in reference to the backlash against Damon after he made comments about diversity to African American film producer Effie Brown on the September 13, 2015 debut of the HBO show Project Greenlight that were criticized as condescending.[17]",t3_fxsj8z,2020-04-10 21:42:58,blackreplica,-1

65,fqdf2wh,t3_giapc3,"> # Covid-19 taskforce to test all 300,000 plus migrant workers in dormitories: Lawrence Wong

> The Covid-19 multi-ministry taskforce is planning to test all 300,000 plus migrant workers in dormitories, the Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong stated at a press conference on May 12.

> More than 3,000 migrant workers are tested daily

> With regard to the current rate of testing, more than 3,000 workers in the dormitories are tested daily, with a total of over 32,000 migrant workers tested thus far, according to a press release by the Ministry of Health (MOH).

> The press release highlighted that many of these workers showed no symptoms when they were tested, and that MOH plans to increase the rate of testing over time.

> Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that ""progress"" was being made:

> ""For the situation in the migrant worker dormitories, we are making progress in clearing, testing the workers. We are committed to testing all the workers to make sure that they are free from infection.""

> 20,000 workers to be ready for discharge by the end of May

> He added that the rationale for doing so was to ""ensure that we are thorough and systematic cleaning up, and clearing the dorms, and verifying the status of all the workers before they resume work.""

> Wong said that about 20,000 migrant workers will be ready for discharge by the end of May, given that many of them were recovering well.

> ""It's also very encouraging to see that many workers are recovering well, they’re well on the road to recovery and many are ready for discharge. So by the end of this month we will have 20,000 who are ready for discharge, and then likewise in June we expect to see many more recovering and well on their way to being discharged and being able to resume work as well.""

> How will testing be carried out?

> As for the manner in which testing will be carried out, Wong stated that this will be done through mass polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, as well as mass serological tests.

> With regard to PCR tests, MOH stated that this is the test which has been relied on thus far to diagnose if someone is infected with Covid-19 in Singapore, and is the globally accepted testing standard.

> As for serological tests, these are used to detect antibodies to Covid-19 from a blood sample, as a marker of past infection.

> MOH further added that people who have been infected by Covid-19 for more than 10 to 14 days ago will have a positive serology test.

> As such, serological testing will be applied to dormitories with a higher rate of infection.

> Every migrant worker will be subjected to at least one of the tests

> Should a migrant worker have a positive serological test, this will mean that he has been infected at least 10 to 14 days ago.

> It will also mean that he will no longer be infectious after a period of isolation.

> Meanwhile, migrant workers in dormitories with a lower rate of infection will be subjected to a PCR test.

> Workers who have a negative result from either of these two tests, however, will be isolated for 14 days before being subjected to another PCR test, to confirm that they test negative for Covid-19.

> The 14-day isolation is necessary as a test before the 14th day will not be able to exclude the possibility of the disease developing at a later point.

> Number of cases remain high, asymptomatic cases are also being tested

> With regard to the high number of cases reported, Wong stated that this was due to the high number of tests being carried out.

> However, the high numbers were not indicative of the rate of new infections in dormitories, as the number reporting acute respiratory symptoms had fallen.

> Wong said:

> ""If you look at the actual numbers of people who report sick with acute respiratory illness, that number has been coming down by the day, compared to the peak of the outbreak. But every day, in terms of the reported cases, you will still see high numbers. That's because we are continuing to test many workers, including the ones who are asymptomatic and well, because this is part of our process to clear the dormitories systematically.""

> Four of the new cases are imported and the remaining cases are locally transmitted.

> Advertisement

> A ""significant number"" of the new cases are linked to existing clusters involving two workers' dormitories, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan, said the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force in a press conference.

> S11 Dormitory @ Punggol has 22 new cases and Westlite Toh Guan has 10 new cases.

> 2 DORMS GAZETTED AS ISOLATION AREAS

> Given these figures, the Ministry of Health has gazetted the two dormitories as isolation areas.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> A total of 19,800 workers across the two dormitories have been placed under quarantine and will have to stay in their rooms for the next 14 days.

> Meals will be provided for the workers, as well as healthcare supplies including masks, thermometers and hand sanitiser, said the task force.

> Further safe distancing measures will also be implemented at all other worker dormitories, including staggering of meal times and minimising the inter-mingling of workers.

> However it should be made clear that foreign workers do not inherently have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.

> Under the enhanced measures which will kick in next week, schools and workplaces – except those running essential services – will be closed for nearly a month until May 4. Food establishments will stay open only for takeaways or delivery.

> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Sunday a third round of support measures will be rolled out to help businesses and households tide through these unprecedented “circuit breaker” measures.

> About a quarter of patients aged 13 and above diagnosed with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) from July 1 to Aug 16 declined a Covid-19 swab test, with some citing fear of discomfort.

> Since July 1, it has been a policy for all patients aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with ARI to be offered the swab test for the virus when they first see a doctor, as part of efforts to support more active case-finding in the community.

> Responding to queries from The Straits Times, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that patients who decline the swab test are given a five-day medical certificate, during which they are legally required to stay at home.

> If a doctor assesses that a patient meets the suspect case definition of Covid-19, or has prolonged ARI at the end of the five-day period, the patient is legally required to go for a swab test.

...

> The ministry said it urges everyone to be socially responsible, and that those who are unwell - particularly those with mild symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose and loss of smell - should see a doctor promptly, and go for a swab test when their doctor tells them to do so.

Yes probably slightly less accurate but if it leads to greater uptake, maybe still worth it on aggregate. Can confirm with nose swab if inconclusive/positive.

> 3 Min Read.SINGAPORE - Nearly half of Singapore&#039;s migrant workers residing in dormitories have had COVID-19, according to the government, indicating the virus spread much more widely among those living in these accommodations than the official case tally shows.

> Authorities are still completing serology tests for about 65,000 workers living in dormitories who have not taken them before.

> While most countries only do serology testing on a sampling basis to estimate the prevalence of infections in a population, Singapore is conducting them on all the migrant workers living in the dormitories.

Second question, hard to answer as we don’t know how often the workers are tested while in community care facilities, whether asymptomatics are segregated from symptomatics, whether they are housed separately from negative workers for some time after discharge. I only know that those discharged on the basis of 21 days have to rest at “home” (dorm) for another week before working.

I would like to think that after the guy tests positive and is moved to e.g. Expo, seeing that he is completely asymptomatic, they would re-test him after a few days and find him negative. Then knowing that there’s a possibility of false positive, they might check him for antibodies and find that he has none i.e. he probably didn’t just recover and is likely false positive.

> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Thursday said in Parliament that with the scale of the COVID-19 crisis, the Government may not be able to save every business and job, but it will continue to support every worker.

> As some jobs “may never return”, Mr Heng urged mid-career professionals to consider changing industry and taking pay cuts to put themselves “in a better footing” after the crisis.

> He also called on companies to be “receptive” to hiring mid-career workers, who come with their “wealth of experience”.

> The COVID-19 pandemic has dragged Singapore’s economy into its most severe downturn since independence, as the Ministry of Manpower recorded 11,350 retrenchments in the first half of the year.

> According to the ministry, this is higher than the 10,120 recorded during the SARS period, but still lower than other recessionary peaks.

> On Thursday, the Transport Ministry also announced that Singapore and Hong Kong have reached an in-principle agreement to establish a bilateral air travel bubble.

> This means that those travelling under the bubble will have no restrictions on their travel purpose and will not need to have a controlled itinerary. Travellers will also not be subject to quarantine or stay-home notice requirements.​​​​​​​

> However, travellers will need to test negative on mutually recognised COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. They will also be required to go on flights dedicated for those travelling under the bubble.

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily reported 399 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Tuesday (21 July) noon, taking the total to 48,434.

> Of the new cases, nine – including one Singapore resident – are classified as cases in the community, while three are imported cases who had been placed on stay home notice upon their arrival here.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are nine cases in the community, of whom one is a Singaporean and eight are work-pass holders,” said the MOH.

> “In addition, there are three imported cases who had been isolated or placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.

> “The higher number of cases today is mainly due to a batch of test results from the previous day reported to MOH after the 12pm cut-off for yesterday’s reporting.”

> More details will be provided later tonight, it added.

> Meanwhile, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a media release on Tuesday that 69 more dormitories have been cleared of COVID-19. These comprise three purpose-built dormitories (PBD), 59 factory-converted dormitories and seven construction temporary quarters.

> In addition, 41 blocks for recovered workers (BRWs) in 11 PBDs have been cleared. The 41 BRWs cleared include the remaining blocks in Tampines Dormitory, Cochrane Lodge 1, Cochrane Lodge 2, Changi Lodge 2 and Sungei Tengah Lodge.

> This takes the total number to 891 dormitories and 56 BRWs in 17 PBDs cleared of COVID-19. In particular, Sungei Tengah Lodge is the largest PBD with around 16,000 workers, all of whom can immediately return to work if their employers have obtained approval from their sector agencies to restart operations.

> As of Monday, about 247,000 workers have either recovered, or have been tested to be free from the virus. Some of the workers are pending movement to appropriate accommodations before they can resume work. Others can return to work once dormitory operators, employers and workers have made the necessary preparations to minimise the risk of new infections as the workers go to work on a daily basis.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 285 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Monday, 44,371 cases – some 92 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while none are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Some 3,454 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 27 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 15 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 13 July, the ministry has conducted 1,009,532 swab tests, of which 519,911 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 177,100 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 91,200 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

\- from MOH's afternoon [press release on 14 Jul](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/347-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-14jul)

The current rise in the number is due to the ""targeted testing of migrant workers completing their isolation period"". In the annex B of the past 2 month press release, it is evident that most of the cases are linked to dorm clusters. On days with 200+ new cases, there is often at least one dorm that has more than 40 new cases linked.

Hi, I've added columns for newly confirmed cases (in a period) and tested positive rate (number of newly confirmed cases / number of unique person swapped x 100% ) as per your suggestion. Is this what you meant?

Although it might be somewhat indicative of how Singapore is doing (controlling the spread of COVID-19), this number might also be influenced by many other factors, such as how testing is conducted.

E.g how many blind/random testing are done + how many ""targeted testing"" of high risk groups (people working in healthcare frontline or staying in dorms that are uncleared for COVID).",t3_hv3ql5,2020-07-22 11:45:35,retaki,5

> SINGAPORE: The Government will construct new foreign worker dormitories as part of plans to reduce the current density in these accommodations.

> 

> By the end of this year, the authorities will create additional space to house about 60,000 workers, the Ministry of National Development (MND) and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a joint media release on Monday (Jun 1).

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> These include Quick Build Dormitories (QBDs) that can be constructed “quite quickly” in a modular form with a low density. These QBDs can last for about two to three years and can house about 25,000 people in total.

> Eight sites have been earmarked for new QBDs by the end of 2020, including in Kranji, Tuas, Admiralty, Choa Chu Kang and Tampines.

> 

> Unused state properties, including former schools and vacant factories, will be fitted out temporarily to house about 25,000 workers, and the authorities are talking to contractors to build more construction temporary quarters, which are makeshift dormitories that keep the workers near their worksite.

> 

> Some of the state properties that will be refurbished include the former Bedok North Secondary School building, the former Anderson Junior College Hostel and tents at the National Service Resort and country club in Kranji.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> As part of longer-term plans, the Government is planning to build new purpose-built dormitories (PBDs) over the next few years that can house up to 100,000 workers. These dormitories, which will have amenities such as minimarts and barber services, will replace the temporary accommodations built this year.

> 

> About 11 PBDs will be ready in the next ""one to two years"", the media release said. Workers living in the PBDs will also have ready access to medical care and support.

> 

> ""With these additional PBDs in place, we will also have the capacity to decant

> workers from the existing dormitories, and to undertake major upgrading to these

> dormitories to ensure that they meet the new standards,"" the ministries said.

> Besides expanding housing availability for foreign workers, government agencies are developing a set of specifications for these new dormitories, the ministries added.

> 

> These specifications will look into the design, facilities, management and regulation of these dormitories, and will factor in social interaction and disease response needs.

> 

> “In land scarce Singapore, dormitories are a practical approach to housing our migrant workers,” the media release said.

> 

> “We aim to make dormitory living and design more resilient to public health risks including pandemics, with improved living standards that are benchmarked both domestically and internationally.

> 

> “We will take on board lessons learnt from the current COVID pandemic, and also seek feedback from relevant stakeholders.”

> 

> Some of the present set of standards that will be improved as part of a pilot include increasing the living space per resident from a minimum of 4.5 sqm per resident, including shared facilities, to at least 6 sqm, not including shared facilities.

> 

> There will also be a maximum occupancy rate of up to 10 beds per room. Currently, there are no limits - the ministries noted that in practice, there are about 12-16 beds in each room.

> 

> The new set of requirements will see only single-deck beds being used, with 1m spacing between the beds.

> More toilets and bathrooms will also be built so that there is at least one bathroom, sink and toilet for every five beds, instead of every 15 beds.

> 

> The Government is also studying the possibility of developing the new PBDs on a different model compared to the present system, where currently land is released for the commercial operators to bid, build or operate.

> 

> ""While the physical standards are being improved, it is equally important to uplift the capabilities of dormitory operators and make adjustments to the daily living habits of the dormitory residents,"" the ministries said.

> ""Everyone must do their part to minimise the risk of infection clusters. The pilot will therefore also seek to instil a new level of discipline on safe living within dormitories.""

> The ministries noted that cost will go up alongside these new housing arrangements, “but they will keep the workers safe and allow Singaporeans to continue benefiting from their contributions"".

> 

> The media release also said that some of the dormitories will be located closer to residential areas given the country’s land constraints.

> ""Singaporeans must therefore do our part too. We must reject the Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) mindset and instead appreciate these workers who keep Singapore going,"" the ministries said.

338,fsld9iv,t1_fsk37ih,"Just out of curiosity (with no animosity or hostility against you), how would you propose going about improving the conditions without reducing the numbers of workers in a dorm?

I believe that this is the only realistic path seeing that reducing the number of people will reduce the strain on the common facilities (toilets, shower area etc etc), and reduce the amount of dirt being brought in from their work sites. There are also arguments that the reason that dorms are in their bad states is also partially due to their own habits and culture where what they consider as ""clean"" might not be ""clean"" to Singaporean standards. 

To combat this, relocating them to less dense dorms seems to be most logical sense in improving their living conditions. Less strain on the common facilities, easier to clean up due to the reduce in dirt/soil being brought from their sites.",t3_guiio0,2020-06-02 10:23:06,B_0_1,2

341,fslhusq,t1_fsld9iv,"One possible way is to reduce the reliance on foreign workers. Of course the counter argument is that it is easier said than done. I agree that certain field like the construction field require more manual labour etc and yes we definitely need foreign workers to contribute to our economy. However, do we need such a huge amount of them ? Or are they here because corporations want them here to maximise their profits ?  When we were in the early 2000s they were here mainly for construction and S&CC services. However, more and more came to roles such as building maintenance and marine services. I believe some Singaporeans would be willing to take on such roles if not for the otherwise poor salary given as corporations wants to keep their expenses low to maximise profits and the easier option is to choose the foreign worker option.

In the view of improving living conditions, it might be necessary to build more dormitories but they could still be built at areas where the population doesn’t resides. If we have to settle them at offshore facilities or floating dormitories then so be it. Also, cleanliness of shared areas could be enforced. I wouldn’t dare to make the assumption that their living spaces is same as what the SAF provides but I would dare to say that it is at least comparable. Why are shared areas and living spaces in bunks way better than what the FWs are living in ? I think it boils down to discipline. Some SAF bunks have 8 double decker beds in a single room and yet the area is still clean af. The question is, are they committed to clean up after their own? It doesn’t matter how much space we give them at the end of the day.

There is no way Singaporeans would want to do the job that the FW who lives in dorms do (construction, grass cutting, road resurfacing 6 times a week etc etc)

For your second point, yes I believe that culture and mindset does play a part in the current condition of the dorms. However, there is also so much ""trash"" (for a lack of better word ) a person can create. By reducing the number of people, it brings down the total amount of ""trash"", making it easier to clean up (or cleaners to clean if they contracted any).

Society is a hot mess of discombobulating, incoherent and inconsistent ideas. And the bottom line is everyone has a voice, everyone is able to influence the outcome. It's simultaneously empowering and discouraging. 

Back in 2011, the influx of foreign labour was the, if not one of the largest, election issue. It cost the PAP a talented Foreign Minister (oh - and a GRC. Whatever). Since 2011 you can track a very clear and blunt shift in policy, focused on keeping FWs away from the public eye. The Little India Riots didn't help, and the public furor only cemented the policy turn as being the right thing to do (if only to avoid public outrage). 

Now, one can persist in laying that at the feet of the PAP, saying that's the PAP abdicating moral responsibility, etc. But another can also make the argument that the PAP was simply following their democratic mandate and listening to the people. *I find it very hard to accept any denial that the voters back in 2011 had a hand in creating the standard of living that FWs experience now*.  

Consequently, while I applauded the outpouring of goodwill to the FWs in the Covid saga, the inevitable pushback was inevitable. Because society is a hot mess. 

My response above was to the comment that we can simply ignore these people, that their views are inconsequential because they're ""wrong"". No. We can't. That's not how democracy works. They will have their voice. There will be an opposition party who will, under the temptation of quick and easy votes, champion their cause. And if none of the existing opposition parties are stupid enough to take up that flag, the likelihood of them creating their own opposition party to raise that voice only increases. 

It is inevitable. The only way we have forward is to continue to show that they are a misguided minority in our society, and their views do not hold water in dictating how the country decides to treat FWs.",t3_guiio0,2020-06-02 15:17:48,owlbunnysubway,3

> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 287 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday (Apr 9), the largest daily increase so far and more than double yesterday's highest record, the multi-ministry task force dealing with the coronavirus said during a press conference on Thursday (Apr 9).

> This brings the national tally to 1,910.

> Of the new cases, 219 are linked to existing clusters, with at least 160 cases linked to the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol.

> A total of 19 cases are linked to previous cases, with 46 unlinked cases, the task force said. Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said.

> 

> Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his death.

> The task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II and Toh Guan Dormitory.

> Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.

> ""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.

> ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.

> 

> Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added.

> Singapore has seen a rise of COVID-19 cases at foreign worker domitories recently.

> Sungei Tengah Lodge became the fourth foreign worker dormitory to become an isolation area from midnight on Thursday, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.

> The other three dormitores that have been gazetted as isolation areas are: S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan Dormitory.

> On Thursday, the Land Transport Authority announced additional measures to ensure social distancing on public transport networks to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.

> This includes thermal scanners at select MRT stations and safe distancing stickers on buses, trains, train stations, bus interchanges and bus stops.

> This came after heightened safe distancing measures kicked in on Tuesday as part of a ""circuit breaker"" period until May 4 to stem the spread of COVID-19.

> About 10,000 written advisories were issued on the first two days of the circuit breaker for breaches, including individuals who gathered in public and those who failed to adhere to safe distancing rules.

> People who repeatedly flout the stricter safe-distancing measures will face a fine or be charged in court, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli wrote on Facebook on Thursday.

> First-time offenders will get a stern written warning. Anyone who commits a second offence will be fined S$300, while a third offence will lead to the person being charged in court.

> SINGAPORE - Foreign workers staying in dormitories make up 558 of the 623 new Covid-19 cases on Friday (April 16), the Ministry of Health said in its second update on infection numbers of the day.

> The other patients are 27 community cases and 37 work permit holders who did not stay in dormitories. There is also one imported case. This brings Singapore's total count to 5,050 coronavirus cases.

> MOH announced four new virus clusters as well.

> S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Singapore's largest cluster, added another 144 patients and is now linked to more than 1,000 cases.

> MOH said that it was also concerned that it is increasingly difficult to link the new cases and identify the source of infection.

> The ministry said the number of unlinked cases in the community has increased slightly, from an average of 19 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 22 per day in the past week.

> ""We have an ongoing surveillance programme, where a small sample of patients at our primary care facilities are tested for Covid-19 infections,"" said MOH.

> ""We have picked up some cases through these tests, which is an indication of undetected cases in the community.""

> Earlier in the day, MOH released preliminary figures ahead of its usual evening announcement. It is not clear why it decided to do so but there were messages circulating earlier that Singapore had logged the biggest single-day spike of 1,146 on some online platforms.

400,fnr55gx,t1_fnp7svl,"Yes, this part is super interesting especially as the Situation Report is now breaking the prevalence down by these groups too.

So as far as I can work out they are separating work permit holders out and then sub-dividing that into dorm / non-dorm.

Then others count in the community cases. What they don't really explain is what these groups include. So lets take the Situation Report population at risk numbers, Dorms - 323,000 / Non-dorm 664,000 = total 987,000

That number nicely matches up with the June 2019 numbers here: https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers Work permit total = 981,000

The interesting thing though is that those numbers include FDW permits which would seem to be the definition of residents in the 'community'.

So as far as I can work out community cases include citizens, PRs and Pass Holders (EP/SPass/PEP/Student Dependents Social etc)

Work Permits group contains 323,000 in dorms, 255,800 FDWs and then another block of 408,200 Work permit holders that do not live in dorms. 

So the only thing that really ties this remaining group together is that according to work permit rules it's the employer that is responsible for providing housing for these workers (and in a way I guess that's technically the case with FDWs).

So a theory for this is that there's a fairly fluid definition of what is and what isn't a Dormitory and sure enough the MOM helps us out again here: https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing

So maybe the missing piece of the puzzle here is the large block of construction workers who are allowed to be housed in temporary quarters and these are not being counted as 'dormitories' 

If this is the case (and the numbers seem to tally somewhat) then the only problem I can see is that the 255,000 FDWs being included in this group are reducing the prevalence in the non-dorm group.",t3_g34x2v,2020-04-18 11:12:21,rossriley,2

But I suspect many of the non-dorm WP holders work in the same places (e.g. construction sites) as dorm workers and got infected by their colleagues. They may not have much contact with the wider Singapore community, other than taking public transport. Here are some examples of where they may live.

One [Chinese WP holder](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/two-work-permit-holders-charged-for-breaching-quarantine-order) was just charged with breaching quarantine , and the case details reveal that his company moved him from [45 Genting Lane](https://www.google.com/maps/place/45+Genting+Rd,+Singapore+349488/@1.3271431,103.8767154,3a,75y,43.13h,94.22t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgHP537pVsohP_RgAFMacOQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da17877434104f:0xe976756926efcc3d!8m2!3d1.3274546!4d103.8767635) to [14 Genting Lane](https://www.google.com/maps/place/14+Genting+Rd,+Singapore+349475/@1.3282141,103.8752106,3a,75y,223.68h,120.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJyfg-Qfj5x9ZCudeJiDh7A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x31da1787230a7e47:0xabfcf08042e321cf!2s14+Genting+Rd,+Singapore+349475!3b1!8m2!3d1.3280172!4d103.8751087!3m4!1s0x31da1787230a7e47:0xabfcf08042e321cf!8m2!3d1.3280172!4d103.8751087). This is a light industrial area; the first appears to be a small number of rooms above a small contractor or warehouse, the second looks like a fairly new office building, but if you zoom in on the top floor, there are shirts hanging up to dry. 2 of the original 5 Bangladeshi construction workers at Seletar Aerospace Heights were reported to live in ""rental apartments"" at Veerasamy Road and Campbell Lane.

421,frrgeyw,t3_gq4f14,"Hmm just a thought, if the infection rate of the FWs seems to be 8%. We can just “end game” now by projecting 60,000 infections for Singapore for this first phase. No need to get anxiety looking at the numbers go up and down everyday.",t3_gq4f14,2020-05-25 20:24:30,mffffooo,7

424,frqt9zt,t3_gq4f14,"I'm thinking the fact that there are so many of them with COVID makes it impossible for Singapore to re-open. That is the reason why they extended this lockdown, without foreign workers Singapore can't function as they normally do. Luckily most cases are mild, so it proves that young people aren't as vulnerable to the disease.",t3_gq4f14,2020-05-25 14:14:06,Spinnocks,0
425,frqu8t0,t3_gq4f14,Frankly I don't see how Singapore can open up next week without some severe restrictions on movement and interactions with our FW. We are still testing positives in the hundreds each day in that segment.,t3_gq4f14,2020-05-25 14:27:41,shuipeng,-3
426,frruqo6,t1_frrgeyw,If all FWs lived in 1 big dorm than yes. Or you can look at that figure as an upper bound. However the 300k workers are spread across numerous dorms. There will be plenty of dorms which end up being completely spared and have no cases. These will the tested later in the process since they are lower priority for the 100% testing. Once we get there it should be expected that the overall FW infection rate decreases.,t3_gq4f14,2020-05-25 23:04:17,hanksredditname,1
427,frr0ug7,t1_frqt9zt,"that's not really true. it may affect the functioning of certain sectors (e.g. less construction projects can continue), but as long as community numbers are low it wouldn't have a massive impact on our daily lives.",t3_gq4f14,2020-05-25 16:08:19,jigaopuaysi,7

429,frr0zvn,t1_frqu8t0,"most FW dorms are isolated now - if you read the news, we can't test all of them fast enough (which is why the numbers are still high - we're just discovering existing cases), so they are mostly confined to their dorms, with only an allocated time for them to come out and exercise or play sports in their recreational area.",t3_gq4f14,2020-05-25 16:10:43,jigaopuaysi,0

Singapore created this tri-furcated labor market with SG/expats, WP/S, then MW and FDW essentially indentured servants. 

Singapore is not Taiwan or HK. Singapore is Dubai or Qatar. 

End reliance on cheap foreign labor, or deal with it humanely. Until you're ready to pay for the increased cost of having SG citizens be builders, you have no choice.",t3_gp2p21,2020-05-23 21:48:47,mat_rocker,-3

you cant stop them from visiting little india too, beyond a certain point.

Thats why the top guys are paid the big bucks...to figure this out so theres no recurrence when the workers get back into society. Else its back to square one.",t3_gp2p21,2020-05-23 19:16:43,,-8
