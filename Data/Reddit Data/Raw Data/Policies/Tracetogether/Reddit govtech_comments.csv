They're trying to make it possible for other countries to adopt the same protocol, preserving interoperability (global contact tracing!), while respecting the wishes of the other government.

You can make a new project with different objectives, where contributing your modifications back won't make sense and probably won't even be approved by the original team.

It's also not an exposé because the github for formsg literally says this. https://github.com/datagovsg/formsg-public How do you make an exposé with public information?

I can't comment on the vulnerabilities, but they do seem to have a security focus: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yq_T8jOhAHA3BLyn1H7cPMBICKYCUmARxRUIe2hwno4/mobilepresent#slide=id.g62bfdc73d3_0_75 The original project is run by a person who thought:
>There are many oudated and vulnerable dependencies within this project and I recommend that you use this code repository for internal testing and development only.

> What a start to the year. On Monday, the inaugural Parliament livestream triggered a real-time outcry over the collection and use of TraceTogether data.

> Contrary to prior assurances that TraceTogether data would only be used for contact tracing, Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan clarified that the police are, in fact, legally empowered under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to access said data for criminal investigations. The TraceTogether website FAQ was then updated to reflect this, ostensibly in the interests of ‘transparency’. Cue the first social media uproar of 2021.

> Some shrugged, saying they had nothing to hide. Some responded with “I told you so”. Still others were suspicious, if not livid, about the blatant U-turn.  And of course, many more turned to memes.

> Whichever camp you’re in, it’s clear that this revelation undermines the extensive efforts to win public support for TraceTogether, and feeds into earlier anxieties that it could be supposedly abused as a hidden tracking device. 

> To be honest, even with this latest development, it’s probably not worth getting worked up about location tracking. TraceTogether works by detecting proximity to other devices, not location. Expert teardowns of the token last year concluded that it did not have a GPS function and was “unlikely to be a useful tracking device” (though this was at least partially based on assurances that only MOH’s contact tracers would ever see the data)

> And as Minister Tan’s comments revealed, the remit of the CPC means that law enforcement is already empowered to access far more useful data, such as SafeEntry records—which, by the way, were also meant to be ‘for Covid-19 purposes only’. 

> What the clarification does do is raise questions over how exactly the proximity data might become useful to the police, whether there is potential for it to be misused, and what sorts of offences are quote-unquote ‘serious’ enough to trigger the exception. 

> It invites incredulity as to how Minister Balakrishnan could have overlooked the CPC during his PR offensive for TraceTogether last year. And it encourages anxieties over the inconsistencies and back-pedalling in government communications.

> These are all serious issues, but not the real source of public ire; nor is there any evidence that this was a deliberate conspiracy to mislead the public. What this episode really invites us to consider is a question of trust: whether the government can be relied on to keep its word, with no catch involved.

> Optics-wise, it’s a terrible look: a communications blunder that could have been easily avoided, and a breach of public trust for no good reason.

> As far as rights concerns in Singapore go, data privacy and surveillance have seldom been a priority. Last year’s PDPA consultation went largely ignored by the public; many of us—myself included—remain oblivious to the sensors, cameras, and GPS devices #disrupting and #innovating and #connecting our way into Smart Nationhood (like the time it was proposed to embed our lamp posts with facial recognition technology).  Meanwhile, legislation like the ISA casts a long, dark shadow over our willingness, historically, to make trade-offs between civil liberties and national security.

> By these standards, the hostility towards TraceTogether, even prior to this incident, was unusual. 

> Last year, the announcement of the token was greeted with a petition in protest, garnering over 50,000 signatures in a few days. Following months of will-they-won’t-they coyness—Minister Vivian Balakrishnan had previously said that TraceTogether would be “voluntary for long as possible”, but stopped short of a definitive statement—October’s announcement that TraceTogether would eventually be mandatory in certain circumstances raised enough eyebrows for MP He Ting Ru to bring it up in Parliament. And a Blackbox Research survey from last month showed that 32% of Singaporeans doubted that TraceTogether data would only be used for Covid-19 monitoring.

> TraceTogether, in other words, was always a hard sell. But had the government been upfront about the CPC caveat last year, chances are that the public, despite its unease, would have understood.

> Unfortunately, thanks to its own insistence that the data would be used for contact tracing and contact tracing only, people are not only uneasy, but outraged that the government has gone back on its word.

> The irony is all too keen, given how the successful implementation of TraceTogether relies on mutual trust between citizens and the state. Mass adoption of the technology—enough to trigger Phase 3—was arguably earned, at least in part, on the expectation that the government would honour its promises. Nor is it reassuring that despite the lessons of last year’s GE, public goodwill appears to have been taken for granted.

> What does this mean going forward? For one, potentially more road-bumps to realising our vision of having “everyone, everything, everywhere, all the time”. (I’m not kidding; this is the actual plan underscoring our transformation into a living dataset).

> This debacle suggests that distrust might colour the way future data-collection practices are viewed. The fears around a slippery slope are not unjustified: is there a clear line that the government will not cross when it comes to using our personal data?

> Most of us understand there are trade-offs to be made in any policy decision, and realise that in some instances, the potential benefits to public health or national security may outweigh the costs. But an informed choice means those costs should be declared to begin with.

> More troubling is how episodes like this one encourage cynicism towards governance. 

> It behooves no-one to reach a point where we believe that the government is flying the plane and we’re all just strapped in for the ride. After all, if we suspect that back-doors and hidden T&Cs will always be introduced after the fact, why listen in the first place? 

> Data might be the commodity of this century, but public trust is just as valuable an asset. Since Monday’s revelation, Ministers Shanmugam and Balakrishnan have been in full-on damage control mode, giving more assurances that the TraceTogether data is only retained for 25 days and that law enforcement must exercise their powers with ‘the utmost restraint’, giving the example of how TraceTogether data was used to solve a murder case.

118,gihidlt,t3_ks3pc8,"Looking at this as a non-Singaporean, everyone involved did exactly the right thing, which led to an unintended and unforseen ""problem"".

There was an urgent need for the Trace Together token as there is an ongoing public health emergency, and  Minister Balakrishnan and the development team would have been laser focussed on creating it, and having it adopted as widely as possible. They opened up the source code for audit by privacy advocates/hackers etc., who were approving of what they saw. The generaly high level of trust in your institutions and the privacy audit led to a pretty high voluntary adoption rate. 

It's easy for me to see how they could have overlooked that the data could or would be accessed and used for purposes other than contact tracing given thier focus on the pandemic and getting the token out ASAP.

Now, a police officer investigating a murder case realised that hey, that data might be useful in this case? Is there anything legally preventing us from getting it? No? Well, let's get it!

This is great savvy and professionalism from law enforcement; anything else would really have been a dereliction of duty on their part. They did exactly as they should given their mandate, and narrow focus on bringing a criminal to justice.

Now,  Minister Balakrishnan must have been peeved when he became aware of this, because this was genuinely not his intent, and was seen as the Government breaking their word, when it was really law enforcement acting independently (actually a positive). 

So at this point, how should it be settled? Do you go the legislative route to ring fence the token data? Given that the pandemic is time limited, and that legislative process may take some time, as well as the genuine value for criminal investigations, my opinion is that it shouldn't.

The compromise that the data will remain accessible, and only be used by LE for serious cases is the best solution in my opinion. Given the high level of professionalism by Singaporean LE, and the high level of trust for public officials, it's workable. In another society with greater corruption etc., the calculus would be different.

So the whole thing was just a real world situation which happens without anyone being a villian or incompetent, or whatever. I found the Parlimentary debate, and some of the wider discussion, around the issue to be  quite edifying.",t3_ks3pc8,2021-01-08 08:16:10,napierwit,2

Just take a look at some SG politician's response to Marijuana legalization in the west for example. It just shows a total lack of understanding of global trends.

130,gijuyqj,t1_gie5whe,"I am f-ing pissed because the alleged pros of having TT data to substantially aid in criminal investigations and prosecutions (if even tenable given that I can manipulate my “location” by leaving the token elsewhere) are FAR OUTWEIGHED by cons - which is the irreversible damage to the trust people have in the government. This trust imo is invaluable. Especially in the current turbulent times with a pandemic and shuttered global economy. Just look at countries around the world where most people don’t have trust in the government to fulfil what they promise. The govtech team and relevant agencies painstakingly built this trust over the later half of the year; only for it to be singlehandedly destroyed for the off chance that it might aid criminal investigations?? It’s such a profoundly costly and stupid trade-off. No money or cash handouts can ever repair that trust deficit they created. 

I can accept that Vivian might have omitted to consider the application of CPC at the first instance. But NO ONE in SPF, MHA, AGC brought it to his attention in the subsequent weeks? He also admitted as much that he found out about it but discussed with his colleagues and decided to proceed ahead nonetheless (btw his sob story about having sleepless nights, which I empathise cos I suffer from insomnia too lol, is wholly irrelevant and doesn’t play out well when you’re trying to seek the people’s forgiveness/understanding). We don’t know when he first found out about it but we know that it likely ain’t just this year. I am pissed because I (and many of us) trusted them to do the right thing and had spent much time and effort persuading family and friends to adopt TT to help our national effort to combat covid-19. Plus the fact that the gov had spent months persuading us and addressing all concerns people posed (INCLUDING about using TT data for crim investigations). The cons are even greater because people are less inclined to use TT responsibly now, which undermines the whole purpose of contact tracing.

To me, this is a matter of Principle and Trust, both of issues the PAP always prides themself on having. It is regrettable and sad that certain leaders decided that this invaluable trust and the PAP’s self-perceived reputation of being principled are worth tearing down for the ostensible benefit that it might or might not bring to crim cases.",t3_ks3pc8,2021-01-08 23:57:29,pbtoastt,2

I've already directly pointed out, that even if we accepted the entirety of your argument, Govtec using the data to find incriminating data and not disclosing the TT data to the police, is a vastly different situation from the reasons why people are angry at the government right now.

This was when you tried to re-raise your legal definition of ""use"", only to then say that the legal term is ""obtain"" (so I'm not sure why we have gone back to ""use"").

>is a legal use of TT data

You are just asserting this notion of ""legal use"", when you can't even provide a proper basis for your legal definition of ""use"". Or ""obtain"", or whatever you really think the proper legal term is.

As I mention above:

1) This entire point about ""legal use"" is misplaced. Vivian gave a *political* promise not to use the data for other purposes, not a *legal* promises (which he has no legal power to give anyway). 

2) It is not in dispute that the police has *legal* power to access the data all the time. However the Government is also free to make the promise that it will voluntarily not use the *legal* power. This was the promise made by Vivian. 

3) Given 1) and 2) above, the idea that there is a special legal meaning of ""use"", or ""obtain"" is missing the point, because the promise is not of a legal nature, and you should be considering Vivian's words in the general layman sense. Plus anyway, the relevant part of the CPC does not contain ""use"" or ""obtain"" so your legal argument is really just a confused misunderstanding of the law. 

4) Assuming that your entire example is even feasible, Govtech checking data, and then giving the incriminating data to the police, is different from the entire data being given to the police from the start. People will not have the same concerns as they now have.",t3_ks3pc8,2021-01-08 13:46:58,pingmr,2

1) My argument was against people who say that ""if police got no use for TT data, why collect it at all"" in which I provided an example where the police might need to have that flexibility ""use"" against people who abuse an exclusion clause. 

2) Yes and like I said before I don't disagree about perceptions on broken promises. Don't change the subject.

3) Mostly a repeat of 1 and 2. I stand by my interpretion of legal use for my example. See point 1.

4) Again, we are back to simplistic arguments. Yes, A and B is different for many combinations of A and B. Will people not have the same concerns? Vastly different situation? How to tell? Isn't that your opinion? Like I also said, Govtech is not MOH which you gave consent to for the sole purpose of contact tracing. Govtech is also not qualified to make criminal investigations by themselves. It is not their purpose eithet. Will not have the same concerns? Yes. Is it less concerning? I'd say no. You really think people won't reduce govtech to just government?  Wait. I do not wish to continue this conversation with you down that path.

I no longer find your arc of argument worthwhile of my time anymore.",t3_ks3pc8,2021-01-08 14:53:46,Elifgerg5fwdedw,2

Legal use that is base on no particular law. Standing by something does not make it logically sound.

>Yes, A and B is different for many combinations of A and B.

And that's just the point. Your example is not addressing the main issue that people are raising about police use.

> I do not wish to continue this conversation with you down that path. I no longer find your arc of argument worthwhile of my time anymore.

Every time someone mentions this on Reddit, I point out the obvious - if you don't want to continue you're free to just stop. I don't expect anyone to reply, and you don't need to notify me of, or ask my permission for, your decision to stop responding,",t3_ks3pc8,2021-01-08 17:08:03,pingmr,1
