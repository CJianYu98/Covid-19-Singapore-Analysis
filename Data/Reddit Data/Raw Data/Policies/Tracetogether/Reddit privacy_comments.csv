initially singapore tested an optional tracking app but nobody used it and it didnt work.

they are using this to force every citizen to wear a mandatory tracking device at all times in public.

the justification is that it is for covid 19 contact tracing. however, the virus in singapore has all but died out already. fewer than 25 deaths in singapore total.

despite apple and google updating their api to enable covid 19 tracing, this will not be used.
