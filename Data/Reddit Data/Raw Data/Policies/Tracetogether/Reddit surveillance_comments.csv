I think in all honesty, if it is going to enforced, this wearable tracking thing is ludicrous. Sure, it would facilitate contact-tracing. But its so stupid on 2 fronts:

2) Privacy. Aren’t current measures already invasive enough? Just look at the amount of CCTVs we have around us.

Questions have to be answered in parliament. That's the point of parliament. The fact that there are no details means they are still in the discussion phase. It takes time to develop custom devices. They can't tell you details when they don't have details.

85,ft4iqez,t1_ft4fbxf,"Yup. I know there's no GPS location tracking for trace together.

My point is that the implications of tracetogether or this new wearables scheme, assuming it is mandatory, should be properly debated.

If the government believes that there's a justifiable tradeoff between privacy and security (or in this case public health safety), then it should be clearly and tactfully presented to the public, given to robust debate, with concerns properly aired and addressed, so that people themselves can be convinced that the tradeoff is acceptable.

Convince people to adopt, rather than use a blunt-force instrument and railroading it through with mandatory legislation.

The government does have some catching up to do in order to bridge the trust deficit in light of rather egregious events like the Singhealth breaches and blood donor data leak. Stuff like PM Lee's personal particulars and medically confidential data being leaked may seem like funny news to some, but the implications are far from funny.

Civil liberties and personal privacy, however trivial it is thought to be, should be jealously guarded and not lightly given up. Once surrendered, it's very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.

Falsely claiming, or spreading news of claims, that the tracing device is a location tracking device that tracks the wearer 24/7 is not raising awareness. It is factually wrong.

Yes, because there are no further details yet. The question was posed in parliament, so it has to be answered. The fact that there are no details means its still in discussion. Tech takes time to develop. And intelligent people realise that no details means no details, not add your own details and use them to fearmonger.

The article was written based on a question in Parliament regarding asking whether Tracetogether will be made compulsory. The minister has to answer the question, that is the point of parliament. 

The precedent set is that Tracetogether did not use location data, and was open source so people could inspect the code to check for themselves if they did not believe it, which addresses privacy concerns.

The device hasn't even been developed yet. In my opinion, this petition is the blind leading the blind. Just by reading the justification of whoever started the petition, I can tell they have a very poor understanding of technology, yet they feel that they should come up with their own details to gain support for their cause.

How does making up details help anything? If you seek clarification by writing a ST forum letter or starting a petition demanding an explanation then yes, I can believe the motive is to seek clarification. 

If someone is starting a petition by making up details to get people to support it instead of seeking clarification, then that is telling of the true motives of the starter. It tells me the motive is not to seek clarification in any way, but instead inciting people to think that the made up details are true.

They left immediately after the service and did not report having lunch at the church. Based on closed-circuit camera findings, **C5 occupied the same seat as did cases C1 and C2 at the prayer meeting after the morning service, but they did not recall meeting each other**.""_  
  
Question: No punishments for the ones who claimed they only stayed at home while asymptomatic, but was later found to have been the cause of a new cluster's formation?

100,fl6cs0t,t3_fmfr83,"> Interpretation
SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community.

Interpretation of their interpretation (after few hours of sleep), combined with the collective thought consciousness, and possibly my personal biases laced with flawed logic:

If one wants to contain and minimise the risk of widespread community transmission via contact tracing as opposed to more stringent measures such as public activity lock down all the way until quarantining everyone in their houses, the former being gentler on the economy, then current methods of contact tracing that utilise interviewing an infected person is insufficient for a variety of reasons such as weak memory, memory loss, bad memory, corrupted memory, unwillingness to divulge embarrassing or compromising details etc., and many potentially infected contacts cannot be traced in a timely manner, if at all.

Additional methods which could help include using the TraceTogether app, activating Google Maps timeline and/or journaling your movement activity.",t3_fmfr83,2020-03-22 15:44:07,musr,2

107,fl5s894,t1_fl5rjzo,"Ugh ok, I can't argue with that. Just saying, it's very audacious to claim you've stayed home all these while, without going out _at all_ (!), when obviously you did.. and not only you did, you also infected others.  
  
Edit: Next question, should there be punishment for not remembering everything then? It's your social responsibility to not only minimise your tracks, but remember it even as you go gallivanting around town? Culpable for negligence.",t3_fmfr83,2020-03-22 10:32:48,kanteater,3

And prior to the virus and TraceTogether, I've used her phone to enable permanent sharing of her geolocation with my phone as she has expressed concerns before about early symptoms of dementia.     
  
I'm just saying... Older people can be responsible too. We also have a part to play to educate the older people in our families. And this should be another matter all together because negligence is still negligence.",t3_fmfr83,2020-03-22 11:09:10,kanteater,-1
