Further discuss also brought suspicion that he and Minister of Home Affairs, K Shanmugam had some miscommunication behind the scenes for TT and was made somewhat a half scapegoat for it. 

That incident also sparked some debate among people. One side said that hiding it can help accelerate collection of TT tokens and app installations for contact tracing in order for quicker transition to phase 3 and a further partial lift of lockdown, and health comes above all else. Another thou believe that this incident further eroded the trust we had in government transparency and policies which is already shaky beforehand even before the pandemic and it should have been clarified beforehand before collection of TT token exercise started.

> Token collection at the community club is from 10am to 6pm.

> Most of those seen in queue were senior citizens.

> Progressively increase number of collection centres

> Currently, TraceTogether token collection is restricted to residents' constituency community centres.

> The TraceTogether programme, which comprises both the app and the token, is aimed at improving Singapore's contract tracing efforts.

> Background

> It is not mandatory to collect the TraceTogether token, but it will be issued to anyone who wants one.

> However, in days to come, the TraceTogether token and app to do SafeEntry check-in at certain venues with large groups of people in Singapore will soon be compulsory.

> It was previously reported that each TraceTogether token costs S$20 to make.

> The government is keen to raise the take-up rate for the TraceTogether token to 70 per cent of the population.

> By late October, there were about 2.5 million people on board the programme, or 45 per cent of the population.

132,gdufs2c,t3_k20zs5,"**Data Transfer out of TT Tokens**

I think it's definitely possible with the current architecture that base stations can be set up at choke points to sniff all the traffic from TraceTogether tokens. The base stations can broadcast a special message that triggers TraceTogether tokens to dump a list of its handshakes. The base stations will then be linked up to a central server to collate the wealth of data for data analysis. This possible ""leakage"" of data via bluetooth data exchange is never talked about in the media - they've always focused on the lack of any traditional forms of data transfer such as 3G/4G etc.

**Tuning of models from data aggregated from TT Tokens**

Data from TT Tokens can then be used to link up with other forms of data points that have lower confidence levels, such as EZ-Link cards, bank cards, CCTV footage to build up and calibrate models that will allow a central authority to predict people's movements with higher confidence levels even after TT has been removed. 

**Geo-location Data without GNSS (GPS/GLONASS/Beidou/Galileo/QZSS)**

Given that TT Tokens do handshakes with other tokens that are sending out messages, how can people be sure that there aren't also other base stations that have known locations actively beaming out handshakes? This will allow the central authority to be able to say: ""Ok so this guy got this specific token ID which we know to be at XXX location.

Just like how the Patriot Act in the US started the whole journey towards reduced freedom, every country will start something that has a context and doesn’t upset too much and then keeps building up on it.

The problem with Singapore though is that Ben if people aren’t okay with it, there isn’t much you can do. Holding a smiley placard outside a court lands you in jail so anything else is unimaginable.

Most people commenting here have valid points about keeping everyone safe, but if that’s at the cost of civil liberties that’s a problem. The best way to keep a national safe would be to lock them up in a controlled facility and control every aspect of their life.

143,gdvh1ve,t1_gdvevyc,"Without going into details, I work for ICT myself and can confirm what u are saying is correct but there is a difference. In case of private/public companies they have strict rules to follow and the government doesn’t own the data. Instead they have to formally request for it. The granularity of location data (for example) is not very high. mobile devices are able to detect and send location from tower data alone but it again is not extremely accurate if you want to create a view of who is in contact with whom. That process is also very data compute intensive and can only be done in retrospective on offline infra, not the online infra (except law enforcement requests).
Today all data is getting captured in isolation in different buckets and it only gets stitched together into a view based on need. However what TraceTogether presents is an opportunity to create an online way of running an efficient query on this data which is being aggregated online.

In my view if the aim was to only capture and Ensure that everyone was compliant then it would have been enough to run the TT app on a device and have a led indicating it was online. There was no need to scan the trace together tokens at entrances. Similarly for mobiles, the app could show on screen that it’s compliant and let them enter. Why scan the QR code.

Also the data you get from social media and other tech companies are not granular enough to create a correlation with a specific named individual (as per official records). They aggregate content which is approximate. For example Google knows you by the advertising id or probably your device id and if you use two separate devices with separate id’s it’s tough for them to correlate the two as one individual.

With TraceTogether the data is extremely granular and identifiable. If for example the government wanted to do target advertising, they would know your device id (from TraceTogether), your identity, preferences etc and then they would create campaigns with specific curated audiences and instead of casting a large net, you could be targeted directly including through SMS etc. You may not realise it’s a custom curated message. This makes the spend on targeted messaging extremely efficient. Like imagine Facebook doing a ID check for every account and knowing he people behind it.

The civil servants have been working hard this year (not being sympathetic, just practical) and I think it’s unfair to not pay them some incentive. A better approach would have been to limit salaries of all ex-generals/political appointees/etc into even charity orgs like SINDA, PA etc...

That thought experiment is so far out.

Please name at least one developed nation which has faced 40% unemployment rate. Even the US in the great depression only faced 25% unemployment rate.

Say I entertain your thoughts. The unemployment rate has reached 40%, isn't it also possible that the Government uses a tracing system to make sure families get their fair ration at the food shelter and ensure no one abuses whatever welfare in place for this economical dystopian future?

Additionally, you must not be paying attention when you didn't think our Government isn't big. Singapore only arrived at where we are because our Government is big while being wildly pragmatic for a long period of time, lending to the credibility that we are the most geopolitical stable nation among our Asian brethren.  People are in fact screaming for our Government to be bigger, look at how left-leaning this sub has become. UBI has been picking up steam here. Yet people chose not to see that having UBI means surrendering individual economical power to government control, making the scenario you paint more likely than the current system.

Here's another thought experiment. Imagine that Indonesia is facing underemployment and a high unemployment rate. In order to find a scapegoat, they chose Singapore. Meanwhile, Singaporeans are divided from within due to people screaming how we are screwed and shaking the faith in the system while Indonesia capitalizes on that to run disinformation campaigns further putting seeds into the populace, somewhat like what is happening in the US. Indonesia successfully undermined our Government, ushering in a weak and incompetent populist Government, MNCs feel that the once corporate-friendly and stable geopolitical landscape in Singapore are no longer a certainty, and choose to instead to go to another cheaper neighbouring country since it's the same anyway. Then, would this be a scenario to lead to your scenario?

>Civilians or not, when there is economic calamity, everyone just has one goal: Keep my job at all cost so I can feed myself and my family.  
>  
>In this situation, there will be enough people in the armed forces that will carry out any command.

Whenever there is an economical calamity, what we see first is an exodus of the populace when it's possible. And armed uprising from civilians will first happen, leading to the government taking the chance to use martial law to suppress the populace.

To feed a military in a 40% unemployment rate scenario, what natural resources or illegal trade do you think Singapore can tap into to fund something like this? It's unreasonable to think that we have not exhausted all means in our financial resources to stop-gap an inevitable 40% unemployment rate scenario in Singapore. Or people are too stupid to see this is not viable and choose to stay in Singapore even as they already lost all reasons to stay here.

>I agree that it sounds all a bit paranoid. ie one thing that I always forget is that SG has a very large group of foreign workers, if the rulers went mad, these workers could just leave and render the city pretty much dysfunctional, so that's good.

In SG, I don't think the rulers will go mad as much as the populace going mad first due to spreading paranoia to a group of unsecure people. And if the rulers went mad, it is extremely likely because the populace went mad first to usher in a mad government, like the US. We have many precedents to such scenarios which started out as populist movement in fact.",t3_k20zs5,2020-12-01 11:01:04,power_gust,2

Just that they haven't come to a conclusion as to whether the initiative has worked, or if how they are interpreting the results is appropriate. This goes for all scientific writings. You don't simply release raw data that lack substantive review and interpretation of the results. Just chill until they do.

Lmao, now you say we can't know. Yet before you said it was likely that this becomes the norm? I admit I don't know what their intentions are, but if they wanted to track you they could get you whenever your phones connects to the internet (this goes for any country btw).
