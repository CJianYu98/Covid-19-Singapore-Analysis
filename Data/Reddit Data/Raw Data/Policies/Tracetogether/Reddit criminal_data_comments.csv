The message is simple (and one that people in Singapore have heard all their lives): the government will use any tool at its disposal to protect society against threats, would-be criminals are warned. 

Singapore is a democracy, but it is a democracy that takes the position that a government of the people has a responsibility to be proactive in defending the collective interests of the people it is supposed to represent. 

From what I’ve seen of the world’s democracies who claim to respect privacy rights, the reality is that they also collect data on their citizens and the biggest difference is that they simply don’t bother to use that power to protect their citizens. It’s like hearing an alcoholic parent claim that they’re respecting their child’s right to privacy by not paying any attention to them, any rational person would call that neglect.

This is an extremely simple example of what you can do. It’s very easy to twist these connections to suit a narrative - something governments love being able to do.

 **9. (C) Singapore boasts a highly competitive and  well-regarded primary and secondary education system, but the  number of Singaporeans completing a tertiary education is  relatively low.  Only 23 percent of Singaporean students  entering primary school complete a degree at a local  four-year university.  In other knowledge-economies such as  Japan's, around 50 percent of students complete a university  degree.  However, according to Cheryl Chan, Assistant  Director of the Planning Division at the Ministry of  Education (MOE), the government does not plan to encourage  more students to get a higher education.  The university  enrollment rate will continue to be maintained at 20-25  percent because the Singaporean labor market does not need  everyone to get a four-year degree, she asserted.**  

[https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07SINGAPORE394\_a.html](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07SINGAPORE394_a.html). 

This percentage has certainly increased but there is still a cap.

 **(C) Summary.  The youth wing of Singapore's ruling party,  Young PAP (YP), is pursuing closer ties with the Chinese  Communist Youth League, two YP executive committee members  told PolOffs on August 27.  Recent YP ""study visits"" to China  have focused on political education and recruitment.  In  contrast, YP's relations with fraternal parties in Indonesia,  Malaysia, and Taiwan are less active.  Though YP membership  has recently increased by about 150% to approximately 9,000,  it remains a relatively small organization even by Singapore  standards.  It has never fulfilled its intended role of  cultivating new leadership for the ruling People's Action  Party (PAP), with only one former member in a cabinet-level  position.  Instead of influencing policy, YP appears geared  toward creating a positive image of the PAP for young  Singaporeans, with the ultimate goal of encouraging them to  become PAP members.  End summary.    Young PAP Pursues Ties with Communist Youth League...**

Hehe and of course many more, i am surprised how short term Singaporeans are at these big issues.

 **1. (C) Summary:  Faced with a chronically low fertility rate  and high emigration, Singapore has used a selective but  relatively open immigration policy to increase its  population, fuel its normally strong economic growth, and  maintain a politically delicate balance among its Chinese,  Malay and Indian ethnic groups.  While the GOS keeps its  immigration numbers secret, it appears that a particularly  low birth rate among ethnic Chinese has allowed  Chinese-national immigrants to overwhelmingly benefit.  Many  Chinese immigrants use Singapore as a stepping stone and  depart for greater opportunities abroad once they have  obtained Permanent Resident status.  The integration of  culturally different mainland Chinese remains a challenge.  End Summary.**

----------------------------------------------------

EDIT - Adding my reply so my karma stays sane u/PathToDefeat:

I think you are missing the point here, what I said was that the purpose of TT is solely for contact tracing yes, but in the event of a criminal investigation, all cards are off the table in terms of privacy. The SPF and PAP are actually 2 separate entities, as difficult as it might be to believe, as the state cannot operate above the law. What you are insinuating (that the gov and the SPF conspire against the people) is possible but I mean why do it via TT when they already have such a tight grip over us? Also, the government can't really mandate what the SPF can or cannot do with the data, wouldn't the ability to control that be dangerous as well? I'm pretty sure the SPF can get whatever data they want regardless of what PAP says... 

"" The SPF is empowered under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to obtain any data, and that includes the TraceTogether data, said Mr Tan. ""

Imagine if EDB sent a representative to a foreign company, say Coca Cola, and enticed them with a 5% corporate tax rate, and after Coca Cola sets up their factories, workforce, etc, in Singapore, MAS comes out and says “oh btw there is this law in SG that says the government can, at its own discretion, raise corporate tax rates as a response to fiscal uncertainties”.

Now, what do you think should be the right course of action? If tax rates have always been set by MAS, then technically EDB shouldn’t be able to offer such terms to the foreign party correct? However to the investor, MAS and EDB fall under the same government, and if one branch of the government can so easily overturn the commitments given by another branch, then what makes Singapore so different from say, the US tearing up the Paris and Iran agreements?

Also on TT: [https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/360043224854-Why-does-TraceTogether-need-Location-Permission-on-Android-](https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/360043224854-Why-does-TraceTogether-need-Location-Permission-on-Android-)

Bluetooth is only really good for location history, but real-time tracking not so much.

Of course, you can turn around and argue that TT's website can't be trusted, in that case, the rest of us don't really have much in the way of convincing you guys.

Also, what do you mean about the point on government and data? Isn't the issue here with giving the data to SPF instead? The SPF and the gov are 2 separate entities. If the SPF wants it they take it. The gov already has the data, what are you on about.

Your point on ad targeting and behavior prediction is ridiculous and here is why. If they inform us about giving the data out to SPF, they will inform us if they give the data to ad companies, otherwise why even inform us about the former in the first place? And you know the gov can't do the latter without huge consequences.

281,gib84b5,t1_giaohcr,"I want to correct your understanding of how location tracking occurs with Bluetooth devices. BLE can be used for indoor position tracking when it communicates with multiple Bluetooth beacons around. The TraceTogether app also asks for ""Location"" permission, and users can choose to give it. In tandem, these two sources of information can give the collection server a pretty good idea of where you are.

More importantly, the issue of privacy isn't as cut and dry as you think it to be. It's about what the government can potentially do with this data. What if tomorrow an important member of an opposition party is being tracked without their consent? What if the government decides to trace thousands of people because they ""think"" they've committed a crime? What if the government collects live location data of all Singapore residents and uses that to predict peoples' behavior? What if that data is sold to third party sources for more effective ad targeting?

While some of these might seem paranoid, this is how it starts. We willingly give away information about ourselves under the blanket of security or convenience, not knowing how that data is being used and who exactly is accountable for it. This leads to a broken window theory, and we give up more of our privacy rights because we don't really see the big picture.

1: Did you read my quote on the CPC? No data is safe from the police when a criminal investigation is underway, and this is true for any country except, and ironically, countries under dictatorship. The government has no say on whether or not SPF has access to TT - it operates as a separate entity, and saying otherwise would insinuate that the gov is conspiring with the SPF against the people. You better have proof to back that up.

2: Indeed data is just data, and so far it has been used to contact trace for covid, and eventually aid in criminal investigations (this is beyond the gov control, again ANY data is available to SPF under CPC). Data can always be used for the bad, but we should look to find a common ground between the pros and the cons instead of outright rejecting this notion from the start.

This is not some front desk customer service. This came from the minister as part of a multiministry task force.  If you see most of the Singapore law (feel free to browse through sso.agc.sg for all the acts where they reference the minister have the discretion to xxx) the minister is where the buck stops and have the final decision.  The lawmakers aka MPs have made it so. Once again stop shifting the goalpost to parliament. This was a ministerial decision.

326,gi61fsq,t3_kqvq88,"> # Police can only ask for TraceTogether data through person involved in criminal probe: Vivian Balakrishnan

> SINGAPORE: While the police can obtain TraceTogether data for criminal investigations, they can only do so by requiring a person involved in the investigation to produce his token or mobile phone, said Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan in Parliament on Tuesday (Jan 5).

> The issue of the police being able to obtain such information emerged in Parliament on Monday, raising privacy concerns over the national contact tracing tool for COVID-19.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan told the House then that under Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), the police have the power to order anyone to produce any data, including TraceTogether data, for the purposes of a criminal investigation.

> He was responding to questions from Member of Parliament Christopher de Souza, who also asked what the legal provisions and safeguards are for using such data.

> 

> A privacy statement on the TraceTogether website had earlier said the data would only be used “for contact tracing purposes”. The website was updated following Mr Tan's comments in Parliament.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> On Tuesday, Dr Balakrishnan rose to make clarifications about TraceTogether in response to Mr de Souza's questions the day earlier.

> 

> ""The police can only do so, can only ask for access, by requiring a person involved in or assisting in criminal investigation to produce either his mobile smartphone or his (TraceTogether) token,"" he said.

> 

> Dr Balakrishnan, who is also Foreign Affairs Minister, also said he “had not thought of” the CPC when he spoke previously about how data from TraceTogether would be used.

> 

> On Jun 5, before the planned rollout of the TraceTogether programme, Dr Balakrishnan said in Parliament that TraceTogether will strictly be used for contact tracing.

> Advertisement

> He reiterated this point a few days later when he said: ""Again I want to emphasise, there is no electronic tagging. There is no geolocation tracking. This is only purely focused on Bluetooth proximity data, and only used for contact tracing.”

> “The keyword here is criminal investigation,"" said Dr Balakrishnan on Tuesday on the provisions in the CPC.

> ""We have gone to great lengths to protect the privacy of all TraceTogether users in all normal use cases. But TraceTogether data is not exempt from Section (20) of the CPC.""

> 

> He added: “And I think members know me well, I am always very frank. Frankly, I had not thought of the CPC when I spoke earlier.

> ""This application of the CPC is not unique to TraceTogether data.""

> Dr Balakrishnan cited the example of phone or banking records that may be protected by specific privacy laws but are also subject to the same provisions under the code.

> 

> “I think Singaporeans can understand why Section 20 of the CPC confers such broad powers. There may be serious crimes, murder, terrorist incidents where the use of TraceTogether data in police investigations may be necessary in the public interest. The police must be given the tools to bring criminals to justice and protect the safety and security of all Singaporeans,” he said.

> ""TEMPORARY RECORD"" OF CLOSE CONTACTS

> Contact tracing is also “absolutely essential” for the control of COVID-19 to identify those who may have been exposed to infected patients, Dr Balakrishnan stressed.

> “We have always been conscious of the need to protect personal privacy. And to this end we took great effort in the design of the system, the coding of the application, we even open-sourced the code for public scrutiny and to share with overseas jurisdictions,” he added.

> Dr Balakrishnan said that TraceTogether only collects Bluetooth proximity data “on a temporary basis”.

> “It does not collect - and I want to emphasise - it does not collect GPS location data nor movement data. So let me reiterate this - the TraceTogether app and the token were not designed to allow any government agency to track the user,” he added

> “The app or the token only keeps a temporary record of who you have come into close contact with for a prolonged basis. Neither the app nor the token tracks a user’s location.”

> The data is then stored in an encrypted form locally on the device - a user’s phone or the token. The encrypted data is then ""automatically purged"" after 25 days, said Dr Balakrishnan.

> “So you can see that we have taken efforts, maximum efforts, to protect privacy while enabling contact tracing to be facilitated through digital means.”

> 

> Adding that the Government does not “take the trust of Singaporeans lightly”, Dr Balakrishnan said the country cannot prevail in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic if Singaporeans did not trust public health authorities and the Government.

> “We are grateful that more than three-quarters of our residents have chosen to participate in their TraceTogether programme. It reflects not only their willingness to play a part in our collective fight against COVID-19 but also their confidence in the government commitment to protect the data so collected,” he continued.

> “I want to again assure Singaporeans that your confidence is not misplaced.We will protect your privacy, and I would add, that once the COVID-19 pandemic is over and there is no longer a need for contact tracing we would most happily and cheerfully stand the programme down.”

> 

> USE OF TRACETOGETHER DATA LIMITED TO ""VERY SERIOUS OFFENCES"": SHANMUGAM

> Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh thanked Dr Balakrishnan for acknowledging that the CPC “wasn’t really in his contemplation” when his original statements were made.

> He then asked Dr Balakrishnan and Minister for Law and Home Affairs K Shanmugam to explain under what circumstances the police would “judiciously” use the information collected by the TraceTogether programme.

> Under Section 20 of the CPC, the police are authorised to recover or seek any information in the possession of a person “as long as the seeking of such information is not excluded by some other written law”, said Mr Shanmugam, adding that there are some provisions that circumscribe the exercise of police powers.

> “Subject to that, the CPC gives the power to the police. And when such a power is given, police are obviously under a duty as well.”

> He gave the example of a hypothetical murder case in which relevant information was available through a TraceTogether token.

> “If the police chose not to seek that information, you can imagine how the victim’s family and indeed the rest of Singapore might react to that situation,” he said.

> But given that the TraceTogether programme is of “national importance” and “necessary” for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, the police's use of data collected by TraceTogether is restricted to “very serious offences”, said Mr Shanmugam.

> “While that requirement is not in the legislation, it will be carefully considered within the police and discretion will be exercised in seeking this information,” he added.

> Although relevant information collected by TraceTogether may be produced in court during a trial, data of “no particular use” will be deleted at the end of a police investigation, said Mr Shanmugam in response to a question from Mr de Souza.

> 

> Progress Singapore Party Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai asked Dr Balakrishnan for the number of instances when the police have used TraceTogether data and thanked him for responding to the strong public reaction.

> “However I would also like the minister to clarify further - one, when did he discover that his statement that he made before is going to be affected by the CPC?"" said Mr Leong.

> “Two, his message today. Is it he wants to apologise that the Government or the minister has made an oversight, or is his message telling us that in Singapore we should just take it that the Criminal Procedure Code will be able to access all the information that they have on us in Singapore?”

> In response, Dr Balakrishnan said instances of TraceTogether data being used by the police is an “operational question”.

> “As far as I am aware, so far I think there has been only one in which involved a murder case. But I am not privy to operational details and I shouldn't be and therefore I am not in a position to comment further on the investigations,” he added.

> Dr Balakrishnan then reiterated that he made the statements when the CPC was “not in my mind”.

> “Subsequently, we’ve been having discussions, especially over the last few weeks as to whether we should in fact change the law or whether we continue as we are now,” he said.

> Those involved decided that it is “better to be upfront” and are “very glad” that the parliamentary question was asked and answered on Monday, he continued.

> Adding that he is “obsessively concerned” with accuracy with an “absolute adherence to honesty”, Dr Balakrishnan said: “And that means over the years from time to time when I have misspoken I have said so. I have never shied away from saying so because it is far more important to maintain trust.

> “I might be right or I might be wrong or I might have mistaken something or overlooked something, but rest assured when I discover it, I will say so and to the best extent possible, we will find a solution together. That is my approach and I don’t see any need to change from that and I hope you understand.”

368,gi8xd3q,t1_gi8w112,"Dude. Your arguments are zipping all over the place.

1. Exclusion of tt for use of criminal investigation does not include scenarios if it is explicitly part of the criminal acts. Penal code forbid physical violence but excluded police if police use violence as part of duties. If police use violence outside their duties this whole exemption is moot.

And in any case if govt wanna put GPS tracking in TT I'm sure instead of doing some backdoor shit a grand and convincing reason will be cooked up for people first.

2. Before ong teng cheong our presidents were  selected. (Never mind that officially wee Kim wee is the first elected president cuz he exercised the power of elected president blah blah). Our president no executive power. Executive powers come from the elected legislative body. This place not America. Even WP had been pushing for abolishment of elected presidency for the longest time.

Privacy violation aren't as explcit and provable as a police punching you in the face. Without direct evidence, how is an act ""explicitly"" part of a criminal act?

My point is that if the legislative body interfere with executive powers to assuage the public on paper (populist move) over a specific app (unprecedented), it is an issue (a technical one too ). ""Our president no executive power"": precisely why they got away with amending the definition of an elected president?

370,giatx0l,t1_gi91do5,"I might have misread your previous comment on 'separation of executive and legislation as an issue that is technical enough' as a reference to President/Cabinet. Apologies.


The law can be simply written to exclude TT as evidence for criminal investigations, except when TT (or usage/development) itself is the subject of criminal investigation. 

I dont know how this can be done without contradicting other laws, but I'm pretty sure the bright minds on MoL or AGC can pull it off.

Which led to my biggest point. The purpose of the legislative is to represent constituents' will in the political arena (by being elected) and ensure the will is empowered through voting within the Parliament. Hence, the legislative by nature, antagonistic and interference to the executive, if the executive's action is not representing constituents will. Whether the constituents are wishing for dumbshit is another different subject for debate.

Due to the supermajority within Singapore and the party whip, the legislation is in line with the executive. Executive say something legislative will vote along with it, cuz party whip.

And the executive has pushed for many laws when it is convenient, contorting them to fit the agenda. And when it comes to more uncomfortable subjects like 377a, laws for domestic violence etc, suddenly we need to think through nuances and grey areas yada yada . 

So, is it populistic for the public to ask for TT to be excluded from cpc? We can agree to disagree. Is it justifiable for this to be done, in that it serves the greater good? We can agree to disagree on what is the greater good/lesser good.


But Is it possible for the Parliament  to pull this off like insert notifications in phone? Absolutely, if they want to.

It's not just that we have a low severe crime rate, but also the fact that it is really hard to imagine TT data being the difference-maker even in those cases of severe crime. Plenty of people have already pointed out the many, many reasons why TT data is probably not very helpful for crime, especially next to the long list of powerful surveillance tools the police already have. Maybe it is still better than nothing, but surely not by much.

390,gizjfom,t3_kvnrut,"I think the simple response is that the laws imposed are not appropriate. 

TT is meant to be a temporary measure (yes yes we know that may turn out to be untrue). If so, why are we becoming dependent on it as another avenue for evidence. It’s going to fall away, at least in theory, at some point. 

On top of that, the efficacy of TT in terms of actually stopping crime seems iffy. Like many have pointed out, do we expect criminals to actually carry their TT devices around when they commit crimes? Do we really believe that a drug syndicate would get their guys to carry traceable phones and their tokens? If not, then what’s the real value in using TT for evidence? Arguably it would be problematic if a suspect can engineer a situation where they get someone else to carry their TT device in a different location right? 

If we apply some critical thinking to this, it surely raises more questions than the answers that have been provided thus far. Even the way the law being rushed out and how it’s being lauded by the PAP (self-praise at its highest) runs contrary to the sob stories they were telling in Parliament. And what public consultation took place? Again it would appear as if the entire thing was engineered so that the 60% who are less able to think critically start to think the Govt is listening when, it would seem, the Govt has just taken more rights from us.

If the Sultan could forsee the subsequent  actions of the British under Dr. Crawfurd which seized all soveriegnty  from the Sultan, I doubt he would have deemed the Treaty reasonable.

There are many such notable similar examples in other countries, especially in the USA.

398,gizioix,t1_gizeynq,"That is true. Though I would argue from the point where the Sultan's signature of the treaty which allowed the British as much free reign over the island as they did, eventually created the conditions such that they were able to eventually dispose of him. (rather than continuing to satisfy him with higher payment renegotiation) 

If the Sultan's agreement was shrewd enough to include immigration restrictions, thereby preventing the British utilisation of foreign convict labour, and hence forcing the British to depend on native labourers loyal to the Sultan. Then perhaps things would have turned out differently. Though also perhaps the way things did turn out was for the best. 

Similarly, the question should be asked. Is the current design of TT's relationship to the law shrewd enough to prevent potentialities of citizen mistrust of gov initiatives? 

Perhaps the hard-code way it is implemented interacts with the Police bureaucracy in such a way that it indeed a good safeguard and in time the citizens will see this and understand that they are in good hands. 

Perhaps it will happen in another way, either with the Police mishandling the data or with some flaw in PR causing the public to heavily doubt the policy, both cases leading to detrimental mistrust. 

Only those with a keen understanding of the Police bureaucracy as well as the nature of gov-citizen media relations would be able to give a good estimate of the potentialities of the TT design as is.

Now more than ever, is the time to ask questions of the govt and their role in your life. You said we have close to no privacy in SG. I will not refute that, but why have it reached this point?

Why is TT a bigger problem than private companies' data harvesting? It is because TT gives data to the government, which has so much more influence over your actions and daily routines with little to no benefit that SafeEntry already provides (SafeEntry is another problem). In exchange for this barely existing benefit you are allowing the government the expand it's powers to see who you meet and how long you meet them.

414,gj3ttij,t1_gj37ypn,"There won't be a second lockdown because using TT is mandatory in most places and will be made mandatory everywhere soon. So, what are you on about? 

I'm not going to explain to you why privacy matters because that's a complex subject about a slippery slope. There's plenty of material online if you care to read up. Information is not just a statistic. There's lots of things people can do with indoor location data and I'd rather not give out such information unless I know that it is only going to be used for it's intended purpose. As I said before, your lack of knowledge on the subject is glaringly obvious.

We can fight Covid and not have the government go back on its promises about the data it collects from us. You don't need to demonize people as insensitive and call them ""American leftists"" (that doesn't even make sense in this context) just because you disagree. Those Ad hominem attacks will get you nothing. Now go ahead and invoke your daddy's throwaway account.",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-13 20:28:00,CarefulCrow3,0

416,gj3huhl,t1_gj3hfrt,"You missed my point, that's why I wasn't talking about the likelihood of a lockdown. I was talking about the attitudes of people who say they would be willing to let it happen to flip off the government, as if this did anything for them and for us. I am criticizing the underlying attitude.",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-13 17:13:36,BEaSTGiN,-1
417,gj3uojn,t1_gj3ttij,"Like I said, I was addressing the attitude of certain people towards a lockdown and not the likelihood of a lockdown.
From their words, they were saying that even it were to cause another lockdown, they would still turn off their bluetooth just to spite the government, which would in their hypothetical scenario, be nothing but foolish and selfish. So, I am criticizing that attitude. It is that attitude that I rightly criticize.

I do have a general disdain for most of the consensus of this sub, given that most of the people engage in the same mudslinging ad hominem you speak of and only hop on the downvote bandwagon without sound arguments to show for it. I try to limit my arguments to the ideas alone, but some responses I get do tend to grind my gears.",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-13 20:39:28,BEaSTGiN,0

419,gj3i3p6,t1_gj3huhl,"Read what I wrote. People know another lockdown won't happen because it will cause PAP to lose its claim to power. Which is economic performance. They took too long to lock the country down at the start, that indicates alot",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-13 17:17:59,SirPalat,2
420,gj470co,t1_gj3uojn,"Look, I understand where you're coming from, but you need to see where all of this is coming from if you want to be taken seriously. Nobody likes being lied to. Period. The fact that a government which everyone trusted is doing it makes everyone feel betrayed.

It doesn't help that you aren't willing to understand this point of view and instead attribute an ""American leftist"" identity to dissenters who may very well be Singaporean through and through. When you do that, it throws any further discussion you want to have out the window. 

If you aimed to come on here and be the ""unpopular opinion"" guy in the room without researching the topic, you've succeeded. It doesn't mean that you're standing up for something you believe in. At this point, you yourself concede that you're discussing hypotheticals which don't mean anything any more.",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-13 22:47:16,CarefulCrow3,2
421,gj3isap,t1_gj3i3p6,"That's not the point, dude.

People know it won't happen but said that they would be willing to have it happen IF flipping off the govt would make it likely to happen. So I am criticizing that selfish attitude.",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-13 17:29:40,BEaSTGiN,-1
422,gj49vre,t1_gj470co,"That was an edit-in, because it was pretty apparent to me that people don't want to have a reasonable discussion in the first place - not that I mind the downvotes, but if you wanted to be so closed to the discussion, why not make your own sub where all you hear is yourself and yourself #2 speak?

I personally think that people are kicking up a big fuss over something that can be reasonably discussed. They should acknowledge that there are people who are also not particularly bothered by the status quo. I for one think that it is unproductive and also that the legislated change is acceptable, if perhaps unsustainable.",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-13 23:11:12,BEaSTGiN,0
423,gj3jzv5,t1_gj3isap,Bro it's like saying I am willing to kill my family if it means ending world poverty.

424,gj4c66d,t1_gj49vre,"If you're not particularly bothered by the status quo, that's on you. Multiple posters have reasonably told you why they care about their privacy but you keep coming back without having done one iota of research to dismiss their claims. How is that a productive discussion? If the majority disagree with you, that doesn't necessarily make it an echo chamber. It can also mean that you're wrong but of course, you'd rather assume the former than the latter.

By the way, GDPR was first introduced by the EU and the Signal app is trending on AppStores of multiple countries. Does that make them all ""American leftists"" in echo chambers?",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-13 23:29:47,CarefulCrow3,3

426,gj4dcxn,t1_gj4c66d,"They were pretty rude about it though, especially the Imran dude.

Personally I think it's fearmongering since they also cite a slippery slope that they can't prove will happen either. But I suppose you have different lines for privacy. I don't expect much because of social media and corporations and I only expect that the one or two situations in which I consider an intrusion (phone calls, texts, etc.) should only be used if I'm a criminal. 

Nonetheless, I think people are too riled up and should just calm down a little. Want to talk to the government just go, coming here to say it is like copying what the last person said with different words. I just find it too reminiscent of mob mentality.",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-13 23:39:18,BEaSTGiN,0

428,gj4l0th,t1_gj4dcxn,"Your passive-aggressive comments started the rudeness by saying that there was a concept that they would find too difficult to understand. Now, you're playing the victim card. That's not how this works. Give respect and take respect.

If you accuse people of fearmongering, they can also accuse you of being a government shill. You accused me of being selfish toward the plight of those who have had business setbacks - a clear guilt-trip attempt.

Finally, there's your false equivalence argument between governments and private corporations. Corporations can be regulated by the government but who regulates the government? You're willing to give up information about yourself simply because some corporations happen to take it anyway. That just gives credence to the slippery slope that everyone is talking about. u/SirPalat already explained this in detail but you continue to repeat this misrepresentation of the truth.",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-14 00:38:46,CarefulCrow3,4

430,gj4moi8,t1_gj4l0th,"@1 Not really though, he was the one who said that first, actually, so I used it back at him. I think the mod deleted his comments, though. Like I said, I gave a critique of his idea alone at first.

@2 That was a statement in general made towards people who, which I specified just now, specifically said in other threads that they would do things to spite the government even if it did threaten public well-being. I think that was justified, and I'm sorry if you were not one of those people.

@3 Ah, maybe I misrepresented my opinion. I don't care if either one takes this data - maybe there's something you can do with my location data, but I personally do not care what they do with it. Did I plot against the government or peddle drugs? And do you want to use my data to plot consumer trends? I simply don't mind, take it if you want. My point was, if I wasn't bothered by the former why did you think I'd be bothered by the latter? Something along those lines.",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-14 00:51:17,BEaSTGiN,0

432,gj4qaj5,t1_gj4moi8,"If the mod had removed any comments in the original thread, I'd see the ""Deleted"" artifact. Your comments about public well-being may well have been targeted at others but your reply was to my comment.

Your data is your own. You are free to give it away with or without your consent. That's your prerogative. My issue is with you not allowing others to keep their data safe and misrepresenting their concerns by labeling them as riots, fear-mongering and whatnot.

I did read the comments and considered them to be far-fetched, and I said so, simply because I don't consider location data something of a sensitive private statement. Like looking at all the 1984 comments and whatnot, I just found it rather hysterical. (The part about the sub being left was a misnomer, I think liberal was a better word choice. Corrected that. As you can tell, I'm not fond of liberal ideology, and the sub seems to be, so I just said so. I do have the right to say I don't like it, don't I?)",t3_kvnrut,2021-01-14 01:29:36,BEaSTGiN,1
435,gj4ylgz,t1_gj4rt5l,"You have the right to say you disagree with an ideology and state relevant points. That's fair. You don't have the right to mislabel anything. Liberalism is a broad term that encompasses several things. By that logic, you yourself are a liberal because you obviously believe in gender and racial equality. Stop labeling people, especially if you don't know what the terms mean. 🤭

Also on the point of what location data can be used for, believe me when I tell you that the data can be used to make people's lives easier and can also be used to oppress people even without any ill intent. People think and act differently when they know that they are being surveiled. History has proven time and time again that this data can and will be misused at some point down the road.

I'm sure a few folks may be quoting 1984 without ever having read it. I'll grant you that there's some hyperbole here since 1984 is a dystopian fiction novel. That being said, many see the book as a warning. The erosion of your privacy won't happen in a day. There won't be a spillover event. It'll happen over years of apathy and bad judgement calls. People being critical of TT are expressing their opinion just as you have a right to do yours. Everyone on this sub is not being hysterical. There are people being candidly upset about a reneged promise.
