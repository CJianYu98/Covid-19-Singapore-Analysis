One of the criticisms against EN that I'm seeing is that people are saying that because the system is decentralised, people have the choice to not report that they're infected to the app (for whatever reason), making EN ineffective as it's on the onus of the user to self-report. However I think that this criticism is half-assed at best. Whether we're using EN or the TraceTogether App or the token, the onus is on the user to install the app and carry the token around.

At the end of the day we can quibble over semantics day in and day out on why so and so will or will not work; what I am still not seeing is the government proactively taking steps to guarantee our privacy. If the government wants us to “do the right thing” while simultaneously trusting them then the government needs to do a lot more in guaranteeing that contact tracing data will only ever be used for contact tracing.

PDPA is as good as out of the window right now (and as far as I am aware the government is exempt from PDPA anyway), and I’m not convinced that the OSA is actually on our side. For example: is it considered contravening the OSA if an order comes from the top to utilise contract tracing data for anything other than contact tracing? Are we supposed to believe empty promises that it’ll never happen?

If the government is really so adamant that they’re never going to abuse any contact tracing data, then make it law. Just like how last-minute legislations have been made to tackle COVID, there needs to be purpose-specific legislation to guarantee our privacy during these difficult times. Enact laws that explicitly state that contact tracing data may only be used for contact tracing. Enact laws prohibiting ANYONE — even civil servants, the police, and ministers — from using the data for any other purpose. Enact laws that guarantee harsh minimum penalties for anyone who misuses contact tracing data and anyone who authorities such misuse.

Until such laws are in place, it’s going to be very difficult swallowing any ministerial statement about how our privacy is in safe hands and the data will never be abused and so on. Show some accountability for once.",t3_h9bib2,2020-06-15 20:16:18,DecayingSelf,-8

22,fuxbu9m,t1_fuw2imk,"lol, this sub is erratic in the downvotes, pay them no mind. 

Let's pretend that Alice and Bob recently met up and Alice just found out that she has Covid-19.     
From what I understand the way TraceTogether works in centralised contact tracing. In this case, the govt would be able to pull your past contact logs - meaning govt will know that Alice has been in contact with Bob, and will be able to serve Bob a Quarantine Order. The govt knows that Alice infected Bob, but Bob would not know.
      
On the other side we have EN which works in decentralised contact tracing. Once Alice is infected, she'll send her info to the cloud - not her past contact logs, just her anonymised identifier. EN will gather all the identifiers of people who are recently infected and compile a list. Bob's app will then download the list and scan if there are anybody on the list that is within his recent contacts. Bob would then be notified that someone in his recent contacts has been infected and that he'd have to self-isolate. Since Alice didn't upload her past contacts, and Bob didn't upload his past contacts, there is no way that the govt would know that Alice infected Bob, in fact, the govt wouldn't know who Alice and Bob are in the first place.

This ""problem"" isn't even app specific. If you've got an iphone, if bluetooth is turned on, in your bluetooth settings it will say ""Now discoverable as ""John Public's iPhone"""". Now if people were to put some devices that just scan for and try to connect to bluetooth on peoples phones and log those names, that is the extent of this ""privacy issue"".

You could go sit at a certain place, and sit on your bluetooth setting page and write down every bluetooth device name that your phone finds. Do this every day, and you'll quickly find the bluetooth name of the people that regularly frequent that spot. Boom, *long term tracking*.
