> Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, Vivian Balakrishnan, takes full responsibility for the ""consternation"" and ""anxiety"" caused by the revelation that TraceTogether data can be used for police investigations.

> Vivian said this in Parliament today (February 2), while giving his speech during the second reading of the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill.

> TraceTogether is privacy-protecting by design: Vivian

> Highlighting the importance of contact tracing, Vivian explained that TraceTogether is ""fundamentally privacy-protecting by design"".

> ""TraceTogether only collects proximity data, which is necessary to identify close contacts. TraceTogether does not collect GPS location nor movement data. Furthermore, the app and the token only keep a temporary record, in an encrypted form, locally on the device. The data is automatically purged after 25 days. The Government also intends to deactivate TraceTogether, along with other digital contact tracing programmes, once the pandemic is over.""

> On using TraceTogether data in the investigation of severe crimes, Vivian said that it would be ""unconscionable to inhibit the ability of the Police to act, when it comes to a serious offence that affects someone’s life or safety"".

> ""It would not be right – in fact it would be untenable – to adopt a purist ideological stance and deliberately refuse to check that data.""

> Some important points to note about TraceTogether data

> The rest of his speech touched on four key thrusts of the Amendment Bill, which you might want be apprised of:

> Firstly, the personal contact tracing data defined in the legislation covers entry or exit records, proximity information and other data collected using any digital contact tracing tools.

> Digital contract tracing tools here include TraceTogether, SafeEntry as well as BluePass (a private sector contact tracing system which can be interoperable with TraceTogether).

> Second, aside from contact tracing, the TraceTogether data can only be used for investigations or criminal proceedings of serious crimes. There are seven categories of serious crimes:

> Third, the Government cannot use the data for any purpose other than those mentioned above, regardless of any other written law requiring or allowing the disclosure of the data.

> ""This will give added assurance that there are no further scenarios where public agencies may use the data apart from the purposes stated in this Bill,"" said Vivian.

> Lastly, there is a clause in the BIll which allows the Minister to specify a date after which a digital contact tracing system is no longer required to prevent or control the spread of Covid-19. Personal contact tracing data must then be deleted.

It’s also convenient that the government actually comes out ahead after this screw-up. If he were truly willing to take full responsibility, the government would have declared that all data collected this way would not be used for any investigations whatsoever.

Even our Asian tech giants and startups aren't working on interesting problems. No one wants to graduate with a CS degree to work on Gojek's or Grab's superapp to help people order diapers. Where's the security company that's using knowledge graphs to find security vulnerabilities? Where's the internet browser company working on the next Chrome-killer?

Let’s say you are hiring for Google and you need 50 Developers in Singapore. Let’s say fresh grads.

Nus computing takes in on average about 500 each year. Let’s assume 100% graduation rate and NTU also about the same, with other private unis adding another 500. So let’s say every year we have 1500 new people in computing. Let’s say 70% stay in software related roles (an optimistic number) so  about 1000 possible people. 

Now obviously Google doesn’t just take everyone but it takes very good people. Let’s say the top 10%. So of 1000, only 100 have what it takes to get into Google.

But then, Google is also fighting with other A names like Facebook, grab, etc. So let’s say FB also need 50, grab 50. So 150 jobs and only 100 candidates who will make the Cut. 

What do you do? Do you lower the bar for entry? Ok, this is possible, but it is unlikely you can force a company to hire someone they don’t want.  Plus, it’s not practical in the Long run. Do you ask your universities to churn out more grads? Ok, possible, but that takes time. 

Uncomfortable truth is at the bleeding edge of technology Singapore is too small to produce enough talent and big companies will want to look further afield for talent.

If you are talking about ""full-stack"" web development, CS theory beyond the basics doesn't really value-add that much in day-to-day work. In fact, self-respecting CS depts don't really teach ""vocational"" stuff like webdev partly because the any teaching material will get outdated quickly. You would either have to self-learn, learn on the job or attend a bootcamp ;D. 

If you are talking about stuff like compiler engineering or OS kernel development then I would agree. But there aren't that many jobs available in those fields.",t3_jjet69,2020-10-29 14:31:54,golemarms,1

But I do think my point stands and you haven’t really presented a strong case that outside of our formal education there are going to be a lot of bootstrappers who are good enough to make the grade in FAANG type companies, or their tech equivalent. 

The difference is that people who actually spend 4 years doing CS are more likely to have the interest and aptitude for it, and have much more exposure through school projects/internships/peer influence and consultation. How many boot camps do you think gives the equivalent? I doubt very many boot camps are that great anyway.

Every occupation is going to have a bell curve of talent, and top companies take the best talent. Are there going to be a couple of these self taught guys made good? Of course. I don’t think that number is going to be very high though.",t3_jjet69,2020-10-29 15:25:22,ghostofwinter88,1

There are lots of potential sources of FAANG-grade talent other than CS fresh grads. Bootcampers (the really top ones), bright kids from other related courses, masters/ Phds (CS or otherwise) grads, singaporeans returning from overseas  studies etc. I obviously don't have the exact numbers, but I would think these are non-trivial sources of potential talent.

500 for undergrad CS in SMU, Yale-NUS, SUTD, Digipen, SUSS etc. maybe. But you didn't take into account the Computing/ software engineering Masters/ Phd people/ returning CS grads (arguably higher hit-rate than local undergrad cs, maybe 500 a year?), or bootcampers/ self-learners looking to break into the field (lower hit-rate than undergrad cs, but MUCH greater in quantity).

Where is the commitment from the government, enshrined in law, that they can only use it in the manner they've stated?

SafeEntry only logs entry & exit. Granted that it also helps in contact tracing efforts by logging who enters & exits a particular place.

Singapore is trying to open up progressively in safe manner. We can say that present measures are adequate if we remain at status quo now, but I don't think it will be adequate if we open our borders.

I wholeheartedly agree with this, but the ""opening up more"" they're currently talking about changes little too. Letting us have 8 rather than 5 people on a table - wowee! 

Things that would make me happier (and I'm aware this isn't remotely a factor they would consider, I'm just saying what would make it feel ""more normal"" for me):

* no mask unless inside a building/vehicle

* reduce limits on table sizes (I'm not sure what's sensible here, but permitting 10 people + doesn't seem that risky)

* reopening of bars with whatever level of safe distancing rules etc enforced

* remove the 10:30 shut off - move it back to midnight like Hong Kong

As you can see, most of my interests are around entertainment and bars, as that's one of the few enjoyments we're still able to have at the moment. I'd really love some green lanes to places like Vietnam or Thailand that are operable for a short break; travel has always been high on my list of priorities and I'm going a bit stir crazy going to the same places day-in-day-out.

Anyway, my list is largely irrelevant, the Gahmen will continue to plod on with their plans for reopening and we'll be forced to cart this token around whether I/we like it or not.

Open Trace is the framework responsible for underlying data storage and interaction and that is open source. As you pointed out, this has not undergone changes since May so there's no change in the storage mechanism.

All the other updates to TT have been to enable SafeEntry and similar features but it doesn't change the way the underlying data is stored nor the mechanism for data exchange happens.

The linked article does not address whether it's possible for a malicious entity to somehow trigger or schedule an upload.

If the Android code was open source, a [direct-from-source compilation](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Reproducible_Builds/) could be made available on [F-Droid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid), which would assuage the worries of anyone _really_ concerned about privacy.

Since we're using taxpayers' dollars to fund its development, I think it would contribute positively to how sceptics view the Singapore government, and the world's perception of Singapore as a tech hub, if the actual app source code gets published.

520,gabv5aa,t1_gaaj2m4,"> The linked article does not address whether it's possible for a malicious entity to somehow trigger or schedule an upload.

The linked article does mention all the online data transport the app engages in. So if the app was DESIGNED to send information out maliciously, this can be identified using a check of the underlying framework OpenTrace / BlueTrace (open sourced by the TT team) or network sniffing or reverse engineering of the apk. 

>What stood out to me immediately was the absence of backend host strings (e.g. api.myawesomeapp.com) or API calls, which is (almost) always the first thing to look out for when inspecting applications. Developers of applications with significant resources or risk typically harden their applications by packaging critical functionality such as encryption and data transport in low level libraries and calling them via JNI, effectively protecting critical functionality from inspection with basic tooling and script kiddies.
>However, that’s not the case with TraceTogether: all online functionality was pointing to Firebase SDK, from User Authentication via OTP (PhoneAuthProvider) to records uploading with Firebase Storage.



And that's not hard to do and in fact it's done for a lot of controversial apps like TikTok to find out what endpoints it's sending data to. 

https://www.cscjournals.org/manuscript/Journals/IJCSS/Volume14/Issue2/IJCSS-1552.pdf

If TraceTogether was DESIGNED to send this kind of data without the user's consent (i.e. other than an explicit manual action when a user is detected as a COVID patient), it can easily be found out. 

As far someone outside the development team maliciously gaining access and sending the device specific data - open sourcing of the apk code is NOT going to show you that. A third party maliciously gaining access and making sense of the data are also extremely unlikely and even if they do get access to that encrypted local storage data that stores nothing but temporary IDs associated with the phone exchanges rather than actual phone numbers, there's very little a third party hacker can do with that data unless they are able to decrypt it and gain access to the actual phone numbers behind ALL temporary IDs across all devices. 

>Australia seems to have no problem open-sourcing — and keeping updated! — their app, which is built on BlueTrace/OpenTrace: here's their iOS repo, and their Android repo.

Also, strange that you bring up Australia's app as an example of transparency and privacy. Independent study by the MIT Technology Review scores Australia low on transparency and privacy of the data collected and sent.

An app that is built straight from an open source repo, and installed from something like F-Droid, _might_ have enough eyes on it that any such malicious code wouldn't be possible, and the assurance that the installed app is exactly what is in the published codebase.

It's funny you are talking about looking at the weight and quality of the evidence, as clearly the people who recommended ""Healthy do not need masks"" did not do that.

Which is exactly the point I am making.

Remsdesvir was never ever proven to be greatly effective at all. The best studies only shown that it shortens recovery by a couple of days. It is recommended because the drug is proven to do no harm to humans, so why not give Remsdesvir a shot to those who are dying of Covid?

Following the Remsdesvir line of logic, doctors should try out recommending masks for everyone until it is proven not effective, as wearing masks isn't harmful to humans at all.

636,gah22ig,t1_gah1eq4,"Oh come on. A meta-analysis IS a study which summarizes previous studies to provide some sort of idea on a particular directionality of effect. At the point in time where the first mask policy came into effect, these meta-analyses were not around yet. Was MOH supposed to come up with their own meta-analysis in a few days? These meta-analyses take some time to do.

Even in Chaabna et al (2020), they acknowledged that ""The randomized clinical trials (high-level evidence) assessing the effectiveness of medical facemask use to prevent transmission of respiratory infections in community settings were conducted in closed settings with high transmission risk of respiratory infections (e.g. households and university dormitories). No trial studied medical facemask use effectiveness to prevent transmission of respiratory infections in open areas.""

They further added: ""At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO did not recommend facemask use in community settings, on the basis that ‘no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons’ (World Health Organization, 2020). However, on 5th June 2020, WHO issued updated guidance about medical and cloth facemask use in areas with ongoing widespread community transmission and where physical distancing is difficult to implement e.g. public transportation, shops, etc. They recommend that countries should encourage the general population to wear facemasks in the aforementioned settings (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020). Since medical facemasks are a critical resource for healthcare workers, the WHO clarifies that when medical facemasks are in shortage, these must be reserved for frontline workers and at-risk individuals.""

Following that, they wrote: ""Healthcare professionals are a population at a higher risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 as they can be more often in close contact with infected individuals. In addition to protecting the healthcare workforce itself, prioritizing the allocation of medical facemasks to HCWs might also be a strategy to reduce nosocomial transmission of the virus.""

So again, going back to the strategy by the G at that particular point in time, when balancing the evidence with potential shortage of masks for medical workers, it was a sound policy. And that was my argument, that it was SOUND policy AT THAT TIME. 

I ask the IV/DV question because the other studies you cited very obviously missed the point, and illustrates your lack of knowledge in the area. They are not scary terms. Basically, face mask use is the outcome being studied in those other studies you cited. They were not studies looking at the effectiveness of face mask use.

They were making fun of the WHO  not recommending facemask use in community settings, on the basis  that ‘no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick  persons’ .

Finally, when everything is exhausted, you try the lame old ""It was a sound policy because they were conserving masks for healthcare workers.""

A point was raised about what's stopping the police from going to TT at the very first available instance and that point wasn't addressed either.

Vivian also tried to play to the compassionate card to try to compel people's sensibilities to comply but honestly I don't have much confidence in his words either. He told everyone that TT would he voluntarily and would only be used for a very specific use case; both of which had since been proven wrong.

I believe that other than clearly defining 'serious crimes' in legislation, there is another compromise that they can easily achieve without too much work: **Publicly announce every time they requested for TT data for investigations** and WHAT crime it is, as well as explaining WHY it was necessary whether be it due to insufficient evidence or there being still some reasonable doubt of the suspect's guilt.

> ""My simple conclusion, or inference, is that Singaporeans know that I misspoke, but they also trust the TraceTogether system is safe — it does what it is supposed to do, it protects public health. And they also trust the police to always behave lawfully.""

> Previously said that data would only be for contact tracing purposes

> Back in June 2020, Vivian had said that TraceTogether data would only be accessed for contacting tracing purposes.

> In Parliament on Jan. 5, Vivian admitted that he ""had not thought of the CPC when [he] spoke [earlier]"".

> Requesting for data to be deleted

> For people who wish to have their TraceTogether data deleted, it is possible to send in a request.

> However, data will be deleted automatically every 25 days, unless it is part of an open cluster or used in an ongoing investigation or court proceeding involving one of the seven serious offences.

> As for people ""gaming"" the system by downloading the TraceTogether app but turning off Bluetooth to render it non-functional, Vivian reminded everyone that the programme is meant to protect themselves and their loved ones.

> SINGAPORE - The wearable device for contact tracing in development by the Government to help curb the spread of Covid-19 will not track an individual's location, and those who prefer to use Singapore's contact-tracing app TraceTogether will still be able to do so.

> The device, which may be issued to everyone here, will be a small device that people can slip into their bag or pocket, said Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan.

> Dr Balakrishnan gave these updates on Sunday (June 7) in the comments thread of a post on his Facebook page, where he had shared a video of him talking in Parliament on June 5 about the device, which may be issued to everyone here.

> The announcement of this device comes after news that TraceTogether, which identifies people in close contact with a coronavirus patient via wireless Bluetooth technology, does not work well with Apple devices.

> The app is useful when those infected cannot recall whom they had been in proximity with for an extended period, but it has not been popular here.

> Dr Balakrishnan, who is also the Foreign Minister, earlier said that about 1.5 million users have downloaded the TraceTogether app since it was launched in March, which works out to only a quarter of Singapore's population.

> This falls short of the optimum number of users needed for the app to work well - which is about three-quarters of the population.

> Responding to concerns that Facebook user Justin Herson had about the device being developed, Dr Balakrishnan said it will not be a tracking device and will not track an individual's location.

> He said: ""It acts as a personal diary, uses Bluetooth proximity data to collate prolonged close contacts.""

> The data in the personal device is encrypted, automatically erased after 25 days and never leaves the device unless the person is infected.

> ""If and only if that happens, then the data is used by authorised contact tracers to find people who may have inadvertently been infected by you,"" Dr Balakrishnan added.

> In another reply, this time to Facebook user Sylvester Zhuo, Dr Balakrishnan said that the thinking behind the device is that there are still people here without a smartphone, or whose smartphone does not work well with the app.

> The device will be able to communicate with TraceTogether and allow the Government to include as many people as possible to maximise public health.

> Responding to requests from user Simon Sin to make the device multi-purpose or to be able to replace TransitLink transport cards, credits cards or company entry passes, Dr Balakrishnan said that he is reluctant to do so as the device's battery should last ""many months"".

> After his announcement of the device on June 5, a petition called ""Singapore says 'No' to wearable devices for Covid-19 contact tracing"" was started by Mr Wilson Low that day.

> In three days, the petition, which rejects the development of this contact-tracing device, has been signed by almost 30,000 people.

> When asked what spurred him to start the petition, the self-employed man said he noticed that many of his friends on social media had shared concerns about privacy and surveillance, and he wanted to give an avenue for them to have their voices heard.

> ""I had no idea that it would get so much attention in such a short time. I am surprised at the response it has received,"" said Mr Low, 37.

> On its Facebook page, opposition party Singapore People's Party on Sunday released a statement by assistant secretary-general Ariffin Sha to express its concerns about data that would be collected by these devices, and called for the Government to ""tread with utmost caution and regard for the privacy of Singaporeans"".

> Mr Bryan Tan, a lawyer from Pinsent Masons MPillay specialising in technology law and data protection, said the device will likely overcome the hardware issues currently associated with contact tracing and that the designers will be implementing privacy by design and take it into account even while putting it together, just like how they have done so with TraceTogether.

> The app also does not collect or use users' location data, but records only whom they might have been close to, and Mr Tan said the new device will likely function in the same way.

> ""I do not see a need to change the position of storing physical locations automatically. There could be an opportunity to build in more features, for instance, a SafeEntry link to allow users to enter locations even easier,"" said Mr Tan, referring to the Government's digital check-in system for contact-tracing purposes.

This is a Bluetooth contact tracing device that performs handshake and records the other such devices that you have come into contact for long periods of time, it runs on a battery.

With no internet connection it is not realistic to perform location tracking unless permanent points are set up every several metres to ""capture"" the handshake of your device which I would argue, can already be achieved by security cameras all over Singapore.

What this means to me is that a user's movement pattern cannot be extracted unless every single device is collected, all of the data exported and analysed. The data remains encrypted and local to your device.

Network and GPS connected services such as Google Maps would have greater potential to track the movement of a user. The only thing keeping people assured about such services is that they are non-mandatory, and Google's promise of ""protecting your privacy""

People are right to be worried, but I also think that many of those reactions, in retrospect, now seem to be over the top and a little silly.

Secondly: And someone please correct me here if I’m wrong, so if my token is collecting data of everyone else’s nearby tokens and it’s possible for MOH to find out who I have been near by looking at the data in my token, what’s to stop the government from planting tokens at locations which have data fed live back to their servers thereby establishing who has passed by a given area.

Sure, this would require them to plant beacons in all areas of interests but that’s a bloody small cost compared to the sheer number of tokens they’re planning on giving to everyone anyway.

And if for example they REALLY want to know if you’ve been near a person of interest, what’s to stop them from seizing the token from said person of interest and then checking if you’ve been nearby?

To say “it can’t track you” is nonsense because if it truly couldn’t track you then the device would be useless. It most certainly can track you, maybe not directly, but indirectly.

I did a bit of reading and digging. Turns out you are actually right, if assuming the tracking device follows BlueTrace's specifications, which TraceTogether is based on. I've corrected my post.

>The difference between this and CCTV is speed and scale. If they decide to implement listening devices at points of interests such as at HDB lift lobbies, they can just run a DB query and find out who visited and who went out. No need to go through CCTV footage.

Using existing CCTV footage and machine learning, it's already possible to analyse and index everything into a db. It'll might arguably be more accurate, since there's actual visual confirmation. Check out 'video analytics' on google.

Of course, that's not to say that they cannot enhance this data further with the bluetooth bracelets, it'll just.. undermine the COVID19 tracking purpose and backfire on it when people simply choose not to wear it.

Firstly, u/KawaiiSumo only gave one example, not two (unless it was edited). 

Secondly, it is fairly obvious that burning your house down is bad but this new tracing capability is not so clear cut as bad because there are some pros about it that can be argued and privacy is not as big a thing here as in the West. Also, it is quite unimaginable that the tracing idea has not been weighed, debated and discussed by VB and his team before coming to the public. So to compare it with a rash decision like burning a house down is quite silly if you ask me.

>As for your second one, I'm not bothering to explain.

Thirdly, I'd like you to take more time thinking about the 'second' example instead of brushing it aside because if you ponder about it, u/KawaiiSumo's last sentence meant that just because those countries succeeded in controlling the spread without needing to use tracing capabilities, we should not blindly follow them too..which implies that we need to rationalize and consider various solutions carefully...which is similar to what you advocated,

It’s why the app no longer has a battery saving mode.

This thing will only work with TraceTogether and the wearable, so it doesn't make sense for it to exist before. Also, there are other technological means that are already out there that the government can use to track your movement, but it's much more difficult.

I am not saying that the government has the intention of doing so, but if I am the government, and if I can make the wearable mandatory, I would first replace scanning ICs at malls/supermarkets with listener devices. I can justify this by saying that it reduces risk of infection because now there's no need for officers to be stationed there. If this works out, then I would consider expanding it to other points of interests such as HDB lobbies if I want to track who goes out and visits.",t3_gyskbq,2020-06-09 03:53:18,issuetissue,1

Basically the situation as of a few days ago was that nobody with an Iphone would be using TraceTogether, because it can't run in the background. That's like nearly 50% of smartphones in Singapore. Then many Android users also won't bother with TraceTogether, because they know that half of their contacts would be missed. 

It's the kind of thing where the more people use it, the more useful it is to those who use it, so more people will use it.

If primary school kids, elderly without smartphones, and others who are willing to be traced but don't have smartphones use these devices, then hopefully 75% can be reached altogether.

961,ftciwhw,t1_ftchrha,"I get what you mean. For context: Children may have limited verbal resources, may feel powerless, or may not have developed the skills to recognise their emotions, and this results in behaviour that some adults call 'acting up' or 'being naughty'. Most of the time, when children engage in 'bad' behaviour, it's an expression of stress or being taught different expectations. 

Back to what you mean - I still disagree that we should liken politicians who are being reumnerated for their education, skills and their work to 'bad children'. One is a group that agreed to a set of laws and ethics to receive remuneration for their education, skills and work performed--and they too have the power to impact those laws. The choice to be irresponsible and deceitful was done actively and purposefully, often with the enablement of others, with the goal to empower themselves. The other group (children) is essentially powerless in the face of regulations, have way fewer cognitive, emotional and physical capabilities to understand the ramifications on themselves and others, and if we take the science into consideration, their bad behaviour is triggered by events and incidents.",t3_gyskbq,2020-06-08 15:09:48,usherer,-5
