I'd be cautious repeating this as it is highly unlikely that this was an imported case - most likely source would be a local seller or buyer who had contact with the board. 

""""At present, it is hard to determine the infection source in the market,"" Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.

""We cannot conclude that salmon is the source of infection just because novel coronavirus was detected on a chopping board of a seller,"" the expert said, adding that the chopping board could be contaminated by infected owner or guests, or other products that carried the virus.""

""However, the virus can survive on the surface of an object for hours to a few days, and chilled salmon was transported by air in a low temperature, under which condition ""it is theoretically possible for the virus to survive, but the possibility is low,"" said Zhong.""

Why? I'm more hopeful because so many people are trying to make cures. The hard truth is that most experimental medical treatments don't work the first time. Even if a given treatment will eventually work (some will never work), it may need years of refining.

IIRC 5 days is the mean and 14 days will capture 98%. There were some outliners in China who went longer. SARS-CoV-2 also appears to be a stable virus that has not mutated much so far that there is hope a single vaccine will work against all the strains.",t3_h9urgn,2020-06-16 18:11:12,bonkers05,2
