No biggie because it's worth the risk for some. The price they pay is small compared to the negative externalities that others incur. That's why some are calling for harsh penalties for not seeking medical attention despite having some covid-19 symptoms - to better reflect the costs incurred by the larger society.",t3_kz8efj,2021-01-18 09:18:46,Calikura,15

Slightly more people can go to attractions. There's a higher mall/shop capacity but it seems to me that malls stopped limiting capacity before Phase 2 ended. Other than that, Phase 3 just allows for larger religious congregations, ceremonies, and live performances.
