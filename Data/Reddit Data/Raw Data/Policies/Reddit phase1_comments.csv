I'd like to think that even the Singapore government understands that more than three months without meeting partners or virtually anyone out their households is ridiculous and almost unheard of elsewhere.

These claims of an uptick causing a rollback... nobody thinks that the virus has been eradicated, and if that's the goal we'd be in lockdown until a vaccine that may never come. Of course cases will go back up; the idea is to prevent the case load from going out of control. Seems we've already achieved that, but extending this phase beyond four weeks would cause any remaining perception of them being reasonable would evaporate.",t3_gp2qc1,2020-05-23 19:04:48,tariqabjotu,133
1,frjyd3v,t3_gp2qc1,"There are a few scenarios I can think of:

1. Govt listens to trade associations kpkb-ing about losing money (completely justified), opens up 2 weeks into phase 1. Govt listens to the public kpkb-ing about not meeting their SOs, friends, mental health suffering (again, completely justified) and sets up social bubble policy (where people can register 1/2 people to visit.) Everyone is happy.
2. Govt doesn't listen and phase 1 continues for 4 weeks. Phase 2 is very very slowly implemented, ie. very few businesses start opening at a time, people's livelihoods are still affected, but at least some progress is made. A few businesses close and/or file bankruptcy anyway. People are allowed to visit a registered small number of people and their mental health improves. 
3. Govt doesn't listen AND phase 1 is extended. The dams of resentment finally burst and there is an outpouring of complaints. Businesses close and/or file bankruptcy. Election doesn't look pretty for PAP.

75,frmcimw,t1_frm3fap,"Let me preface this by saying that, despite how long this is, I largely agree with you. And I think the government's capriciousness makes this hard to predict with a high degree of accuracy. Nevertheless, in my thought process:

> The Singapore gov has done bizzare things which no other countries have done : such as no-mask when every country is already doing it, and letting in tourists even when Europe's infection rates are soaring.

The no-mask policy may have been unusual in Southeast or East Asia (or was it?), but it wasn't something no other country was doing.

Also, Singapore was actually quite ahead of the curve on travel restrictions all along. For China, they were one of the first, in a handful of countries that did it at all. Then in March, the broader travel restrictions were so rapidly introduced globally, it's hard to argue that they were behind. For example, the EU was up in arms over the US's travel restrictions on the Schengen Area (at a time when Europe was way ahead of the US in number of cases)... only for their countries to institute a *global* travel ban maybe five days later.

At the beginning of March, the idea of global travel bans seemed unimaginable; by the end of March, dozens upon dozens of countries were doing it. In retrospect, perhaps they should have been instituted earlier (and, to that, I think they were too late to even accomplish much), but the world, as a whole, seemed to act too late, based on the (faulty and incomplete) information it had and the fixation on China.

> In Singapore, the gov can extend CB for 7 more months. What can Singaporeans do, except lament on social media? LOL

Yeah, I know the government can do whatever it wants. I'm merely making a guess; I, of course, can be completely wrong.

I am giving the government the benefit of doubt here (even though I was already annoyed by the nature of this ""Phase 1"" reopening thing). By the end of June, it seems Singapore will still be on near lockdown, while most of the rest of the world has moved on. Even hard-hit countries not led by Donald Trump, like Spain and Italy, will be open to at least regional tourists... while Singapore with only a handful of community cases prohibits people from socializing with other households in open-air? Absurd.

I firmly feel the length of this circuit breaker/lockdown/'safe reopening' is based on Singapore trying to salvage its image after losing its standing in combating the pandemic. But if they're going to continue to size themselves up against the rest of the world, barring a change of circumstances elsewhere (or in Singapore) that allows the SG government to smugly say they were right, Singapore is going to look so out of step from the rest of the world by the end of June that that might result in a different kind of embarrassment.

> You've to understand that the people making decisions in SG are not your everyday Singaporean. They live in an alternate reality, parallel universe where they don't see the same world we do. Besides, these ministers are already married with kids, why and what does it matter to them if you can't meet your gf/bf?

I do agree with this in that the decision-makers are unable to personally relate to those without live-in partners or who live alone, because the decision-makers are likely not in these circumstances. The Phase 1 concessions are so largely family-oriented, disregarding the fact that many people's lives are not structured that way.

But at the same time, surely they can't be completely devoid of empathy. And they surely have friends or other people outside their household of concern. Or perhaps they might be spurred on by the economic angle.

> Even till now, the gov is still taking about ""waiting for a vaccine"".

Yes, this does raise questions. But, then again, Phase 3 is so close to normal life – with cinemas, bars, and clubs open. I guess no sporting events, concerts, or other very large gatherings?
