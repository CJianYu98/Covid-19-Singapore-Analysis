> SINGAPORE: Member of Parliament Seah Kian Peng has explained why he was out and about at his constituency on Sunday (Apr 26), after netizens questioned his Facebook post that said he was ""playing the role of a safe distancing ambassador"".

> 

> The Marine Parade GRC MP raised eyebrows after he said that he spoke to residents at coffee shops and at a wet market.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Netizens questioned if he was keeping to stay-at-home requirements during the ""circuit breaker"" period, and some pointed out that he was without the red armbands and passes worn by safe distancing ambassadors.

> Others noted that the People's Action Party had announced earlier this month that it would suspend ground engagements and face-to-face Meet-The-People sessions.

> In response to CNA queries, Mr Seah said he has been working from home ""almost the entire week"", and that he was out on Sunday as he had to sign some documents at the community club.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""I also went to check on how things were at the two FairPrice supermarkets in vicinity (this is part of my job to find out from time to time how operations were and situation is on the ground),"" said Mr Seah, who is also group CEO of NTUC FairPrice.

> ""At same time as I walked through the estate, I would pass by the kopitiams in (the) estate, wet market too. And I thus made those observations. At all times observing safe distancing rules. Based on what I saw, happy that things are all in order,"" he explained.

> ""One or two merchants in wet market had some feedback for me as well. All short conversations. Another two residents who saw me had some enquiries for me which I gave them my advice accordingly. All parties concerned observed the safe distancing rules.""

> 

> As part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, authorities have asked residents to stay at home except for essential activities such as to buy food or groceries. Even then, people should go out alone and not in groups. It is compulsory to wear masks once they leave their homes.

> Safe distancing ambassadors have been appointed to remind people of these rules. Those who do not comply will be issued a fine.

> In his Facebook post on Sunday, Mr Seah said he observed that compliance with safe distancing measures was high, and temperature screening and crowd control measures were in place at popular places like supermarkets and wet markets.

> ""Take care and stay safe,"" he wrote, adding hashtags like #socialdistancing and #walkabout.

> 

> Responding to online criticism of his post, Mr Seah told CNA on Monday: ""I hope we don’t politicise this matter. It appears that some are clearly wanting to do so.""

> 

> He added: ""If people want to volunteer as a SDA (safe distancing ambassador), it takes a few hours a day and some of them especially during the initial period had it rough. So it is work for them.

> ""Let’s focus on what we all need to do. And work as a team whether you are part of those providing essential services or WFH. If I can make a call out, I hope all of us make things easy for the essential workers and also SDA and let us continue to show our appreciation to all those who are going to work day in, day out to provide these essential services for us.""

> 

> Another MP, Liang Eng Hwa of Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, also posted about being a safe distancing ambassador on Sunday. He was seen wearing a yellow vest like the other ambassadors.

> Mr Liang wrote: ""Joined as one of the Safe Distancing Ambassador (SDA) this evening. With the exception of a few, by and large residents are in compliant of the circuit breaker measures.""

> SINGAPORE - A safe distancing ambassador was fined $300 for not wearing a mask while he was conducting surveillance checks at a shopping mall, after photos of him failing to wear the mask were shared on social media.

> In response to media queries, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) said on Saturday (April 18) that it had deployed the safe distancing ambassador to conduct surveillance checks at shopping malls.

> Based on its investigations, the man had gone to the restroom during his break and forgot to put his mask on after leaving it, which was when the photos were taken.

> The images of the safe distancing ambassador not wearing his mask were taken at White Sands shopping mall on Wednesday and posted by Facebook user Daniel Wong.

> The man is seen talking to another safe distancing ambassador, who is wearing a mask, and riding on an escalator with him. The Facebook post with the photos, which was uploaded on Thursday, has been shared about 850 times as of early Saturday afternoon.

> ESG said that the man put on his mask immediately after other safe distancing ambassadors reminded him to do so.

> It added that it takes a serious view of such infringements and has issued a stern warning to the man, in addition to the $300 fine.

> ""This is consistent with the penalty imposed on individuals who are found not wearing a mask in public, as we expect our safe distancing ambassadors to uphold the same standards,"" it said, adding that the man has accepted the penalty and apologised for his mistake.

> ESG said it has reminded all safe distancing ambassadors about the requirement to wear masks at all times when they are not at home.

> SINGAPORE: Member of Parliament Seah Kian Peng has explained why he was out and about at his constituency on Sunday (Apr 26), after netizens questioned his Facebook post that said he was ""playing the role of a safe distancing ambassador"".

> 

> The Marine Parade GRC MP raised eyebrows after he said that he spoke to residents at coffee shops and at a wet market.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Netizens questioned if he was keeping to stay-at-home requirements during the ""circuit breaker"" period, and some pointed out that he was without the red armbands and passes worn by safe distancing ambassadors.

> Others noted that the People's Action Party had announced earlier this month that it would suspend ground engagements and face-to-face Meet-The-People sessions.

> In response to CNA queries, Mr Seah said he has been working from home ""almost the entire week"", and that he was out on Sunday as he had to sign some documents at the community club.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""I also went to check on how things were at the two FairPrice supermarkets in vicinity (this is part of my job to find out from time to time how operations were and situation is on the ground),"" said Mr Seah, who is also group CEO of NTUC FairPrice.

> ""At same time as I walked through the estate, I would pass by the kopitiams in (the) estate, wet market too. And I thus made those observations. At all times observing safe distancing rules. Based on what I saw, happy that things are all in order,"" he explained.

> ""One or two merchants in wet market had some feedback for me as well. All short conversations. Another two residents who saw me had some enquiries for me which I gave them my advice accordingly. All parties concerned observed the safe distancing rules.""

> 

> As part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, authorities have asked residents to stay at home except for essential activities such as to buy food or groceries. Even then, people should go out alone and not in groups. It is compulsory to wear masks once they leave their homes.

> Safe distancing ambassadors have been appointed to remind people of these rules. Those who do not comply will be issued a fine.

> In his Facebook post on Sunday, Mr Seah said he observed that compliance with safe distancing measures was high, and temperature screening and crowd control measures were in place at popular places like supermarkets and wet markets.

> ""Take care and stay safe,"" he wrote, adding hashtags like #socialdistancing and #walkabout.

> 

> Responding to online criticism of his post, Mr Seah told CNA on Monday: ""I hope we don’t politicise this matter. It appears that some are clearly wanting to do so.""

> 

> He added: ""If people want to volunteer as a SDA (safe distancing ambassador), it takes a few hours a day and some of them especially during the initial period had it rough. So it is work for them.

> ""Let’s focus on what we all need to do. And work as a team whether you are part of those providing essential services or WFH. If I can make a call out, I hope all of us make things easy for the essential workers and also SDA and let us continue to show our appreciation to all those who are going to work day in, day out to provide these essential services for us.""

> 

> Another MP, Liang Eng Hwa of Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, also posted about being a safe distancing ambassador on Sunday. He was seen wearing a yellow vest like the other ambassadors.

> Mr Liang wrote: ""Joined as one of the Safe Distancing Ambassador (SDA) this evening. With the exception of a few, by and large residents are in compliant of the circuit breaker measures.""

> Most of these advisories were issued to members of the public in hawker centres and markets, said the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) in a media release on Tuesday (Apr 7).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> MEWR said the breaches included failure to maintain safe distances when queuing or making payments by following floor markings. The ministry also cited a stallholder who was issued an advisory for selling drinks intended for dine-in at a hawker centre.

> Under the enhanced measures, F&B outlets are only allowed to offer takeaway or delivery services.

> Safe Distancing measures at Singapore's Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre on Apr 7, 2020. (Photo: MEWR)

> ""If a member of public is found in breach of these measures, an enforcement officer will issue a written advisory immediately,"" said MEWR.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""If the member of public does not comply or returns to commit the same offence, the enforcement officer will take down his or her particulars and issue a written stern warning. The police may also be contacted for follow-up action.""

> Under a new Bill passed in Parliament on Tuesday, first time offenders can be fined up to S$10,000 or imprisoned up to six months, or both. The penalty for second or subsequent offences is a fine of up to S$20,000 or imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.

> More than 2,000 Safe Distancing and SG Clean Ambassadors, and enforcement officers were sent to HDB estates across the island on Tuesday. The personnel were deployed in town centres, hawker centres, coffee shops, transport nodes, parks, and community clubs.

> SINGAPORE: The number of abuse cases against safe distancing enforcement officers and ambassadors has gone up since elevated measures kicked in, with multiple cases of abuse reported to the police in recent days, the authorities said on Friday (Apr 17).

> As of Thursday, the police have received 12 reports of members of the public physically or verbally abusing enforcement officers and ambassadors while they were carrying out their duties, said the Singapore Police Force and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources in a joint release.

> ""We will not tolerate this, and will take offenders to task,"" said the authorities.

> One of these cases involved a 40-year-old man, who headbutted an enforcement officer after he was told to stop playing basketball at a cordoned-off multi-purpose hall in Khatib.

> In another case on Wednesday along Havelock Road, a 79-year-old man punched an enforcement officer who told him to wear his face mask properly.

> Also on Wednesday, a 72-year-old man slapped an enforcement officer who asked for his particulars after he saw the man eating food at a hawker centre along Circuit Road.

> Other cases involved verbal abuse against officers.

> On Thursday, a 37-year-old man insulted a police officer who had fined his friend for not wearing a face mask outside The Cathay shopping mall.

> Meanwhile on Tuesday, a 35-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman ""hurled vulgarities"" at three safe distancing ambassadors who had told the man not to sit on a crossed-out seat at a hawker centre along Toa Payoh Lorong 5.

> Police investigations are ongoing.

> Anyone found guilty of using abusive language against a public servant could be jailed for up to 12 months, fined up to S$5,000, or both.

> Anyone who voluntarily causes hurt to deter a public servant from the discharge of their duty could be jailed for up to seven years, fined or caned.

> Those who use criminal force to deter a public servant from the discharge of their duty could be jailed for up to four years, fined or both.

> ""The police would like to remind members of the public that it is an offence not to furnish their personal particulars and residential address when required by an enforcement officer,"" added the release.

> The authorities also advised members of the public to take official identification with them when they leave the house.

> Since elevated safe distancing measures kicked in on Apr 7, as part of a ""circuit breaker"" to curb the spread of COVID-19, around 3,000 enforcement officers and ambassadors have been deployed daily to public places and Housing and Development Board estates across Singapore, said the authorities.

> Under the tighter precautions, non-essential workplaces and schools have closed across the island and strict physical distancing measures have been put in place.

> It is also mandatory to wear a mask when leaving the house, apart from a few exceptions.

Police in many countries are doing that in this COVID situation. Even some of which are considered more democratic than Singapore.  

Don't hold back. Beat up the violent criminals. Concerned for their injury? So what they are asking for their own injuries. After getting beaten up, when going to clinic, doctor should also give them a slap on face, as a bonus.",t3_g35g2f,2020-04-18 10:42:56,FeefaPlayer,-8
