*****
> A 52-year-old British man who was charged in court on Friday with violating Singapore&#039;s notoriously strict quarantine rules could face up to six months in prison or a fine of about $7,500- or both - according to the city-state&#039;s immigration authority.

> Nigel&#039;s fianc&eacute;e, Agatha Maghesh Eyamalai, who was not in quarantine but who had booked another room in the same hotel, was also charged with abetting Nigel&#039;s breach of the quarantine requirements, per ICA. Singapore has kept its COVID-19 numbers low in recent months by strictly enforcing a 14-day quarantine for incoming foreign workers and citizens.

> The quarantine period has helped Singapore greatly reduce its overall number of COVID cases and deaths.

In Singapore, we can count the number of daily transmissions on one hand. We have an astoundingly low death rate (a grand total of 29 people have died in a country of about 6 million). We don't have people crying on the grocery store floors because they have to wear a mask. No service worker has been attacked. Now we can have guilt-free dinner parties and open tourist attractions.

181,gjp3a04,t3_kzka7k,"So the lashes with the rattan cane are often misunderstood. You get sentenced with 5 lashes, let’s say.  We understand it that they hit you 5 times and you walk out pretty sore. But that’s not how it’s done. 

They hit you once, on bare skin, really hard and send you back to your cell. You heal fairly well with some swelling and maybe a scar or two. Once you e healed, they do it again. Same place. This time as the split came comes back together it gabs hold of scar tissue and rips it off. And back to your cell you go to heal. Longer healing now in a dirty cell. Maybe infection sets in. More damage. But you heal, eventually and they bring you in fir the third set. 

By the fifth set, they’re pulling out muscle tissue and you are hobbling, if able to stand at all. The infection you get in your dirty cell will probably kill you. If not, you’re maimed and crippled for life. 

That’s why there is very little crime in Singapore. 

That’s why that teenager years ago who was caught spray painting walls was so scared for his life.

We are one of the countries with the highest population density in the world (>8000 people per square kilometre). We are also very dependent on the economy running. We've managed to keep deaths below 30 in total, and our new daily infections, mostly people coming from other countries, are averaging around 10-20 a day in a nation of 5.5 million (and about 1 case of community spread per day on average for the past month or so).

What happens if he gets out, no one notices, and passes the illness to 3 random people in the hotel? And what if they're asymptomatic when they start becoming contagious (which is usually the case), and spread it to wider society?

Now in modern times to break the whole EU thing up, they had to get inside. If they tried to break it up from the outside, that wouldn't work.

Double Edit: I have concluded I must be conflating stories.

They also executed a Singaporean national in 2005 who was known for being the country’s national jet ski chamion in 1995. He was smuggling ~2lbs of cannabis from Malaysia.

The Aztecs enslaved other peoples and forced them to pay tribute in the form of human sacrifice. 
A few centuries ago, China indiscriminately massacred Dzungars, 80% of them were wiped out and nearly all of their land/culture were gone and replaced. 
Much of Southern Africa was dominated by Pigmy, Khoi, and San peoples that were almost entirely wiped out by Bantus.
Just look up a list of the largest genocides and you’ll see that the West doesn’t stand out in this regard.

Chinese birth rate falls to lowest in seven decades. Now about same with US and Europe.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51145251

China’s falling birth rate threatens economic growth.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-birth-rate-falls-to-new-low-threatening-economy-11579265321

It's not rocket science that there is point where every growth starts slowing and then stops and that's already happened with your fantasy.

> This sounds like a hilarious white supremacist make belief.

Meanwhile they keep photoshopping bigger eyes and paler skin on to seem more ""western"" and some of them even go and get double eyelid surgeries.

And no, the punishment for buying or possessing drugs isn't death, the authorities don't really care about small fry recreational drug users. They target traffickers and dealers and people who possess huge amounts. I have a friend who's about to be released (yay!) after 5 years in prison for possession of a variety (yup, not just one type) of drugs. Whilst awaiting trial, he was sent to rehab. So don't believe the fearmongering from foreign journalists who don't have in depth knowledge of what truly goes on in the country.

 Anyway, I'm pretty sure the police knows which clubs/parties they'll find recreational drug users and if they wanted to arrest anyone at any point, they would've done so. So far, I haven't seen anyone getting arrested in any club. But that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I know people who've been to prison for either possession, consumption, dealing. Depending on the quantity and type of drug they had on them at the time, the sentence is anywhere between 12 months to... well, years. These people are also educated, functional, intelligent people who go on to lead normal lives after release. There's nothing wrong with a little fun now and then, and the war on drugs needs to end.

As a Singaporean that identifies as centre-left, I will tell you the country has a regressive, anti-intellectual stand towards drugs, capital punishment and corporal punishment. It is a huge blind spot of an administration that crows about its technocratic, evidence-based policymaking. It is founded on the dubious assumption that extant research and case studies on failed drug wars are fundamentally irrelevant to the Singaporean experience (as an island city-state), and that a drug war can not just be won, but is desirable. And also that harsh punishments are something demanded by the majority of the populace - ignoring that fact that reverence of authority and a retributive streak were socially engineered by the government.

That said, some of this apologism, I think is a symptom of overcorrection. Tired, Orientalist caricatures have not kept up with the social development of Singapore (eg. the whole chewing gum thing), and there is therefore a desire to leap in the country's defense. Hell, they were caricatures even when they first emerged. Flawed, yes, but to have a realistic image of when and where torture and brutality happens.

Progressive activism is also viewed as a neo-colonialist enterprise by the West by too much of the population. The legacy of colonialism is fraught in this region. There is much trauma. To some extent the government has cultivated this trauma to their advantage to malign progressive activism, especially when such activism first gained traction in global culture through discourses in ex-colonial powers in the West.

993,gjpkjfm,t1_gjphnob,"I mean sure. If you want to pretend that Singapore executes and canes literally everyone who does something wrong or illegal. 

There is of course a more complex view to take like the fact Singapore has a lot of the basic necessities really nailed. Housing is subsidised for almost every citizen who wants to buy into government housing ( I own one with my wife. It's a flat. It's great and is actually designed to make it possible to own a home. Singaporeans will debate the benefits and cons of HDB due to its 99 year lease system but compared to back home... I don't think id ever have been able to peruse being a designer and still get to own a home in a city that I can find work )

The food is subsidised, local hawker culture is some of the tastiest and cheapest food around. Nothing compares to it in the UK. The idea that you can go out everyday and it's cheaper to eat and sit down with family and friends than to eat at home (unless super frugal) still blows my mind. 

The national insurance equivalent, CPF is usable for more than just your eventual pension. You can use it for medical bills ( on top of already subsidised healthcare. Albeit as someone who suffers from a lot of health issues I do miss the NHS ), you can use it to pay for your home loan and your employer has to match you monthly contribution as well. 

Education is some of the best in the world, the school rankings here leave me feeling stupid as hell when I meet kids who are in 'not as good' schools who are still brighter and more educated than I could ever say I was at that age. Albeit that this comes with the cost of extreme child stress, which is the problem Singapore is now trying to work out how to address. Maybe a bit slower than it should be...

I think Singapore just looked at a lot of the things that make crime common, you know... poverty and access to basic needs. 

I'm a big old SNP voting lefty, so take all this as you will. I just feel like if the UK gov actually wanted to be like Singapore, I hope the low tax bit isn't the thing they take. I hope it's the subsidised housing, the food support etc etc.",t3_kzka7k,2021-01-18 18:55:46,orcfull,5

>**The law creates a presumption of trafficking for certain threshold amounts**, e.g. 30 grams of [cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)). It also creates a presumption that a person possesses drugs if he possesses the keys to a premises containing the drugs, and that ""Any person found in or escaping from any place or premises which is proved or presumed to be used for the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been smoking or administering a controlled drug in that place or premises."" Thus, one runs the risk of arrest for drug use by simply being in the company of drug users. The law also allows officers to search premises and individuals, without a [search warrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant), if he ""reasonably suspects that there is to be found a controlled drug or article liable to seizure"".

Kind of dishonest to pretend like they don't execute you for possession when they do, they just redefine ""trafficking"" to mean ""possession of a certain amount, whether or not they actually...uh...*possess* the drugs.""

The case against capital and corporal punishment - in general beyond drug trafficking - is just as strong as the case against cannabis.

Saying that the drug policy is uniformly regressive, as are its punishments, is not the same as equating potential of damage of cannabis vs opioids or meth. It just means that the gradations should be preserved, but the punishment (and other aspects of justice like rehabilitation) should be relooked.

The topic was regarding a man who is going to be jailed for breaking strict quarantine and visiting his fiance in the same building. It's completely fair for people to contribute to this discussion who both agree with and disagree with the authorities response. Your attempts to remove me from this discussion is amusing though.

First thing to note is that you are working under the assumption that these laws save lives. I have shown you evidence that they don't, and they are largely detrimental. Are you willing to even consider the opportunity cost involved? The lockdowns on a global scale are very literally going to result in massive deaths in poorer nations due to starvation, and you don't think that the scale and scope is comparable?

You are working off of the false premise that ""if it only saves one life it is worth it"" but you selectively ignore all of the data that shows this is quote the opposite. And if that is true then shouldn't we ban everything, literally anything can cause harm. Forget about seatbelt laws, let's ban cars all together. My questions are where do you draw the line and what's the appropriate balance. You are allowed to have a different opinion, but the more you defer to government to choose where that line is you better believe they will keep moving that line year after year, and crisis after crisis. Not to mention, once they have that level of control, how can you then continue to even believe the information they are providing you with? We all know that China has kept the real death numbers hidden, so which governments are open and transparent and which aren't?

1219,gjre4mq,t1_gjr5avp,"I started typing up this response about to shoot down your analogy, but it’s actually pretty good. If a significant proportion of the population don’t get vaccinated, we start to see a resurgence in previously controlled diseases, but at their core, vaccines are still essentially selfish - people get them primarily to protect themselves. 

Masks are similar in the sense that they require herd compliance to be effective, but not to the same degree - the protection a mask offers the individual wearing it is pretty minimal. It’s value is in preventing droplets becoming airborne, which is generally more of a benefit to other people (at least for the strips of cloth worn by the average shopper). 

The difference is, the general population aren’t really affected by antivaxxers. The fact that they’ve been vaccinated themselves protects them. It still significantly increases the risk to the vulnerable who can’t have a vaccine, but the vaccinated majority severely limits the ability for it to spread. 

That’s not yet the case with Covid. Antimaskers put everybody else at risk every time they enter an enclosed space without a mask. If they have it, they can easily spread it to 2-3 people in every shop they visit.

As an outbreak grows, the responsibility lies with the authority in charge of that reason. When it's a lab, it's the company, when it expands to that district, it's the district authority, when it becomes the city, the city authority etc. etc. etc.
