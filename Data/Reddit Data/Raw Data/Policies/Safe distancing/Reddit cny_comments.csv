Even worse when you cannot return to your homeland and hearing news that you lost one of your close relatives at Malaysia just before the festive season. You feel like you lost everything in life and having a heavy breakdown that could go on for weeks or months.

To all Malaysians who are unable to return to your homeland during this festive season and also some on this sub, treasure your loved ones and keep them in contact every now and then cause you will never know until when they will be around in this world.

Hari Raya Haji was in July, second month of Phase 2. What my family did was allocate timings and limit the number of visitors to my house (my grandmother stays with us).

The fight began on 25th day of fasting.My mum put on the family Whatsapp group to make a list(2 person each day).Then all her siblings started fighting who visit on 1st day when you have the whole month to celebrate.

Anyway my dad suggested to used Zoom since my mum siblings can't be pleased.

37,gjxx5my,t3_l11fxm,"If you really have no choice and have to carry out the CNY gathering (within legal limits), then you can consider doing things that the govt has been doing for public areas and large events:

(1) Check everyone's temperature before letting them into the house.

(2) Continue to wear mask and sit further apart during the gathering.

(3) Make sure everyone washes their hands before eating.

(4) Serve individual portions and don't share food, and minimise talking during eating.  Also try to seat everyone further apart, if possible.

(5) Continue to keep in touch with everyone who has visited your house and whose house you have visited for two weeks.  At the first sign of someone having flu-like symptoms, quickly inform everyone, and make sure everyone in your household monitor their health carefully.  Importantly, avoid socialising to minimise spread to the larger community, until you are certain that there is minimal risk.

So, perhaps the weigh up for your family could be between, on the one hand, risking infection as well as following all the lechey restrictions listed above, and on the other hand, keeping everyone safe and don't have to deal with the lechey restrictions listed above.",t3_l11fxm,2021-01-20 21:29:24,OnosideH,3

May I suggest that we indulge them for just one day? The rest of us will just have to be extra-vigilant and give up on socializing so that our elders can get their socializing.

These factors are already built into policy and are part of the risk management.

Ultimately, the government can only lead, but it is the people who enact these policies or procedures that have to ensure it’s all followed.

>Also, it's easy to sit on a high horse and deride people for not ""following guidelines"". All I'm saying is, stop being so quick to bash Singaporeans just because they bend a few rules here and there.

allow me to hit the ball back into your court. it's easy to sit on a high horse and deride the government for not being prudent when you only make considerations upon a small window of factors. 

and also, please hold everyone to the same, equal standards - if the government must be prudent in its decision making, so must the people. can't ""bash singaporeans"" just because they decide to relax a bit? don't ""bash the government"" because they also relax.

This is the same reason why we need the safe distancing people sitting at the entrance of every location. Because people can't be trusted to do the right thing. See the Chinatown situation, for example. 

Another example: people who will not use the safe entry if the shops themselves don't employ a person to stand at the entrance and force people to do it. I have seen many a person just walk into the shop without scanning. Sure, I try to ask them to do it, but I can't catch every person. It's personal responsibility, which, unfortunately, a lot of Singaporeans lack. This is why we need to be nannied.
