10,gc8qrco,t3_jtzz19,"> # Two big groups under probe for safe distancing breaches

> Two groups, each comprising 20 people or more, are under investigation for allegedly breaching safe distancing rules at Singapore's nature reserves.

> One involved 26 hikers who had attempted to go off-trail illegally in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the largest on the island.

> The other was a group of 20 who had gathered for a birthday celebration at Labrador Nature Reserve in the south-west of Singapore.

> Of greater concern is that these two groups are not the only ones being investigated for possible violation of Covid-19 safety measures, nor are they even the biggest group.

> The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) revealed yesterday that a group of 50 people is also being investigated. The New Paper understands this is the largest group linked to a breach since safe distancing measures were put in place in March.

> Responding to queries from TNP, an MSE spokesman said these incidents are among a spate of recent cases involving 12 to 50 people intermingling in large groups at various parks, birthday celebrations, baby showers, food and beverage outlets, and basketball and football games in Housing Board estate courts.

> These cases are under investigation and the appropriate enforcement action will be taken, she added.

> Noting the recent increase in such gatherings, the spokesman added: ""It is important for all of us to remain vigilant and adhere to safe distancing measures to avoid a resurgence of cases as seen in other countries.

> ""We have been able to keep the number of Covid-19 cases low due to the majority playing their part.

> ""With the festive season coming up, and as we make the transition to phase three, it is even more crucial for us to adhere to these measures so that we can continue to keep our community safe.""

> Under the current phase two of the country's reopening, social gatherings of up to five people are allowed with safety measures such as the wearing of masks.

> The Government has signalled that the country could move into phase three by the end of the year.

> But Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force of Covid-19, reiterated on Tuesday that three criteria must be met for this to happen.

> Two of them are sufficient testing capabilities - in which Singapore is ""proceeding well"" - and a participation rate of 70 per cent in the TraceTogether programme, up from the current rate of less than 50 per cent.

> The third is an overall sense of compliance with safe management measures.

> ""We do need to see Singaporeans taking today's measures seriously because if people are not even responsible enough to uphold (them), then going for further relaxation is going to be very risky,"" Mr Wong stressed.

> Separately, on Tuesday, Minister of Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said on Facebook: ""I am concerned to see an increasing number of flagrant violations of the rules. I urge you to continue to observe the measures to keep your family and friends safe from infection.""

> Infectious disease experts warned that this was not the time for complacency despite the drop in community cases.

> With reciprocal green lanes established between Singapore and countries like Malaysia and Japan and the imminent air travel bubble with Hong Kong, an undetected case of the virus could slip through, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, a specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said.

> ""Our defence of masks and social distancing must hold. If not, we will see a new wave of community spread,"" he added.

> ""I would encourage everyone to not give up the huge gains that we have achieved.""

> Another expert, Dr Ling Li Min, who is also based at Mount Elizabeth Novena, said the recent rise in breaches suggested that people may be suffering from Covid-19 measures fatigue.

> However, she stressed the importance of remaining socially responsible, as studies have shown that gathering in large groups in close proximity results in an estimated secondary infection rate of up to 53 per cent should someone in the group have the virus.

> ""Getting to where we are now with our low community infection rates has been a challenge, and we have seen from the experiences of other countries how easy it is for a new cluster of infections to form,"" she added.

> ""Let us not be tempted to let our guard down now.""

> Another investigation has been launched over a possible breach of safety measures at a hotel at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS).

> Videos of a group of at least six women and a man were uploaded on social media on Sunday, when they allegedly held a party to celebrate the 33rd week of pregnancy of one of the women.

> Some of the women had uploaded several videos on Instagram, showing themselves play-fighting with pillows and clothes on beds.

> Social gatherings of more than five people are prohibited due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

> Responding to queries from The New Paper yesterday, Mr Chew Tiong Heng, executive director of infrastructure planning and management at the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), said it was aware of the alleged incident and was investigating.

> ""STB takes a serious view of any breach in safe management measures,"" he said.

> ""Hotels are required to comply with all safe management measures, including ensuring that gatherings do not exceed five people if they are not from the same household.""

> An RWS spokesman said it takes a serious view of non-compliance and requires all guests to be registered with the hotel front desk.

> Safe management measures are highlighted to guests during check-in, and signs are displayed at common areas as a reminder.

> He said: ""We strongly urge all guests to strictly observe and adhere to all safe management measures for the health, safety and well-being of the Singapore community.""

> This is the second such gathering at RWS that has allegedly breached safe management rules in as many months.

> Last month, it was reported that a group of at least 10 people, mostly women, were seen drinking and dining together in a hotel suite there. Investigations over the incident are ongoing.

> A reader tipped off TNP on the latest alleged incident and claimed it involved six women and two men who held significant influence over youth here.

> One of the women involved has about 57,000 followers on Instagram.

> The posts have all been removed from their Instagram accounts.

> Individuals who breach safety measures may be fined up to $10,000, or jailed for up to six months, or both.

> The maximum sentence is doubled for repeat offenders.

> Asked what possible action may be taken if such breaches repeatedly occur at the same location, Mr Chew said hotels that are found to be non-compliant may face closure of its premises.

> Businesses that do not comply may also be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other forms of assistance.

> Rules for staycations at hotels

> Staycations are allowed at hotels approved by the Singapore Tourism Board and Ministry of Trade and Industry.

> The hotels must comply with existing safe management measures, such as the wearing of masks and practice of safe distancing in public and common areas.

> Gatherings, even those in private rooms and adjoining rooms, must be limited to five persons or fewer.

> The exception is if the gathering consists only of people who have already been living in the same household, each with the same address.

> All hotel guests are required to register themselves and use SafeEntry for entry and exit. The use of TraceTogether is encouraged.

> There must be staggered timings for guests to be at the hotel lobby and at guest facilities, as well as employees at the back-of-house work environment.

> On May 16, photos of people gathering in Robertson Quay went viral on social media. Olagunju and Waring were part of a group of people who met at the steps near Limoncello restaurant that day to chat and drink alcohol.

> 

> Seven other people who also gathered in the area were fined in June. All were barred from working in Singapore except for one who is a Singapore permanent resident.

> Both Olagunju and Waring were also fined earlier this week for flouting COVID-19 circuit breaker measures. Olagunju was fined S$8,500 and Waring was fined S$8,000.

> Singapore implemented a circuit breaker from Apr 7 to Jun 1 to stem local transmissions of COVID-19. During this period, people who were not living in the same residence were not allowed to meet for social purposes.

> 

> In response to CNA’s queries, a spokesperson from MOM said on Thursday it would not “hesitate to take action against those who have been convicted of breaking the law”. This includes revoking work passes.

> “All work pass holders in Singapore must abide by the law, regardless of nationality and pass type,” said the spokesperson.

1. If you’re out and about and you are more inclined to take a video or photo of someone breaking the rules because they are a particular race, then that is racist. 
2. If a news outlet publishes more stories about a particular race breaking the rules, pushes a narrative that a certain race breaks the rules more than others, or covers stories about one race in a different way to others (including publishing names or photos) then that is racist. 
3. If stories about people of a certain race are published to bait racist comments, then that is itself racist.
4. If a government enacts policies that require police or ambassadors to visit locations more often because they are frequented by people of a certain race, then that is racist. 
5. If ppl of a particular race receive harsher sentences in court then that is racist.

Without being able to work here they will be tourists and as Brits they have 90 days inside the country.  Extension isn't going to be granted.

They will leave.

1. If you’re out and about and you are more inclined to take a video or photo of someone breaking the rules because they are a particular race, then that is racist. 
2. If a news outlet publishes more stories about a particular race breaking the rules, pushes a narrative that a certain race breaks the rules more than others, or covers stories about one race in a different way to others (including publishing names or photos) then that is racist. 
3. If stories about people of a certain race are published to bait racist comments, then that is itself racist.
4. If a government enacts policies that require police or ambassadors to visit locations more often because they are frequented by people of a certain race, then that is racist. 
5. If ppl of a particular race receive harsher sentences in court then that is racist.

> SINGAPORE - Authorities are investigating shoe retailer Foot Locker, following large crowds that gathered on Friday evening outside its Orchard Gateway @ Emerald outlet.

> The Singapore Tourism Board said early Saturday (Dec 5) morning that investigations are under way, as Foot Locker stores have continued to hold events that draw large crowds, despite repeated advisories about crowd management.

> On Friday night, crowds had gathered at its Orchard outlet, apparently for Saturday's release of limited edition Adidas sneakers, which can fetch a tidy profit on the secondary market due to high demand.

> Eyewitnesses saw at least four red Police Tactical Unit anti-riot trucks parked outside 313@somerset mall, and police tape used to cordon off shop fronts. Police officers were also seen dispersing the crowd, which consisted mainly of youths.

> Photos that circulated on social media at about 8pm showed a crowd of around 100 people packed shoulder to shoulder outside the footwear store.

> The crowds were dispersed shortly after 8.30pm after safe distancing ambassadors and police officers arrived, STB said in a statement.

> ""STB takes a serious view of any breach in safe management measures, and will not hesitate to take actions against individuals and businesses that do not comply with them,"" said STB's director for safe management operations Ms Ranita Sundramoorthy.

> Adidas' Yeezy sneaker line, the product of a collaboration between rapper Kanye West and the sports shoe brand, has drawn large crowds in Singapore and abroad during past launches.

> Last June, the launch of the limited edition Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V created a long queue many hours before the release time at Foot Locker's Jewel Changi Airport outlet.

> Sole Superior Singapore, a sneaker and streetwear community, called on Foot Locker to shift to a contactless system for ""hyped"" - or very popular - releases, and that a traditional queue system ""is not the way during such dangerous times"".

> ""All we need is just one case to create a cluster,"" it said on Facebook. ""Then, inevitably, the public will look at the streetwear community in general in disgust.""

> Adidas Singapore had held an online ballot for Saturday's limited release shoes, but many sneaker aficionados who missed out appeared to have been trying their luck at Foot Locker given the high resale value of the shoes.

> ""These trainers are hot - the hype is real...Foot Locker is at the head of the latest trends, so you know it'll stock Yeezy boost trainers online and in select stores,"" it said on its website prior to the launch.

> The Foot Locker Singapore website was down as of Friday evening.

> Netizens took to social media to voice their displeasure at the lack of social distancing among the crowd.

> Former NMP Siew Kum Hong shared pictures of those gathered outside Foot Locker on his Facebook on Friday with the caption: ""Few cases does not mean no cases.""

> Under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament in April, those found flouting safe management measures face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Repeat offenders can be fined up to S$20,000, jailed for up to one year, or both.

305,geno7g3,t1_genaaqz,The hype is sustained entirely from limited editions being able to be flipped for profit. Sell it at market price = no profit for scalpers = no one actually wants to buy that ugly ass shoe = no hype,t3_k6ps9i,2020-12-05 09:29:04,mechacorgi19,15
306,genikmt,t1_genaaqz,Because having an inflated resale market adds to the hype and brands the product for them. Their margin is already through the roof. They can move into multiple permutations of a successful shoe and milk it for a long time,t3_k6ps9i,2020-12-05 08:33:46,bbqoyster,10
