> SINGAPORE - Singapore should be fully prepared that many of the current restrictions and circuit breaker measures in place will continue for some time even after June 1, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.

> This is to keep people and their loved ones safe after the circuit breaker ends, he said in a Facebook post on Sunday (May 17).

> ""It won't simply be a return to life before the circuit breaker,"" he said, noting the Government will adopt a careful and calibrated approach as the country resumes normal activities at work, schools, and in social settings.

> The Government is preparing for the next phase and considering what activities can resume in a safe manner, said the minister, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the Covid-19 outbreak.

> ""A controlled and phased exit from the circuit breaker will require patience and discipline from all of us,"" he said.

> ""We must all do our part to control the spread of the virus and ensure that it does not flare up again. Otherwise all our efforts and sacrifices during this circuit breaker period would have been made in vain.""

> He cited the approach taken for the construction sector, which will restart on a few critical projects where very tight safeguards are required from June 2.

> The safeguards include requiring workers involved in a project to be housed together, instead of lodging at multiple dormitories, as well as periodic testing of workers at two-week intervals.

> The number of construction workers involved in projects will scale up over time as the industry gains confidence and experience with the measures, Mr Wong said.

> Related Story 682 new coronavirus cases, including 4 Singaporeans and PRs

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> Construction work has largely been suspended since Covid-19 circuit breaker measures kicked in on April 7, with only 5 per cent of the sector's workforce - about 20,000 workers - continuing to work on a small number of critical projects, and those that have had to continue for safety reasons.

> The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) expects another 5 per cent of the workforce to resume work gradually, meaning about one-tenth of the usual workforce will be active in June.

> During a press conference on Friday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong also called on Singapore residents to remain vigilant even after circuit breaker measures officially end on June 1.

> He highlighted the need for restrictive measures to continue to ensure that the number of coronavirus cases does not spike, and urged Singaporeans to continue to cooperate with the authorities and support safe distancing measures so the country can progressively open up with time.

But because now the crowd has formed due to people panicking and not listening. Eventually a cluster will form out of these hypermarts like Mustafa Centre, which then will force the Government to go even a step further and have to close or restrict these places too.

Now, here comes the funny problem.. when these full scale lockdowns finally happen, those people who went to panic buy or form the queues at these hypermarts will then tell you "" I TOLD U SO TO PANIC BUY AND STOCK UP MONTHS WORTH OF SUPPLIES.. DONT LISTEN TO ME LAH NOW U HAPPY ?"" .. when it is actually a result of their actions of forming potential clusters or crowd which has caused the escalation in lockdown.. so they will still continue think there is nothing wrong with their actions and rush to form queues again to ""stock up"" at every where place possible when the lockdown is lifted a little again.. and we become stuck in a negative loop",t3_fvq6io,2020-04-06 10:49:42,havetheveryfun,182

73,fmkhyz8,t3_fvq6io,"In defense of the covidiot Singaporeans: 

Most Singaporeans are not stupid. 

For the past 2-3 months, they made a personal assessment, looking at the headline local and global news, the low number of local cases, and the behaviour of their friends and family, and they decided that the risk of continuing their social activities is low. 

They could not see (even experts did not know) that they can spread the virus even if they are asymptomatic, or that they can indirectly affect the elderly/ immunocompromised even if they themselves may not suffer severely. 

As they visit the malls, or go to the hawker centres, they see everyone behaving normally, and this further enhances the fact that they can continue normally. 

As a comparison, if the SARS-COV2 was similar to SARS-COV1 in mortality (30%), and they read the news of lots of Singaporeans dying, every Singaporean will guai guai stay at home at all times (without the constant nagging). 

This is the crux of the problem: the fact that SARS-COV2 does not have the killing power of more severe diseases like SARS-COV1 or Ebola, for example. So in terms of messaging of health policy, it is extremely difficult to get people to understand and follow. 

Hopefully now as we step up the messaging regarding the seriousness of the problem, things will improve. And we will come out of this 1 month with a flattened curve.",t3_fvq6io,2020-04-06 14:46:17,mburg777,4

Due in part to the government's relatively spineless ""it's not that bad"" approach to the second phase of this whole thing. The DORSCON-Almost-Red memes exist for a reason. 

For better or worse, the government has been trying and succeeding to downplay the severity of the situation here in Singapore. Locals take a look at other countries and see the streets literally devoid of people or traffic, then look at our own and see business as usual, and conclude that things are still going okay here.

This whole ""circuit breaker"" shit is a great representation of that. Even when it's lockdown, it's not really.

- What R0 is and what is the estimate R0 of the virus and what does that look like. Even a conservative estimate R0 of 2.5 means it will ravage the whole world in 2 months time.

- The possibility of asymptomatic transmission. Chris said that makes it a lot worse than SARS because with SARS, you knew who had the virus and you can isolate them very easily. This factor alone makes it a lot more invisible than SARS and you cannot fight effectively against something you cannot see/perceive. This is why you will need to consider the possibility of a lockdown when reports of asymptomatic transmission are coming out.

- Chris also mentioned a lot that tackling this Pandemic is a juggling act. You want to limit the spread but measures to do that will hurt the economy. Keeping your economy afloat will let the virus spread and overwhelm/cripple your healthcare. But if you let your economy crash, you will get shortages of supplies everywhere, making your war against the virus a lot harder. So far I think many countries have leaned too heavily on the economy part at the expense of limiting the virus spread and overwhelming their Healthcare.

The only country that did well in this is Taiwan and China is gonna be pissed off with this statement. South Korea did pretty well through tremendous effort. I believe Taiwan is at where we are 1 month ago right now and may reach 1000 cases in the coming few months. They will be able get away with minimal damage and will be back to normalcy relatively quickly. That was my hope that that will be outcome with Singapore's management on the disease.

To break down your reply clearly.

>Supply chain to essential business

>you supply fabric to mask maker u are essential

This 2 lines are the same except that 2nd line defines clearly what it is doing.

So line 1 is still valid.

You could also suggest that only essential supply chains to essential business can be exempted. 

So fabric is ok. Marketing isn't. 

But that's not how the policy is written. Which is why you have to apply for it.

Who knows, maybe certain business's supply chain which is marketing could be approved due to certain reasons.

So maybe marketing by itself may not be entirely non essential. 

ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

Tldr:

Supply chain to essential business does not clearly define what supplies will be approve or not.

Business all have to apply for it.",t3_fvq6io,2020-04-06 12:04:24,danielling1981,5

It is technically correct. Only assuming if you are providing some service to essential business.

The OP isn't false because it is vague and subjective.

Let me read again OP.

Edit:

>Companies are calling each other up to see if their clients are open. If the client is open, they will use that to justify that they need to remain open. This effectively nullifies the Circuit Breaker.

I note that OP did not include the word essential under ""clients"". However it is clearly implied since anything non essential will be closed without debate.

Only essential business / clients and their support chains have even a slim chance of staying open.

Since it is implied, so OP is not fake news.

Your first reply is below.

>Fake news, all non essential companies even if their clients are essential companies, if they can't do work from home, they must close.

Some people use levain/sourdough to refer to the same thing but in the US the sourdough is really sour while the typical  French boules made with levain are only a little bit. Also IIRC regular baguettes are specifically not made with levain to have that neutral/sweetish flavor, unless it's specifically a sourdough baguette. 

Sorry to be pedantic but I'm a bit of a bread geek but I don't bake, just eat. I did think of making my own boules though at one point. I'm puzzled at why people are making levain/sourdough starter though because it seems like the market for such breads in sg doesn't even exist commercially so why would they make it at home?! 

Tbh the quality of French/European bread here is not great IMO. I lived in the US and the local European/French bakeries produced better boules/baguettes than anything I have had in sg. Maybe I just havent found the right places.

The risk increases the more people gather. It can be a queue, it can be a music concert, it can be school, or just about anything else. That is simple math. The queues we saw last weekend was packed with people, so I don't know if you are even in the same context as this thread. 


This context is important.


We are talking specifically about last few weeks where people senselessly went out before the lockdowns happened. The most recent examples being toys, IKEA and so on. 


Just to make it even clearer in writing, the problem is absolutely 'not adhering to safe distances' while queuing, as you said. Infact I thought the whole core of this thread stems from the OP's disappointment and frustration that people are not taking social distancing seriously, which he or she believes will lead to Singapore's situation worsening. This whole thread is to call that behavior out. It is probably the OP's holier-then-thou approach that got people all defensive and bothered.

In your mind, you see yourself as someone combating against fearmongers, keeping the community spirit up, trying your best to spread what you believe is accurate information. I commend your positive intent. But playing down the threat is not the way to go. At this stage, people need to feel the danger. 


In the context of this thread (and as the OP pointed out in a few of the posts), people who RISKED queues, without practicing safe distances, for something they can survive a month without, have placed the people in danger.

This is your first reply.

What I understood from this is, your business has to be essential. Doesn't matter who your clients are.

Derived from the words ""even if their clients are essential"".

>Eh I just realized, using your own arguments.

>What I wrote isn't fake news because it's implied that non essential companies are those left after they tried to appplied to stay open and failed. So it's true that those companies who failed to get permission to stay open must close :)

This explanation is very different from your first reply.

Now you trying to say if they apply and fail.

This is fairly backtracking and trying to change your words. Bad try though as it's fairly different the 2 statements.

But it is correct that if cannot get permission means must close.

>Also supply or support chains are a small part of what I wrote as non essential, supply chains are almost always considered essential. 🧸

Again not true.

If you are supply chain but not supplying to essential, you are not essential. 

Supply chain could be delivering things like pen and paper to popular.

However, you could be delivering paper to a hospital. Then the same supplier of paper becomes essential.

I was replying directly to this comment.

So I will argue toys are essential for keeping my 14month old entertained during this period otherwise I might go mental if she is going to scream the whole day and we are stucked at home.

> I wonder why Singaporeans have such a skewed sense of priorities

It's not up to you to decide what is essential or not. If the toy helps keep the kid entertained for a period of time and helps keep peace in the house yes than its essential.

> While they did not specify what essential purposes are, I think we can safely assume that buying toys ain't gonna cut it. Your kids won't die without a toy or two.

> And it's delusional to think that a few toys will keep them ""distracted"" for the month (and beyond). People doing this are putting their self-needs above the safety of the community at large.

If you don't have kids, don't judge. You aren't the one stuck at home with the kid. I can sense the sarcasm here when you posted those links. If you think it's delusional than you are also delusional to think that every kid is the same and reacts exactly the same way to the same stimulus. Do they?

Use [this](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/circuit-breaker-to-minimise-further-spread-of-covid-19) article instead, the one you provided is too outdated. Some quotes from this press release:

*  We require the cooperation of all Singaporeans to minimise movements and interactions in public and private places, and stay home unless necessary for essential purposes. 
* ""Members of the public are strongly advised to stay at home and avoid going out unnecessarily, except to purchase daily necessities, essential services, or for urgent medical needs.""
*  The general public is advised to stay home and avoid interactions with anyone other than immediate family members living in the same household. 
*  Social responsibility is critical in slowing the spread of COVID-19. We need all Singaporeans to do the right thing, if we are to beat the virus. 

&#x200B;

Social distancing (1 m apart) is a last resort method to TRY to reduce chances of spread during **essential activities** (e.g. buying food because you ran out).

I don't get why people view social distancing and masks as a bulletproof option to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

At this point in time, the most effective method is to **avoid going out if possible.**",t3_fvq6io,2020-04-06 21:16:04,ZeroPauper,1

Since you can't grasp why it is essential. I will tell you why with my story: 

I put my daughter in infant care while both of us work. This circuit breaker was a little sudden to us but I had plans to buy those things anyway. I'm just bringing it forward because I have to spend this month with my daughter at home. And since at the infant care, they read books, do crafts and play with toys, I'm trying to replicate that same environment at home. For toddlers you have to establish a routine otherwise it's mayham. 

It's not some twisted priority, I'm trying to make my daughter comfortable while staying at home since she is used to the infant care and her friends. It's good for the both of us mentally. She's happy and so are we. 

Sure I have no doubt there are parents queuing not for these reasons but clustering everyone together is very judgemental and vindictive (why are you cross posting my comment to suit your narrative in another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fvw33i/comment/fml1hbb?context=1) when it's misrepresenting how I feel.
