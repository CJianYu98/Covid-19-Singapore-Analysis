> SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Friday (Jan 8), becoming the first member of Singapore's Cabinet to take the COVID-19 vaccine.

> 

> Mr Lee received the jab along with Singapore General Hospital (SGH) staff at the official launch of vaccinations for healthcare workers.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Public healthcare institutions, including hospitals and polyclinics, will start vaccinations for their staff on Friday. SGH estimated about 90 of its employees will get vaccinated on the first day.

> 

> The official roll out comes after a small-scale test run at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, where 40 employees received their jabs on Dec 30.

>

> Speaking to reporters at SGH, Mr Lee said he was happy to see the start of inoculations for healthcare and frontline workers.

> ""So I took the opportunity to have my own jab this morning and now I'm done – 30 minutes waited, nothing happened,"" he said.

> ""I've got my card, and the appointment to come back in three weeks' time. It's painless, it's effective. And it's important.""

> 

> Advertisement

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said earlier that plans for the Cabinet to get vaccinated in batches were in the works.

> 

> The Health Ministry’s Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak, who is part of the multi-ministry task force on COVID-19, also received his first dose of the vaccine on Friday.

> “My Cabinet colleagues and I, including the older ones, will be getting ourselves vaccinated early. This is to show you, especially seniors like me, that we believe the vaccines are safe,” Mr Lee said in a televised national address last month.

> The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was approved by Singapore late last year and the first shipment arrived on Dec 21. The vaccine requires two doses taken 21 days apart, and it will take up to 14 more days after the second dose to achieve maximum protection against the virus.

> 

> Vaccinations for the elderly and those at greater risk of severe COVID-19 will start in February, beginning with seniors aged 70 and above. Vaccinations will be free for all Singaporeans as well as long-term residents in Singapore.

> 

> After he received his jab on Friday, Mr Lee urged people to get inoculated when they can. He said there are ""ample vaccines coming in"" as Singapore ordered the vaccines early.

> ""It will make us safer, and it will make you and your loved ones safer. So please take it when you can,"" he said.

Pzifer and Moderna can only manufacture 800k doses per day. Only 6 companies are racing to make vaccines for 2021 and let's say if the other companies manufacture at the same rate of 800k per day. That's 1490 days (4 years) to vaccinate 90% of the population. If there're more companies in 2022 onwards, realistically it'll be 1-2 years faster.

172,gik5ls4,t1_gij0s0i,"I was speaking more to the perception that people would entirely shun the SinoVac offering, which doesn't seem to be the case, and hence there need be no worry about shots left on the shelf if people were given a choice, or at least a preference.

As it is, there will be no choice as long as Ah Gong is footing the bill (mostly for logistical purpose, I suspect, since sending multiple vaccine types to a single location probably complicates matters).

> Having dozens of different vaccines available and asking ordinary people to choose which one they want to receive is irresponsible and reckless.

This isn't inherently dangerous, as long as you trust the authorities to have properly evaluated the candidates. People can already get flu shots of their choice by choosing the GP/clinic. I think ladies have different considerations for choosing among the available HPV shots on the market. Once the supply crunch for Covid shots eases up in a few years and the technology matures leading to even more options, you'll probably be free to choose whatever you want.",t3_ksv59v,2021-01-09 01:18:38,cosgd,1

176,gin54y9,t1_giiqybm,"There was a paper where researchers found evidence of fragments of viral rna retroactively embedding itself into human DNA like HIV.

Unlike HIV, COVID19 has no machinery to do this retroactive integration. All this happened by chance and all by existing machinery that already exists in healthy cells.

So yes. You might get mutant powers like becoming a mule to permanently carrying covid19 genetic material.
