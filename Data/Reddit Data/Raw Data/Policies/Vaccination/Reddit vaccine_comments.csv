I complete agree with you. Moreover, we are 100 percent urbanized and only 720 sq km, which should make it easy to transport the vaccines to anywhere on the island.

The only explanation I can think of for the plans for vaccination centers is that they originally planned for vaccinations to be done in hospitals and polyclinics for storage reasons (e.g. ultralow refrigeration) before realizing that the vaccines are more easily transportable with dry ice which means that the injections can be done outside of polyclinics and hospitals.

Who is ""They""? This is not factual. Read your own link

The initial efficacy rate of 78% was also reported by a Brazilian Institute based on trials in Brazil and not Sinovac itself. This was revised to 50.38% based by the same institute later using a more stringent criteria. The trials of these studies are conducted by Brazil and not Sinovac itself.

>CoronaVac, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the Chinese company Sinovac, has been shown to have an efficacy of 78% during phase 3 trials in Brazil, its local partner, the Butantan Institute, announced on Thursday. 

>""Today is a very important day for Brazil, for Brazilians, for life and health,” Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria said during a press conference, alongside state health officials and executives from the Butantan Institute.

>""The Butantan Institute and the Government of Sao Paulo report that the coronavirus vaccine achieved a 50.38% overall efficacy rate in the clinical study conducted in Brazil, in addition to (an efficacy rate of) 78% for mild cases and 100% for moderate and severe cases of Covid-19.

If it really comes down to the point that the vaccine is deemed unsafe for use (side effects, coupled with low efficacy), then HSA likely won't approve it and we won't use Sinovac in Singapore. Most likely, as long as it passes their criteria, they will approve it for use, possibly deploy it for specific subsections of the population (e.g those who cannot use the mRNA vaccines).
