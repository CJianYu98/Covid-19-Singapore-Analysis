> SINGAPORE - Singapore received its first shipment of China's Sinovac vaccine on Tuesday (Feb 23). However, the product has not yet been authorised for use by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), said the Health Ministry on Wednesday (Feb 24).

> In a statement, the ministry said: ""Sinovac has started submitting initial data, and HSA is currently awaiting Sinovac's submission of all the necessary information in order to carry out a thorough scientific assessment of the manufacturing process, safety and efficacy of the vaccine under the Pandemic Special Access Route.""

> Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are currently being used in Singapore, have received interim authorisation under this route. Both vaccines involve injecting snippets of the virus' genetic material into the body to stimulate an immune response.

> In contrast, Sinovac's product is an inactivated vaccine, which makes use of killed virus particles. This method has been used in vaccines for diseases such as polio.

> MOH also said it received a fresh shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, and will continue to monitor vaccine supplies closely.

> In a Facebook post, the Chinese embassy said the delivery of the vaccine cements the agreement made by both countries to cooperate on issues related to the pandemic.

> ""China and Singapore have helped each other to meet the challenge since the Covid-19 epidemic broke out, setting a fine example for cooperation against the virus among countries,"" it wrote.

> It added that China will continue to work with Singapore to ""enhance cooperation on vaccine and epidemic control, build a global community of health for all, and win the final victory in the fight against the epidemic"".

**""We will go through the data carefully when it comes, rather than depending on reported numbers. It's better to rely on official data that we receive from Sinovac itself,"" he said.**",t3_lrdomp,2021-02-25 01:13:10,puncel,7

One would think that politics is a matter of compromise and we, the people, are one of the stakeholders they need to compromise with. If they approve Sinovac and *actually start distributing it*, despite its poor showing, the blatant disregard to their constituents is outrageous.

Let’s hope we Singaporeans are wise enough to see what’s going on. And let’s hope we don’t have to do so due to them pulling political stunts on the matter of health. Why should we put our lives at risk so that rich people can get to invest in China and gain more wealth?

The clinical trials for the vaccines are rigorous. 

As for efficacy, people need to be careful interpreting the figures because different reports and different studies are using different standards and performed in different populations.

There wasn't enough research and evidence at the early days of pandemic that mask is necessary for healthy people. As huge as government is, they also shouldn't suga suga implement something without any base.

Along with the other 2 lines of his, it is quite clear he is using all these as a collective hate-inciting towards government. And the government soon too, find out that healthy people wearing mask is overall safer through scientific researches.

Sounds exactly like what Sanlu said about its milk at first for months after it first received reports of adulteration issues. People are still taking Pzifer (sic) and Modena (sic) vaccines, to some extent because there's a lesser likelihood of issues being swept under the carpet by these manufacturers.

205,fyfbp70,t3_hsv9yx,"Hi,
 
  I'm just trying to correct the record, hope this gets enough visibility. Happy to answer more questions if necessary. 

> We already know now that antibody immunity to a natural infection fades fast. 

  I am not sure what you mean by that, but I assume that you are referring to the studies that demonstrated that the antibody levels in recovered patients decrease after a few months. Thing is, the adaptive immune system (i.e. T and B cells) have memory. That means that once the adaptive immune system sees an pathogen or infection, they are likely to have a secondary response that is much faster than the original defense.

Hence, loss of detectable antibody in the blood/plasma doesn't mean that the memory B cells or plasmablasts are gone, nor does it mean that the patients that we can't find the antibody in can be reinfected by the virus (i.e. immunity may still be there) Truth is, we'll only know when it's put to the test.

> What the Singapore work shows is that the earlier SARS outbreak established very long-lasting immunity against SARS that also covers SARS-2. That also included CD8+ T-cells that play a key role in killing infected cells. As SARS-2 as similar to SARS, there is reasonable hope that these other new vaccines could also elicit long-term immunity. However, they did not study the S protein that those other vaccines are based on so we don't actually know if long-term T-cell immunity can be generated against that. It will be a ""game over"" downer for all candidates if it can't. Couldn't at least one effort have selected the NP protein instead? Groupthink.

The fact that the NP protein responses are being generated at a much higher frequency in COVID patients just means that for some reason, the SARS-COV-2 virus' most immunogenic protein is there. Why that is the case may have nothing to do with the antibody and the quality of the immune defense against the virus.

The S protein was chosen based on previous studies of similar viruses such as SARS and MERS. In fact, the main reason why we have clinical trials that quickly already is that much of the early work for developing a vaccine based off this target was already done. Based off this new study, we may need to look into NP. But a S protein based target may still work, since it doesn't [mutate as frequently] (https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02392-y), and still can [generate a response] (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483?query=featured_home). 

The main reason I am replying is to hope that you and others don't judge the work of the researchers based on hindsight. After all, hindsight is 20/20 for a reason.",t3_hsv9yx,2020-07-18 10:21:34,palewhisper01,18

Inactivated vaccines are injected into muscle, contain a high dose of viral antigens all at once, don’t unleash various immune-suppressive tactics, may contain adjuvant etc. All in all, very different from natural infection in the respiratory tract. Most importantly, the inactivated vaccines consist of more than one shot (at least one booster shot will be give).

The implications of that are pretty wild. For one, we may have a much higher diversity of coronaviruses which spillover from the animal reservoir (esp in SE Asia with the high biodiversity), and which goes under the radar because they cause no symptoms or very mild symptoms. 

Secondly, this may explain the perplexing differences in mortality in for example SG, Vietnam, even South China, compared to Lombardy or the US. Some regional populations may have pre-existing immunity from prior ""angel"" spillovers.

Clearly some people are shit out of luck and end up in hospital (or worse) but are there people that are already immune or capable of not getting infected?",t3_hsv9yx,2020-07-18 10:42:56,zoinks10,1
213,fyfhr2q,t3_hsv9yx,"I'm no biomedical graduate, but I have serious doubts that we, as a species, could develop an effective vaccine against SARS2.

We have never develop a vaccine for a coronavirus. Ever. I believe the reason cited was that coronaviruses are highly seasonal and die off before any R&D into them can take flight. So without this experience, I have my doubts that we will have a proper vaccine for SARS2 before SARS3 comes out.",t3_hsv9yx,2020-07-18 11:28:15,CSlv,1

215,fyfel9u,t3_hsv9yx,Showing a T-cell response does not mean that you are immune to the coronavirus and cannot be infectious. It just suggests that you can mount a more effective immune response and perhaps have a lower chance of dying. You can still be infectious and infect your parents and grandparents.,t3_hsv9yx,2020-07-18 10:52:45,doc-tom,0

219,fylnb36,t1_fyeym31,"Inactivated vaccines, in general, don't generate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses well and that's what you need to kill virus infected cells.  The problem is CTLs are MHC class I-restricted so the antigen to generate them must be derived intracellularly, for example, with an attenuated virus vaccine or such-like.  Inactivated vaccines provide extracellular antigen and those are processed via MHC class II - that pathway does not generate CTLs.

In principle, if you fiddled around with the inactivation just right so the inactivated virus particle is still capable of fusing with the target cell so antigen can get presented via MHC class I, you could potentially get some CTL response but is not the usual outcome.",t3_hsv9yx,2020-07-20 06:21:26,92ekp,1
220,fyfxed6,t1_fyfhr2q,"There was never a strong incentive to develop vaccines against “common cold” coronaviruses, given their mildness (still can kill babies and elderly though) and the fact that they only account for ~20% of colds anyway.

SARS vaccine research actually got quite far (Phase I human trials completed, good results in monkeys) but the virus died out and there was no reason/funding to go further.

MERS was quite rare except for camel rearing nations, so research there was slower. But Oxford’s MERS vaccine candidate was rapidly converted to their current Chadox design for Covid.",t3_hsv9yx,2020-07-18 14:58:33,DuePomegranate,3

The study OP links is a T cell study to NP protein. It has no bearing on the success of a humoral vaccine that targets S protein.",t3_hsv9yx,2020-07-18 14:42:39,palewhisper01,4

225,fyfkz5n,t1_fyeyz61,"I see. Only asking cos I encountered this Asian couple (think they might have been PRC) on a 170 from the BT area going to Little India back in Dec 19. The wife was coughing something fierce with the husband trying to console her the whole ride. Bus was pretty empty thankfully. I fell slightly sick after that although I kept my distance from them but recovered in 2-3 days. After the news of wuhan broke in Jan I thought of getting tested but tests were only administered on people who were actually sick then.

After reading this post, I realised that I had a huge episode of flu a few years back. Puked in the carpark omw back from work, suffered from high fever and diarrhea for roughly 4-5 days. My shit was green and the doc had to prescribe loperamide to get my stomach back to normal. That was the first time I've been so sick in my life and I was in peak physical form at that time too. I was training for AHM and managed to finish slightly under 2 hours. 

It's a long shot I know but maybe my past flu infection has given me some immunity to whatever coronaviruses are floating out there rn? I rarely fall sick nowadays but thought nothing of it until this post.",t3_hsv9yx,2020-07-18 12:05:24,lupCheong,1
