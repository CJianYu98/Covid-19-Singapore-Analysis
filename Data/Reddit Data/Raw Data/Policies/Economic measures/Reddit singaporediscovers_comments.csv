Rather than to directly supply $$ to the companies (which could be misappropriated/benefit only bosses or unknowingly support companies already on life support pre-COVID), the $100 is kinda giving citizens a say as to where the ""bailout"" should go.

23,g5fo1up,t3_itnmk4,"> # All adult S'poreans to get $100 tourism vouchers in December for staycations, attractions and local tours

> SINGAPORE - Singaporeans aged 18 and above this year will each receive $100 in digital vouchers to spend on staycations, tickets to leisure attractions and local tours.

> The SingapoRediscovers Vouchers will be accessible via SingPass from December and can be used to offset ticket purchases and hotel stays through the end of June next year. Permanent residents will not be eligible for the vouchers.

> Adult Singaporeans will also be able to purchase up to six subsidised tickets for attractions and tours - each at $10 off - for those under 18 from December to the end of next June.

> Announcing the details on Wednesday (Sept 16), Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said the duration of the voucher programme is timed to coincide with the June and December holidays and spreading out demand in between.

> The initiative is not a social assistance scheme, he added.

> ""This is an economic scheme to help our tourist attractions preserve their capabilities that have been built up over their years while they consolidate the capacity in the interim,"" Mr Chan told reporters during a visit to the Jurong Bird Park.

> The $320 million SingapoRediscovers Vouchers scheme was first announced last month and forms part of the Government‚Äôs efforts to prop up the tourism sector, which has been decimated by travel restrictions amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

> The vouchers, which will come in denominations of $10, can be used at all licensed hotels, leisure attractions and for local tours by operators that have received approval from the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to reopen or resume.

> There are currently 214 hotels, 40 attractions and 438 tour itineraries that have been given the green light to resume operations with safe management measures in place. They include Singapore's four wildlife parks, a number of activities and hotels on Sentosa and guided tours of Pulau Ubin.

> The vouchers complement the $45 million SingapoRediscovers marketing campaign, launched in July to encourage locals to holiday at home and support local businesses.

> More than 200 deals and packages have been launched so far, and the vouchers will give locals more incentive to rediscover their backyard, STB said on Wednesday.

> The tourism board said specific details on how vouchers can be redeemed will be announced in November.

> While STB expects that the redemption process for the vouchers ""will adopt a digital mode by default"", it will provide support for those who have difficulties using such methods.

> Industry players have said that the vouchers will act as a form of indirect discounting for businesses, as lowering prices is a challenge with capacity limits on their operations in place.

> HIGHER CAPACITY LIMITS FOR ATTRACTIONS

> However, tourist attractions - which are currently restricted to 25 per cent of their operating capacity at any one time - can apply to increase this to 50 per cent from Friday.

> 

> Adult Singaporeans will also be able to purchase up to six subsidised tickets for attractions and tours for those under 18 from December to the end of next June. ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG

> 

> They can also seek STB's permission to scale up the capacity at their outdoor shows to 250 people, up from 50 currently. But shows must be split into five zones with a maximum of 50 people in each, with safe distancing between groups as well as zones.

> Related Story Staycations under $180: Explore trendy locales while staying at these chic boutique hotels

> Related Story Tourist at home: Explore Singapore with cool local tours

> This means the limit for outdoor shows at attractions will be in line with the maximum number of participants soon to be allowed at approved meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (Mice) events.

> STB said on Wednesday that the easing of rules for attractions comes as operators have been effective at preventing and dispersing crowds, as well as maintaining high standards of cleanliness and hygiene.

> All attractions have also introduced online booking systems for timed-entry or pre-booking of activities to monitor and control visitor numbers, it said.

While we enjoy our $100 vouchers, we're also indirectly ensuring the best allocation of resources to the players who most deserve it, saving the government the potentially tricky task of deciding that question themselves.

Anti-foreigner sentiments have been stirred up in the midst of the pandemic and also apparent from polling day. Issues like job security and discriminatory hiring are very real and true. (i too, got retrenched but not saying that i dislike foreigners. More like the disdain for overly open immigrant friendly Singapore. But also acknowledging that with our low birth rate, we do need additional workforce) 

It's a great and right thing that Singapore would want to prioritise providing benefits for locals (including converted singaporeans), such as sg traineeship or the job wage support scheme. And not for other ep or spass. (sorry, not sorry). 

Should Singapore provide benefits to PRs equal to true local born and bred singaporeans, such as a hypothetical universal basic income, how would singaporeans feel?

But well, i digress. Maybe i feel triggered because there are possible self entitled (really not implying u) ppl who feel tt they deserve exact equals of locals. (despite not even having being converted to pink ic yet) Of course in this case, $100 is not a big sum of money. And by providing this, the main rationale is to help inject funds into the travel sector based on personal choice. 

This might be due to other factors like concerns over overcrowding. (my best bet) Or to appease singaporeans? Policies are never perfect and have their pros and cons.",t3_itnmk4,2020-09-17 08:59:49,matchabinqilin,2

It‚Äôs really interesting to see that perspective. And as a foreigner and EP holder I completely understand your position. I guess at the end of the day every country needs to look after its own. I would say 99% of foreigners understand that here. I think the only thing that truly feels a bit off living here atm as a foreigner is you can feel there is a tension in the air around us being here. I for one am so grateful for the opportunity to be here and have come here knowing how welcoming the country is. But things are changing and it‚Äôs gets harder to manage living here. So it might be time to leave soon. Some would rejoice, another foreigner gone, however I can‚Äôt help but wonder who is going to replace me as no one is Singapore is trained in what I do as there is no university course for it here or training opportunities as it‚Äôs an incredibly niche field. My company will simply move the role back to Europe or the US and the Singaporean economy will suffer as a result. It‚Äôs a lose lose I think. That‚Äôs just my perspective on the bigger picture here.

>COVID-19 presents policymakers with difficult trade-offs. Many governments in low- and middle-income countries have resorted to severe lockdown measures which impose high costs.

These unintended consequences **must** be weighed against the direct toll of an unmitigated pandemic.

295,gdeo9qz,t3_jzxueq,"> # Who will get SingapoRediscovers Vouchers and what can you do with them?

> SINGAPORE - From December this year, Singaporeans aged 18 and above will be given $100 worth of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers to spend on local attractions, hotel stays and tours.

> Here are some answers to common questions on the vouchers.

> 1. How much vouchers will you get?

> Each eligible Singapore citizen will receive $100 worth of vouchers to spend on approved hotel stays, attraction tickets and tours, as part of the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers scheme. The vouchers will be in denominations of $10.

> 2. Who is eligible?

> The SingapoRediscovers Vouchers will be available to all Singapore citizens aged 18 and above in 2020.

> All adult Singaporeans are also entitled to purchase up to six child or youth tickets for younger relatives under the age of 18, at $10 off per ticket. So, besides parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, other relatives and legal guardians can purchase such subsidised tickets.

> To do so, however, the adult must declare his familial relationship to the child or youth, and must have at least $10 left in your SingapoRediscovers Vouchers balance.

> 3. When can the vouchers be used?

> The vouchers can be redeemed from Dec 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.

> 4. What can I spend the tourism vouchers on?

> They can be used at all Singapore Tourism Board (STB) approved hotels, leisure attractions and local tours.

> As of Monday (Nov 23), STB said 230 hotels, 971 tour itineraries, 43 attractions and 230 hotels have been approved to resume operations.

> For now, the vouchers can be used at 178 hotels which represents about 77 per cent of hotels allowed to re-open.

> They can be spent on the tours offered by 79 tour operators.

> As for attractions, 39 of them, or 91 per cent meet the eligibility criteria for the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers.

> The full list of eligible merchants can be found here.

> 5. Can the vouchers be used on cruises, shopping and food and beverage and at weddings?

> Generally, no, even if a wedding package includes a hotel stay.

> But the vouchers may be used for retail and F&B only if they are part of an approved package including a hotel stay, attraction visit and/or tour.

> Such packages must meet certain criteria such as ensuring that the retail or F&B component is used during the same period as the hotel stay, attraction visit and/or tours.

> For instance, the vouchers could be used for a one-night room stay bundled with dinner for two at the hotel‚Äôs restaurant.

> Simlarly, vouchers can only be redeemed for cruises as part of a bundled package.

> 6. Can the vouchers be used all at once?

> You can decide on the value of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers you want to redeem for each purchase.

> Each voucher comes in denominations of $10 and any unused value in a voucher will be wasted. For instance, if you buy one $25 attraction ticket and use $30 worth of vouchers, the $5 leftover from the vouchers will be wasted. You can instead use $20 worth of vouchers and top up the remaining $5 with cash.

> You can check your current SingapoRediscovers Voucher balance at this website from Dec 1.

> 7. How do I redeem the vouchers?

> The SingapoRediscovers Vouchers can be redeemed online through five authorised booking partners: Changi Recommends; GlobalTix; Klook & UOB Travel Planners; Traveloka; and Trip.com.

> 8. Users can redeem their Vouchers by following these steps:

> - Have your SingPass ready. Citizens are encouraged to register for a SingPass account if they do not have one, or reset their SingPass password if they have forgotten it, before the scheme commences on 1 Dec 2020.

> - Choose your products. Browse the websites of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers authorised booking partners. Eligible products are marked ""eligible for SingapoRediscovers Vouchers"" or with the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers icon. Add your item(s) to the shopping cart. To pay, click ""Use SingapoRediscovers Vouchers"" at the checkout page.

> - Login with SingPass to:

> a. Select the voucher amount to use.

> b. Activate child/youth subsidies. If you are purchasing child/youth tickets, please declare details of any family members under the age of 18. Up to six child/youth tickets will be subsidised by $10 each.

> - A voucher code will be generated. Copy and paste this at the booking partner's checkout page, and pay the outstanding amount (if any). Payment modes may differ from merchant to merchant, but most debit and credit cards will be accepted for the payment of any outstanding amount.

> - You must complete the checkout process within 10 minutes. Your vouchers are only deducted after you have completed the booking.

> 9. Where can people redeem their SingapoRediscovers vouchers? Can non-seniors redeem them from physical counters?

> Authorised booking partners will provide assistance at 69 locations across Singapore, with most located within CCs or within a five-minute walk from CCs. Booking counters will also be available at selected malls and SingPost locations.

> Of the 69 counters, 30 are run by Changi Recommends, 23 are run by GlobalTix, and 16 are run by Klook and UOB Travel.

> Each physical counter caters for bookings from only one of the three mentioned booking partners. So a Changi Recommends counter only allows bookings for packages under it, not those by GlobalTix, for instance.

> STB advised customers to ascertain what packages they wish to book, before heading down to the physical counter nearest to them.

> If the counter does not have the package they wish to book, consumers can book them online or visit a physical counter by a booking partner which has the package.

> Non-seniors can also redeem their vouchers at these physical counters, although STB recommends that citizens redeem their vouchers online, and assist family members and friends who require help with online transactions.

> 10. Why do merchants have to pay a commission to booking platforms?

> When asked, STB did not say why booking platforms can charge merchants commissions. But it said that booking partners provide marketing resources to help Singaporeans discover eligible merchants.

> These partners also have the manpower to operate physical counters islandwide and the resources to provide customer and merchant support.

> 11. Will hotels, attractions and tours jack up their prices due to the vouchers?

> STB said it takes a serious view of practices such as profiteering and said it will penalise merchants found to have done so.

> 12. Are vouchers transferable between individuals and can they be pooled with other people's vouchers?

> Your SingapoRediscovers Vouchers cannot be stacked or combined with another person's within the same redemption.

> But you may purchase an eligible product using your vouchers, and transfer the product to another person provided the merchant allows it.

> For more information, please visit this website. A how-to video on how to redeem your vouchers is available online as well. Alternatively, a hotline (1800-2828-228) is open from 8am to 10pm daily, for those who might require further assistance.

Hey guys,  
  
Testing the waters to see how useful this is.  
  

I noticed the STB website only listed the names of the attractions and not much info. I've gathered the addressees, tripadvisor ratings and categories for the Attractions where you can use the Rediscover Singapore Vouchers. This is to hopefully kickstart some discussion and make it easier for you guys to decide where to use your vouchers.

> It has been about a month and a half since all Singaporeans received S$100 in SingapoRediscovers vouchers to spend on local hotels, attractions, and tours to support Singapore's tourism industry.

> For those of you out there who haven't decided how to use your vouchers, or who wish to put your vouchers toward a good cause, one option is to use them to purchase Singapore Flyer tickets for migrant workers.

> Initiative by ItsRainingRaincoats

> Through an opportunity organised by local community initiative ItsRainingRaincoats (IRR), Singaporeans can donate their SingapoRediscovers to migrant workers, a group that was hit disproportionately hard by the Covid-19 pandemic in Singapore.

> Here's how you can use your vouchers to fund one or more migrant workers to have the experience of riding the Singapore Flyer:

> 1. Go to the Klook link.

> The tickets can be purchased on Klook here.

> 2. Select the date and number of tickets.

> Scroll down to the package options. Click ""Check availability"" and select Mar. 8, 2021 as the date.

> Select the number of tickets that you wish to purchase. Each ticket is S$35, and includes entrance to the Singapore Flyer and its newest attraction, The Time Capsule.

> Once you have done so, click ""Book now"".

> 3. Log in or sign up for an account to proceed with the order.

> Once you have either logged in to or signed up for a Klook account, you will be directed to a new page to enter your booking info.

> Tick the box acknowledging that the purchase goes toward IRR, to purchase tickets for migrant workers.

> 4. Fill in your contact information

> 5. Select the ""Use SingapoRediscovers Vouchers"" option.

> Once again, click ""Use Singaporediscovers Vouchers"", which will open up a new window of the LifeSG SingapoRediscovers website.

> There, select ""Redeem vouchers"", which you can redeem using your SingPass.

> Select ""Copy voucher code"".

> 6. Enter voucher code(s).

> Back on Klook, paste the copied promo code(s) into the box.

> Select ""Redeem"", and then ""Book now"".

> You will be prompted to pay the difference, if you are topping up.

> IRR's Facebook post about the initiative is available here:
