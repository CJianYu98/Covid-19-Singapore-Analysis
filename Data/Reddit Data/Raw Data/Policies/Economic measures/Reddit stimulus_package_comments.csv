0,fmn83hz,t3_fw9242,"They have raised very good points. Many companies have forced their staff to take >25% paycut and no pay leave during this CB period, is it then still fair for them to apply for JSS for govt to pay 75% of their wages?",t3_fw9242,2020-04-07 08:43:21,chualibaba,67
1,fmn14ad,t3_fw9242,"Some points mentioned by Pritam and Sylvia are interesting:

>Mr Singh asked if the measures in the various schemes would represent a “new normal” for Singapore, especially after the nine months that several schemes in the Resilience Budget covers.

>“Will these schemes represent a new normal akin to a multi-year ‘New Deal’ to help Singaporeans cope and bounce back from economic hardship? For Singaporeans who will continue to see disruption and technology reducing their job prospects, can we expect continued support for them in the nine months after this package expires, particularly for training and wage support?” the secretary-general of the opposition party asked.

>The New Deal is an economic support package by the late American president Franklin Roosevelt to provide relief in the aftermath of the Great Depression from 1933 to 1939, and was arguably a temporary approach to help the United States recover.

>But it became a defining moment in American politics that cemented the US as a “welfare state with a strong federal government and a perennial national debt problem”, Mr Singh said.

Hopefully, there are longer term measures that will kick in when the economy gets better. Pritam is right,there needs to be caution when providing benefits to the whole nation for an extended period of time. Not to mention this includes the rich, instead of focusing on vulnerable groups.



>Later, WP chairman Sylvia Lim pointed out how the Jobs Support Scheme, for example, provides wage offsets to the employers rather than the employees directly. The scheme provides substantial government subsidy to businesses to help them pay the wages of their staff members in a bid to help them retain workers.

>However, Ms Lim said that many employers have already initiated cost management schemes by asking employees to take salary cuts, such as airline companies. 

>Retail employers, hard hit by the pandemic, have also asked their staff members to work reduced hours, while other employers in non-essential services have told employees that their job situation was not assured due to the stay-home measures, Ms Lim added.

>“To be sure, employers without revenue have to make tough choices, and I understand that. To that end, I know Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat’s speech included a hope that those who receive support will use the resources wisely and responsibly, and that the Government will not hesitate to take action against any abuse.”

>Ms Lim asked Mr Heng to clarify what would be a form of abuse by employers under the Jobs Support Scheme.

It's no secret that some companies are enacting pay cuts, like SIA. However, with Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), the question is how will it be enforced? 

The easy way out is looking at CPF contributions but that may be manipulated by unscrupulous employers. The hard part is potentially receiving thousands of complaints about reduced or unpaid leave once the JSS kicks in. Even once the JSS kicks in, companies with a lot of employees with above $4600 salaries will still suffer a lot. What will be their decisions?

Looking at the schemes and measures for COVID-19, hopefully the government has already planned properly how to properly enact them. 

Hopefully this will be unlike the property tax hoo-ha, social distancing measures' difficulty of enforcing or the work from home directives which clearly didn't deter most businesses from insisting their employees work from their workplaces.",t3_fw9242,2020-04-07 07:33:38,Dunkjoe,35
2,fxjy0em,t3_fw9242,"Not all companies use JSS payouts for SG'reans. JSS is saving companies but not singaporeans. For a reference, of a ratio of 4 foreigners to 6 SG/PR in a company, in addition to prolonged MOM's / TAFEP's advisory that companies are to have a fair workplace, local SME's Or MNC's, HR dept by default, will base their decision on fund management on these factors. The massive funds, in turn does not fully 'help' SG'reans save jobs, but the whole workforces' jobs, (40% foreigners inclusive and ~10-20% PR). The default decision made was contributed by prolonged periods of ""HR has to rule-keep if not companies will be blacklisted by MOM and quota will be reduced- again to save foreigners jobs"". 

Also, for SG/PR support grants that were issued, namely TRF and Covid-19 support grant, money was credited without thorough fact checking on the documents, reason being that govt knows that their people are in need of money / cash fast. 

I wouldn't say the stimulus is bad but it could have been more well thought, planned, executed and more well spent (for SG'reans). And again, this brings us back to the question that Jamus Lim raised.",t3_fw9242,2020-07-11 02:02:14,terrieblast,1

11,fmnwrrd,t1_fmnoahr,"So based on IRAS website, it's not exactly right. JSS first tranche is based on wage payouts from October 2019 to Dec 2019 AND the top up to April 2020 wages.

Also, the money can still go to the employers, but the employers are not bound to keep the employees even as they will get JSS payouts. This is tricky since many jobs are actually impacted this year starting in Feb 2020. In fact, the payout itself is to put more resources to firms and to really cut their costs, but employers have discretion on how they intend to use the rebates. Some will keep jobs as is, some will reduce wage bills and make people go on no pay leave.

18,flqm0rz,t3_fqfoz0,"Did some research on this. The total figure announced is a mixture of actual loans and tax breaks/loan guarantees. So, when Canada talks about a 82 billion dollar package, that includes tax breaks, support for individuals and tax deferrals as well. Arguably, some parts of it are loans that need to be paid back with little to no interest (hence lost is made on inflation), tax deferrals (hence no net loss) and cash payouts (net loss). Therefore, they are not really spending $x amount of money, more like small portions of that amount is actual money given away with no strings attached. 

As for borrowing from the future, well, this is going to saddle a lot of businesses with a lot more debt. More debts means you would be more risk averse. That means less hiring, less expansions, less spending, at least until people feel comfortable where they are at again.
