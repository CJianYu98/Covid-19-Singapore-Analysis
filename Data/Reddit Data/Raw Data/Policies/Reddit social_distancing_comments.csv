> SINGAPORE — With commuter numbers expected to rise when Singapore’s circuit breaker period ends on Monday (1 June), there “will be times when safe distancing will not be possible” on public transport, said Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan.

> “We have been able to ensure safe distancing so far because commuter numbers have plunged. From tomorrow onwards, it will be more challenging,” he said in a Facebook post on Monday.

> In the post, Khaw shared pictures of himself and a public transport worker removing safe distancing notices from seats on an MRT train and a bus, respectively. In another image, Khaw seen next to a poster at an MRT station for the SafeEntry app, with the minister describing its use as part of “the new normal”.

> “We still urge Singaporeans to work from home and for those who need to leave home, to stagger their time and avoid traditional peak hours,” said Khaw, who stressed the importance of commuters wearing masks “all the time”.

> Khaw also advised commuters to refrain from conversations and observe personal hygiene.

> Noting that many are looking forward to the end of the circuit breaker, which began on 7 April, he added that the easing of measures needed to be done “gradually and carefully”.

> “Unnecessary haste may lead to an uncontrollable spike and cluster. We do not want to have to hit the circuit breaker again,” said Khaw.

> From Tuesday, Phase 1 of Singapore’s re-opening will see businesses in sectors deemed at low risk of COVID-19 transmission being allowed to resume operations. Households will also be allowed to receive two visitors per day, while places of worship will be re-opened for private worship sessions. Primary and secondary school students who are in graduating cohorts will also be returning to school.

49,fsisars,t1_fsipvdy,"That's a good qn. I can't really give a comprehensive answer to that, but I'll say it's definitely within the realm of plausibility. Lower traffic during peak hours due to WFH schemes and not running certain bus lines allows redirection of manpower and buses to other lanes. Trains would be the one seeing the bottleneck, although that's presuming that 3min frequency is optimum give and take, and we want higher frequency to translate to similar travel time. We can have more trains on hold in between lanes, but that will be on the expense of time to take a more preventive measure. 

I think we shouldn't translate higher frequency to being faster too. It's just spreading the people to break them apart from crowding spots such as bus stops and train stations.

> SINGAPORE - Stricter safe distancing measures will be introduced to reduce the risk of further local transmission, the authorities announced, as Singapore reported another 40 Covid-19 cases on Friday (March 20).

> Keeping a safe space around individuals is especially important for vulnerable segments of the population, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said at a press conference.

> All events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.

> Events with fewer than 250 people and operators of venues accessible to the public, such as restaurants and cinemas, are also required to implement measures to ensure separation of at least 1m between patrons.

> The measures will apply across the board for all events, including religious and private gatherings.""

> Employers have also been strongly advised to allow their employees to work from home, or implement staggered working hours where telecommuting is not possible.

> Non-critical work events should be deferred and critical ones scaled down to no more than 250 participants at any one time.

> ""When combined with good personal hygiene, safe distancing measures can help to slow the spread of Covid-19"", said Mr Gan, who is co-chair of a multi-ministry task force to fight the coronavirus.

> He added : ""Our healthcare professionals are working hard to take care of patients. We don't want to add to their load, and therefore, it is important to add these measures to ensure our healthcare workers have the capacity to look after our patients.""

> Singapore has witnessed a recent uptick in new cases daily that has been largely due to a sharp increase in imported cases, as Singaporeans studying and working abroad return home from other countries where the number of infections continue to rise.

> Of the 40 cases confirmed on Friday, three-quarters were imported.

> There were only 33 imported cases from Jan 23 to March 9, with this number rising to 156 from March 10 to March 20.

> Imported cases have also nearly caught up with non-imported ones for Singapore's total of 385 cases.

> Stressing that is cannot be business as usual, task force co-chair Lawrence Wong, the Minister for National Development, said that the aim was to have fewer people out and about, and a reduction in social gatherings and any activity that could be a potential social vector for the virus.

> On how the safe distancing measures will be enforced, Mr Wong said this can be done in several ways.

> For example, food and beverage outlets that are licensed will have to close some tables.

> ""So it is not an option, it is not advisory, it is mandatory,"" he said.

> ""We will start tomorrow and it will take some time to roll out fully but we will aim to do so as quickly as possible.""

> He added: ""We do not want to see crowded venues, we do not want to see packed event halls. We should see more work from home, more takeaways.""

> ""We will be enforcing the rules. There will be some inconvenience but we also need all Singaporeans to cooperate. And if we are all very disciplined about this it will give us better control and enable us to control spread of virus.""

> Mr Gan had announced on Wednesday that non-Covid patients could be transferred to private hospitals to free up capacity at public hospitals.

> He also said there are plans to convert normal wards into isolation wards, and quarantine facilities into care centres for Covid-19 patients with less severe symptoms if the number of cases here continue to rise.

Unlike Wuhan, we don't have other provinces to channel supplies to us. Already other countries like Thailand are slowly turning off the tap on essentials like food. If we ""lockdown"" in the manner you suggest, how are we going to pay, and what can we offer in return? And if we *do* run out of these supplies we're gonna be in a *much* more sticky situation than with the virus alone. It's not trendy these days to mention this, but *thrashing the economy also results in loss of life*.

Then theres the issue of what a lockdown actually means. Its easy to say ""well, lets just give exceptions for essential services, like healthcare workers, people working in critical industries like water, telecoms etc"". But the devil is in the details: where do you draw the line? Obviously, clubs and pubs aren't essential. But what about hotels where you house the people in SHN: these need to be somewhat staffed as well, right? What about our military --- is that essential? And then you come to hawkers and restaurants: our frontline workers need to eat too, right? Even if you allow only for takeouts, the eateries still have to be open. Or our ports: we've got to ship in food and supplies from *somewhere*. Once you think about it further, you'd realize that after provisioning for these exemptions, you get something that is not too different from what we already have (and most certainly something that we're heading to).

And don't even get me started on the chaos which would ensue if this is declared immediately. If DORSCON orange already led to panic, what would a lockdown lead to? How do you enforce the lockdown against a tide of panicked people? Send the police and army? Will that make things better?

That's why I think we might as well bite the bullet and lock down. The Covid situation is fluid and we must adapt, just like how one moment we were told to support local attractions and the next moment to stay at home. Our infection graph was quite nice in Feb but started to spike once the overseas Singaporeans returned.

Singapore is a small country and our enforcement is good. From the generous budget, we know the govt can afford to pay full wages up to median salary for more than 2 mths (ie 25% salary over 3 quarters). With the borders as good as closed, just focus on clearing the virus from SG. Even if our curve has a long tail, I'll bet my last penny it will be shorter than the messy Europeans / Americans and our even messier neighbours.

With things under control, at least life can get back to some normalcy. Everyone will still have to scrape by, some are still screwed but at least we are not in this not-here-not-there limbo. During this time, the govt can also take the time to ponder how we ""leap ahead"" once the virus is over world wide.

270,flkq04e,t3_fpg7zx,"> # COVID-19: Fine or jail for not observing at least 1-metre social distancing in public

> SINGAPORE — Those who intentionally sit on a seat or stand in a queue less than one metre away from another person in public venues can be fined up to $10,000 or jailed a maximum of six months, or both.

> Such penalties also apply to those who intentionally sit on a fixed seat that is demarcated as not to be occupied in public venues, as well as those who take part in events held anywhere here with more than 10 participants.

> These and other social distancing regulations, along with penalties, were included in one of several updates made by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to the Infectious Diseases Act.

> These were published in the electronic version of the government gazette at 11pm, Thursday, less than an hour before all entertainment venues were to be closed till end-April.

> The same penalties apply for those who flout other social distancing regulations during the period between 27 March and 30 April, inclusive of both dates. Such regulations do not apply to proceedings of the Parliament or the courts.

> During this period, all events, regardless of size, must be deferred or cancelled, while social gatherings are to be limited to 10 people or fewer at any time.

> Public venues, such as retail malls, museums, and attractions, where contact is more transient, may remain open but only with precautionary measures in place.

> Separately, all centre-based tuition and enrichment classes have been suspended to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools. All religious services and congregations have also been suspended.

> The scope of violation for the regulations includes:

> This excludes any event that is conducted for business at a workplace or providing education in an educational institution.

> Among the 55 places of attractions that must comply are the Arts House, Asian Civilisations Museum, Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore Zoological Gardens and Gardens By The Bay.

> In an earlier update made by the MOH to the Act, patients who are issued a five-day medical leave by a medical practitioner certifying that they have acute respiratory symptoms are not allowed to leave their homes starting on the day the certificate is issued.

> Similarly, those who do not comply and leave their homes during the five-day period will too face a maximum fine of $10,000 or a maximum jail term of six months, or both. They can only leave their homes to seek medical attention.

> The same penalties apply to anyone who flouts the 14-day stay-home notice by leaving the place of accommodation or residence they are serving the notice in.

> Of the 683 COVID-19 cases here, 172 have fully recovered. 18 patients remain in the intensive care unit while two – a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man – have died.
