13,fs1g4t0,t3_grwbju,"> # Travelling or telecommuting – how COVID-19 could affect public transport costs in Singapore

> SINGAPORE: It could be more expensive to take the bus or train in future if telecommuting becomes the norm in the long term, even after the COVID-19 pandemic dies down.

> Lower ridership means a drop in fare revenues for operators. They may eventually have to adjust fares or rely on more government subsidies to ensure that public transport continues running, said experts.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The issue of costs and funding would also “depend critically” on how long safe distancing measures would be implemented on buses and trains, said Associate Professor Theseira, who heads the Singapore University of Social Science’s master of urban transport management programme.

> “What is affecting financing is safe distancing, because it forces us to operate a full schedule of services but with very low ridership per service run,” he said. “There is no way for any public transport system to break even with low ridership on board each vehicle.”

> Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan had said earlier in May that fare revenues have dropped by about 80 per cent during the COVID-19 pandemic, putting transport operators under “significant financial stress”.

> He noted that even as ridership has fallen, public transport operators have had to spend on additional cleaning and on deploying people to ensure safe distancing.

> Advertisement

> Additional costs incurred by operators are not ""adequately covered"" by current fares and will ""eventually have to be borne by operators and taxpayers"", Mr Khaw added.

> Public transport operators will have to cover some of the shortfall on their own and depend on more subsidies from the Government for the time being, said transport engineering consultant Gopinath Menon.

> “Fares may need to eventually rise so that the commuters also contribute their share instead of just the public transport operators and the Government,” he added.

> File photo of an MRT train against a backdrop of HDB blocks. (Photo: Jeremy Long)

> In the longer term, however, changes may have to be made to the pricing policy.

> “We have to look at a combination of pricing policy - not so much fare increases, but perhaps trying to spread out travel more - and perhaps other means of cost recovery such as earmarked taxes or charges,” said Assoc Prof Theseira.

> “For example, public transport in many cities is financed specifically from local taxes from businesses that benefit the most from public transport connectivity, such as those within some distance of train stations,” he pointed out.

> PREVENTING TRANSMISSION ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT

> 

> For commuters returning to work or school, they will have to be mindful of safe distancing rules.

> Experts note that measures to prevent crowding on buses and trains may be challenging to enforce after the circuit breaker period ends on Jun 1.

> That is why it is compulsory for commuters to wear masks.

> They should also avoid talking on the phone or to one another, noted Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.

> “These measures are aimed to minimise people from producing aerosolised droplets that go on to infect others or settle on surfaces,” said Prof Teo.

> “If there is very little contact between people and no conversation, then the chance of droplets being expelled will be significantly reduced, and this in turn reduces the risk of infection to fellow commuters.”

> Commuters wear face masks on an MRT train in Singapore on Mar 18, 2020. (Photo: Roslan RAHMAN / AFP)

> Other ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on public transport could include the regular testing of frontline workers such as drivers, as well as increasing the frequency of buses and trains, although Prof Teo noted that this would increase operating costs substantially.

> RETHINKING TRANSPORT

> As an alternative to crowded mass transit, some countries, including Italy and Colombia, are turning to cycling as a mode of transport.

> 

> France is investing 20 million euros (S$31 million) in subsidising bicycle travel, while Britain has announced an ambitious £2 billion plan to promote “active travel” modes such as cycling and walking.

> 

> While Singapore has its own initiative to encourage cycling - the Government plans to invest more than S$1 billion on cycling paths over the next decade - Assoc Prof Theseira believes cycling is not yet a “realistic alternative” for most commuters because of the long distances between population centres and workplaces, as well as the lack of dedicated cycling paths connecting the two.

> Singapore should continue to invest in public transport infrastructure, even if ridership were to decline in the longer term, said Assoc Prof Theseira.

> “Extensiveness of the network is different from intensity of services. We need an extensive network so that you don't need private transport and to provide redundancy,” he explained. “However, service frequency and intensity could be adjusted to save costs.”

>

> Transport consultant Mr Menon believes the coronavirus outbreak is an “opportune time” to review Singapore’s overall transport policies.

> Such a review should consider the provision of additional bus lanes and cycling lanes, and taking away lanes for motor vehicles, he added.

> “Otherwise, we go back to the old system where the cars still dominate, with nothing having been changed, and the pollution levels return.”

> In the longer term, Mr Menon hopes concerns over COVID-19 will also lead to greater decentralisation in urban planning - so people will be able to travel shorter distances for work and leisure - in addition to telecommuting and more flexible work arrangements.

> The long term increase in adoption of telecommuting in response to COVID-19 would be a “great thing for everyone”, said Assoc Prof Theseira.

> “Travel is actually economically inefficient. What we gain from economic activities around travel - such as supply of transport services, fuel and so on - is far outstripped by the value destruction from congestion, consumption of fossil fuels, environmental harm, time wasted,” he said.

> There would however be adjustment costs, he noted, pointing to the impact of reduced demand on the taxi and private-hire car sectors.

> “But while these costs may be painful to pay, a sustained reduction in local travel demand will eventually be better for the economy, because doing business without a need to physically travel is much more efficient,” he said.

49,fl6frhu,t3_fmwfh0,"I agree there is scope for discussion around this topic. SG is pursuing quite a different strategy from other nations. Time will tell whether it was smart or foolish. At the moment they are still holding well, and the evidence (cases, deaths) point to a viable strategy that they can continue.

I believe much of their decisions revolve around the single concept that this pandemic might stretch for months and months and months. Hence they postulate the scenario during planning: what if the schools are closed for 6 months, what will happen? when will it end? what is the indicator to close schools, what is the indicator to open schools? Have you considered this?

This is the same criteria for all other measures they are taking. 

Similar for work, they are discouraging travel, but not total lockdown. I believe we will see first a single-school lockdown, and if it spreads, then multiple schools, the entire school system. Alternatively, temporary short 'brakes', like a 14 day stop school, instead of perpetual. 

They have indicated many times they have lots of different options, but everyone keep asking, why not total lockdown, as if there are no other choices. 

If we get a crazy 1000 person local community transmission overnight all over the island without any trace, I am sure they will do the temporary lockdown.",t3_fmwfh0,2020-03-22 16:47:21,tenbre,24
50,fl6ev2d,t3_fmwfh0,"Okay, let’s try to answer a few questions before we proceed:

1) How long will the covid situation last? 

2) Do the benefits of a lockdown outweigh the costs?


Well, we don’t know how long it will last, when it will end, so you can’t go on a lockdown with no deadline. The situation is really not THAT bad to warrant a lockdown yet, although it might worsen. Do we know if it will worsen? No we also don’t. 

Now what benefits do a lockdown provide? It gives a temporary, and emphasis - TEMPORARY, relief to curb the virus from spreading. Will it mean the virus completely does not spread? No. Will the virus completely stop spreading when the time to end the lockdown comes? Don’t know. When do we end the lockdown? Don’t know too. 

This means complete economic uncertainty. You’re asking the government to promote economic uncertainty and inefficiency when it is already guaranteed we will enter a recession this year. A lot of people will lose their jobs. If you want the economy to return to normalcy as soon as the virus situation is over, then a lockdown is really not the best way. 

Ultimately a lockdown may occur, but everything is about the timing. Going straight into a lockdown now may bring more harm than delaying it by, say, two weeks. 

The situation is bad but it really isn’t THAT bad yet. YET. So wait and see will be the right thing. 

Now when will be the “right” time then? My guess would be when the number of unlinked cases start to rise, or (touch wood) even explode. Then that would definitely warrant a lockdown. For now, no. 

For example, look at the big hoo-ha surrounding that VJC teacher case. Did any other related cases explode from there? Did any VJC students get infected? Not that we know of, right? It’s okay to be careful, but letting fear overrule logical decisions and mathematical probabilities would really not be the ideal thing to do in this climate.",t3_fmwfh0,2020-03-22 16:27:35,flabberwabber,47

School closure is not the answer. 

Children do not watch themselves at home. 

Parents will have to take care of them. 

This means frontline HCWs and other essential services will lose manpower. 

There is already a strain on frontline HCW manpower, so it’s not a good idea. 

Children who are home may not stay home either. The parents might be tempted to bring them to Universal Studios or a playgym or go shopping perhaps. 

There is also no widespread local transmission. Most of the cases are imported - Singaporeans returning back from overseas. 

Closing down the city will impact many people’s livelihoods unneceaaarily.

Even in schools that are comparatively very innovative and accepting of new technologies and their implementation in schools, I'm looking at schools like Nan Chiau Pri that had a very innovative mobile learning system previously, I doubt it surprises anyone that they still prefer traditional schooling so long as the current state of education with its hard focus on continuous written papers and examinations persist.

And even if they were, let's be real, the people with the least confidence on this system is the parents. Would they really trust their kid alone at home in front of a screen to study?",t3_fmwfh0,2020-03-23 05:50:12,YipJK,5

Active cases: 290     
Imported cases: 228     
Non import: 62      
        
What does each of these numbers mean and which is more important? First, active cases is more important than total cases, since it represents the current situation more accurately. And active cases can be broken down to imported or local cases.     
           
Next, imported cases will have lessser impact than non import. These includes sg residents MFA rescued from overseas and tested/quarantined immediately.     
      
Last is the most important of them all, local cases. They are the most likely to spread the virus to others in sg, with each case potentially creating a cluster.    
        
So in my opinion, 62 local cases isnt cause for panic yet, and with the ban on short term visits, it seems manageable.

As there are no CCA for now, school hours can be stretched. Maybe some classes can be held in morning, some in afternoon. Or all odd register number morning session/ even ones attend afternoon session.
 
+ It could reduce crowding by half.

- school staff might have a longer working hour

The issue here is Singapore is trying to reduce business impact as well as contain the spread of the virus.
Like you said, if school close, parents need to take care of them which might affect the parent's work. If parents leave them be, some of them are going to meet anyways.


In your post, I don't see a solution give that meets the government's and people's need. If there isn't a balance between economical impact and controlling the virus I doubt the government will do anything too drastic",t3_fmwfh0,2020-03-22 19:27:10,Sproinkerino,-5

Let's be truthful, the only reason why schools are not lock down is because it is socially disruptive to working parents / single parents / shift workers.

In my opinion, there is a drastic lack of social support for school closures, and it shows how unprepared we are when it boils down to it. Everyone needs to help out, and most are unwilling.",t3_fmwfh0,2020-03-22 18:36:15,saperis,-11

78,fl6mql2,t1_fl6kqfs,"1) Until when will you extend the holidays? How many weeks? Will the situation be better then?

2) There is no “free” extension. Extending the March holidays means a shorter, or even complete removal of the June holidays. Students need a break, teachers also need a break. 

3) Exams cannot be postponed, unless you are asking the students to take their ‘O’ and ‘A’ levels next year. Students who are taking exams this year are severely disadvantaged. 

4) E-learning is a travesty. It’s ineffective, inefficient, and really unproductive. 

5) Teachers don’t get to work from home, but their kids are on stay home notice. If teachers work from home, they have to take care of their children.


Regarding your last point about the lack of social support, I guess I will have to agree with it to some extent. But it’s really not about support for school closures alone, because in this case you’re looking at a complete shutdown of the economy extremely abruptly - what you need is a superbly coordinated effort by every single member of society to support the lockdown, but we already know that is close to impossible (xia suay-ers, anybody?).",t3_fmwfh0,2020-03-22 19:18:28,flabberwabber,10
