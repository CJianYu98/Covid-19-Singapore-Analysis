> SINGAPORE: Working from home must be embraced as the new normal even as the country’s “circuit breaker” is eased gradually from next month, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Saturday (May 23) as he urged employers to adjust their mindsets.

> 

> Singapore will exit its circuit breaker period as planned on Jun 1, with measures to be progressively lifted in three phases. Under the first phase, businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks will be allowed to open but authorities have stressed that telecommuting must be used to the “maximum extent”.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Some requirements have been put in place. For instance, employees should only return to work if they need specialised equipment and machinery that cannot be accessed from home, or if they need to fulfil legal requirements such as to complete contracts or transactions.

> “On that basis, we expect most employees working in an office setting to continue working from home as they are presently doing,” said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the COVID-19 outbreak.

> Many employers and managers will need to adjust their mindsets to embrace this new normal, the minister added.

>

> “It’s no longer about having all your staff physically present at work. Even if they have to be on site, consider if they really need to do so every day,” he said, noting that “hybrid arrangements” could be made for employees to work from home for a few days in a week.

> 

> As for those who have to be in the office, employers must make sure that the work environment is safe by maintaining good ventilation and high hygiene standards. Employers can also put in place staggered work hours, he said.

> 

> “All these workplace measures are critical in our fight against COVID-19,” Mr Wong wrote. “They will reduce the need for daily movement of people, and minimise the risks of the virus flaring up again.”

32,frkw5xq,t1_frkr6um,"Telecommuting is just costly and requires changes to industry expectations and management practices. Aside from one-off fixed costs, like changing commercial long leases, IT infrastructure, networking, training, big factors include e.g. not relying on onsite presence to build relationships with clients or vendors. Or e.g., not relying on office presence to assess, monitor, reward, or discipline employees. 

These are things that can be done. They're just expensive to do, which is one reason they're often not done. But once a desk-job company pays these costs - when it adopts good WFH practices, like changing employee management techniques to assess performance in ways less reliant on physical monitoring, relying on bulletins and tasklists rather than in-person meetings to coordinate employees, etc., it will find that these changes also vastly increase the productivity of remote contractors and smaller satellite offices.

At that point, if remote employees *can* hail from places without an urban cost of living, then why not? If there's only a weak cluster effect on productivity after all, [why pack into everyone into Mountain View and pay ridiculous prices for employees to afford houses and schools and transport](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/technology/facebook-remote-work-coronavirus.html)? 

The same theoretically applies to employees too. If you can work from your home in Woodlands, then you can work from a home in Johor, where your cost of living could be much less. Unfortunately, unlike the big economies in North America and Europe, folks in our big cities can't pick up and just move to the small cities and towns to adapt to the new economy. Singapore *is* the big city. If there's a headwind which punishes the productive-but-expensive megacities relative to the dispersed-but-cheap towns, Singapore has no choice but to stay and suffer.",t3_gp27o6,2020-05-24 04:10:26,threesls,14

So I waited for the video of the full press con, and what I took away after watching is that they still maintain WFH as the default, but review will take place and it may allow for some relaxation in the future. The MMTF still hopes that WFH largely remains as default though:
