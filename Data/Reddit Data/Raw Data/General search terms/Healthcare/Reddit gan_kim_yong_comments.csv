2,fjmt9bv,t3_feaj68,I think it's inevitable that every country which has more than 10 cases will see a death.,t3_feaj68,2020-03-06 16:22:37,Subtle_Omega,10
3,fjmtp8i,t3_feaj68,btw why does Singapore have 107 cased but 81 of them have already recovered?,t3_feaj68,2020-03-06 16:32:19,Jakten2,1

5,fjmutba,t1_fjmt9bv,"I think it's inevitable that every country which has more than 100 inhabitants will see 10 cases.

I do think all 10 cases could survive though. Like Germany had 16 cases early on (like 6 weeks ago), all of them survived and are in the ""recovered"" state by now. (Obviously, some of the 600 current cases in Germany are going to die.)

And I do expect corona deaths in every country.",t3_feaj68,2020-03-06 16:57:41,couchrealistic,3
6,fjmu6sg,t1_fjmtp8i,"Because they tested everyone with pneumonia, not just people who came back from China, earlier than any other countries. They managed to slow down the spread, they knew it wouldn't stop the spread, but if they can slow it down, their health system won't be overwhelmed like South Korea and Italy now. Thanks to that proactivity instead of reactivity like other countries, they're able to treat each case much better. You see everyday they only have <10 case, that's definitely managable.",t3_feaj68,2020-03-06 16:43:23,daysof_I,17

8,fjmv8tr,t1_fjmu6sg,"Spread can be stopped by sufficient contact tracing. You may not catch all the infected in first try, but you can always try again with the new cluster grown from the missed spot, this continuously suppresses the outbreak. And if you never give up, you'll eventually succeed in catching all the infected. Of course, this is assuming there isn't a missed super spreader event. If you missed a pool instead of a stain, then you'll have to go into lock down.",t3_feaj68,2020-03-06 17:07:51,PfXCPI,2
9,fjmiqgj,t3_fe8hjg,"They’ve been doing a fantastic job but up until recently they really only had to watchout for travelers coming from China, now it’s travelers from South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran... with a global pandemic they’re really no way to stop it from getting in unless you willing to just cut yourself off entirely from the outside world and there’s no way Singapore, as a global economic hub, can do that.",t3_fe8hjg,2020-03-06 13:15:52,SPECTREagent700,8
10,fjmj32g,t3_fe8hjg,"This is NOT encouraging for California, the US, Europe or the rest of the world. If Singapore , a tiny city state, with a good healthcare system,excellent centrally directed planning and a compliant educated population is planning assuming that they cannot contain it enough to the point of insignificance in the medium term...that means everyone else IS definitely going to be stuck with this for many many months at the minimum.",t3_fe8hjg,2020-03-06 13:20:49,,5

14,fjmjdn0,t1_fjmj32g,I don’t think most people think containment is possible. It’s now all about slowing the spread to not overwhelm hospitals. This will likely become endemic so we should prepare to live with it.,t3_fe8hjg,2020-03-06 13:25:05,ValuableEquivalent2,5
