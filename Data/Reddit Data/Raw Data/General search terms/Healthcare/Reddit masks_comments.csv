11,gk5z1f1,t3_l2lrie,"> # Diners to wear masks when tossing yusheng, no 'shouting' of auspicious phrases: Lawrence Wong

> Those dining out during the CNY period should keep their face masks on during the tossing of yusheng, the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) announced in a press conference on Jan. 22, 2021.

> Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong said during the press conference that they had anticipated a greater level of transmission in Phase 3 due to the increased interactions in the community.

> ""Indeed, in the past two weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of locally-transmitted cases,"" Gan added, saying that some of these cases have resulted in community clusters.

> Given the situation, Covid-19 safe management measures will be tightened during the CNY period, including measures such as limiting the number households that a family should visit.

> Lohei practices

> Regarding dining out, the MTF said that face masks must not only be worn during the tossing of yusheng, but lohei should also be done without any verbalisation of auspicious phrases.

> Minister for Education Lawrence Wong said, ""There should be no shouting of auspicious phrases by the F&B staff or by the patrons in the restaurant.""

> He also said that we have to be ""especially careful"" during this CNY period.

> F&B establishments and enterprises serving lohei must ensure that both the staff and patrons comply with these requirements.

> The maximum group size for social gatherings outside the house will remain at 8 people for now, but people are encouraged to keep their social circle small instead of mixing with multiple groups.

> Stepping up enforcement checks at F&B outlets

> There will also be more enforcement checks at F&B establishments, malls and other crowded public spaces during this period.

> Strict enforcement actions will be taken against individuals and operators who do not comply with safe management measure.

> The penalties include fines and prosecution in court, depending on the severity of the offence. For operators who do not comply with the measures, their operations will be suspended.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here

The woman allegedly spit at a man and poured soup on him, or something to that regard. She was not getting arrested only for not wearing a mask. 

Also, yes, masks are conpulsory here. As long as you are outside you are required to wear one. Failure to follow the rules would lead to probably a $300 SGD ($220.62 USD) fine and that's about it, but you'll get worse punishments if you are a repeat offender.

No

3) Is that person fair?

Once I had happily bought an ice cream from United square in novena and walked to novena sq via the nearby underpass which connects both novena square and novena mrt.

Happily minding my own business as I was going down the escalator slurping my ice cream when this guy asked at me from behind NO EATING IN THE TRAIN STATION!!!

In my mind I was like I am not eating in the train station. This is an underpass that connects to the train station but not the train station itself. I scolded him by shouting back this is not the train station there's no sign saying I can't. We had some unpleasant exchanges. He said he's an SMRT staff so he knows. If I wasnt in a rush, I would have brought him to the train station itself and hopefully have him scolded by the train station guys if he was an imposter.

End of the day I was right. Emailed SMRT and they replied underpass not part of train station

If it were me or any one of my local brown friends, we'd cuss his ass out and totally tell him to go back to China without inhibition (we'd cuss him in fluent Bahasa Kebangsaan, too, to see how he deals with it. Probably throw a lil ""pendatang"" in there while we're at it or tell him to stfu lest he infects us with the Wuhan), and we'd get a great kick out of it. Born-and-bred Malay and Indian Singaporeans don't have the same inhibitions that you may have when it comes to delivering a stinging rebuke to belligerent racists that provoke us because there isn't a power differential between us and the local racists (as opposed to the citizen > foreigner power differential which makes the latter less inclined to take a stand.)

 I believe ignorance is the cause of the man's behavior, he may believe that is the right thing to do; I don't know why, maybe he read something on the internet that enraged him or something. Probably with the racism against asians due to covid19 going around in many European countries right now. However, he must know that not all caucasians are racist, and it's only a few, and therefore, he is most probably wrong if he were to judge someone by their skin colour.

As much as I disapprove the man's behavior. In every country, there will be ignorant people. If you let them get to you emotionally like how he did, then he won.

Singapore is super welcoming and a multicultural country which welcomes all races, but there’ll always be that 1/50th man who will try his absolute best to kick out every foreigner from his country. Earlier this year, a fucking security guard of my own condominium yelled at my brother for having his mask down when cycling out. When my brother told him that you’re allowed to remove it while cycling, the bitch literally called him “a motherfucking Indian” and came ahead to physically assault him.

Yeah, we did report him and he got transferred out. But now he still works at a mall 500 meters away run by the same security guard agency. Having personally known every single security guard in the condominium, they were aware of the fact that we are friendly, outgoing people who wouldn’t unnecessarily pick fights.

This was during the lockdown, and the security guard was probably brought in from overseas due to a shortage of labor.

It is sad, but once in a blue moon, it does happen. What does relieve me is that, for every 1 in 50 idiots, there are 49/50 welcoming locals who’ll always smile and welcome foreigners for who they are.

Fast forward a few minutes, was heading to Tori-Q to buy lunch, when I saw the same guy walking towards me. That level 1 entrance/exit was divided into two for crowd control purposes so if you were along the entrance corridor you had to walk one big round to get to the exit corridor and leave.

u act like other races arent racist to chinese ppl in western countries? for example its notorious of black and asian communities to have tiffs. BUT there are always those that look pass their differences and bond together.  same as any other race. 

I find it disheartening u think in singapore its sinkie vs ""amdk"" ang moh big shot. ur blatantly discriminating against white ppl here. im not sure what bad experiences u have had but dont stereotype so many ppl of different backgrounds, social classes, values, personalities into ur own personal bad experience. 

im a half chinese half white American singaporean working a blue collar job having to speak chinese at a company where malay is the main language of communication, followed by chinese. I failed chinese in my o levels and the agent from a recruit company alr ripping 
me off lied to me it was english speaking when I  went from a horrible previous job with miscommunication and honestly bullying with chinese as the main language. why do I feel ashamed, scared to speak about experiences of me living in singapore as my race. why  do I feel better that I can come off as non white person because my features can look like a non white person too? 

u act like there arent singaporean big shots ? Malaysian big shots? Indian  big shots ? Chinese big shots? other country expat big shots etc;? I read there are singaporeans respected and high up the hierarchy of the cooperate world in other countries like Australia. on a post like this that is suppose to deter xenophobia, please refrain from a comment like urs spurring xenophobia towards white ppl in singapore. nothing good comes from judging a person based on a race. we cant and should not want to change the color of our skin, the features on our face, just because majority of the ppl decided that this particular minority group can be discriminated against. increasingly and scarily among young singaporeans white ppl are the easy to pick on group in singapore. theres so many reddit posts against white ppl, im worried for the future that we will find white ppl become even worse the scapegoat of discrimination but its fine cos for some reason ppl like to justify their racism with racism.


 I definitely dont want to come off as victimizing myself and excusing that ppl sometimes treat me badly because of my race. I want to always strive to be better, more understanding, communicative and productive, but I definitely have lapses in doing so. honestly think sometimes ppl are welcoming, intrigued and well responding. Ive been told I was attractive solely because im mix which is weird. its just im a reserved person that can come off as rude and anti social. its like if a singaporean etc chinese is like that its fine but for my race it ""stands out"" as stuck up or rude. my sibling was literally called ""hao lian yang ren"" for just stacking things on a shelf. what the fuck? its just been clicking in my mind that all these posts on reddit are revealing the true underlying (racist) feelings of singaporeans that can affect how they see a white person that deeply disturbs me.. my white American father  was abandoned by his parents and raised by his abusive uncle working on a farm. packed his bags and left at 18. faced a lot of racism and discrimination and got scammed a lot in asian countries even tho he was not well to do. his Sister was shot by a black man to steal her purse, (this really affected him because he was very close to her) . he got ganged up on and beaten by a group of black man for playing a game of pool in the wrong bar. I have to say this has influenced my thought process, I have no prejudice against black ppl, well by the definition ""Prejudice is an unjustified attitude or opinion, usually a negative one, directed toward an individual for something the individual cannot control"" I really try not to, but i get very annoyed by posts like these, I dislike the blm movement  that were about supporting george floyd heavy on drugs and stealing a pregnant lady things at gun point, ppl going around destroying white businesses and bullying white cops.
we always will want to one up each other, be smarter be better, or else u become the loser. I see that black ppl have had fought for their rights and rightfully taken it. and white ppl shouldnt stop to fight for theirs. either way in singapore at least u shouldnt be judged by race but by merit to build a democratic society, based on justice and equality, so as to achieve happiness prosperity and progress for our nation.",t3_key66f,2020-12-22 15:23:48,shimishimayeshimo,2

The people there are mostly very friendly; Singaporeans can learn a lot from the Aussies and Kiwis.

You will face bigotry both because you are upper middle class and because you are non white. They also resent the asian work ethic stereotype. Also coupled with the the fact that career opportunities are scarce, your ability to launch into a career there will be difficult. You know how Singapore's economy is a giant reit with a port attached, and how it causes career disadvantages for everyone here who isn't Ho ching or Ng Teng Fong? Australia is like that on steroids, if it were possible to imagine such a thing. The economy is dominated by property speculation and diggingthings put of the ground. Their government favors this sort of economicactivityover everything else. Mining and agriculture can be technologically demanding, but Australia imports all the tech for this. Between the racism and scarce opportunities for skilled value creation in the economy, you might be making things difficult for yourself.

I've been living in Australia (Brisbane) for the past 13 years and I must say that Australia feels a lot less racist and a lot more multicultural than Singapore, barring the occasional bogans (Australian Ah Bengs). 

I've had new neighbours inviting me for dinners and drinks, random strangers saying good morning in passing on the street, stopping and asking if I'm alright if I'm stopped on the bike path tinkering with my bike. 

The daycare centre my kid goes to is staffed and attended by people from \~20 different countries (I counted).

615,gg8s7ic,t1_gg7ztw4,"I mean, I did acknowledge that racism exists everywhere. Perhaps the most inclusive places (that I’ve heard of) would be NZ and Canada then. I guess I was very blessed that in the four years that I lived in Canberra, I didn’t really experience severe cases of racial discrimination. It could also be that Canberra tends to be a uni/student town, more educated, and the local families who live there are very comfortable with international students and actually reach out to us to make us feel at home while abroad. Been to Sydney many times on trips and it definitely doesn’t feel as “warm”. Sydney is just a big city like any other. The likelihood of there being racist people is just higher.

As for making white friends, I’ll agree that for me personally, I’m pretty introverted so I found it hard to get close with them (also I don’t enjoy clubbing so that’s a lot of social events in the hall that I missed out on haha). I definitely found it easier to connect with my Korean Australian friends etc. The caucasian aussie that was close to us grew up in Taiwan so culturally, we found it easier to connect with him, but he also made the extra effort to connect with international students. That’s not to say that white Aussies were unfriendly or racist; I have many extroverted SG friends who integrated with the (white) locals very well. I’d say that generally it does take more effort on both sides to reach out to make a connection. The people at the local church I joined really went the extra mile to help internationals feel at home in Canberra; they became our family for the years we were there. We tend to flock to the social circles we’re most comfortable with. Same thing probably happens in SG unis.",t3_key66f,2020-12-18 20:03:39,pbtoastt,0

618,gge0j9r,t1_gga9kqd,"Late 90s and early oughts. I was there for all of my teens. I went back as part of work a few years ago when I still worked for a certain big yellow American heavy equipment company. The urban areas are slightly less racist. There is a huge international student bubble that you can get lost in and never have to see a local. The rural areas are even more racist than I remember. The problems with the Australian economy are even worse right now, even as the place has become a lot more prosperous for that sizable minority of people who have their fingers in real estate, agriculture and mining. If you are a property speculator, a miner or a farmer and have not found a way to rent seek off of these industry, Australia is going to be a terrible place. Extremely expensive with no opportunities.

The thing with the US is that there are an abundance of good schools. Many non brand name mid western schools count over a dozen nobel prize winners as their alumni. They have very strongly funded research programs such that you will have access to career enhancing research opportunities even as an undergraduate. The quality of instruction is typically very high at a good school. The thing with the US are so many of these schools that you will almost certainly get in to one of them as long as your grades are even slightly competitive.--Of course surviving to graduate may be a different matter, but the key thing is that if you are late bloomer and are willing to work hard, you can punch above expectations. I went in with good grades, but I feel that this is is a system that I strongly prefer over systems like Singapore's where there is all kinds of pointless and invented rationing of opportunities for the sake of elitism. There will be opportunities for you to participate in engineering design teams building cars aircraft and machinery for competitions. These teams tend be democratic in the US and open to everyone prepared to contribute, even those who are not engineering students.The research and the engineering teams I was part of made finding a job out of University very easy. It made finding internships in University relatively easy even though I was disadvantaged by the H1B visa nonsense.

 I heard from my Australian colleagues that Australian universities ration these opportunities for favored students and they are certainly not open to everyone. I invite you to take a look at your prospective university's formula student team. This is an important indicator even if you aren't planning to be an engineer. You will likely find that even as these Australian universities happily take your money, they will reserve the best opportunities for white students. This is true at all levels of Australian society The same is simply not true of the US. I still mentor my old student design teams. The leadership in my shell marathon team has had exactly 2 white guys in the last 10 years. Both this team and the FSAE team are majority non-white. Both team have recently been led by women. No one had to tell them to be diverse. There was no diversity program or any shit like that. Just being open to the contributions of people regardless of race made things this way.  I am very proud of this and would be very happy if my kids could go to the same school when they are older. 

The other advantage that choosing the US would have is that, unless you pick a university in downtown NYC or SF or LA, your cost of living is going to be hugely lower. Fees at a midwestern public University are comparable or lower than an Australian University. Many US college town have decent amenities and are near enough to have the big cities to make weekend trips feasible, but not near enough that you wind up paying over 500USD a month in rent even right now. Owning a used car is cheap and the US is sufficiently relaxed about tuning and so on that you can really get something cheap and fix it up into something nice. Working on your car there is seen as a human right. It is a very different environment to Singapore and you will find it to be a great opportunity to learn many new things and make friends that will follow you for a long time.",t3_key66f,2020-12-20 03:05:37,Paullesq,2

From what I understand, the initial advice from the govt to not wear masks was because singaporeans were stocking up heavily on them, and this caused a shortage esp to those who really needed them (healthcare workers, those who were actually sick etc). That’s why our govt said to wear masks out only if we were sick (just in case it was COVID). Now that the shortage is more or less dealt with, and our local (and untraceable) cases here are increasing, the govt is saying to wear masks if we go out - as we may be asymptomatic carriers. Soon they will give out reusable masks to households.

(We apparently have plants producing respirators locally, but I don't think Singapore would forcefully nationalise assets belonging to foreign companies.)

As we saw more cases and collected our own evidence of asymptomatic transmission, they probably knew a mask would be helpful, but likely didn't want to cause a frenzy by advocating masks when it was so difficult for the general public to buy any. They only made the announcement when they were ready to offer masks for every household.

Not just a case of 'immediately produced'. Back in Jan, when Taiwan got news of people having an unknown pneumonia + Chinese citizens snatching up masks and health supplies overseas, they went out to purchase mask-making equipment instead. The tensions across the Taiwan strait meant that Taiwan was very up to date, compared to other countries (minus Japan/US). The government eventually went to all the mask making factories, offered them the machines (for free, on conditions) and offered them extra manpower (their conscripts) to use the machines.

They recently donated 10 million masks to EU, US and other countries. That was less than a day of their production amount.

While the latter, waiting for concrete evidence before taking action is too reactive and slow, when one considers that the cost of the action (everybody mask up, even if not surgical) is relatively low compared to the consequence of the inaction. In other words, a proactive approach of getting everyone to mask up (even with cloth mask), when there's no strong evidence of asymptomatic transmission yet but one can infer that it's possible (for asymptomatic transmission) and that low symptom expressing infected may not wear masks if it's not normalised for everyone to wear it in public, might result in a circuit breaker being unnecessary now.

The appeal to international or superpower authority is just intellectually dishonest IMHO. I've seen over the years WHO, CDC and what other countries' say and do being used as a justification for various decisions. However, if one looks clearly, they're often merely cherry picking what backs their choices. Also, if one's choices are grounded in logic and evidence, there's no need to appeal to authority. Appeal to authority here is used to placate the masses, but also as a convenient scapegoat to blame when decisions turn out to be bad in hindsight.

> If they changed their stance early on, there just be a rush of hoarders. We don't want a situation like in the US or UK where the healthcare workers don't have PPE and are having to re-use them or MacGyver up their own plastic protection.

This is actually a moot point. The government controls the supply of surgical masks and rice. Hence, it's not possible for PPE for public healthcare workers or for food for emergency rationing to gone as a result of consumer hoarding.

What's important now is for the CB to work so we can regain some normalcy ASAP.

As for the initial misstep regarding masking up in public, it's not something I really want to harp about, to attribute blame or whatever. It is however, something worth analysing, whether it's about government decision making, to the public relying too much on the Govt and hence not go beyond the prescribed recommendations (arguably though, in the initial phase, it was actual active discouragement from wearing masks. Though it was changed later, could the initial strong discouragement have contributed to low mask wearing even when the discouragement advice was dropped?), to the public following the letter but not the spirit of the law etc.",t3_fx7dg3,2020-04-09 06:30:08,musr,6

There is already a shortage of surgical and n95 masks, it's a global issue. That's why they're resorting to giving out reusable cotton masks for regular people even if they're not as effective. 

We don't know how long this pandemic is going to last and we don't know how large is the stockpile of masks. Food isn't really a concern, PPE for healthcare workers is seeing as how many of the big countries are under equipped.

For Taiwan, everybody had the distrust. For HK, their govt is aligned to the CCP and it's the HK people who fought tooth and nail for several preventive measures to be implemented.

For Singapore, our govt is afraid to anger the CCP, so we didn't ban Chinese arrivals until another country started it, or WHO announced something (cannot remember exactly). It's not too bad as the damage done by Chinese visitors was limited.

That our govt behaves in a reactive and not proactive fashion (imo) with regards to the pandemic, is a problem here, compared to HK, because our people trust the Govt compared to the HK people:

Q: Does wearing a mask cause you to be exposed to MORE virus than not wearing? (ie virus created out of nothingness or able to replicate without a host)

A: No.

Q: Does the probability (p) that an outside droplet containing COVID19 reaches the protected nose/mouth of the mask wearer go down?

A: YES! It's illogical to even suggest p(no mask) <= p(mask) when a other distance & handwashing regimens are done. Arguments surrounding touching outside mask, improper use, you still need to social distance, or in the case of surgical mask: (droplet can go under mask), are all logical fallacies! Learn how to quickly identify fallacious arguments since this one is the 'Strawman argument'! Answering an argument NOT presented.

NEVER accept a statement about anything from someone using a clear strawman argument.

I claim: Never let perfection be the enemy of the good. As such, the statements above are a dishonest way to argue this scenario. No claim is EVER made by ANYONE that N95 or surgical will bring p=0!!!

This thought experiment is NOT proof. But ponder if you really believe p=0 for mask wearers inhaling the virus.

We know that SARS-CoV-2 transmits via droplets. We know surgical masks stops droplets. In theory it should be effective.

And it is. Data from various countries suggest that the infection rate per day is lower in those countries whose citizens wear masks. These were the numbers taken from Wikipedia on 21/03, either 30 days' worth of data or 14 days' worth.

HK: 4.17% (30), masks worn by the average citizen (i.e. not obviously sick)

Taiwan: 6.90% (14, infection rates before then are too low), masks recommended

Japan: 8.96% (30), masks worn

Singapore: 5.00% (30), masks worn by some despite lack of recommendation

Italy: 53.2% (30) (at least 20% even excluding the outliers that are greater than 100%), masks presumably not recommended

Spain: 36.5% (30), masks presumably not recommended

France: 26.6% (14, same reason as Taiwan), masks not recommended

Germany: 28.1% (14, same reason), masks presumably not recommended

UK: 27.2% (14, same reason), masks not recommended

Canada: 23.2% (14, same reason), masks not recommended

USA: 35.1% (14, same reason), masks not recommended

I didn't add South Korea because I wasn't familiar with whether they used masks when I was making the list, but they are a country whose people wear masks. But from the countries here, you can see that all of the countries whose people wear masks have an infection rate of less than 10% while those who don't have infection rates of greater than 25% per day.",t3_futju9,2020-04-07 11:48:21,Vampyricon,1

797,fl00equ,t3_flq8e1,"1) Not easy to buy one now. Different quality different price but prices have gone up a lot, like maybe 5x.

2) About 30% wears masks now. I think most people are willing to wear masks now but we can't get enough because most of the supply is reserved for the medical field now.

3) To be honest my opinion is that wearing masks definitely trumps not wearing one. The hard part going for Singapore is, there is a global supply crunch for masks and Singapore doesn't make enough for everyone. Hong Kong on the other hand, has the full backing of China with regards to that. That's the cold hard truth imo.",t3_flq8e1,2020-03-20 14:42:30,pendelhaven,9

I've seen photo of S$29.90 for a box of 50pcs of low quality masks.

> - In your estimate, what's the percentage of people (locals / foreigners) wearing a mask in the street and at the office?

Unemployed so no office stats. In the street my guesstimate is 10-30%.

> - What are you thoughts on Singapore govt's recommendation to wear masks only if you are sick vs Hong Kong's wearing mask at any time anywhere?

Our govt say wear mask when sick and Singaporeans mostly believe the government.

Isn't it the case that HK's mask up everywhere is an organic movement by the citizens and not what the Govt enforce? Kudos to you HKers.",t3_flq8e1,2020-03-20 15:02:23,musr,5
801,fl0fdg6,t3_flq8e1,"I got masks when I went overseas last time cos I have sensitive nose (Japan masks are so comfy), had some masks at home bought when I was sick last year and my boss insisted on making me go work. Also got some cloth masks and mask cover. Have been trying to get masks from overseas too. Will wear mask when I go out for work, try to stay home when I don't have work. 

Have seen some shops selling a box of 50 for $29? Quality seems to be meh though. 

I will say there are more foreigners than Singaporeans wearing mask. A lot of PRC Chinese wearing mask from what I observe. Maybe they have friends who told them about the situation so they got the masks earlier? I don't know. 

I would support mask up if you go out, but that might not be possible for SG since there is a shortage of masks in SG. Masking up works because you don't know who is infected, they might not even be showing symptoms. Looking at Taiwan and Korea (many masking up and they have their situation under control now), I would say mask up if you can.",t3_flq8e1,2020-03-20 19:41:54,maolyx,1

Given that WHO, European and American CDC and the Singapore govt all say not to mask up unless you are sick, it looks to me that masking up for healthy people is more about relieving anxiety rather than helping from a medical perspective.
