> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 18 new COVID-19 cases on Friday (Feb 12), including two cases in the community who are linked to the Chinatown Complex stall owner who had earlier tested positive.

> There were 16 imported cases, who were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving their notice, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its update.

> Advertisement

> The two new community cases are the Chinatown Complex stall owner's 33-year-old son and 62-year-old wife.

> The 66-year-old stall owner and his other son, 32, were reported as COVID-19 cases on Thursday.

> The four of them form a new cluster linked to the stall owner, identified as case 60138, said MOH.

> Advertisement

> The 33-year-old son, who is unemployed, was identified as a close contact of case 60138. He was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on Feb 10.

> The Singaporean man was tested for COVID-19 on Feb 11 even though he was asymptomatic. His test result came back positive on the same day, and he was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) by ambulance.

> His serology test result has come back positive.

> The stall owner's wife, a homemaker, was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on Feb 10 when case 60138 was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection.

> The Singaporean woman was tested for COVID-19 on the same day even though she was asymptomatic. Her test came back positive on Feb 11 and she was taken to NCID in an ambulance.

> Her serology test result came back negative, indicating that this was likely a current infection.

> Epidemiological investigations are ongoing, said MOH.

> 

> EFFECTIVE CONTACT TRACING KEY: MOH

> All the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine.

> They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that asymptomatic cases can be detected.

> MOH said it will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.

> ""Effective contact tracing is an important enabler to ringfence community transmission,"" added the ministry.

> MOH noted that both stall owner's wife and 33-year-old son do not use the TraceTogether app, and while they both have TraceTogether tokens, they did not carry their tokens with them.

> ""Individuals are reminded to turn on their TraceTogether app or carry their TraceTogether token at all times so that we can quickly identify and isolate the close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and limit further infections,"" said MOH.

> Two supermarkets within shopping malls in Pasir Ris were added to MOH's list of places visited by COVID-19 cases during their infectious period.

> The NTUC FairPrice at Pasir Ris West Plaza was visited on Feb 3, Feb 6 and Feb 10, while the Sheng Siong Supermarket at Elias Mall was visited on Jan 29, Feb 5 and Feb 9.

> 16 IMPORTED CASES

> One of the imported cases, a long-term visit pass holder who arrived from Indonesia, arrived from Indonesia on Nov 26 last year and served stay-home notice at a dedicated facility until Dec 10, said MOH.

> His swab done on Dec 6 while serving his notice was negative.

> He was asymptomatic and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on Feb 10 in preparation for his return to Indonesia.

> His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, although the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load.

> His serological test result has also come back positive.

> ""He reported that before his trip to Singapore, he had interacted with his sibling in Indonesia who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection in October 2020.

> ""Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others,"" said MOH.

> Three permanent residents who returned from India and Indonesia were also among the 16 imported cases.

> One imported case is a dependant's pass holder who arrived from the UAE.

> There were also four work-pass holders who arrived from Myanmar, the Philippines and UAE among the imported cases.

> The remaining seven imported infections involved work permit holders who arrived from India, Indonesia and Myanmar. All except one of them are domestic workers.

> 11 MORE CASES DISCHARGED

> MOH said on Friday 11 more COVID-19 cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. A total of 59,569 patients have fully recovered from the infection.

> There are now 31 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, with one patient in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Another 148 cases are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> 

> 

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday said the bulk of Singapore's economy is expected to recover this year after last year's drubbing from the COVID-19 pandemic.

> Some sectors - such as transport, tourism and aviation - may take a longer time to do so, Mr Lee told reporters after visiting Singapore Airlines and Changi General Hospital staff members on the first day of Chinese New Year.

From the research done by NCID, MOH discharges people who continue to test slightly PCR-positive 21 days after their first positive test assuming symptoms have resolved.

Eventually, the world will reopen, and naturally, infections will happen again. The vaccine isn't 100% and some people can't get it because of allergies or preexisting conditions. However, we can manage the risk while opening up by slowly relaxing lockdown restrictions, rather than suddenly returning to 2019. Some people will still get sick, but we won't have a US or Europe style uncontrolled spread if we maintain some social distancing and vaccinate quickly. This way, the economy can still keep running, and the citizens can mostly resume our daily life.

New Zealand and Australia have a mostly self-sufficient economy and can survive as a hermit for years until their population is vaccinated. We rely on foreign workers to supplement our workforce, and foreign trade to supply our basic goods. Locking down completely will cause companies to close, jobs lost, and ultimately more suffering for workers. Once again, risk management is key. Our hospitals can cope with a small number of cases; the mortality rate in Singapore is tiny compared to overseas where hospitals got overloaded.

However, if you CB earlier to squash any existent cases before it spreads too far, you might save yourself from an even longer (potentially months long) CB further down the line. Like maybe a 2 week CB right now, monitoring the cases, would be sufficient to allow for this mini-bubble of cases to peter out. Rather than waiting 2 months until it starts exploding again and we are back to having thousands of cases a day (it's possible) and we need to have another CB from March to July.",t3_l0lohk,2021-01-20 09:28:38,DatAdra,8

CB is needed when there are too many unidentified source infections in the community, which is now.

Therefore, CB need to comes in, to break everyone up for 2 weeks to minimise spread. You can have your social lives back when this outbreak is nipped at its bud.

> On Jan 18, as she had been identified as a close contact of Case 59429, she was contacted by the health ministry and taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and tested for COVID-19 when she reported these symptoms.

> Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day. Her serology test result has also come back negative.

> ""We strongly urge everyone to do their part to reduce the risk of transmission. Those who are unwell, including those showing early/mild symptoms, should be socially responsible and seek medical attention immediately and stay at home to prevent the spread of illness to others,"" said the health ministry.

> 

> The third case linked to BS Industrial & Construction Supply on Wednesday is a 28-year-old Malaysian woman. The work pass holder, known as Case 59474, works as a finance personnel.

> She developed a cough on Jan 19. On the same day, she was placed on quarantine as a close contact of Case 59429, and was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital when she reported her symptom.

> She subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and was warded at NCID on the same day. Her serology test is also negative.

> The health ministry said investigations are ongoing to assess if there was any breach of the relevant prevailing safe management measures at their workplace. The Government takes a serious view of any breach and will take actions should there be non-compliance, added MOH.

> 

> The Case 59429 cluster at BS Industrial & Construction Supply now has a total of four infections.

> The remaining community case is a 46-year-old Indian national. The man, known as Case 59473, works as a software engineer at APAR Technologies at 4 Shenton Way.

> He had travelled to India between Mar 9 and Oct 29 last year, and the United Arab Emirates between Oct 29 and Nov 13.

> He served stay-home notice at a dedicated facility upon his return to Singapore until Nov 27 and his swab done on Nov 23 was negative for COVID- 19.

> MOH said the work pass holder is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on Jan 19 in preparation for a trip back to India.

> His result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day and he was taken to NCID. His Ct value is ""very high"", which is indicative of a low viral load, and his serology test result has come back positive.

> 

> INCREASE IN UNLINKED COMMUNITY CASES: MOH

> MOH said the overall number of new cases in the community has increased from four cases in the week before to 18 cases in the past week.

> The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from two cases in the week before to six cases in the past week.

> Among the 213 confirmed cases reported from Jan 14 to Jan 20, 118 cases have tested positive for their serology tests and 36 have tested negative while 59 serology test results are pending, said MOH.

> There was also a dependant's pass holder and a long-term visit pass holder who both arrived from India.

> Four are student's pass holders who arrived from India, Indonesia, the UAE and Slovak Republic while four others are work pass holders from India and Ireland.

> Twenty are work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Myanmar, of whom seven are foreign domestic workers.

> The remaining four cases are short-term visit pass holders. Two arrived from India to visit their Singaporean relatives while two others arrived from Myanmar and the United States for work assignments in Singapore.

> 

> 32 MORE PATIENTS DISCHARGED

> 

> 

> 

> 

> NEW COVID-19 CLUSTER

> Minister for Education Lawrence Wong said on Monday that authorities have seen more new infected cases in the community in recent days.

> ""We are also monitoring the situation carefully and considering if additional measures are necessary to ensure the infection remains under control,"" he said.

> Since Jan 13, seven community cases have been linked to a police K-9 unit.

> On Tuesday, two of the newly reported community cases were linked to a food processing worker at Golden Bridge Foods Manufacturing who tested positive last week, forming a new cluster.

> 

> Amid an increase in the number of community cases, a pilot programme for some nightclubs and karaoke outlets to reopen has been deferred until further notice.

> This is to prevent the risk of further community transmission and formation of clusters in ""high-risk settings"", said the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Trade and Industry on Tuesday.

> Such settings entail people coming into close contact for prolonged periods of time and in enclosed spaces, the ministries added.

> The ministries said it was uncertain when the pilot would be able to start given the ""dynamic public health situation"", and that it would review the start of the pilot at a suitable juncture.

> SINGAPORE: The last COVID-19 cluster in a migrant worker dormitory has closed, meaning there are no active clusters in Singapore since the pandemic began.

> 

> The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced the closure of the cluster at Cassia @ Penjuru dormitory on Tuesday (Nov 24), after 28 consecutive days with no new infection linked to it.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""With the closure of this cluster, there are no active COVID-19 clusters for the first time since Feb 3, 2020,"" said MOH on Tuesday.

> Since the first COVID-19 case was reported in Singapore on Jan 23, the tally of cases has grown to more than 58,000 cases, with 28 fatalities from the disease.

> The first cluster was reported on Feb 4, at the Yong Thai Hang Medical Hall, a Chinese medicine shop that primarily served tourists from China.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Three days later, Singapore's Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level was raised from Yellow to Orange, as more local cases emerged without links to previous cases or travel history to China.

> 

> 

> Soon more clusters sprung up, including at the Life Church and Missions Singapore, the Grand Hyatt Hotel, the Grace Assembly of God church and the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.

> Contact tracing efforts drew a link between the Life Church and Missions and the Grace Assembly of God clusters, with serological testing used for the first time to uncover the link.

> Advertisement

> In the first week of March, a new cluster linked to an event at SAFRA Jurong was identified. The cluster, which included several elderly people, grew in numbers throughout the rest of the month.

> Even as more safety measures were enacted, including cancelling or deferring all ticketed cultural, sports and entertainment events with 250 participants or more, the number of local cases increased and surpassed 200 infections by mid-March.

> By the end of March, three people had died from COVID-19 in Singapore. Several new clusters are announced, including one at the S11 dormitory in Punggol.

> This would become the first of dozens of dormitory clusters as the coronavirus spread across the dormitories.

> 

> There have been more than 54,500 cases linked to foreign worker dormitories, since the first two infections were reported on Mar 29.

> Workers queue for food at S11 Dormitory @ Punggol on Apr 6, 2020. (Photo: Reuters / Edgar Su)

> The number of infections in the dormitories peaked at more than 1,000 a day, before it reduced slightly to hundreds of new cases daily.

> 

> Singapore entered a circuit breaker on Apr 7, with the aim of curbing the spread of the coronavirus in the community, while isolation measures were enforced to contain the growing clusters in the dormitories.

> After months of testing and isolation, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Aug 19 declared that all dormitories were cleared of COVID-19.

> 

> But three days later, a new cluster was identified at Sungei Tengah Lodge, Singapore’s biggest purpose-built dormitory and one that was previously cleared of COVID-19 on Jul 21.

> The new cluster at Sungei Tengah would grow to 216 cases.

> 

> Worker dormitory Sungei Tengah Lodge at Old Choa Chu Kang Road was declared an isolation area after a spike of COVID-19 cases there.

> Less than a month later, 21 new clusters were identified at dormitories that had been previously cleared of COVID-19.

> The biggest of these new clusters was at Sungei Tengah, followed by Avery Lodge Dormitory, Westlite Toh Guan and CDPL Tuas Dormitory.

> Stringent routine testing began and about 900 new cases in total emerged from these clusters.

> It was “part of the plan” for cases to be detected through rostered routine testing, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.

> Hundreds of thousands of workers residing in dormitories were scheduled for rostered routine testing. Employers were warned by the authorities that workers who had not been scheduled for the testing were not allowed to return to work.

> 

> The daily number of new cases at the dormitories fell into the single digits, and on Oct 13, Singapore reported no new case there for the first time in more than six months.

> New daily infections in dormitories then hovered between zero and two cases for the rest of October and into November, as MOH started closing the new clusters.

> On Tuesday, the last dormitory cluster – at Cassia @ Penjuru – was closed, bringing an end to active clusters in Singapore.

> The latest cases bring Singapore's total number of COVID-19 cases to 631, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release.

>

> Of the new cases, 38 were imported cases with travel history to Europe, North America, ASEAN and other parts of Asia. All except one were returning residents and long-term pass holders.

> Five more patients have recovered and were discharged, bringing the total to 160. Two patients died last Saturday.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> On Wednesday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament that Singapore has increased the number of teams for contact tracing from three to 20 in order to prepare for an ""expected surge"" in COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks.

> 

> Mr Gan said that with around 200,000 overseas Singaporeans returning home from all over the world, the number of cases will continue to rise.

> 

> The health minister also noted that while Singapore has sufficient capacity in its healthcare system to handle the COVID-19 outbreak, the country cannot be complacent and needs to preserve its buffer capacity.

> National Development Minister Lawrence Wong highlighted in Parliament that there was no need to stockpile food and other essential supplies despite tightened measurements to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

> His comments came a day after a slew of initiatives - such as limiting gatherings outside of school and work and closing entertainment venues such as night clubs, karaoke outlets and cinemas - was announced to curb the coronavirus outbreak.

Even for students with nuclear families (parents together), are you absolutely sure a parent can sit by and ensure the student can still learn effectively from home? What about special needs schools? 

If you wanna talk about spreading covid-19 at schools: you should see how many students come in sick lol. The Teachers are at risk themselves but schools have placed much more social distancing rules than any other workplaces or public places out there.

This isn’t weak leadership. If anything, the government has put in due consideration. No plan is perfect and we’re still hoping things improve.

Still, Teachers have to prep for home based learning that could still happen if things escalate.

But of course this doesn't take into account economic impact. 

They do cite workplace closure as higher priority as identified work as a higher-risk area vs schools due to various factors (e.g. adults more likely to be symptomatic, kids more likely to stay home when sick), but have acknowledged kids could be transmitting virus within home community, which our recent cases and overseas situation have proven.

""The location of infection (school, workplace, or home community) was determined according to the site where individuals were exposed to the virus (table). Owing to behaviours of school absenteeism and work-distancing presenteeism, the number of infections acquired at work consistently exceeded those at school, although students could be transmitting the virus within the home community.""

At the time of writing their study, SG had 243 cases - this was ~16 March. The global and local situation has evolved rapidly since then. More cases around the world and in SG have shown kids to be a vector, and I think this is something the government is realising and starting to look into.

(Eg UK - where Boris has said to guarantee 80% of pay) although that would reaaaaaaallly help. 

Next, where do we get the extra staff who will work in childcare to fit in the extra demand then? So schools close but childcare centres are ok?

In other countries where schools shut down in short notice - most of them did not take as stringent measures initially as SG did, and this comes as a shock + whole load of work for teachers who did not have time to prep. Even so, those countries allow home tutoring. This is not new to them. Singapore has never been as strong in this although we have been introducing home based learning gradually. Of course, we can still learn if this is enforced.

The fact that now we have not closed schools yet, and have the time to prep for home based learning - is a luxury. I just hope to point this out that we are doing better than we thought but I agree such measures can be looked into if things get worse.

So kids can don’t go to school, but stay in a childcare for an extended period instead, and not learn anything as useful? Great argument. 

Companies can mandate that, whether they can maintain that and still keep up with KPI is another story. 

Parents who work from home are *working*. So do you expect them to put more kids in a childcare too? Or sacrifice their work to ensure kids learn?

Let me quote another country.
In UK - Oxford University researchers have also just argued that the predicted outcome by Imperial College London (that the Govt followed) has not counted in several factors and predicted death rates may be an exaggeration.
This means that the lockdown in UK might be a mistake as it may be an extremely disproportionate response to the virus. While they are still conducting more tests, if this lockdown is a mistake - It just cost them 350 billion pounds.


The whole point of not going into a lockdown rashly is to minimise all of these disruptions to folks from all kinds of background and economic losses that we might take years to recover from.

I’ve established plenty that to insist on a lockdown recklessly is selfish, limiting and stupid. 
It should only be done when we have no choice but to give up our personal freedom to fight this spread.

(1) Travel restrictions AND SCREENING at ports of entry. Travel restrictions are just half the formula, because unless you shut down ALL travel all it does is reduce the potential incoming flow, it doesn't eliminate it altogether. It's fallacious to assume that only entrants from Wuhan were dangerous in late January, it's fallacious to assume that only entrants from China were dangerous in late February, and it's fallacious to assume that only entrants from China/Europe are dangerous today. Those are higher-risk regions, but even low-risk regions have some risk, so you need to reduce it further with proper screening.

(2) Widespread availability and utilization of health care resources, including testing. Taiwan has a robust public health care system. When I worked in Taiwan I often made fun of my coworkers for going to the doctor for every little thing. ""Why are you wasting your time, they'll just tell you to drink lots of liquids and get plenty of sleep,"" I'd joke before they went to see the doctor and inevitably got told to drink lots of liquids and get plenty of sleep. Of course from their point of view it makes perfect sense to see the doctor every time you have some sniffles if it costs you next to nothing. This may be somewhat wasteful in normal times (I can tell you a funny story about a coworker of mine who, locked out of his apartment, figured it would be cheaper to go to the hospital than call a locksmith so he cut himself up breaking into his own apartment through a broken window. Turns out he was right - the subsequent hospital visit was very cheap.) But this excess health care capacity gives you the flex to respond to a crisis. So Taiwanese default behavior - visit the doctor for even minor symptoms - was pre-optimized to identify and isolate cases quickly. Of course you need the testing capacity to make this work, but the government did a good job of anticipating the need here early.

Like if NYC is completely overwhelmed, you don't have an issue with NYC, you have an issue with the entire eastern seaboard because people travel and you've got to divide attention and resources between wherever these people decided to go.

Like look at Italy. Italy now has a problem with the entirety of fucking Italy because they couldn't contain it to the places it started. Italy can't use all their resources on one city because it's not one city that has a problem.

NYC as a city will not divide resources (presumably) and pour those into effort to tackle problems within NYC. When that fails, presumably their backup is Federal resources and/or help from other more fortunate states.

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (13 April) confirmed a record daily rise of 386 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total to 2,918 here.

> The announcement comes a day after authorities here announced 233 cases, the third single-day highest figure reported thus far, following last Thursday’s confirmation of 287 cases.

> On Sunday, 32 more patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing the total of recovered patients to 560.

> Most of the 976 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while 31 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. A total of 988 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Eight have died from complications due to COVID-19 infection, including a 90-year-old Singaporean man who succumbed to the disease on Saturday.

> At least 17 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including the largest cluster at S11 Dormitory@Punggol, which is linked to 365 cases.

> Eight such dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, including the newly confirmed cluster at Acacia Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.

> As of Sunday noon, the MOH has identified 28,140 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 12,088 are currently quarantined, and 16,052 have completed their quarantine.

> As of 7 April noon, 72,680 swab tests have been carried out, of which 47,486 of them involved unique individuals. 

> The COVID-19 Temporary Measures Act, passed in Parliament on Tuesday, gives authorities the power to ban events and gatherings, or impose conditions on how they are conducted, during the “circuit breaker” period lasting till 4 May.

> Those caught flouting these regulations will be fined $300 and subsequently face prosecution for repeated offences.

> Under the Act, the penalty for first-time offenders is up to a $10,000 fine, a jail term of up to six months, or both. For second-time or subsequent offenders, the penalty is a fine of up to $20,000 along with a possible jail term of up to a year.

> People who flout their five-day medical leave or stay-home notices and do not wear masks if they have to leave their place of accommodation to seek emergency medical treatment are also subjected to similar penalties.

> Part of the “circuit breaker” measures – announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Friday – include the closure of schools and most workplaces. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, transport, and key banking services will remain open during the month-long closure.

> In a Good Friday address, Lee reiterated his call for Singaporeans to stay home, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in foreign worker dormitories as well as in the general population.

> Over the weekend, the authorities issued a slew of measures, including the closure of beaches, facilities in parks and gardens and playfields.

> Wearing masks was also made compulsory for commuters on public transport, as well as while those visiting supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies, and shopping malls.

> Stadiums have also been closed, while parents are not allowed to drop off their children with grandparents on a daily basis.

> Separately, all Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning from overseas apart from Hubei province must serve the 14-day stay-home notice, while those returning from Hubei must serve a 14-day quarantine.

> All short-term visitors are barred from entering or transiting via Singapore.

> On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced an additional $5.1 billion Solidarity Budget to help businesses, workers and households.

> The government’s response to COVID-19 will total $59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product.

> To date, there are over 1.8 million COVID-19 cases globally. More than 115,000 have died from the virus, with the US holding the record for the highest global death toll at over 22,000.

> At over half a million cases, the country also holds the record of having the largest number of patients globally, followed by Spain at over 169,000 cases, Italy at over 156,000, followed by France at over 132,000.

> China, where the virus originated, has over 82,000 cases and earlier last Tuesday reported no new coronavirus deaths for the first time since it started publishing figures in January.

> SINGAPORE: A total of 65 new COVID-19 cases were reported in Singapore on Friday (Apr 3), of which 56 are local cases.

> Of the new local cases, 39 are linked to previous cases while 17 are currently unlinked.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Nine other cases are imported infections, with a travel history to Europe, North America, the Middle East and ASEAN, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily update.

> This takes the national total to 1,114 infections.

> 

> Three new clusters haven been identified - Ce La Vi bar at Marina Bay Sands with four cases, Singapore Cricket Club with six cases and a construction site at Project Glory, an integrated development at 50 Market Street with four cases.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> A total of 235 more cases have been discharged. Of the 473 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving while 25 others are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> A total of 401 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 have been transferred to community isolation facilities.

> Singapore on Friday reported its fifth death from COVID-19, an 86-year-old Singaporean woman with no recent travel history to affected places. The patient's profile matches that of case 918, the first person linked to a cluster at Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home at 1 Thomson Lane.

> 

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed the nation on Friday, outlining enhanced and stricter measures to help limit escalating COVID-19 infections.

> 

> Singapore will close most workplaces, but supermarkets, markets, transportation and other essential services will remain open.

> “We also should not disrupt economic sectors that are strategic or form part of a global supply chain. People working in these industries can continue to go to work, with safe-distancing measures in place. But most other work premises must close,"" he said.

> 

> Schools and institutes of higher learning will also implement full home-based learning while all pre-schools and student care centres will close.

> Restrictions on movements and gatherings of people will be tightened and Singaporeans should stay at home as much as possible, avoid socialising with others outside of their households and only go out to do essential things, Mr Lee added.

After the cluster at Hero’s Bar in Circular Road was announced, half of me was thinking “See! I told you so”, and the other half was hoping there won’t be yet another such cluster despite how logic and the examples from the Western countries say otherwise. 

By the way, it was later found that the cases at Dover Court International School were linked to the Hero’s Bar cluster (source: https://mothership.sg/2020/04/covid-19-heros-bar-8th-case/).

This is largely also because of how transparent the Ministry of Health have been about the cases and the amazing work they did (contact tracing, testing etc), tracing most of the cases and taking many preventive measures. There isn't any panic-buying also because the government and supermarkets have come out to show their extensive stockpiles (9 million+ rolls of toilet paper, millions of instant noodles, extensive stock of rice etc).

So far there hasn't been any closing of entertainment venues but I think they've been disencouraging large scale gatherings, implementing measures in schools to reduce the gathering of large amounts of students.

Only thing is the government saying there's no need to wear masks unless we're sick so I would say but my observations only about 1/3 of the people wear masks on public transport etc. On the good side many people have been taking extra care of their personal hygiene and i've seen almost everyone taking their time to wash their hands properly in the toilet etc.",t3_fb51xz,2020-02-29 10:51:31,pixelmemories,7

> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 66 new COVID-19 cases on Monday (Apr 6), bringing the national total to 1,375, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily update.

> 

> One of the new cases is imported and the remaining cases are locally transmitted. Twenty-four more patients have been discharged, taking the total number of people who have fully recovered to 344.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Among the local cases, MOH has established links to existing clusters for 35 cases. Of these, 24 are linked to clusters at foreign dormitories and 11 are linked to non-dormitory clusters.

> A total of 30 of the new cases are unlinked, and contact tracing is ongoing for these patients.

> 

> A total of 571 patients are still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, and 25 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Two new clusters were also identified, according to the Ministry. They are Little Gems Preschool and Kranji Lodge.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that Singapore has been conducting around 2,000 coronavirus tests daily. As of Monday, the country has conducted more than 65,000 tests.

> He provided these numbers in a written answer on Monday to a parliamentary question by Nominated Member of Parliament Walter Theseira.

> Assoc Prof Theseira had also asked if the Ministry of health will report any other national health statistics relating to COVID-19 to enable researchers to gather ""internationally comparable datasets"" on the pandemic.

> ""The Ministry of Health reports the relevant COVID-19 information and statistics regularly to keep Singaporeans updated. We also share information on the number of tests conducted from time to time where relevant,"" said Mr Gan in his reply.

> 

> THIRD SUPPORT PACKAGE TO SUPPORT SINGAPORE

> As part of the country's ongoing battle against COVID-19, a third support package announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Monday.

> The S$5.1 billion Solidarity Budget is aimed at saving jobs and protecting livelihoods during the four weeks when schools and non-essential businesses have to be shut as part of the “circuit breaker” distancing measures that will kick in from Tuesday.

> From Tuesday, most workplaces islandwide will be closed and schools will move to full home-based learning, as announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last week. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open.

> Mr Heng said on Monday the COVID-19 pandemic had ""exploded"" in Singapore in recent days. To date, Singapore has seen six COVID-19 fatalities.

> Singapore has “progressively” ramped up its measures but as the number of infections – especially local transmitted cases – kept rising in recent days, the Government decided to roll out an “extraordinary” set of “circuit breaker” measures to pre-empt the escalation, he said.

> 

> This is the first time that the Singapore Government has released three Budgets in less than two months, following the S$6.4 billion Unity Budget in February and the record-breaking S$48 billion Resilience Budget on Mar 26.

> To fund this third booster, the Government has sought permission from President Halimah Yacob to draw an additional S$4 billion from past reserves, on top of the S$17 billion tapped for the Resilience Budget.

> Altogether, Singapore will be committing S$59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), for this battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.

There might be nonlinear dose-response relationship between the two, indicating that there is a best 
temperature contributing to its transmission and that low temperature is beneficial to the viral 
transmission. The emergence of the outbreak in Wuhan and its neighboring areas may be closely 
related to the local temperature. For countries and regions with a lower temperature, strict prevention
