> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 876 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Sunday (10 May) noon, bringing the total to 23,336.

> The vast majority of the new cases are foreign workers living in dorms, said the ministry. Three cases are Singaporeans/permanent residents.

> The MOH said more details will be shared when its daily press release is issued at night.

> More than 50 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Tuas View Dormitory and Sungei Tengah Lodge.

> The three are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> This story will be updated later.

> The ministry on Saturday confirmed that 2,296 patients have fully recovered from the infection. Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while 23 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Apart from the 20 COVID-related deaths, six patients who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including a 44-year-old Bangladeshi man who died of a heart attack on Tuesday.

> As of 4 May, the ministry has conducted 175,604 swab tests, of which 123,525 were done on unique individuals.

> This translates to about 30,800 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and around 21,600 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> Of the cases, 860 are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry. There is one imported case and four cases in the local community.

> There are also five new clusters: a construction site at 15 Serangoon North Avenue 1, a construction site at Tanah Merah Coast Road, 9 Woodlands Industrial Park E1, 11 Woodlands Industrial Park E1 and 515 Yishun Industrial Park A.

> Also, the ministry said that it had recently found that 33 cases from a laboratory were false positives, “due to an apparatus calibration issue for one of its test kits”. This was discovered as a result of its regular reviews of laboratory tests.

> Subsequent retesting at the National Public Health Laboratory confirmed that these were negative cases. “There were no false negative results discovered from our review,” MOH said. “MOH has taken immediate actions to rectify the situation. The laboratory has stopped all tests and is working to resolve the calibration issue.”

> In addition, the ministry said, “There were two results that had been equivocal, and were subsequently verified to be negative upon re-testing.”

> It added that all equivocal results are sent to the National Public Health Laboratory for re-testing. “As a precautionary measure, we had categorised Cases 18669 and 19360 as positive while pending verification, and isolated them.”

> Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

> This includes the five additional cases that are now linked to the cluster at Mustafa Centre (145 Syed Alwi Road), which has a total of 129 confirmed cases currently

> One additional case is linked to the cluster at Acacia Home (30 Admiralty Street), which has a total of 17 confirmed cases now.

> There are currently 1,097 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, with 22 of them in critical condition in the intensive care unit. A total of 19,498 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19.

10,fq5bku4,t1_fq59ttd,"\[opinion\] Yesterday, I discussed [my interpretation of ""backlog cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ggavxx/singapore_reports_753_new_covid19_cases_taking/fpyyj3s/?context=3)"". I think that ""backlog cases"" consist of the suspect cases of people who are staying in dorms which have known infections.

I noticed from the [SHN+QO tab on this site](https://covidsitrep.moh.gov.sg/), there is still a big number of ""Active Number of Persons Under Quarantine (PUQ) on May 9.

* PUQs pending quarantine location : 1286
* PUQs being transferred to hospital : 310
* PUQs in non-Gazetted Dorms : 17436
* PUQs in Gazetted Dorms : 319
* PUQs in Government Quarantine Facility : 9184
* PUQs in Home Quarantine Order : 592

I am guessing these numbers are indication of the number of ""backlog cases"" (suspect cases).  As QOs are issued everyday due to new cases, the total PUQs will never drop to 0.

Instead of 0, when the number of PUQs drop to less than 10000 (early April levels), then we would have cleared this ""backlog"".",t3_ggwxig,2020-05-10 16:26:33,retaki,8

Damage to the nervous system from the 1918 pandemic wasn't immediately apparent, until statistical analysis was done in the ensuing decades. Our technology/understanding now is advanced enough that doctors have already noticed such damage to the nervous system from the coronavirus.

Separating non-dorm FWs is a good proxy for the coupling strength, which I'm sure MOH keeps an eye on. 

In addition, non-dorm FWs themselves are weakly coupled, cause in this case most of those infected are construction industry FWs living in non-dorm residences, such as on-site or shophouses.

You just have to pick which one would be relatively ‘better’.

And u understand that they tryna keep the citizens calm, theres ur answer, yes there will be downsides but its choosing ‘the lesser of two evils’ in a way.

At the time, We also didn't know much about the virus. About the transmission and everything. 

So, at the time, the govt made a call. To say that only wear masks if you are sick. Which at the time, with the information we had, made sense.

3. Probably can look tonight at the press release. Best yesterday most of the community cases with work passes were in the construction sector. The virus is still spreading among the workers.

The “community” work pass holders are basically the same work permit holders who would normally live in a dorm (male, mostly Bangladeshi and Indian, a few PRC/Myanmarese). Doing the same jobs like cleaning, maintenance, contractor work, construction. Only their employers housed them outside dorms in units above shophouses and other weird cheap spots. These guys mingled with dorm residents, maybe were colleagues, of dorm residents before CB. The virus got into these pockets of foreign workers as if they are mini-dorms.

Note that they are almost always asymptomatic, and only picked up because they are required to be swabbed before starting to work again.

149,frj3vhg,t3_gp0o56,"> # 642 new Covid-19 cases in Singapore, bringing total to 31,068

> SINGAPORE - There are 642 new Covid-19 cases preliminarily confirmed as of Saturday noon (May 23), as cases in Singapore reached 31,068.

> Among these are six Singaporeans and permanent residents, while foreign workers living in dormitories form the bulk of the remaining cases.

> More details will be released later on Saturday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said.

> Earlier on Saturday, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong reiterated that after June 1, employees should only return to workplaces if they need specialised equipment and machinery that cannot be accessed from home, or if they need to fulfil legal requirements.

> This means that most employees working in an office setting will continue working from home.

> Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi ministry task force handling the Covid-19 outbreak, said that many employers and managers will need to adjust their mindsets to this new normal.

> For those who do have to be onsite, employers should consider if staff really need to go in every day. They could arrange for employees to work from home a few days a week.

> These employers should also offer staggered work hours, and must ensure that the work environment is safe with measures such as good ventilation, high hygiene standards, and safe distancing in place.

> ""All these workplace measures are critical in our fight against Covid-19 - they will reduce the need for daily movement of people, and minimise the risks of the virus flaring up again,"" he said.

> On Friday, 838 more Covid-19 patients were discharged from hospitals and community facilities.

> This means that as of Friday, 12,946, or about 43 per cent, of Covid-19 patients in Singapore have fully recovered from the disease.

> The number of patients discharged has exceeded new patients in the past ten days.

> On Friday, Singapore also recorded the lowest number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care since the start of the circuit breaker period, with eight of the 798 patients still in hospital in critical condition in intensive care.

> However, the average number of new daily community cases - which does not include foreign workers staying in dormitories - has risen from five cases two weeks ago to seven in the past week.

> MOH attributed this is partly to active surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school staff, resulting in more cases being picked up in the past week.

> Two of the four new Singaporean Covid-19 cases announced on Friday are pre-school staff.

> The remaining 610 new cases announced on Friday are migrant workers living in dormitories, bringing the total number of cases in Singapore past the 30,000 mark.

> As of Friday, 28,161 of the 323,000 migrant workers staying in dormitories, or more than 8 per cent, have tested positive for Covid-19.

> Twenty-three patients have died from Covid-19 complications here and nine who tested positive have died from other causes.

> Globally, the outbreak, which began in December last year, has infected nearly 5.3 million people. Some 339,000 have died.

178,frjktvn,t1_frj8i12,"Why are you so sure about this? The most recent update for number of tests done is as of 18th May. From both the numbers of cases and the numbers of people discharged, it is clear that the 17th (305 new, 495 discharged) and 18th (451 new,  530 discharged) were affected by the calibration issue. Then on 19th (570 new, 842 discharged), things were largely back to normal.

You have no idea how many tests were done after the 18th.

Regarding backlog, I have a different interpretation. Huge numbers of people were swabbed in the week before 10th May (large dorms), then fewer leading up to the 18th (moving on to smaller dorms, factory-converted dorms). So probably a lot of foreign workers with symptoms were swabbed and treated as presumed positive, but their swabs were saved and not yet tested. After the 10th, the labs were probably clearing this backlog of swabs, leading to several days of high numbers that should rightly belong to earlier days. We may still be clearing backlog now, but that means that the numbers reflect cases that were actually infected earlier, and not new, recent infections.

If the numbers were re-analyzed according to the day of swab collection, not test confirmation, we may see a huge peak of 2000+ cases in early May, going down to less than 300 now. Just a guess.",t3_gp0o56,2020-05-23 20:13:48,DuePomegranate,5

Furthermore

Firstly the lack of propaganda is blindingly obvious.

1) If tests were back to normal - ST will be banging the war drums

2) If testing has increased - St will be firing war cannons.

I'm willing to hazard, the increase in releases and discharges (tests required), increase in nursing home / preschool (tests required) + public, takes away from dormitories (less tested). Take it even one step further, the people in dorms with uncertain status are just hanging around waiting for results - meanwhile with an extremely high possibility of getting infected. By the time results are out, a negative can mean nothing.

Backlog of 4-5 days  from last friday when preschool teachers were first tested till positive results late this week, that was like 6000 tests taken away from other testing, which probably led to decline in discharges and dormitory tests. 

You're right, they might be infected earlier- but in the overall scheme of things, the number is not falling due to fewer infections, it's due to more sub populations being tested.",t3_gp0o56,2020-05-24 00:09:51,swordfishunter,0

Plus 2 asymptomatic preschool teachers. They didn't use to test local asymptomatic contacts; it's just in the past few days.

Of the symptomatic new cases, 2 were confirmed within 1 day of symptom onset, a 51 year old local man and a foreign worker. I have noticed that 50+ year old people are getting tested within 1-2 days of symptom onset now i.e. doctors are readily sending the elderly for testing, no more dilly-dallying around waiting for 5-day MC to expire.

In the whole list, only 1 person was not tested very quickly, a 20 year old man who went to work at 2 dorms (NSF?) who had onset of symptoms on 16 May. This guy had to wait out his 5-day MC, maybe because he's young and had mild symptoms.",t3_gp0o56,2020-05-24 12:47:17,DuePomegranate,1

For the preschool teachers, they were doing pooled testing, that’s why it takes longer to confirm the positives. 5 swabs are combined to be tested as 1 sample, increasing the throughput. But if the pooled sample is positive, they have to recall the 5 people involved and re-test them individually.

A delay of *two days*. I just picked PEI because it has a pretty small population (156k), so bumping up their herd immunity by two months compared to the rest of the country would barely affect the timeline for the rest of the country.

To make it more “fair”, the federal government could allocate 100k vaccines in total to this process - split it evenly with 50k to the Atlantic provinces and 50k to the harder-hit provinces so we get data on how vaccination works in both low and high-spread areas. Let the provinces decide how they want to allocate them, or do it by lottery, but only on the condition that they go to a contiguous population of roughly similar size. e.g. instead of PEI we could do Red Deer and Cape Breton.",t3_kvfn7v,2021-01-12 14:20:48,Marsymars,0

""Harsh"" mask mandate for France takes effect [28 August 2020](https://www.france24.com/en/20200828-face-masks-compulsory-throughout-paris-from-8-am-local-time). 

Here is [September 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33XDY0cb86Q). Many more masks, finally, following the mask mandate. But see 0:49, guy on the right, no mask. 2:43, cyclist, no mask - even though masks are mandated even if you are cycling. 2:45, two ladies on electric scooters with no masks. *I'm not even trying to find these guys*.  

Here is [October 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtfGWV2X8iY). It is actually 27 Oct 2020, lockdown starting Friday has already been announced. Finally, many people wearing masks. But look at 2:58 - no masks! 

That's just mask rules, in France. ""Harsh"" rules? I can write a law that fines you 50,000 euros and 1kg worth of your flesh and bone carved from your body every time you don't wear a mask, it won't make a damn difference if you don't enforce it. 

Here's [Singapore, October 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EfZCWJmB8I). Masks, masks everywhere. You see those stickers on the floor? Those are to mark distance when you're standing in line for something. You see the QR codes in the entrance to *every single individual shop*? Those are check-in points - no entry is allowed unless you check in using the country's check in. You see the cordoned-off areas to direct traffic into and out of most shops? Those are to control traffic. 

Popular shops have a man standing outside who will not let you in because the store has reached capacity. 

If you were to look inside restaurants, you'd see stickers on tables to mark out places you can't sit, so people are spaced out. 

If you try to flout the rules, there are a literal army of [safe distancing ambassadors](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-11-19/singapore-safe-distancing-ambassadors) prowling the streets. 

If you eat out, the server will seat you and ask for your drink orders early. This is so you can get your drinks early, and finally *actually take your masks off*. If you take it off before your meal arrives, your server reminds you to put it back on, because if they don't ask you to, when the enforcement officers come in, everybody gets it!

It's been like this for over half a year. **Half a year!**

>SINGAPORE: Singapore could lower its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level if COVID-19 spreads widely around the world and travel restrictions no longer prove useful, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Tuesday (Feb 25).

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dorscon-level-covid19-transmits-worldwide-coronavirus-12469484

When the cases were low, a lot of overseas media were praising Singapore for its strict measures, there were also a lot of measures being taken to prevent imported cases.

A few articles also said there was no community spread.

People got stressed because still cannot get mask, people stockpile when DORSCON went from yello to orange. After such periods of stress and alarm, people were bound to get complacent as the number of cases stayed low. 

The ""socially irresponsible"" were blamed for various clusters. Everything or everybody else seemed to be doing the right thing.

Then it happened.

The number of infections first passed the highest record at that time, 14, on March 16. It was 17. We never went back below that number up to today.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/1098959/singapore-new-cases-of-covid-19/

There are a lot of discussions on why the number of locals increased, even though media and the government focused initially on imported cases, saying it would increase as Singaporeans are recalled back.

Reasons so far I've seen that seem reasonable are that initially the implementation of SHN was fraught with controversies. Some people were issued SHN the day after they come back, so before it took effect some people went everywhere including one where it was posted on Facebook.

Some were staying at home for containment measures, so any roommates or family members might be affected.

And also there's the people who are on 5 days MC....",t3_ftccpi,2020-04-02 20:09:23,Dunkjoe,1

They were then conveyed in ambulances to a hospital. (including 12 Aug's first case, there are now 5 cases linked to seamen).
   3. Of the community cases, 1 is linked, 4 are unlinked.

I know FWs has to go through it and despite how scared they are, they can't say no because they are employed. If you ask a typical Singaporean (Assuming a very fearful boomer) he might refuse or downplay his symptoms to run away from a ""painful"" swab.

I've talk to doctors before in SGH about swab vs. blood test and he told me swabs are not painful but I don't buy that completely because if you ask Singaporeans who have been through it, they keep saying, ""Never want to do that again ever"" or ""Not a very nice thing to go through"". I note that the sample size is small and there are ppl who indeed felt that swabs are just discomfort and ticklish but who wants to take that chance right?

Personally, I would want to get one just to try it out but I have no reason to and MOH wouldn't allow ""pay for swabs"" so if anyone can explain it to Singaporeans out there who are afraid, please do! So we can encourage more ppl who are experiencing flu-like symptoms to go for swabs.

> Elevated social distancing measures will be progressively lifted in three phases starting Jun 2, with the resumption of economic activities that do not pose a high risk of transmission in the first phase.

> Pre-schools will also gradually reopen from Jun 2, starting with children from kindergarten levels.

> Students from graduating cohorts in the primary and secondary levels will also be allowed to return to school on weekdays, while other cohorts will rotate weekly, alternating between home-based learning and returning to school for lessons.

> For the first time in more than six weeks, no new COVID-19 cluster was identified in Singapore on Sunday.

> 

> According to data from MOH, the last time there were no new clusters was on Apr 8, a day after the ""circuit breaker"" period in Singapore began.

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) preliminarily reported 218 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Monday (22 June) noon, bringing the total to 42,313.

> There are no Singapore residents among the new cases.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there is one case in the community who is a work pass holder. There are no Singaporean/permanent resident cases,” said the MOH, adding that the majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> The ministry said that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge with over 2,000 cases, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory with over 1,700 cases, Cassia @ Penjuru and Tuas View Dormitory with over 1,400 cases each.

> These dorms, the top five clusters with the highest number of cases here, account for over 20 per cent of the total infected workers living in dorms. Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here.

> To date, 132 dorms and 14 blocks of recovered workers in purpose-built dorms have been cleared of COVID-19.

> With 718 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Sunday, 34,942 cases have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while one is in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 6,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 26 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 10 others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another three, including the 44-year-old male Indian national who died on Monday, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 15 June, the ministry has conducted 576,189 swab tests, of which 340,894 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 101,100 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 59,800 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> Singapore has entered Phase 2 of its reopening – with various safe distancing measures still in place – on Friday. This phase is expected to last up to six months or longer, according to authorities.

> With more returning to workplaces, the MOH said that it will extend testing to all individuals aged 45 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection from later this week. It will be progressively be extended to more groups, it added.
