33,fot3yjg,t3_g9ewzq,"People need to understand that just as mental health is a very serious issue, mental resiliency training is a very serious preventative medical asset in dealing with it. 

On an anecdotal point, I know a lot of people here in Canada have been reporting lower mental health during the lockdown. Realistically, staying inside for 3 weeks with good lighting, shelter, food, and regular government support shouldn't send half the country's mental health spiraling downwards. It's important to look after one another but if I'm being completely frank, it seems a bit ridiculous to think of some of the people I know who seem to be breaking down. The British people lived through years of food rationing and constant bombardment without too much of a dip in public morale.

People on reddit really like to shit on the mentality of ""Someone has it worse so I shouldn't complain"" but in reality that's a very effective strategy to get through hardship. The time for reflection and therapy should come after the hardship, if you focus on it throughout then you will only make your situation worse for yourself.

41,fot6i15,t1_fot5wv0,"> Couldn't it be argued that while such a strategy could work for periods of time for the military (who are already mentally disciplined) but that civilians wouldn't have the same level of effectiveness? 

Certainly yes, military personnel are far more well prepared to deal with hardship than those outside. That's simply due to the nature of today's societies, where we have managed to reduce hardship significantly over the course of the last 100 years. It's not impossible, however, to not have a population of very mentally resilient people. I will also say that a lot of the measures used by the military simply involve normal people adopting a very proactive mindset to approach hardship and stress. If you do not maintain a positive attitude then you are only exasperating the issues for yourself. 

> Also, what is the possibility of things like dissociative disorders and the like from potentially repressing too much?

I think that would entail a minority of people, and those people should already have been targeted for higher than average assistance. What I'm talking about is relatively healthy individuals self-identifying a significant deterioration in their mental health because they haven't been allowed to leave the home over the last 3-4 weeks. 

The example I'm specifically using is Canada, where 50% of the population reported today having a significant reduction in mental health, despite the fact that our government is still financially supporting the incomes of a significant number of the population. Contrast that with WW2-era London where people lived under strict rationing and constant bombardment and maintained a historically significant level of positive attitudes throughout.",t3_g9ewzq,2020-04-28 11:49:10,,7

43,fot6s4d,t1_fot6i15,"I gotcha, makes a lot more sense to me now.

Also, human contact/camaraderie plays a massive factor, something that can be present among civilians in wartime, but again is lacking during a pandemic.
