Singapore reversed its position on masks based on WHO’s advice that only those who were sick should wear masks, saying it would no longer discourage residents from wearing them in public and would distribute reusable face masks from Sunday. It is mandatory for all persons who are 6 years old and above to wear a mask when leaving their homes. People should put on their masks at all times, including putting them back on immediately after activities such as eating, drinking, or doing strenuous exercise. Masks should also be put on when seated before the start of consuming food or drinks or before a workout. Anyone travelling in a car or van alone does not have to wear a mask. If the driver and passengers live in the same household, they do not have to use a mask when they are in the vehicle. Currently, a person is fined $300 when caught without a mask on for the first time. Repeat offenders will face stiffer fines or prosecution. Government had updated its advisory on masks based on the "latest medical and scientific advice”, and that the exercise to distribute reusable masks to Singapore residents was completed over the weekend.
