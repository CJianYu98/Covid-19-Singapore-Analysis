The Multi-Ministry Taskforce regularly has put in place a Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) to manage the risk of importation and onward local transmission from travellers. Except for countries that we have unilaterally opened up to, travellers from selected low risk countries/ regions serve a 7-day SHN at their place of residence or suitable accommodation of their choice, and all other travellers serve a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities.  All travellers who opt to stay at their place of residence for SHN must remain in their declared place of residence at all times. Do not leave your residence, even if it is to purchase food and essentials. If necessary, you may opt for home delivery services or enlist the assistance of others for your daily necessities. If applicable, inform your employer or school that you have been issued a SHN as soon as possible. Minimise contact with others, and avoid interaction with others in your residence. You are prohibited from coming into contact with other persons (who do not stay with you) within 2 metres, other than for the purposes of receiving delivery of food or other essential supplies. They will be subject to close monitoring of their whereabouts, through electronic monitoring as well as physical spot-checks. Strict enforcement action will be taken against those who breach the requirements of the SHN or make false declarations. Individuals who breach their Stay-Home Notice may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 â€“ Stay Orders) Regulations 2020. First-time offenders can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.
