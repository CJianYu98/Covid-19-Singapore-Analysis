Three phases of planned reopening were announced namely "Safe Reopening" (phase 1), "Safe Transition" (phase 2) and finally "Safe Nation" (phase 3); the third phase will last until an effective treatment or vaccine is found to stop the spread of COVID-19. Phase One of this approach involves the safe re-opening of economic activities that do not pose high risk of transmission. It includes the resumption of selected services, like motor vehicle and aircon servicing, all hairdressing services, selected health services. Schools will start to reopen. Everyone should continue to leave home only for essential activities, and wear a mask when doing so. Seniors should continue to stay at home. A critical pre-condition for us to be able to move into the next phase or ease certain measures further within each phase, is to have improved capabilities to control and contain any subsequent outbreaks. In Phase Two, almost the entire economy will re-open, subject to safe management measures being in place. More activities will resume. Most businesses will be allowed to resume, with safe management measures, group size and capacity limits in place. These include retail, F&B dine-in, personal health and wellness, as well as home-based services. Sports and other public facilities, e.g. stadiums, swimming pools, will be opened too. Masks will remain compulsory whenever outside one’s home. Small-group gatherings of up to 5 persons will be allowed. Within one’s home, households may receive up to 5 visitors per day. Phase 3 will be the new normal for Singapore. Social, cultural, religious and business gatherings or events would have resumed with limited gathering sizes and safe distancing measures need to be practised, peak period travel, crowded places and large groups need to be avoided.
