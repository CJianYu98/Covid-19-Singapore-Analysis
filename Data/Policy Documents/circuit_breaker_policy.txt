The 2020 Singapore circuit breaker measures, abbreviated as CB, was a stay-at-home order implemented by the government. Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange in response to additional local cases of uncertain origin. The Multi-Ministry Task Force announced more stricter measures to combat the spread of COVID-19, including the closure of entertainment venues, tuition and enrichment centres and places of worship. Malls, retail establishments and tourist attractions were required to reduce their crowd density in order to stay open. Gatherings of more than 10 people outside of work and school are prohibited. On 3 April, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced a nationwide partial lockdown, known as a circuit breaker, to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. All non-essential workplaces closed from 7 April, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning from 8 April. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. The wearing of masks by healthy individuals was no longer discouraged and was made compulsory when not at home with immediate effect, with fines and prosecution for offenders who refuse to do so. The circuit breaker was extended, with existing measures tightened until 4 May initially, including shrinking the list of essential services, such as closing all close-contact service providers such as hair salons, as well as restricting entry to certain hotspots like wet markets and some essential retail franchises going by the last digit of one's ID number. Popular markets utilized an odd/even date entry restriction; ID ending with odd numbers are only allowed entry on odd dates of the month and ID ending with even numbers are only allowed entry on even dates on the month. The Singapore franchise of McDonald's also shut all of its restaurants islandwide, as a response to a number of its employees being infected.
