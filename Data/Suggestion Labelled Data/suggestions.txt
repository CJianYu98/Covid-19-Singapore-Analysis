sharing of interesting concepts with the class
most of the time instructor speaks way too fast for students to grasp especially for more difficult concepts towards the end.
and often, when instructor asks if there are any questions, it's hard for students to raise questions when they have not even_x000D_
very knowledgeable, patient and easygoing - sounding a little more upbeat may help with the class's energy level
XXXX  is very competent in her subject expertise.
clear explanation, interactve more examples could have been given
helpful, clear explanation more illustration needed
humorous, helpful, interesting more examples could have been given to facilitate understanding
important skill limited skills on excel
iteresting and provides opportunity to leaarn about security limited in content.
More technical content would have been better
new skills, new concepts limited in class learning
He shared lots of insights with the class with regards to setting up a company
sharing of interesting concepts with the class
should include more management tools into the course
He is friendly and approachable.
2
He gives sufficient examples for concepts to help students better understand what is taught in class, especially the more difficult concepts.
3
He gives his attention to the students whenever a student poses a question_x000D__x000D_
 to him individually.
The course project is very difficult, but very challenging.
2. The starting of class at 8.15am does not seem to make any difference to the morning rush crowd after all.
could include some field trip during the week 8 break
20 page in depth report could use a bit more guidance on expectations
815am lesson in the morning is a bit too early
A bit boring
A bit too heavy at times.
Project has a very wide scope.
But very useful.
A bit too rushed.
While we are taught a lot which is good, the tested material is very different, which lends to confusion.
Distinctions should be made.
A friends, approaching and helpful XXXX who is always ready to help his students when they needed him.
:D I enjoyed your class XXXX! :D
A general guideline on what to be done on the project would be better that just giving us the topic name.
Or if it is an open ended project please state it clearly so that we can adjust the scope accordingly.
A little more attention should be paid towards the Apple (Mac) users.
A little to unstructured and unfocused.
More bridging between theory and practice.
A lot of content.
Interesting hand-on exercises and labs help stimulate student's interest in the course.
A lot of things need to learn by our self outside class
A lot of work.
A more organized course outline would be better
A rather patient XXXX that encourages us despite the fact that we were not performing as expected.
a really helpful tool in the working world
A useful course.
The main useful things in the course were the excel tips and the project (self-learning).
The course outline should state the following prerequisites: Statistics, Finance, FA, MA, MS-Excel.
There is little time to create the project.
A very good instructor.
Has passion in what he is teaching and he is able to communicate the ideas to the students.
Teaches very well, and he is able to slow down for those who do not understand.
One of the best lecturer thus far!
A very passionate and enthusiastic instructor.
A very useful course as data is booming in the workforce now.
A very useful course.
AA is awesome
AA is definitely a course all SIS students should go through to understand the basic about real world computing issues.
Able to clearly explain the concepts and illustrating it with on hand examples
Able to explore more into different areas of IT.
For me, its mobile development.
Able to have hand-on experiencs with Tibco EMS and Designer
Able to pinpoint areas of improvements that the team lacks.
Practical in ensuring that our ideas are realistic and feasible.
Able to work with sponsors in business setting Able to build an application from scratch Able to present to sponsors and internal stakeholders Able to have a sense of responsibility in committing
accent tends to mix up public and private pronunciations which can be very confusing overall tries his best to teach and explain as clearly as possible
Advanced Data Management is very useful course.
it tells us about how real data is store in disk and how can make a faster read and write etc.
all IS course are good
All lectures were very interesting and helpful.
XXXX effectively led her courses and I enjoyed her class.
However, as many students have not used/utilized much of excel functions and formula, it'd be better for students to do more practice problems during_x000D__x000D_
 class.
Alot of self-learning
Although her presentation skills may not be the best, but she makes it up with her enthusiasm for the subject, and she's very willing to help anyone who is unable to cope.
She also offers consultations to weaker students, which i think is commendable.
Although it is our responsibility to learn the Java syntax I think it would be better that our XXXX is more certain on what are the right things.
Although it was emphasised that the course focuses on algorithms and not coding, a 25% project was introduced, which requires coding in ruby.
Whats more, it is ironic that while many of us are still unsure of ruby and the algorithms, we were required to_x000D__x000D_
 code the project out in less than 3 weeks.
The way the project is graded, focusing only on question 3 and question 4, is simply unfair and disregards the effort that students have to put in just to code out question 1 and 2. Grading the project for 25% is_x000D__x000D_
 simply too much and just unfairly places a quarter of the marks on coding skills, which the course emphasises it is not about.
In this respect, I would think that the emphasis of the course should be more clear.
Although the course assignments are technically challenging, the grading criteria places more emphasis on the learning of the core objectives instead of the 'hardcore' technical aspect.
Although the course is a bit dry, i see the value in it in the technology industry.
Always approach students and check whether we're doing fine, always an engaging presenter, friendly
Always available for feedback/ because he was very technical, he didn't really understand the questions from someone with no background on the subject
always breaks it down for us to simple parts and explains to us.
Very approachable
Always comes prepared to class.
always concern for student and willing to help weaker student
always give feedback in the start of lesson
always helped the students during lab, very patient
Always provide a recap of last week lesson's concept before the start of the lesson.
always there to help students
Always willing to meet for consultation.
Always willing to meet the group for consultation.
Among all the modules that i have taken, I hve to admit that this course is the course that is the most useful.
The skills we learnt in would not be easily attained, and it is so useful in our daily life application.
Definitely a course for everyone!
An experienced and interesting XXXXXXXX.
She made the effort to go through various excel functions and examples and personally attended to our questions.
an extension of IS200, helps the student to build up relevant programming skills.
Apart from getting to learn new stuff in OOAD from XXXX, I really dreaded going to class each week.
I felt that the course outline was too confusing, where each week we switched between XXXX and our instructor (for sample application exercises etc).
For_x000D__x000D_
 example, I cannot fully appreciate how what I learned this week can be applied to what we will learn next week.
The XXXXs should NOT take away the project component and assign it as an individual, ungraded project.
The weaker coders will be the true victims_x000D__x000D_
 from this decision.
Because although taking away the project also removes stress from the students, making it an individual project (without guided instructions or template codes) means weaker students will get lost.
From the start.
As a team, we will be_x000D__x000D_
 able to get help from team-mates and be more motivated to achieve the milestones.
Applicable and useful in general.
applicable in creating simulations
Applicable to real life scenario and learnt very useful functions&nbsp; But, the project is a little too demanding
Applicable to real world situation
appreciate more about IT security
Appreciate XXXX's strictness and frankness in conducting this course.
IST is a module that is more related to knowledge and I think students are not very willing to dive into the technicals.
It is your enforcement that ensures everyone focuses on it and_x000D__x000D_
 I'm thankful for that
Approachable
Approachable after lesson for consultation.
However, sometime he went through the concepts a bit too fast for us to gasp.
Approachable and always willing to lend a helping hand
approachable and interesting teaching style
Approachable and teaches clearly
Approachable for consultation after lesson
Approachable, always willing to sit down with you to discues your progress and provide feedback.
Approachable, dedicated.
approachable, pragmatic, thorough, great mentor, provides constructive advice, direction and approach.
Approachable, willing to help students
Appropriate and sufficient examples for me to learn what was each topic about.
As a soci student, I feel that CAT skills might be important for us, but not in the business perspective that the course is tailored towards.
As a result, there are many negative implications towards soci students.
In general, we can't contribute much_x000D__x000D_
 to the group, esp so when the focus is largely on financial predictions and business models.
It is a known fact that soci students are unwanted in groups as we are the bottlenecks and are unable to contribute much and are taken in by friends out of sympathy.
As students, we try our best to understand XXXX's circumstances and difficulty.
But the lack of communication for half the semester causes many students to feel lost and insecure.
As this course is an IS module.
I felt that the IS students in class generally have an advantage, given their familiarity with programming.
The course focuses heavily on group project, thus groups without IS students were disadvantaged as we had less understanding_x000D__x000D_
 of VBA coding which allowed IS students to produce more impressive models with their spreadsheets.
suggestion: CAT course for IS students and students under different majors can be separated
Ask questions about our assumption/answers even though knowing that the assumption/answer was wrong, leading to the answer.
Asks challenging questions to get us to think deeper.
Assignment 2 grouping should not be randomized.
It would be more appropriate if they are grouped according the grades, such as having a mixture of those who are better and those who are not as good together.
This would ensure that those who are very strong_x000D__x000D_
 will not be grouped with those who are their same level!
Assignment 2 released too late / advance concepts taught too late in the semester.
More support from instructors and XXXXXXXXs when students require help with out of the class functionalities
Assignment requirements were unclear and requirements keep changing, akin to shifting goal post.
If you are going to change a requirement, then we expect you to change the deadline if it is changed on short notice.
Student don't just take 1 module a semester.
Assignment time frame might be too short
Assignments are a little too technical as compared to the course outline.
Assignments are too hard and competitive, not all students are able to get it in one go in such short period.
Too much things which need to be taught, just too packed.
making expectation for student to be high.
assignments from week 1 to 13 is too much work.
it would be great if assignments were cut down and the module is scoped down further. it was a good module, holistic however i felt too much was trying to be incorporated through the course.
Associate XXXXXXXX  was a great instructor because he engaged the class with deep thinking.
At first I really didn't like the way he teach, but I got used to it and he was actually very funny
At times a little long-winded, think it would have helped if delivery was more concise.
Attempts to gather class involvement
Available outside of class for any consultation sessions.
Awesome, keep up the good job.
Balanced quizzes, having easy and tough questions.
No exams very good.
More tutorials on netlogo would be nice.
basic design principles to help us develop a simple application using object oriented concepts
Battlestations Project is too difficult for a year 1 programming project.
BattleStations was a good project but at least, it will help if alittle bit of answers are released to us because we dont know if what we did on battlestations are correct.
We may do it wrong all along and thus learn the wrong way of coding.
Because i dont have IT background so i think that two lessons for SQL are not enough.
XXXX also can give us more exercises about SQL coding.
Before the class started, XXXX summarized the learning objective of previous lesson and ask questions to the class for refreshing our mind.
I liked it much.
Bell Curve.
Everyone is super smart and it becomes such that its about who has full marks, not about what we are learning
Beneficial
best XXXX
Better understanding on data management!
XXXX makes the course interesting!
The assignment engages me and rest of other groups to discuss tgt and learn tgt!
Boring and dry for the content.
Overall still fine.
But the lab can be more clear, it's really hard to follow when the steps are not clear enough.
BRING PROJECT BACK INTO OOAD !! NO MORE LABTEST!!! MAKE THE PROJECT 70%!!
So that students are able to grasp the concepts of OO and hands on without the time constraint.
Most students are able to do remarkable codes but panic and not given much room to_x000D__x000D_
 provide good answers to the labtest.
But definitely the course in this case is certainty affected and the learning outcome is unclear.
Can be a little monotonous, students might have a little difficulty in understanding whether the XXXX is asking a question or saying a statement Due to the nature of the course, questions asked must be quite specific and understandable.
He was able make_x000D__x000D_
 sure that we clearly understand the questions asked so that we can do our work with little issues.
Can be counted as a 2 CU module
can be more engaging
Can be more hands on
Can be more interesting
Can be more proactive and could have structured the course learning in a more structured manner.
Can get a little monotonous
Can give very detailed descriptions of terms on slides.
Very focused on students.
can have interim feedback or submission for project.
can perhaps offer advanced CAT or VBA lessons as an optional mod - can liaise with external companies for these lessons and allowing interested students to continue learning, at a subsidised rate perhaps?
Can provide more feedback with regards to the project.
Can take out the weekly reviews and focus more on the labs
Can work on articulating himself better, but nevertheless knowledgeable
Caring and sincere teaching method made for a comfortable learning environment.
However, insufficient time was given for most of the quizzes.
Caring XXXXXXXX.
CAT could have been a very enjoyable mod but the instructor was monotonous, uninspiring and seemed unsure about certain topics.
CAT has given me the skills to easily manage my business and simplified processes into just a click of a mouse.
It has shown me the power of using excel and made me rely on excel for every work i do.
CAT is a useful mod and relevant for my course
Cat is a very useful coursd
CAT is a very useful module as I start to realise that many jobs require the use of excel sheets.
Other that that, it is very useful for everyday usage.
CAT is all about practicing and the project showed me how excel modeling can be applied to real-case problems and explore various scenarios which ultimately provide some form of benefits for the client.
CAT is by far one of my most tiring mod ever where I spend all my weekend after break week in school.
No denying that the mod is interesting and useful but seriously I spend so much time on it and what about the other mods?
SMU should seriously re-consider_x000D__x000D_
 the mod guideline and stuff.
Its taking way too much time.
cat is extremely important and amazing.
the most useful course in SMU.
CAT is one of the most useful modules in SMU, despite its reputation.
However, the course material, which I believe is largely similar across board, is sort of messy.
I think if the materials were revised, and tweaked, it would better help the student's_x000D__x000D_
 learning.
CAT is simply too heavy.
For the project, I don't like the fact most are limited to business projects.
The project should be open to any kind of topic as long as it uses analysis in its course.
CAT is the most useful course that I have taken in SMU so far.
CAT is useful in the workplace and for other projects.
CAT is very interesting and useful.
I find that i am able to apply it in whatever i do and the formulas i am taught are very beneficial as i have to use excel frequently.
CAT is very useful in our everyday lives- definitely one of more important courses i have taken!
but the project requires alot of external learning which i struggled with.
CAT itself is a very difficult module, but XXXX made it easier to understand with clear examples and demonstrations.
CAT should be a module that should not include a final exam and should be graded so the focus can be learning.
cat tends to be a fast mod, meaning the instructors go rather quickly.
so i dont know how helpful it is for non-is students.
perhaps i didn't put in the required amount of practice and effort for the course, so i learnt a little, but kind of the tip of_x000D__x000D_
 the tongue on what excel can do.
the assignments were very useful to consolidate what i learnt in class and apply them so i definitely learnt how to better use the functions.
the project was very challenging.
personally find that cat is a difficult module_x000D__x000D_
 to learn everything yourself.
so the project takes up way too much time.
the thought processes seem so different, since its not a writing mod.
i can see how it'll be very useful, but at the end of the day, still don't think i can use excel that well to solve_x000D__x000D_
 real problems.
Certain expectations seem conflicting
Certain parts of course were difficult to understand.
challenging
Challenging and allows me to apply skills sets gained throughout my SIS journey and apply it to address problems faced by clients
challenging and interesting with different computing technologies.
challenging and useful
challenging exams questions to spur deep thinking.
Challenging to do, interesting
Challenging.
Cheerful, always willing to help students.
Made OOAD seem fun (:
Clarity tone of the lesson was one of his good point.
At the same time, he always encourage us or push us to think more about the model that we are going to create.
Class exercise can be better, examples writing the problem that we are supposed to solve for at the home page.
Class may be a bit dry at times but it is probably due to nature of the course
Class participation is good, but sometimes it seems like there are too many questions asked.
Class participation is really difficult in the course because it is so technical its either you get it or you don't.
The project is too time consuming as it requires us to research on some of the functions that are not taught in class.
Class was interesting and instructor was very passionate about imparting her knowledge to us.
class was sometimes too fast.
Clear
Clear and concise
Clear and concise.
Dislike nothing.
Clear and concised lectures
Clear and gd revision before each class
Clear delivery of instruction during the course
Clear explanation, but I hope he could go a little slower
Clear explanations
Clear explanations and analogies for complex topics.
Clear explanations on concept
clear helpful and easy to understand!
Clear in explanation of course content.
Clear in explanation!

Clear instructions
Clear lectures.
clear, caring delivery of the course
clear, very approachable.
Always open to student's views and supportive of them.
clearly explain the purpose of the course
Clearly explains concepts
Clearly understood
Coding portion of the course in the projects
collaboration projects with overseas teams - though it was a very good learning opportunity, overseas team members had commitment issues at times and lacked initiative on certain levels.
Common expectations should be set to ensure students from both sides_x000D__x000D_
 are on the same page in required effort/time/commitment.
comes across as dismissive of opinions at times
committed!
Communication barrier; Sometimes unable to understand what XXXX wants in the group project.
Company visit is awesome.
If anything, I would recommend people to take the course because of it.
External speaker also adds value to the whole experience.
complexity lies within the skills of the students themselves, not comparison with the outside world or other teams.
Concepts feels that its been half taught and not in depth and the concepts learnt will not be useful as it is not being taught on how to apply on real projects.
Concepts taught were applicable; using the computer's basic software such as excel to analyse data.
The term project could be improved as an analysis of a business case assignment instead of having the requirement to source for an 3rd party business to_x000D__x000D_
 have a level platform for all groups.
Concepts were explained clearly and made the effort to explain several times if we did not understand any particular topic.
Concise and good teaching with relevant materials
consider replacing class part components with another assignment
Constantly giving students useful feedback
Constantly seeking to clarify our doubts
conten is a bit diverse
Content can be structured in a more interesting way
Content covered in her lectures are doable and within scope
Content is seemingly hard to understand and the class was just not interactive enough
Content taught during class differs a lot from tests/lab tests.
content too much
control over class
Cool stuffs!
Could be clearer in explanations
Could contain lesser topics, as having the last few chapters included for the finals and more importantly, having a labtest on the sat of the last week of school, doesnt help in advocating learning how to learn.
We have to learn how to properly see the_x000D__x000D_
 logic of coding certain stuff, but WHYYY on that SATURDAY when starry night is held the night before.
HOW TO DRINK!? sorry for the rant.
but its my heartfelt thoughts.
Could explain concepts clearer
Could give clearer explanations and slow down the pace of lessons
Could go deeper into excel's functions.
More in class practice, not just with the functions, but open ended problems.
Could have been a little been less anal about certain stuff.
However, the pressure do help the students to learn.
Could have covered more.
Could have given more assignments to better prepare for mid term
Could have greater breadth in topics covered.
Could have had more lab exercises for practice.
Could include more information on what are the project requirements.
Having some points would not be enough in the project requirements.
Cables not enough.
Perhaps some case studies would be useful.
Could not see the relevance to me as a social science student.
Course can considering shifting the focus to SQL.
Too little lessons committed to teaching SQL.
May consider increasing the lessons for SQL to 3. Can cut down time spend on design.
Course content was very practical - some concepts could be applied in other modules
Course could be more standardized throughout the cohort.
Course could be scoped down.
course could have been better structured with more elaboration on slides and concrete examples/questions to answer (with proposed solutions).
Since the course in rather broad in nature (including for assignment/projects) - may want to look into exploring_x000D__x000D_
 more reliable sources for students to learn from.
Course could have more avenues to help team deal with client VS school/course expectations.
Course could have spent more time on app logger and less time on the rest of the stuff
Course duration for exploring the software is inadequate.
Course duration is too short.
Course encourages student to research more than just what is taught in class.
Course exposed me to a lot of new concepts which are very interesting and challenging.
Course exposes me to many new concepts which are valuable and interesting.
course focused on business solutions, as such many of the terms were business like NPC, stocks risk level?, for someone who never taken any business mod, it was hell trying to (1) understand the question (2) find the right solution.
Felt that this should_x000D__x000D_
 not have been a compulsory mod.
Course has too little focus on transient data(current trend)
Course is a bit hard to understand thus the project scale should not be so large but rather there should be more time spent on the discussion of exercises completed by the groups
Course is a great help to everything i do in life.
course is challenging especially the project
Course is difficult to understand.
course is enriching, and unlike normal modules in SMU.
Course is extremely interesting, I gonna take a second major on this
Course is extremely relevant in what I want to do in future.
Course is fun
course is fun, definitely useful and will help greatly in projects/internships next time:)
Course is good and useful and makes me more interested in this course.
Course is great.
Nothing much to feedback.
Course is interesting
Course is interesting and gives students a basic feel of what IT security is like.
Course is interesting and teaches us the basics of security concepts and ideas.
Course is interesting and useful for the future workplace.
Course is ok.
project isn't a good thing.
Course is quite heavy with deadlines every week.
or 5 days to do work after weekends.
Course is quite taxing, in terms of project wise since there are 2 projects within the course require a full blown business scenario
Course is really useful however the content is quite forgettable.
Students find it hard to remember last week's class.
Course is technically-demanding when approached with curiosity.
It throws students into exploration on their own while providing the fundamentals and directions to follow.
Course is too technical, a lot of theory, but just could not understand the logic behind it.
Course is too time-consuming
Course is totally unrelated to anything we learn, made worst by the fact that it is compulsory.
A pretty much useless course for SMU in general.
Course is useful if one wants to pursue a career in Enterprise web development.
However, learnt many aspects of IT and business that I didnt have an understanding of prior to taking the course.
course is v useful
Course is very dry, but interesting once you force yourself to pay attention
Course is very helpful especially in work environment.
Very useful course
Course lab is sometimes vague in requirements and more detailed instructions can be given to help in identifying out deliverable.
Course learning curve a little steep
Course material should have less implementation emphasis.
I've no idea why we are expected to produce highly technical ETL workflow and C# programming without ANY support from instructor/course material.
This course also have too few solid learning outcomes.
So much of the concepts are 'fluffy' and situational.
This course also shouldn't touch Data Mining topics.
course may not be entirely fair to all groups, taking into consideration different sponsor situations.
Course maybe too packed towards the end and can be even out better.
Course nature is depressing.
By right, the content should be interesting.
Course outline could be better and clearer.
Course project is really bad, the amount of effort that different students put in is not congruent.
Some students approach real clients, where time and effort is spent to approach and maintain relations with the client.
While other groups find random projects_x000D__x000D_
 that they do not have any need to maintain external validations.
There really is a need to give more credits to project teams with real clients, if not this project should not be graded.
Course relevance is easily understandable
Course require good teamwork.
Course seems very useful
Course should be made a university core.
Really useful
course should have more teaching of logic.
The advanced sql query should be introduced early before week7 as students would be busy for all the mods after week 7. Introducing these topics after week 7 or week 9 would give students less time to study and_x000D__x000D_
 understand these crucial topics which require a lot of understanding of logic
Course structure was not well organized.
Large bulk of time was spent at the initial stages on simple concepts.
While they formed the foundation, there was definitely room it to be compressed.
This refers to ER modeling and Logical design.
MySQL and PHP_x000D__x000D_
 segments formed the largely challenging and unfamiliar grounds which require more time, practice and in class guidance on.
More time should have been allocated to this end during lecture hours.
Constantly found ourselves to be limited to very short spans of_x000D__x000D_
 time after having learnt completely new and hence difficult language
Course taught us real life systems
Course teaches the most important tool in the financial world Project too tough
Course teaches useful skills
Course teaches very useful content, though the amount of time spent on the project is really too much.
Course time management could have been better given tight time shcedule
Course was challenging.
Lots of thing not taught.
Have to self learn
course was helpful in preparing students for future DM stuff.
but the time frame was too short to learn all the different languages.
i feel that sql was the hardest for me and the time frame given to learn it well was not sufficient.
and most of the time_x000D__x000D_
 was spent on the logical diagram which i felt was not necessary.
Course was initially dull and i feel could cover more topics!
Course was ok.
Course was quite boring at times.
But easy to absorb and understand.
Could do with a little more interesting subject or cool functions.
Course workload is quite heavy and lots of concepts are cramped into the 13 weeks of the term.
Created a very interactive learning environment, with many examples for the class to try out.
Creating a game application
Cute and nice
is an excellent instructor.
He is very helpful and understanding and makes the class very interactive.
is good!!make the class very Funny
is an engaging XXXXXXXX who isn't hesitant to pause in class to elaborate on more difficult concepts for the weaker student.
Like me.
is very patience and helpful.
I like his teaching style and clear explanation on the subject
Definitely enthusiastic about the subject and tried his best.
Could be a bit less sarcastic though.
Definitely helpful, probably needs to be taught in Year 1 Term 2.
Delivers his stuff well.
Demanding, but will do everything to help students
Despite course outline listing that several labs would be given, we were not given any substantial content in labs.
Very little time was devoted to hands-on experience with the softwares provided, we weren't taught much more than the basics such as importing_x000D__x000D_
 data into the software.
Due to the lack of labs and time allocated in-class to using the software, we received no guided experience in applying the concepts taught in class and had to face the project with little to no knowledge.
Detailed teaching.
She will answer to all our quries.
Didn't assume that we had basic knowledge in Excel, allowing those who didn't have prior experience with excel to learn and adjust quickly.
Didn't explain VBA clearly.
For a non-IS background student, I found it difficult to understand what was going on, and could only resort to plainly copying whatever she typed onto Excel, without understanding on what was going on.
Did not clearly explain_x000D__x000D_
 the purpose of effect of what she was typing - or she went through the explanation so quickly that I couldn't follow what was being said.
Didn't like all the stories.
I mostly wanted to learn more tips on how to use Excel.
Dislike having pre-assign group for assignment 1, because not all team members are committed.
I think it will be better if we can select our team members.
Dislike nothing.
Useful and excellent course to take
dislike that we didn't really learn about macro and that we have to discover how to go about doing it without much help
Dislike the course VM image, very slow!
Dislike the unfair allocation of grouping for assignment 1
Dislike: Come to class unprepared which just reading it from the slide.
Dislike: XXXX speak a bit too fast sometimes make it very hard for me to understand what is he trying to say.
Does not really follow the lecture slides.
dislike: Since it is a 1CU course, it is not reasonable to ask student to take at most 4 mods including FYP.
Unless it is a 2CU course.
Student should be free to take 5 CU without get any permissions.
Like: Enable us to experience real life project.
Dislike: The instructor expected us to discover what he wanted from us without giving us sufficient information on what he expected, and does not give enough opportunities to ask questions about what his requirement for the project was.
He merely responded_x000D__x000D_
 if you still don't know what is exploratory modeling after so many weeks, you have not understood the course.
dislike: the lab test is not a true indicator of the practice exercises given
Disliked: Be more strict about free rider issue raised by student.
Disliked: Team issue will not be entertained after passed the acceptance.
Disliked-The lack of textbook/study material
DM is a very well structured course that is a must learn subject for every IS student.
All the projects and workloads are manageable and effective.
However, the duration of lab test should be increased a little bit longer may be about 2 hours.
DM is really a fun course.I thoroughly enjoyed doing the projects assigned to us.
Really had a feel of what SQL and Database Management is about.
The pop quizzes were also very effective in helping me revise and keep up with the content of lessons:)
do not like the final exam !!!!!!
don't see the relevance to BBM and it's way too hard and fast-paced to be grasped.
Down to earth and very approachable.
Very clear in his requirements and feedback
Dr  knows the subject well and he's a caring XXXX who will talk to students during break to find out if they have any problems dealing with the subject.
Dr  is highly passionate in the use of spreadsheet for analysis purpose.
He frequently shares his experiences with the class, allowing us to understand how the real world applications work.
Dr  is articulate, understood what he says easily.
Dr   can improve our learning experience through demonstrating more interaction and lively session.
Dr.  has very interesting materials that highlighted how excel can be used to create models that is applicable in the real world
Draggy
Due to the problem of lack of organization, many labs were either cancelled or push back very very late, resulting in missing progressive learning.
This also resulted in very last minute rushing of work at the end of course, in which the instructor pushed_x000D__x000D_
 the final presentation 1 week later.
I felt that this was unfair since my our group chose a topic which had a smaller scope to cope with the deadlines, and now our project scope will look quite small as we were not able to expand alot even with the 1 week_x000D__x000D_
 extra time.
Due to time constraints, many important examples were not gone through
Due to unforeseen circumstances, it is unfair to feedback.
Due to unforeseen circumstances, the instructor is difficult to hardly available to seek help from.
TAs tried their best to help us, appreciate lots, but the IS417 they took covered different contents with the existing IS417.
duration too short
During labtest, I realised that some lecture notes/ slides are not inside the folder.
Please sure that the slides are inside the folders.
Easy going and funny.
Easy to approach and puts in effort to clarify our doubts.
Easy to understand, lessons are easy to follow as well.
Engaging
Engaging and able to explain well.
Engaging and open, interesting
engaging, enthusiastic, garners interest.
Enjoyed classes despite it being very challenging.
XXXX was interesting and lively and patient and learning under her made the subject inifinitely more tolerable.
ensured whole class could keep up
enthusiastic and entertaining.
classes were never boring.
more in class exercises would be good to have.
Enthusiastic, knowledgeable and fun.
Enthusiastic, tries his best to engage with students.
Even though this is the second time I am taking it, but I still manage to learn somethings out of it.
Everyone comes into the course with an expectation of a heavy workload.
This is reasonable given the nature of the course, and I find that having constant assessments (through quizzes and assignments in the first half of the semester, and the group project_x000D__x000D_
 in the second) is a very effective method of ensuring that students learn as much as possible.
I agree wholeheartedly with the breakdown in the grade components.
The things taught as well are very useful for application in real life.
Everything just goes wrong.
exam is redundant , should be more project based and school can give us data or more specific area to work on.
Exams are redundant.
Given that this is already a heavy module due to the project, implementing exams would make it an even heavier module.
Exams should be replaced with more take-home activity - these assignments are the ones that I learnt the most
Exams for the course.
MEH.
Excel is a very important tool for us.
And the course is very useful.
Excel is extremely useful, in the course of learning the program, I was already applying it on other projects (e.g. for Management Accounting project)
Excel is fun
excel is useful but most students just recycle past projects, making it quite unfair
Excel skills are very useful in other courses and in future jobs.
Excellent in his field, pragmatic, gives constructive feedback and works to push the team.
Lends help and is realistic with the team.
Learnt a lot from this XXXXXXXX, am very glad to have him as our supervisor.
Excellent practical material which would definitely be useful in the current business environment we live in
Excellent!
This XXXX teaches well and he is able to influence us with his passion.
He has the patience to teach the whole class, and he is very approachable - always ready for consultation.
Excellent, strongly recommended
Excited about going to Korea for a trip
Experienced
Explain solution in a step by step procedure which is good and easy to follow, can probably enlarge excel file from time to time so that students at the back can see better.
Explained everything very clearly.
Did not move too fast for the class and answers every question regardless of how trivial.
Awesome XXXX.
explained pros and cons of certain concepts but never did come to a conclusion.
was interesting in sharing his experiences in the working world.
Explained the concept of IST clearly.
And offered high level view
Explains concepts very well.
It is a pleasure to attend his lessons.
The pace of his teachings is just nice for me to cope and understand with the concepts introduced
explanations sometimes not adequate.
course expectations not laid out clearly
Expose to XML which i feel is useful
extremely fun and useful~!
Extremely helpful and knowledgeable.
Extremely intensive and should be considered more than 1 CU
Extremely knowledgeable
Extremely resourceful and practical
extremely useful in all sorts of analysis
Extremely useful skills to learn.
Eye opening
Fairness and clarity in the lectures.
Friendly too.
Fairness.
Feel that there is too much unneeded work to configure the basic setup of the project, let alone optimising the configurations themselves.
Feels like theres not enough time to really learn more useful skills, the course is interesting but needs more time
Felt that the BattleStations app should have been made into a team project instead.
This way students would have no choice but to do it and be encouraged to do the app as well, since the work is split.
The current system of do-it-yourself is not effective_x000D__x000D_
 and due to the complexity of the app, many are discouraged to complete it as it would be too time consuming.
field trip is awesome, in class exercise is good also.
Like that no exam.
another awesome!
Field trip to PSA was good.
First time being able to look in the Pasir Panjang Terminal area.
Also, the use of FlexSim is useful for future career prospect.
final exam should be done in week 14, although i respect the student's opinion to have it in week 13.
I believe it is major enough such that having it in week 14 would give the students enough preparation.
Find that learning excel will be definitely of a great help in future
flawless
Flexibility in coming up with our own scenarios is great so that we are not entirely restricted.
The release of the second project could be earlier so that the timeline for completing it will be less rushed.
Flexibility of technology chosen
Flexible and approachable.
Focuses on analysis, not the excel skills, which is beneficial for non-IS students.
follow too strictly to slides and teaching material
Foundational course, but really useful
friendly
friendly and able to approach outside class
Friendly and approachable
Friendly and approachable, easy to get feedback from him
Friendly and approachable.
Could be more engaging
Friendly and approachable.
He would encourage students to visit his office during non-class hours for more clarifications on certain concepts.

sharing of interesting concepts with the class
most of the time instructor speaks way too fast for students to grasp especially for more difficult concepts towards the end.
and often, when instructor asks if there are any questions, it's hard for students to raise questions when they have not even_x000D_
very knowledgeable, patient and easygoing - sounding a little more upbeat may help with the class's energy level
XXXX  is very competent in her subject expertise.
clear explanation, interactve more examples could have been given
helpful, clear explanation more illustration needed
humorous, helpful, interesting more examples could have been given to facilitate understanding
important skill limited skills on excel
iteresting and provides opportunity to leaarn about security limited in content.
More technical content would have been better
new skills, new concepts limited in class learning
He shared lots of insights with the class with regards to setting up a company
sharing of interesting concepts with the class
should include more management tools into the course
He is friendly and approachable.
2
He gives sufficient examples for concepts to help students better understand what is taught in class, especially the more difficult concepts.
3
He gives his attention to the students whenever a student poses a question_x000D__x000D_
 to him individually.
The course project is very difficult, but very challenging.
2. The starting of class at 8.15am does not seem to make any difference to the morning rush crowd after all.
could include some field trip during the week 8 break
20 page in depth report could use a bit more guidance on expectations
815am lesson in the morning is a bit too early
A bit boring
A bit too heavy at times.
Project has a very wide scope.
But very useful.
A bit too rushed.
While we are taught a lot which is good, the tested material is very different, which lends to confusion.
Distinctions should be made.
A friends, approaching and helpful XXXX who is always ready to help his students when they needed him.
:D I enjoyed your class XXXX! :D
A general guideline on what to be done on the project would be better that just giving us the topic name.
Or if it is an open ended project please state it clearly so that we can adjust the scope accordingly.
A little more attention should be paid towards the Apple (Mac) users.
A little to unstructured and unfocused.
More bridging between theory and practice.
A lot of content.
Interesting hand-on exercises and labs help stimulate student's interest in the course.
A lot of things need to learn by our self outside class
A lot of work.
A more organized course outline would be better
A rather patient XXXX that encourages us despite the fact that we were not performing as expected.
a really helpful tool in the working world
A useful course.
The main useful things in the course were the excel tips and the project (self-learning).
The course outline should state the following prerequisites: Statistics, Finance, FA, MA, MS-Excel.
There is little time to create the project.
A very good instructor.
Has passion in what he is teaching and he is able to communicate the ideas to the students.
Teaches very well, and he is able to slow down for those who do not understand.
One of the best lecturer thus far!
A very passionate and enthusiastic instructor.
A very useful course as data is booming in the workforce now.
A very useful course.
AA is awesome
AA is definitely a course all SIS students should go through to understand the basic about real world computing issues.
Able to clearly explain the concepts and illustrating it with on hand examples
Able to explore more into different areas of IT.
For me, its mobile development.
Able to have hand-on experiencs with Tibco EMS and Designer
Able to pinpoint areas of improvements that the team lacks.
Practical in ensuring that our ideas are realistic and feasible.
Able to work with sponsors in business setting Able to build an application from scratch Able to present to sponsors and internal stakeholders Able to have a sense of responsibility in committing
accent tends to mix up public and private pronunciations which can be very confusing overall tries his best to teach and explain as clearly as possible
Advanced Data Management is very useful course.
it tells us about how real data is store in disk and how can make a faster read and write etc.
all IS course are good
All lectures were very interesting and helpful.
XXXX effectively led her courses and I enjoyed her class.
However, as many students have not used/utilized much of excel functions and formula, it'd be better for students to do more practice problems during_x000D__x000D_
 class.
Alot of self-learning
Although her presentation skills may not be the best, but she makes it up with her enthusiasm for the subject, and she's very willing to help anyone who is unable to cope.
She also offers consultations to weaker students, which i think is commendable.
Although it is our responsibility to learn the Java syntax I think it would be better that our XXXX is more certain on what are the right things.
Although it was emphasised that the course focuses on algorithms and not coding, a 25% project was introduced, which requires coding in ruby.
Whats more, it is ironic that while many of us are still unsure of ruby and the algorithms, we were required to_x000D__x000D_
 code the project out in less than 3 weeks.
The way the project is graded, focusing only on question 3 and question 4, is simply unfair and disregards the effort that students have to put in just to code out question 1 and 2. Grading the project for 25% is_x000D__x000D_
 simply too much and just unfairly places a quarter of the marks on coding skills, which the course emphasises it is not about.
In this respect, I would think that the emphasis of the course should be more clear.
Although the course assignments are technically challenging, the grading criteria places more emphasis on the learning of the core objectives instead of the 'hardcore' technical aspect.
Although the course is a bit dry, i see the value in it in the technology industry.
Always approach students and check whether we're doing fine, always an engaging presenter, friendly
Always available for feedback/ because he was very technical, he didn't really understand the questions from someone with no background on the subject
always breaks it down for us to simple parts and explains to us.
Very approachable
Always comes prepared to class.
always concern for student and willing to help weaker student
always give feedback in the start of lesson
always helped the students during lab, very patient
Always provide a recap of last week lesson's concept before the start of the lesson.
always there to help students
Always willing to meet for consultation.
Always willing to meet the group for consultation.
Among all the modules that i have taken, I hve to admit that this course is the course that is the most useful.
The skills we learnt in would not be easily attained, and it is so useful in our daily life application.
Definitely a course for everyone!
An experienced and interesting XXXXXXXX.
She made the effort to go through various excel functions and examples and personally attended to our questions.
an extension of IS200, helps the student to build up relevant programming skills.
Apart from getting to learn new stuff in OOAD from XXXX, I really dreaded going to class each week.
I felt that the course outline was too confusing, where each week we switched between XXXX and our instructor (for sample application exercises etc).
For_x000D__x000D_
 example, I cannot fully appreciate how what I learned this week can be applied to what we will learn next week.
The XXXXs should NOT take away the project component and assign it as an individual, ungraded project.
The weaker coders will be the true victims_x000D__x000D_
 from this decision.
Because although taking away the project also removes stress from the students, making it an individual project (without guided instructions or template codes) means weaker students will get lost.
From the start.
As a team, we will be_x000D__x000D_
 able to get help from team-mates and be more motivated to achieve the milestones.
Applicable and useful in general.
applicable in creating simulations
Applicable to real life scenario and learnt very useful functions&nbsp; But, the project is a little too demanding
Applicable to real world situation
appreciate more about IT security
Appreciate XXXX's strictness and frankness in conducting this course.
IST is a module that is more related to knowledge and I think students are not very willing to dive into the technicals.
It is your enforcement that ensures everyone focuses on it and_x000D__x000D_
 I'm thankful for that
Approachable
Approachable after lesson for consultation.
However, sometime he went through the concepts a bit too fast for us to gasp.
Approachable and always willing to lend a helping hand
approachable and interesting teaching style
Approachable and teaches clearly
Approachable for consultation after lesson
Approachable, always willing to sit down with you to discues your progress and provide feedback.
Approachable, dedicated.
approachable, pragmatic, thorough, great mentor, provides constructive advice, direction and approach.
Approachable, willing to help students
Appropriate and sufficient examples for me to learn what was each topic about.
As a soci student, I feel that CAT skills might be important for us, but not in the business perspective that the course is tailored towards.
As a result, there are many negative implications towards soci students.
In general, we can't contribute much_x000D__x000D_
 to the group, esp so when the focus is largely on financial predictions and business models.
It is a known fact that soci students are unwanted in groups as we are the bottlenecks and are unable to contribute much and are taken in by friends out of sympathy.
As students, we try our best to understand XXXX's circumstances and difficulty.
But the lack of communication for half the semester causes many students to feel lost and insecure.
As this course is an IS module.
I felt that the IS students in class generally have an advantage, given their familiarity with programming.
The course focuses heavily on group project, thus groups without IS students were disadvantaged as we had less understanding_x000D__x000D_
 of VBA coding which allowed IS students to produce more impressive models with their spreadsheets.
suggestion: CAT course for IS students and students under different majors can be separated
Ask questions about our assumption/answers even though knowing that the assumption/answer was wrong, leading to the answer.
Asks challenging questions to get us to think deeper.
Assignment 2 grouping should not be randomized.
It would be more appropriate if they are grouped according the grades, such as having a mixture of those who are better and those who are not as good together.
This would ensure that those who are very strong_x000D__x000D_
 will not be grouped with those who are their same level!
Assignment 2 released too late / advance concepts taught too late in the semester.
More support from instructors and XXXXXXXXs when students require help with out of the class functionalities
Assignment requirements were unclear and requirements keep changing, akin to shifting goal post.
If you are going to change a requirement, then we expect you to change the deadline if it is changed on short notice.
Student don't just take 1 module a semester.
Assignment time frame might be too short
Assignments are a little too technical as compared to the course outline.
Assignments are too hard and competitive, not all students are able to get it in one go in such short period.
Too much things which need to be taught, just too packed.
making expectation for student to be high.
assignments from week 1 to 13 is too much work.
it would be great if assignments were cut down and the module is scoped down further. it was a good module, holistic however i felt too much was trying to be incorporated through the course.
Associate XXXXXXXX  was a great instructor because he engaged the class with deep thinking.
At first I really didn't like the way he teach, but I got used to it and he was actually very funny
At times a little long-winded, think it would have helped if delivery was more concise.
Attempts to gather class involvement
Available outside of class for any consultation sessions.
Awesome, keep up the good job.
Balanced quizzes, having easy and tough questions.
No exams very good.
More tutorials on netlogo would be nice.
basic design principles to help us develop a simple application using object oriented concepts
Battlestations Project is too difficult for a year 1 programming project.
BattleStations was a good project but at least, it will help if alittle bit of answers are released to us because we dont know if what we did on battlestations are correct.
We may do it wrong all along and thus learn the wrong way of coding.
Because i dont have IT background so i think that two lessons for SQL are not enough.
XXXX also can give us more exercises about SQL coding.
Before the class started, XXXX summarized the learning objective of previous lesson and ask questions to the class for refreshing our mind.
I liked it much.
Bell Curve.
Everyone is super smart and it becomes such that its about who has full marks, not about what we are learning
Beneficial
best XXXX
Better understanding on data management!
XXXX makes the course interesting!
The assignment engages me and rest of other groups to discuss tgt and learn tgt!
Boring and dry for the content.
Overall still fine.
But the lab can be more clear, it's really hard to follow when the steps are not clear enough.
BRING PROJECT BACK INTO OOAD !! NO MORE LABTEST!!! MAKE THE PROJECT 70%!!
So that students are able to grasp the concepts of OO and hands on without the time constraint.
Most students are able to do remarkable codes but panic and not given much room to_x000D__x000D_
 provide good answers to the labtest.
But definitely the course in this case is certainty affected and the learning outcome is unclear.
Can be a little monotonous, students might have a little difficulty in understanding whether the XXXX is asking a question or saying a statement Due to the nature of the course, questions asked must be quite specific and understandable.
He was able make_x000D__x000D_
 sure that we clearly understand the questions asked so that we can do our work with little issues.
Can be counted as a 2 CU module
can be more engaging
Can be more hands on
Can be more interesting
Can be more proactive and could have structured the course learning in a more structured manner.
Can get a little monotonous
Can give very detailed descriptions of terms on slides.
Very focused on students.
can have interim feedback or submission for project.
can perhaps offer advanced CAT or VBA lessons as an optional mod - can liaise with external companies for these lessons and allowing interested students to continue learning, at a subsidised rate perhaps?
Can provide more feedback with regards to the project.
Can take out the weekly reviews and focus more on the labs
Can work on articulating himself better, but nevertheless knowledgeable
Caring and sincere teaching method made for a comfortable learning environment.
However, insufficient time was given for most of the quizzes.
Caring XXXXXXXX.
CAT could have been a very enjoyable mod but the instructor was monotonous, uninspiring and seemed unsure about certain topics.
CAT has given me the skills to easily manage my business and simplified processes into just a click of a mouse.
It has shown me the power of using excel and made me rely on excel for every work i do.
CAT is a useful mod and relevant for my course
Cat is a very useful coursd
CAT is a very useful module as I start to realise that many jobs require the use of excel sheets.
Other that that, it is very useful for everyday usage.
CAT is all about practicing and the project showed me how excel modeling can be applied to real-case problems and explore various scenarios which ultimately provide some form of benefits for the client.
CAT is by far one of my most tiring mod ever where I spend all my weekend after break week in school.
No denying that the mod is interesting and useful but seriously I spend so much time on it and what about the other mods?
SMU should seriously re-consider_x000D__x000D_
 the mod guideline and stuff.
Its taking way too much time.
cat is extremely important and amazing.
the most useful course in SMU.
CAT is one of the most useful modules in SMU, despite its reputation.
However, the course material, which I believe is largely similar across board, is sort of messy.
I think if the materials were revised, and tweaked, it would better help the student's_x000D__x000D_
 learning.
CAT is simply too heavy.
For the project, I don't like the fact most are limited to business projects.
The project should be open to any kind of topic as long as it uses analysis in its course.
CAT is the most useful course that I have taken in SMU so far.
CAT is useful in the workplace and for other projects.
CAT is very interesting and useful.
I find that i am able to apply it in whatever i do and the formulas i am taught are very beneficial as i have to use excel frequently.
CAT is very useful in our everyday lives- definitely one of more important courses i have taken!
but the project requires alot of external learning which i struggled with.
CAT itself is a very difficult module, but XXXX made it easier to understand with clear examples and demonstrations.
CAT should be a module that should not include a final exam and should be graded so the focus can be learning.
cat tends to be a fast mod, meaning the instructors go rather quickly.
so i dont know how helpful it is for non-is students.
perhaps i didn't put in the required amount of practice and effort for the course, so i learnt a little, but kind of the tip of_x000D__x000D_
 the tongue on what excel can do.
the assignments were very useful to consolidate what i learnt in class and apply them so i definitely learnt how to better use the functions.
the project was very challenging.
personally find that cat is a difficult module_x000D__x000D_
 to learn everything yourself.
so the project takes up way too much time.
the thought processes seem so different, since its not a writing mod.
i can see how it'll be very useful, but at the end of the day, still don't think i can use excel that well to solve_x000D__x000D_
 real problems.
Certain expectations seem conflicting
Certain parts of course were difficult to understand.

Challenging and allows me to apply skills sets gained throughout my SIS journey and apply it to address problems faced by clients

Cheerful, always willing to help students.
Made OOAD seem fun (:
Clarity tone of the lesson was one of his good point.
At the same time, he always encourage us or push us to think more about the model that we are going to create.
Class exercise can be better, examples writing the problem that we are supposed to solve for at the home page.
Class may be a bit dry at times but it is probably due to nature of the course
Class participation is good, but sometimes it seems like there are too many questions asked.
Class participation is really difficult in the course because it is so technical its either you get it or you don't.
The project is too time consuming as it requires us to research on some of the functions that are not taught in class.
Class was interesting and instructor was very passionate about imparting her knowledge to us.
class was sometimes too fast.

Coding portion of the course in the projects
collaboration projects with overseas teams - though it was a very good learning opportunity, overseas team members had commitment issues at times and lacked initiative on certain levels.
Common expectations should be set to ensure students from both sides_x000D__x000D_
 are on the same page in required effort/time/commitment.
comes across as dismissive of opinions at times
committed!
Communication barrier; Sometimes unable to understand what XXXX wants in the group project.
Company visit is awesome.
If anything, I would recommend people to take the course because of it.
External speaker also adds value to the whole experience.
complexity lies within the skills of the students themselves, not comparison with the outside world or other teams.
Concepts feels that its been half taught and not in depth and the concepts learnt will not be useful as it is not being taught on how to apply on real projects.
Concepts taught were applicable; using the computer's basic software such as excel to analyse data.
The term project could be improved as an analysis of a business case assignment instead of having the requirement to source for an 3rd party business to_x000D__x000D_
 have a level platform for all groups.
Concepts were explained clearly and made the effort to explain several times if we did not understand any particular topic.
Concise and good teaching with relevant materials
consider replacing class part components with another assignment
Constantly giving students useful feedback
Constantly seeking to clarify our doubts
conten is a bit diverse
Content can be structured in a more interesting way
Content covered in her lectures are doable and within scope
Content is seemingly hard to understand and the class was just not interactive enough
Content taught during class differs a lot from tests/lab tests.
content too much
control over class
Cool stuffs!
Could be clearer in explanations
Could contain lesser topics, as having the last few chapters included for the finals and more importantly, having a labtest on the sat of the last week of school, doesnt help in advocating learning how to learn.
We have to learn how to properly see the_x000D__x000D_
 logic of coding certain stuff, but WHYYY on that SATURDAY when starry night is held the night before.
HOW TO DRINK!? sorry for the rant.
but its my heartfelt thoughts.
Could explain concepts clearer
Could give clearer explanations and slow down the pace of lessons
Could go deeper into excel's functions.
More in class practice, not just with the functions, but open ended problems.
Could have been a little been less anal about certain stuff.
However, the pressure do help the students to learn.
Could have covered more.
Could have given more assignments to better prepare for mid term
Could have greater breadth in topics covered.
Could have had more lab exercises for practice.
Could include more information on what are the project requirements.
Having some points would not be enough in the project requirements.
Cables not enough.
Perhaps some case studies would be useful.
Could not see the relevance to me as a social science student.
Course can considering shifting the focus to SQL.
Too little lessons committed to teaching SQL.
May consider increasing the lessons for SQL to 3. Can cut down time spend on design.
Course content was very practical - some concepts could be applied in other modules
Course could be more standardized throughout the cohort.
Course could be scoped down.
course could have been better structured with more elaboration on slides and concrete examples/questions to answer (with proposed solutions).
Since the course in rather broad in nature (including for assignment/projects) - may want to look into exploring_x000D__x000D_
 more reliable sources for students to learn from.
Course could have more avenues to help team deal with client VS school/course expectations.
Course could have spent more time on app logger and less time on the rest of the stuff
Course duration for exploring the software is inadequate.
Course duration is too short.
Course encourages student to research more than just what is taught in class.
Course exposed me to a lot of new concepts which are very interesting and challenging.
Course exposes me to many new concepts which are valuable and interesting.
course focused on business solutions, as such many of the terms were business like NPC, stocks risk level?, for someone who never taken any business mod, it was hell trying to (1) understand the question (2) find the right solution.
Felt that this should_x000D__x000D_
 not have been a compulsory mod.
Course has too little focus on transient data(current trend)
Course is a bit hard to understand thus the project scale should not be so large but rather there should be more time spent on the discussion of exercises completed by the groups
Course is a great help to everything i do in life.
course is challenging especially the project
Course is difficult to understand.
course is enriching, and unlike normal modules in SMU.
Course is extremely interesting, I gonna take a second major on this
Course is extremely relevant in what I want to do in future.
Course is fun
course is fun, definitely useful and will help greatly in projects/internships next time:)
Course is good and useful and makes me more interested in this course.
Course is great.
Nothing much to feedback.
Course is interesting
Course is interesting and gives students a basic feel of what IT security is like.
Course is interesting and teaches us the basics of security concepts and ideas.
Course is interesting and useful for the future workplace.
Course is ok.
project isn't a good thing.
Course is quite heavy with deadlines every week.
or 5 days to do work after weekends.
Course is quite taxing, in terms of project wise since there are 2 projects within the course require a full blown business scenario
Course is really useful however the content is quite forgettable.
Students find it hard to remember last week's class.
Course is technically-demanding when approached with curiosity.
It throws students into exploration on their own while providing the fundamentals and directions to follow.
Course is too technical, a lot of theory, but just could not understand the logic behind it.
Course is too time-consuming
Course is totally unrelated to anything we learn, made worst by the fact that it is compulsory.
A pretty much useless course for SMU in general.
Course is useful if one wants to pursue a career in Enterprise web development.
However, learnt many aspects of IT and business that I didnt have an understanding of prior to taking the course.
course is v useful
Course is very dry, but interesting once you force yourself to pay attention
Course is very helpful especially in work environment.
Very useful course
Course lab is sometimes vague in requirements and more detailed instructions can be given to help in identifying out deliverable.
Course learning curve a little steep
Course material should have less implementation emphasis.
I've no idea why we are expected to produce highly technical ETL workflow and C# programming without ANY support from instructor/course material.
This course also have too few solid learning outcomes.
So much of the concepts are 'fluffy' and situational.
This course also shouldn't touch Data Mining topics.
course may not be entirely fair to all groups, taking into consideration different sponsor situations.
Course maybe too packed towards the end and can be even out better.
Course nature is depressing.
By right, the content should be interesting.
Course outline could be better and clearer.
Course project is really bad, the amount of effort that different students put in is not congruent.
Some students approach real clients, where time and effort is spent to approach and maintain relations with the client.
While other groups find random projects_x000D__x000D_
 that they do not have any need to maintain external validations.
There really is a need to give more credits to project teams with real clients, if not this project should not be graded.
Course relevance is easily understandable
Course require good teamwork.
Course seems very useful
Course should be made a university core.
Really useful
course should have more teaching of logic.
The advanced sql query should be introduced early before week7 as students would be busy for all the mods after week 7. Introducing these topics after week 7 or week 9 would give students less time to study and_x000D__x000D_
 understand these crucial topics which require a lot of understanding of logic
Course structure was not well organized.
Large bulk of time was spent at the initial stages on simple concepts.
While they formed the foundation, there was definitely room it to be compressed.
This refers to ER modeling and Logical design.
MySQL and PHP_x000D__x000D_
 segments formed the largely challenging and unfamiliar grounds which require more time, practice and in class guidance on.
More time should have been allocated to this end during lecture hours.
Constantly found ourselves to be limited to very short spans of_x000D__x000D_
 time after having learnt completely new and hence difficult language
Course taught us real life systems
Course teaches the most important tool in the financial world Project too tough
Course teaches useful skills
Course teaches very useful content, though the amount of time spent on the project is really too much.
Course time management could have been better given tight time shcedule
Course was challenging.
Lots of thing not taught.
Have to self learn
course was helpful in preparing students for future DM stuff.
but the time frame was too short to learn all the different languages.
i feel that sql was the hardest for me and the time frame given to learn it well was not sufficient.
and most of the time_x000D__x000D_
 was spent on the logical diagram which i felt was not necessary.
Course was initially dull and i feel could cover more topics!
Course was ok.
Course was quite boring at times.
But easy to absorb and understand.
Could do with a little more interesting subject or cool functions.
Course workload is quite heavy and lots of concepts are cramped into the 13 weeks of the term.
Created a very interactive learning environment, with many examples for the class to try out.
Creating a game application
Cute and nice
is an excellent instructor.
He is very helpful and understanding and makes the class very interactive.
is good!!make the class very Funny
is an engaging XXXXXXXX who isn't hesitant to pause in class to elaborate on more difficult concepts for the weaker student.
Like me.
is very patience and helpful.
I like his teaching style and clear explanation on the subject
Definitely enthusiastic about the subject and tried his best.
Could be a bit less sarcastic though.
Definitely helpful, probably needs to be taught in Year 1 Term 2.
Delivers his stuff well.
Demanding, but will do everything to help students
Despite course outline listing that several labs would be given, we were not given any substantial content in labs.
Very little time was devoted to hands-on experience with the softwares provided, we weren't taught much more than the basics such as importing_x000D__x000D_
 data into the software.
Due to the lack of labs and time allocated in-class to using the software, we received no guided experience in applying the concepts taught in class and had to face the project with little to no knowledge.
Detailed teaching.
She will answer to all our quries.
Didn't assume that we had basic knowledge in Excel, allowing those who didn't have prior experience with excel to learn and adjust quickly.
Didn't explain VBA clearly.
For a non-IS background student, I found it difficult to understand what was going on, and could only resort to plainly copying whatever she typed onto Excel, without understanding on what was going on.
Did not clearly explain_x000D__x000D_
 the purpose of effect of what she was typing - or she went through the explanation so quickly that I couldn't follow what was being said.
Didn't like all the stories.
I mostly wanted to learn more tips on how to use Excel.
Dislike having pre-assign group for assignment 1, because not all team members are committed.
I think it will be better if we can select our team members.
Dislike nothing.
Useful and excellent course to take
dislike that we didn't really learn about macro and that we have to discover how to go about doing it without much help
Dislike the course VM image, very slow!
Dislike the unfair allocation of grouping for assignment 1
Dislike: Come to class unprepared which just reading it from the slide.
Dislike: XXXX speak a bit too fast sometimes make it very hard for me to understand what is he trying to say.
Does not really follow the lecture slides.
dislike: Since it is a 1CU course, it is not reasonable to ask student to take at most 4 mods including FYP.
Unless it is a 2CU course.
Student should be free to take 5 CU without get any permissions.
Like: Enable us to experience real life project.
Dislike: The instructor expected us to discover what he wanted from us without giving us sufficient information on what he expected, and does not give enough opportunities to ask questions about what his requirement for the project was.
He merely responded_x000D__x000D_
 if you still don't know what is exploratory modeling after so many weeks, you have not understood the course.
dislike: the lab test is not a true indicator of the practice exercises given
Disliked: Be more strict about free rider issue raised by student.
Disliked: Team issue will not be entertained after passed the acceptance.
Disliked-The lack of textbook/study material
DM is a very well structured course that is a must learn subject for every IS student.
All the projects and workloads are manageable and effective.
However, the duration of lab test should be increased a little bit longer may be about 2 hours.
DM is really a fun course.I thoroughly enjoyed doing the projects assigned to us.
Really had a feel of what SQL and Database Management is about.
The pop quizzes were also very effective in helping me revise and keep up with the content of lessons:)
do not like the final exam !!!!!!
don't see the relevance to BBM and it's way too hard and fast-paced to be grasped.
Down to earth and very approachable.
Very clear in his requirements and feedback
Dr  knows the subject well and he's a caring XXXX who will talk to students during break to find out if they have any problems dealing with the subject.
Dr  is highly passionate in the use of spreadsheet for analysis purpose.
He frequently shares his experiences with the class, allowing us to understand how the real world applications work.
Dr  is articulate, understood what he says easily.
Dr   can improve our learning experience through demonstrating more interaction and lively session.
Dr.  has very interesting materials that highlighted how excel can be used to create models that is applicable in the real world
Draggy
Due to the problem of lack of organization, many labs were either cancelled or push back very very late, resulting in missing progressive learning.
This also resulted in very last minute rushing of work at the end of course, in which the instructor pushed_x000D__x000D_
 the final presentation 1 week later.
I felt that this was unfair since my our group chose a topic which had a smaller scope to cope with the deadlines, and now our project scope will look quite small as we were not able to expand alot even with the 1 week_x000D__x000D_
 extra time.
Due to time constraints, many important examples were not gone through
Due to unforeseen circumstances, it is unfair to feedback.
Due to unforeseen circumstances, the instructor is difficult to hardly available to seek help from.
TAs tried their best to help us, appreciate lots, but the IS417 they took covered different contents with the existing IS417.
duration too short
During labtest, I realised that some lecture notes/ slides are not inside the folder.
Please sure that the slides are inside the folders.
Easy going and funny.
Easy to approach and puts in effort to clarify our doubts.
Easy to understand, lessons are easy to follow as well.
Engaging
Engaging and able to explain well.
Engaging and open, interesting
engaging, enthusiastic, garners interest.
Enjoyed classes despite it being very challenging.
XXXX was interesting and lively and patient and learning under her made the subject inifinitely more tolerable.
ensured whole class could keep up
enthusiastic and entertaining.
classes were never boring.
more in class exercises would be good to have.
Enthusiastic, knowledgeable and fun.
Enthusiastic, tries his best to engage with students.
Even though this is the second time I am taking it, but I still manage to learn somethings out of it.
Everyone comes into the course with an expectation of a heavy workload.
This is reasonable given the nature of the course, and I find that having constant assessments (through quizzes and assignments in the first half of the semester, and the group project_x000D__x000D_
 in the second) is a very effective method of ensuring that students learn as much as possible.
I agree wholeheartedly with the breakdown in the grade components.
The things taught as well are very useful for application in real life.
Everything just goes wrong.
exam is redundant , should be more project based and school can give us data or more specific area to work on.
Exams are redundant.
Given that this is already a heavy module due to the project, implementing exams would make it an even heavier module.
Exams should be replaced with more take-home activity - these assignments are the ones that I learnt the most
Exams for the course.
MEH.
Excel is a very important tool for us.
And the course is very useful.
Excel is extremely useful, in the course of learning the program, I was already applying it on other projects (e.g. for Management Accounting project)
Excel is fun
excel is useful but most students just recycle past projects, making it quite unfair
Excel skills are very useful in other courses and in future jobs.
Excellent in his field, pragmatic, gives constructive feedback and works to push the team.
Lends help and is realistic with the team.
Learnt a lot from this XXXXXXXX, am very glad to have him as our supervisor.
Excellent practical material which would definitely be useful in the current business environment we live in
Excellent!
This XXXX teaches well and he is able to influence us with his passion.
He has the patience to teach the whole class, and he is very approachable - always ready for consultation.
Excellent, strongly recommended
Excited about going to Korea for a trip
Experienced
Explain solution in a step by step procedure which is good and easy to follow, can probably enlarge excel file from time to time so that students at the back can see better.
Explained everything very clearly.
Did not move too fast for the class and answers every question regardless of how trivial.
Awesome XXXX.
explained pros and cons of certain concepts but never did come to a conclusion.
was interesting in sharing his experiences in the working world.
Explained the concept of IST clearly.
And offered high level view
Explains concepts very well.
It is a pleasure to attend his lessons.
The pace of his teachings is just nice for me to cope and understand with the concepts introduced
explanations sometimes not adequate.
course expectations not laid out clearly
Expose to XML which i feel is useful
extremely fun and useful~!
Extremely helpful and knowledgeable.
Extremely intensive and should be considered more than 1 CU
Extremely knowledgeable
Extremely resourceful and practical
extremely useful in all sorts of analysis
Extremely useful skills to learn.
Eye opening
Fairness and clarity in the lectures.
Friendly too.
Fairness.
Feel that there is too much unneeded work to configure the basic setup of the project, let alone optimising the configurations themselves.
Feels like theres not enough time to really learn more useful skills, the course is interesting but needs more time
Felt that the BattleStations app should have been made into a team project instead.
This way students would have no choice but to do it and be encouraged to do the app as well, since the work is split.
The current system of do-it-yourself is not effective_x000D__x000D_
 and due to the complexity of the app, many are discouraged to complete it as it would be too time consuming.
field trip is awesome, in class exercise is good also.
Like that no exam.
another awesome!
Field trip to PSA was good.
First time being able to look in the Pasir Panjang Terminal area.
Also, the use of FlexSim is useful for future career prospect.
final exam should be done in week 14, although i respect the student's opinion to have it in week 13.
I believe it is major enough such that having it in week 14 would give the students enough preparation.
Find that learning excel will be definitely of a great help in future
flawless
Flexibility in coming up with our own scenarios is great so that we are not entirely restricted.
The release of the second project could be earlier so that the timeline for completing it will be less rushed.
Flexibility of technology chosen
Flexible and approachable.
Focuses on analysis, not the excel skills, which is beneficial for non-IS students.
follow too strictly to slides and teaching material
Foundational course, but really useful
friendly
friendly and able to approach outside class
Friendly and approachable
Friendly and approachable, easy to get feedback from him
Friendly and approachable.
Could be more engaging
Friendly and approachable.
He would encourage students to visit his office during non-class hours for more clarifications on certain concepts.
