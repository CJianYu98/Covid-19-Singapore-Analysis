WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,11/3/21,1,1.0

I have been wondering if the lady I spoke to in BCA have reported upwards to her manager or just couldn't be bordered? If she did, what have the manager done about my complain? Took bus 35 from Bedok Mall. This bus passes by a dormitory along Tanah Merah Costal road. Most of the time, I can see FWs standing outside their dorm door without social distancing and without putting on face mask. Occasionally, I can see them walking from 1 door to another and mix socializing.  So, I have expected to see that re-infections in dorms is very likely and high.  A sad encounter... with stupid people in the BCA. I could tell and felt that the lady I spoke to was not interested as she did not even asked for my particulars for me to expect BCA's feedback and actions taken.  Where are the dormitory ambassador to control and ensure proper mask wearing and socializing control in the dorms?  There is no whistle blowing contact to the correct agencies.

Psychologically and mentally it does not refresh you. Esp if your employer does not respect your own time during your off day at home.  Please EMPATHiZE every one has their own struggle. These FDW are not burdens but a big help in a FAMILY.  We are all sociable human beings, aren't we all under stress right now that we cannot even meet and hug our friends who stay just nearby?

3313,"There are two parts to this. One is an essential need, and one is not. Essential: the need for foreign workers to send money back to their families. Many locals seem naively unaware that domestic helpers (and other foreign workers) need to get money home to their families frequently. Heck, that's the reason why they come to work here! To get money to send home! This essential need must be allowed, or else their families risk starving back home. And this is not a stretched truth. And that is why you see long snaking queues at said venues. In a nutshell, REMITTENCE. it is the lifeblood of your domestic helper. Govt can work with embassies and remittance businesses to bring the remittance to the worker instead, to prevent hot spots at the usual haunts of ofws. Also, employers and OFWs can explore online remit options where possible. Rates may not be as good, but if for the time being, perhaps the employer can work out something with the helper.  Non essential: some domestic helpers take the chance to fake it and go to said venues to meet their friends. This is a big no. socialising in groups at said venues. This should definitely not be allowed. Same rules apply whether you are a foreign worker domestic helper or a local or expat. The virus is no differentiator of man. We must all follow the phases so that we can make a full recovery to reopen the economy. NO socialising after remittance. Go home.  When the home is also your workplace, it can get unbearable for your helper. For you working at home, to get away from work, you switch off your PC and work mail. How does your helper ""switch off"" when all her bosses are at home? Therefore she needs time to mentally and physically destress and recalibrate. If you don't want to give her rest then please GET A ROBOT instead. And even robots need time to recharge! So, allow your helpers to do some exercise or other activities while following within the rules at all times.  A good employer knows that a good helper is an asset to his/her family. If you take care of the helper, the helper will want to take care of your household.",13/6/20,1,1.0

3579,"The very fact they consist a small proportion against the entire population and yet yesterday have almost double the infected compared to singaporean locals means one thing. They have not observed and kept the hygiene standards and also not been observing any distancing measures.   The dormitory all allocated to them were almost new and good condition when they moved in. The fact there are cockroaches derive from littering and bad personal maintainence of their personal spaces.  In the Singapore army in BMT we have 10 men to a single bunk room and an entire company of 160 men using a single block. Yet with proper area cleaning we kept it spotless. Toilets are sparkling. On top of that as full time soldiers we had to fufil every single training obligation issued to us.  Instead of complaining about cockroaches and bad hygienic conditions....why not start area cleaning. They are getting a full months pay to do nothing. Spend the time wisely! Hundreds of Singaporeans too live in blocks and dine in local hawker centers with hundreds of people at any time.  My fear is if their girlfriends who may be FDWs go back home with their infection. The entire family she lives with will suffer. This will cause a massive infestation. I pray this day never comes.   I believe the govt policy to quarantine 20,000 is very sound. This is a preventative measure against a mass outbreak amongst millions of local Singaporeans who have stood by Singapore thick and thin and served the nation when she needed us. It’s understandable that many foreigners are here to enjoy the wealth, prosperity and jobs that we are blessed with. However consider the flip side of the coin....assuming there is a war....outbreak....or any disaster....will the very ones who flocked here for jobs stay with us and fight with us or will they be the first ones to board planes and ships out. It’s the sons of this land who will lose the most as we have families and friends here. As a son if this land without question I will fight for her as my love ones are here.

The possibility that it can get critical and no loved ones can be with you? When all it takes is to stay home, only buy whats needed, keep a distance and come home immediately. Do the authorities have to detail everything out or even make it more strict to keep people at home? Just because last week they didnt wear a mask and nothing happened doesnt mean it cant this week.

A big thank you to all our medical, healthcare & other frontline staff (the police, contact tracing team & researchers etc.) who have helped Singapore in our fight against COVID-19.  The plans to manage the huge dormitory clusters are quite comprehensive but there is something more that can be done to halt the transmission of COVID-19 amongst the dormitory residents. Run more COVID-19 detection tests on all close contacts of current dormitory confirmed cases now, within capacity that our lab team can currently cope & run them now. Because simply confining the dormitory workers in their crammed dormitory will not prevent further COVID-19 transmission amongst the dormitory workers especially if they continue to stay together in the high density crammed conditions, now that we can almost be certain of  asymptomatic carriers who unintentionally infect others as they do not realized they are sick.  The bigger clusters is a result of dormitories having higher density   crammed. Enclosed space and closed proximity has remain the constant theme for transmission. It would be ideal if density at these dormitories are reduced significantly. But even doing so is not enough against insidious spread of COVID-19.  More can be done now to ""actively attack"" the virus transmissions at these dormitories, the top priority now is to identify & isolate any more potential infected carriers especially asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who may not realized they are carrier. Most men(which the bulk of these dormitories workers are, would probably have been more busy with their work at workplaces previously)& will tend to be less fastidious about COVID-19 prevention measures like safe distancing with others in dormitories & enhanced hygiene measures, so health officials may need to come out with programs to educate & emphasize to them the importance of personal hygiene(not touching face without thorough washing of hands with soap & water & after visiting toilets & before meals etc.)in their native languages for any who have difficulty comprehending English. Facilities owners will need to increase frequencies of toilet/bathing area cleaning at these dormitories as well.  With current developments of Singapore's own rapid test kits which we have been sharing with our neighboring countries, this is the time to ramp-up production of these accurate testing kits as there may now be a need to conduct more tests on any potentially infeyuuúcted dormitory  workers for early detection & isolation to prevent an even higher transmission numbers.  Contact Tracing/ Investigation Teams will need to work quickly to establish & identify any previous close contacts of current confirmed cases from the dormitories. We need to quickly mount a larger scale COVID-19 testing on these close contacts of the dormitories' confirmed cases. As many people may appear healthy now but they maybe rapidly infecting others. We need to be able to quickly identify & isolate any such persons from the crowded dormitories.  Please work out plans to test more of our dormitory  workers who had previous close contacts to current confirmed cases now.",6/4/20,0,1.0

Data has shown that the death rates both for overall diseases as well as for the elderly in 2020 are NO DIFFERENT to those recorded for between 2016-2019.   The Biden administration is now coming clean and admitting that the Covid death rates in America for 2020 had been grossly exaggerated (most probably to make Trump look bad); and that the PCR testing should not be used as a diagnostic tool for positive cases.    The AMA also recently advised that Doctors should go ahead to treat patients in their early stage with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine — this, after rigging the results last April that there was no evidence for the effectiveness with the 60+ years old drug, followed by a ban of their sales in the US.    In other words, the whole world had been lied to by those intent on bringing down the world economy, and to oust Trump out of office.

4504,"GOVERNMENT & PARLIAMENT the difference  GOVERNMENT  - run the country  PARLIAMENT  - represent the people - hold the government to account.   We want both a good government and a good Parliament.   For 55 yrs, our Parliament do not have enough parties truly representing the people. Instead majority inside are of the same ruling party, representing not the people, but the PAP.   This means we, the SG voters, have sold ourselves to be slaves (because we sold our Voice) and not master of our collective destiny.   You may argue we have a good government but we don't have a good Parliament. Giving PAP supermajority in parliament is like selling away our birthrights as stakeholders of our SG. Result is you get a SG by PAP, for PAP and not a SG by the People, for the People.   You can have BOTH a good government and a good Parliament.   VOTE IN A STRONG PARLIAMENT",30/5/20,0,1.0

Now the landlord after the retail shops for rental. So no people coming to work. So how can the retailers in the city survive?

4862,"Good to see that the situation is under control, and Singapore is starting to reopen the economy.  But the pandemic is not yet over, much effort is still required in passing on the correct information to the public, the community and the foreign workers.  To ensure restaurants can reopen safely, it is a good idea to indicate at the entrance the maximum number of patrons allowed, so that there is no argument.  In Australia, the rule is 1 person per 4sqm.  The restaurant has to further limit the number if there are additional health or safety concerns.  It is encouraging to see the government assisting small businesses to adopt digital payment.  However, to minimise costs for unnecessary subsequent upgrade of equipment, service providers should consider wireless and edge technologies, solar and battery backup power, cybersecurity, etc.  The more the service providers can do to lower adoption and operation costs, the more small businesses will take up the practice, and the more savings flow to the individual consumers.",14/6/20,1,1.0

Your trace tracker can add a step counter to sync with the Health 365, save on your budget and it has a reward effect for those who wear it to win vouchers for hitting 10k steps..  All the sites using the same method or different? What's the cost to recover ratio? What the elements that have the highest recovery? How to lower the cost while maintaining efficiency?  This is not a sprint, more like a marathon. Devil on the detail. Prevention vs detection. Dive in the policies and guideline in social distancing, contact tracing.

However, I hope many of the essential services that are allowed to continue operations should be also revised and reviewed and we should further cut back on movements.   For a start , there are so many essential services concentrated in Changi Airport and as a result a lot of staff movement which includes a significant number of work permit holders. So this is one area where we can scale down as airline frequency is quite Low. Can we consider having Changi airport to close for one month so that we also carry out necessary renovations and upgrade. This is the best time to speed up any infrastructure upgrades when there is no pax movement .   Any flights in the meantime can be operated from Seletar airport if possible.  So we can still have freighter cargo flights operating.   We need to consider cutting down on essential services movement as much as possible. Let’s all hope our efforts bear positive results soon.

I think to make the call whether to extend the CB on the end of 3rd week will give us better visibility on our measures.

5511,"Thank you PM Lee for the decisive measures.  I am suggesting to use technology to do contact tracing for essential activities.  Currently, we have to use a pen and paper to write down our particulars, this added an opportunity for the virus to pass to one another, as viruses are known to stay on surfaces for extended periods (up to 3 days on paper and plastics).  For the same reason, I try only to touch the things I need to buy, avoiding any unnecessary exposure to myself.  My solution is to have a simple functionality added to TraceTogether, using the camera function to scan a QR code at the premise when we enter.  Do what we need to do and quickly leave.  This was used at the recent airshow at Changi, the only difference, we pre-fill our particulars, just scan & go! Those without smartphones may still use old tech - pen and paper.

Of course, urgent criminal cases must and should be adhere to original court schedule.   Below is my definition of non essential medical appointment and non essential civil suits   Non essential medical appointment refer to medical condition that is not life threatening or non respiratory related symptom.   Non essential civil suits refer to suits that was file with the court on or after November 2019 as these cases are still in the early stage of proceeding and can afford to wait until the Covid 19 is more stabilise.

Just I have to say,,, just government provide for us domotery it's enough ,I don't think so  1. 1room staying many people.. Very congested and room temperature very hot, just proved fan😢. We don't enough sleep at night, enough sleep is very important for the worker worke hard .many cases In Singapore incident because the worker some time lost his body control. That why very important to take enough rest.. Just I have to say at the working time we are worker but end of the day we also be a human,, we also tired and need to take rest... So I request all of you all the domotery provid air-condition  at list we can take enough rest at night in our room...   2. I already say many people are staying same room..

5847,"Dear Mr Lee, in order to beat this virus by end of eCB, just think we need the task force to move much further ahead of the curve. Just as I tweeted not to waste the original CB period and implement compulsory wearing when leaving the house, I am glad with or without my tweet it is implemented. Just my thoughts on few areas we may want to think about to get ahead. First, current contact trace methodology is not effective when it comes to asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic. Even though I am not comfortable with the contact tracing app due to privacy concerns, please make it compulsory. We need to relink the unlinked cases through location/time overlap analysis with patient 0, coupled with testing to find patient -1. We need to use technology to shorten the analysis. Second, if the possibility exists that the pandemic will last far beyond eCB, we need to have a more effective mask strategy. Cotton masks while reducing the level of contaminants do not have the same trapping properties of a simple 3 ply surgical mask. A Canadian study have shown such a mask is sufficient besides offering some more protection to the wearer. Third. We need to use our science teams to figure out how to make aerosols settle quickly or maybe trapping it especially in aircon places. Maybe it is in the form of a diffuser/purifier. It will be a reusable solution not just in Singapore and for future epidemics. Fourth, we cannot just sit and wait for Jun 1st and than figure out, can we re-open, how do we re-open, etc. We plan on a worst case basis that the virus will take a long time to address, so we need to be smart about how do we still open. Do we use mass testing for e.g. figure out who is already immune and be deployable ? do we open office building by building, or sector. How do we use enhanced contact tracing to quickly contain the cases, can we get testing down to 1 min and implement quick test at buildings, etc. The rainy budget is not bottomless and more SMEs fold, it will be worst than the property bust we have seen before. regards",21/4/20,0,1.0

5851,"Sir:  I propose for the Ministry of Healthy and relevant agencies to impose a shutdown of food delivery platforms such as Grab, FoodPanda, Deliveroo etc, to prevent new clusters of Covid-19 transmission and the spread of the virus.  It has been evident in the past two weeks of 'Circuit Breaker' that delivery riders have faced tremendous pressure in their job of delivering F&B to customers at home. Shortly after the announcement of tightening and restriction of what is deemed to be “essential”, a number of videos have circulated on the internet which displayed the rowdy behaviour of delivery riders and F&B workers. Some of the commotion between the riders and stores resulted in close contact of these persons in their individual bids to put their point across.  Such behaviour is fairly understandable- likely due to the pressures of increased orders and lacklustre management of orders. These delivery riders on the ground are helpless except to do their utmost to fulfil their daily orders. The delivery platforms have also been purported to be almost impossible for delivery riders to cancel orders in view of unforeseen situations such as long waiting times or out-of-stock items. These circumstances inadvertently culminated into displays of frustrations, jostling, and hurling of insults or abuses. It has also been evident many F&B locations are ironically, the ground of close gathering of delivery riders who have almost no option to practice safe-distancing at these crowded venues. The mood of Singaporeans from all walks of life is expected to run high through the Circuit Breaker period, and occurrences of these unfortunate disputes are likely to increase.  One cannot be certain that all delivery riders or F&B outlets are Covid-free. It would take just one infected individual in the nucleus to spread devastating consequences deep into the homes of families waiting for their orders.  The measures at wet markets and supermarkets are quite effective in allowing families to purchase groceries. Food establishments also remain open and people should have little difficulty to get food and drinks for consumption.

5856,Hi PM. Now that SG has zoomed into problem; stay focused on it as all locals are in the same boat with.you at the helm. After cloud clears; go after the irresponsible dorm operators to deny these dirty rich scrooges further chance to bully FWs and putting all SIngaporeans in harm's way so they can rake in tonnes of money monthly. Spare them n the world will presume Govt n operators are in cohorts. SG need to repair our tarnished reputation.,21/4/20,0,0.0

5934,"One of the best perspectives of the current situation that I read so far :-  From Dr Sharmil de Silva:  I think the thing most people don’t understand is that the lock down is in place to slow the progression of the disease, NOT to eradicate it by end of May.  I think people are missing the point because they naively think the govt will somehow get rid of it so life goes back to normal. These are people who have ignored the global reality since January. This is the dangerous delusional thinking that some people are applying in their assessment of the situation when advocating we should stop the lockdown because they are literally only waking up to this thing now, or when we were initially shut down. So let’s lift the curtain a bit.  1. Flattening the curve means slowing down the disease so that hospitals can cope with the sick. It does not mean eradicating the disease all together.  2. No government will be able to eradicate the disease this year. It’s here until a cure or a vaccine is found   3. A vaccine is at least a year away. That’s April 2021. The earliest vaccine trials just started late last month. It takes 18 to 24 months to make, test and assess the efficacy of a vaccine. So 1 year is literally a Hail Mary.   4. There is NO going back to normal. Your normal will not exist for at least a year. Economies globally will keep bleeding and we are likely to have rolling lockdowns until a vaccine is found.  5. Even when the ban is lifted, tourism and hospitality industry, and many others will not see an increase in business for at least a year. Until a vaccine is found people will continue to self isolate even when a lock down is lifted.   6. The only reprieve we are going to get is if we have thousands of people who have been infected and recovered and minimum deaths so that we have some level of herd immunity. That is also still a theory that is yet to be proven because some countries think they may be seeing people get reinfected. Even with that in place normal is not feasible because fear still reigns and people will remain isolated until safety is guaranteed- cure or vaccine. Refer to point 3.  7. The above is still 6 months away. We are projected to reach our peak in September. That means, bleeding economy, rolling lockdowns, death and chaos until then.  8. The decisions made in the lockdown like no alcohol and no dog walking or running and no e-commerce are not made with the privileged in mind. They are made with the masses in mind. What you allow in the suburbs you must allow in the townships and those two things look very different in execution.   Now our government is doing the best it can and they have reacted faster than most developed countries. Our progress is still better than most and right now we’re riding the dumb hope that somehow BCG gives us some fighting chance (still unproven).   So please please we all need to do whatever we can to help our neighbors, help each other, support our government and stop having delusional ideas about any level of normalcy at the end of this month. Adjust your projections and hunker down.   This is not a joke and it’s not even anywhere near any semblance of real yet.   Normal is dead. Let that sink in. But HOPE  is very much alive!",21/4/20,1,1.0

Next, It is a very crucial preventive  measure because 80% of us live in HDB. If neighbours are careless, just imagine!

To filter out the affected in dormitory asap.  I agree with Forum letter today that when we do execise, mask must be on, without exercise for 1 or 2 months will not risk our lives. when i went  NTUC today,  i see every where people flouting the rule under the cover of exercise by putting on the the sportsshoe or ride on a bicysle to jalan jalan without mask on. This has created unhappiness in the ground, many has sacrified to stay home and only go out when necessary and most have obeyed when out must with mask on all times.we must not allow these trouble makersto put our effort in vain  People are unappreciative of the flexibility granted But exploit them for own convenience or try to be hero [ BUT remeber when hero created, someone must die or many will dies].

Due to our structural limitations, and that migrant workers are essentially younger, fitter and healthier, perhaps we may explore a form of “herd immunity” strategy to mitigate this crisis provided that infected symptoms are mild or asymptomatic, not in danger and that welfare prioritized.  Recovered patients can voluntarily donate plasma to help speedy recoveries of their friends.  Recovered patients can become and add to our increasing “immunized” core migrant workforce numbers to further help our economy and start more virtuous cycles.  Our best and brightest scientists can study this and plan this into a workable strategy and maybe the world may also start their own workable “herd immunity” strategy which is safer for the population.",17/4/20,0,1.0

Although it may affect human rights or privacy , a tracing app should be made mandatory for all. The app is installed automatically on all mobile phones by the telco . Visitors are not to be exempted . We need to work out the security and this app disabled on departure for visitors. ( Perhaps we can work out an agreement among the ASEAN members) 2. It may be difficult to put back all the FW into the dorm again and alternatives cannot be produced overnight .  Suggest that the temporary accommodations be used as long as practicable such as yet to be demolished HDBs , empty schools , empty barracks etc. Floatels and cruise ships are just too expensive .  3. In the long run , we have to consider seriously the question of FW accommodations . It is impossible to have hygienic communal toilets and kitchens . Remember all those SIT flats that were torn down.

They must have adequate protein in their meals. And make sure they all have 15 minutes sun exposure on large areas of their bodies between 10am to 4pm. Dark-skinned folks will need to spend more time under the sun (2-4X). These measures will give them internal qi to fight the infection or prevent frontline from getting struck down by the virus.

7408,"Dear Mr Lee, I have some suggestions on how to combat the pandemic outbreak. There is much we can learn from how South Korea successfully arrested the outbreak after a terrifying start.   Firstly, we need to significantly ramp up testing so as to identify the infected, especially the asymptomatic ones. I watched a video in which a South Korean medical expert explained that the main reason why they could contain what seemed like widespread community transmission was by extensively testing the population so that the infected could be quarantined. Even though South Korea's situation is now under control, they still have public booths available for any member of the public to be tested.   Contrast that to Singapore's situation. My friend who was sick visited a clinic and requested for a coronavirus test but was rejected. He was deemed not to exhibit sufficient symptoms to be tested. But hasn't the coronavirus been proven to be asymptomatic? In light of that, we should not be turning people away for tests. We have to be more proactive in order to quickly identify the infected before the spread worsens.   I understand there is a political price with extensive testing, as the numbers could significantly increase. Indeed the South Korean president was initially embarrassed by the speed of the outbreak, but his willingness to swallow the bitter pill has won him the respect of his people as he managed to arrest the outbreak. His party won a resounding electoral victory. We too must swallow the bitter pill in order to stop the outbreak.   Secondly, may I suggest that we get the best PITs from the SAF to design some home-based fitness routines for all ages. In the absence of a vaccine, the best medicine to fight the virus is exercise. Exercising is crucial in building up our immune system, which is an important way for us to fight off the coronavirus. It is also a good way to relax our mind and cost nothing. We can air exercise routines live on tv, and encourage everyone to participate at home. This is a good way for the nation to bond in this time of crisis. ",17/4/20,1,1.0

Do understand cases will reach a peak somewhere before moving downwards . As far as possible to minimize infected cases as it crossed over the 3k mark .

7667,"Firstly, still feeling very grateful for the government efforts in dealing with this Pandemic. While the exponential increase in the cases is a cause of concern, it's also a real opportunity for us Singaporeans, 4G leaders and young Singaporeans who may not have gone through ww2 to go through the baptism of fire.   Comments from other countries media have pointed that the 2nd wave of transmission has knocked us off our feet. It has. The question is how we bounce back. Bouncing back with ingunity and guts lets us learn a better lesson than if we had got by with solutions such as hotel stays at rasa Sentosa. We want to be remembered for bouncing back, beating the curve, being able to continue our lives after the CB. That shall be our gold standard.   It is clear that the leaders are moving away from the strong statesmen approach of the yesterday towards a consultative, multi agency, evidence based approach. We all have to rise to the challenge. The 3 prong approach does not sound aggressive enough. In time to come, more solutions will be need to be deployed to solve the issue of migrant workers density.   At the citizens front, we need to be aware that this is like a war. And during war time, we don't eat ding Tai feng.",17/4/20,0,1.0

Yes, old habits die hard, but to them, No Job for them,  they die harder. I don't think we are here to point finger on who's at fault, we are just saying, if one have make a mistake,  admit it and change. No one is perfect. Where as on why they use their hand to eat, most of them are Muslims, this is how they eat, but they only use their right hand after washing. Why they eat on the floor, grassland, do they have a choice? Can you get a table to dine in the middle of nowhere if they are working in the construction site?

I suspect some FWs (WP, EP included) and foreign students with Covid-19 are staying low & not going for test especially with work-from-home, study-from-home wef Tuesday.   We should make their employers/sponsors personally responsible for their accommodation if they want to keep them in Singapore.   Some are still illegally lodging in HDB and private apartments turned into dormitories.   May I suggest URA, HDB and MOM work together to stamp these out. They must be given more authority to enter these premises when neighbours report them.  And increase the penalties on such owners.  I used to live in an apartment block and a few of us owners reported on an unit that was converted to a dormitory with temporary partitions. For years, the authorities were unable to enter the unit and the tenants knew what to say when authorities came knocking. This should not be so difficult if MOM records show more than 8 tenants including FWs/students registered under the same address.

Yes, maybe some NSmen or NSboy wouldn't want to be in the front line, but I believe most would as it's of national crisis. It's inevitable for our numbers to increase with so many Singaporean still having the habit of queuing up and clustering. Old behavior can't be changed overnight as we all know too.

This applies even if they queue with their helpers. Please don't allow them to use trolleys as they stack up too much n leave trolleys lying around everywhere. This cause others who only buy few items to wait for a v long time, half an hour or more to get to pay. 3. Enforce stricter measures for people who break the rules like heavier fines or go to jail.

This clearly reflect the irresponsible, arrogant and selfish attitudes of some of our citizens. This is indeed a shame to say the least. Perhaps it’s time for more harder measures and stronger words as well as harsher punishment to be implemented. After all these are very difficult times that Singapore is experiencing and being confronted by an unseen ‘enemy’ that is growing threateningly uncontrollable by the day! For a start all Malls should be shut to discourage crowds, wearing of masks should be made mandatory when taking public transport, gathering of 10 should be scaled down to not more than 3 and social distancing guidelines must be strictly adhered to or else appropriate punishment be meted out promptly.

8145,"What about those in the dormitory, Sir ? As far as we know, some dormitories have their own minimart, food court, eateries etc.  Are we missing too many loopholes ?  We also see that a lot of foreign workers have no knowledge of what is going on now, what is covid19, how it is affecting people if they do not practice social distancing and good hygiene. They are seen to be sitting on crossed seats and still gather in groups and speak to each other in close proximity. Many of them do nt understand or read English, so they can’t understand such notice too even when they enter the mall.   Also pls refrain from allowing our seniors from working in the dormitories and places that’s high risk pls ...   Can make it a mandatory to close the F&B outlets in the dormitory clusters, so that those elderly who worked there are forced to stay home ?  My mom 64 a singapore citizen is working in sungei tengah dormitory as a hawker, and her employer is simply not bothered because it’s her boss’s best chance to earn more $$$ with foreign workers all being lockdown. Her boss is not stationed there himself to work at all. So he won’t face any risk of infection. We have been persuading her to quit but she see no risk. Instead she feel it’s hard for her to get a job at her age so she wants to continue despite the high risk. Today she is still going to work, even on weekends. Waking up at 4am to reach dormitory before 6am, and slog until 3pm. We are all very worried about her, even my aunts have been persuading her to quit but old ppl is really stubborn .  Only laws and government can stop her now...  Pls pls pls... May I beg the government pls consider this appeal, can the government do something abt it, maybe  provide catering packed food delivery for them instead to minimize human interaction ??",5/4/20,0,1.0

8167,"Dormitories tend to be more crammed which explains the bigger clusters. Enclosed space & closed proximity has remain the constant theme for transmission. It would be ideal if density at these dormitories are reduced significantly.  However, more can be done now to ""actively attack"" the virus transmission at these dormitories, the top priority now is to identify & isolate any more potential infected carriers especially asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who may not realized they are carrier. Most men(which the bulk of these dormitories workers are, would probably have been more busy with their work at workplaces previously)& will tend to be less fastidious about COVID-19 prevention measures like safe distancing with others in dormitories & enhanced hygiene measures, so health officials may need to come out with programs to educate & emphasize to them the importance of personal hygiene(not touching face without thorough washing of hands with soap & water & after visiting toilets & before meals etc.)in their native languages for any who have difficulty comprehending English. Facilities owners will need to increase frequencies of toilet/bathing area cleaning at these dormitories as well.  With current development of Singapore's own rapid test kits which we have shared with neighboring countries, it should be time to ramp-up production of more of these accurate test kits as there may now be a need to conduct more tests on any potentially infected dormitories residents for early detection & isolation to prevent even higher transmission numbers.  Contact Tracing/Investigation Teams will need to quickly establish & identify any potential close contacts of current confirmed cases of dormitories residents & authorities would need to quickly mount a larger scale COVID-19 testing on these close contacts of the confirmed cases who may appear healthy now at these dormitories so as to identify & isolate any asymptomatic/mild symptoms carriers who will not realize they are sick yet & halt any further transmissions in such higher density dormitories setting & reduce the burden on Singapore Healthcare workers & facilities.",6/4/20,1,1.0

8874,"Smart people will find the quickest, cheapest and simplest  way to permanently solve a complicated problem without any repercussions . Clueless people will recommend the most complicated, futile, mindboggling, ineffective, often toxic measures that will have more crippling effects on the economy, livelihood, environment, air quality, physical and mental state of mind plus huge financial losses for the government, companies and the individuals!The only weapon that will win COVID 19 is the unharmed immune system. It is the best doctor and best defence against infections. Read Food Heals But The Wrong Food Kills written by Jessica Seah from Singapore. She reversed all her health problems without any medication or exercise! I used her nontoxic method to help a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication. It is cheap, simple and very effective! The correct method will heal without any repercussions. The wrong treatment will kill! Science fails miserably in tackling COVID 19 crippling the world economy and triggers Domino's effects like bankruptcies, more vulnerability to COVID 19 due to ineffective preventive measures and treatment methods! How can the toxic man-made chemicals with cancer causing ingredients like formaldehyde, sodium laurel sulphate parabens, Triclosan, etc. """"protect"" anyone when the the  immune system, our first line of defence is harmed? I urge the leaders all over the world to contact Jessica Seah from Singapore at aceofaceent@yahoo.com so this unpredecented global pandemic can end swiftly without using expensive ventilators, disininfectants, hand sanitizers, alcohol, soap, lockdowns and social distancing! True healing means eliminating toxins, never about building muscles or adding man-made chemicals to the already poisoned body.

I don't see Pritam's question as ""divisive"", that is something that people projected onto it. There is nothing wrong with PRs landing good jobs in SG, especially if they bring along skills that our economy requires, but that is not what the debate was about.

i have chatted to migrant workers, and most of them are full of praises for singapore simply because they think singapore is lawful and fair. this makes our collective treatment of our migrant brothers and sisters even more appalling because it is clear that we can do so much better for them.

You do realize that the issue we're debating on is about their vulnerability towards pandemics, which wouldn't be a thing if their living quarters aren't pitiful. Why do you think most of us are still surviving the virus? Because we're capable of making ourselves less vulnerable. Imagine trying to be semi-immune in a flat filled with cockroaches with floors caked in urine.


Are you trying to tell me that the government is capable of wielding their power for good? Actually, yes. On the other hand, given how quickly they changed their tune after a bunch of people angrily pushed back, they can definitely use it for the greater good. In terms of land, if they can greenlight estates of unnecessary condos in tiny spaces, they could have also used the same land to build dorms for foreign workers. I live near a large patch of deserted land that could have been used to build a long stretch of dorms. It's convenient for the workers too. Been here for a decade and nothing's been done to it.

I digress.


In regards to the situation at hand, you must have missed the deplorable comments about how the workers are at fault for ""not knowing how to eat off the ground"" and ""having poor hygiene standards in the first place"". No one was born with the knowledge of good hygiene, but we were all *educated* on the practice. Thus, they could have been educated as well. But no, they're just animals to some apparently. One comment I read even suggested that help shouldn't be rendered to them because they'll ""revert to their terrible hygiene standards"". And that's just one idiot who dared to vocalize such thoughts. What makes you think no one else thinks the same way?


As I mentioned in a previous post, humans seem to derive sick pleasure from treating their perceived inferiors as non-humans. Not just migrant workers but domestic helpers too.

You're a taxpayer and if you're demanding for a change while paying your taxes, why won't the government listen since they essentially depend on you to grow the economy and their pockets?

> SINGAPORE: While there have been some comments that the authorities have reduced the volume of COVID-19 testing for migrant workers, this is not true, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Monday (Apr 27).

> “Our testing capacity for migrant workers is about 3,000 a day. We have not reduced it. Instead, we have been increasing the capacity of testing of our migrant workers. The rate of testing has not slowed,” Mr Gan said at a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference.

> Infectious diseases expert Associate Professor Dale Fisher had said in an interview with CNA over the weekend that at dormitories the rate of COVID-19 positivity is so high that there is no need to test anymore.

> Mr Gan added that a total of 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested since the start of the outbreak.

> “This means that one in 15 migrant workers in dormitories have been tested. This is far higher than the testing rates seen in other countries like Korea, which is one in 19, as well as other countries like the United States, United Kingdom, or even Hong Kong,” he said.

> The authorities started testing at dormitories where there were a high number of cases detected, and now it is actively testing at other dormitories as cases emerge, including at factory-converted dormitories, he said.

> “We are also actively testing around confirmed cases in these dormitories, where new cases are starting to emerge in an effort to isolate cases, and contain further transmission,” he said.

> He added that for dormitories where the assessed rate of infection is “extremely high”, efforts are focused on isolating those who are symptomatic, even without a confirmed COVID-19 tests.

> “This allows us to quickly provide medical care to these patients,” he said.

> Testing serves important objectives such as diagnosing patients, to provide them with appropriate treatment and care and carrying out contact tracing so to limit and control the spread, he said.

> There were 977 new cases of the coronavirus in Singapore as of noon on Monday, according to the preliminary figures from the Health Ministry. Most of them were work permit holders staying in dormitories. Fourteen were Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> 

> To date, there have been 14,423 cases of COVID-19 in the country.

> Singapore is nearly three weeks into its ""circuit breaker"" period to try and break the COVID-19 cycle of transmission. Initially scheduled to end on May 4, the circuit breaker will now only end on Jun 1. During this time, all non-essential businesses have to remain closed and residents are required to stay home except for buying food and exercising alone.

At the end of the day the accuracy of the number of confirmed cases for such a contagious disease will be extremely inaccurate, and the only real purpose that testing serves is to identify clusters and contain the virus.

9506,"Shekor arrived in Singapore a decade ago at age 17, one of many low-income migrant workers who have powered the city’s growth, building hospitals, subway lines and the Marina Bay Sands resort.

In his years working in aluminum production and on construction sites, the Bangladeshi national has suffered various work-related injuries. The most recent, on March 18, left him with searing pain in his left hip.

That was also the date that coronavirus infections in the city-state — whose early response epidemiologists had lauded as the gold standard — began soaring, from 313 then to more than 9,000 as of Tuesday, after two days of record jumps.


Almost 70 percent of Singapore's coronavirus cases are concentrated in migrant dormitories.

Singapore's migrant workers face a heightened risk of infection because of overcrowded living quarters, poor nutrition, limited access to health care and personal protective equipment, low wages and, in some cases, discrimination.
Thousands of new cases — and almost 70 percent of Singapore’s total — are concentrated in dormitories that house migrant workers, who have been locked down in their quarters as authorities seek a solution. For Shekor, who gave only his first name for fear of retribution from his employer, it means no access to painkillers he needs just to sleep.

“Everything is so difficult for everybody here,” he said in a phone interview from his dormitory of 25,000, where hundreds have been infected. “It seems like they only take the most serious ones to hospital; the normal ones like me, no one takes care of us.”


The situation highlights the vulnerability of migrant workers, who in Singapore make up one-third of the labor force. Their risks of infection are exacerbated by overcrowded living quarters, poor nutrition, limited access to health care and personal protective equipment, low wages and, in some cases, discrimination.

 A construction site in Singapore lies empty on April 11 during a halt to nonessential work to stem the spike in coronavirus cases.
In the Persian Gulf, laborers’ quarters also have become infection hotspots. As in Singapore, many migrant laborers are from South Asia. Elsewhere, African migrants in China are facing discrimination and xenophobia, refused entry into restaurants or evicted from their homes. Singapore’s largest Chinese-language broadsheet, Lianhe Zaobao, recently published a letter from a reader who blamed the migrants for the outbreaks, labeling their countries “backward” and their practices dirty.

In Singapore, critics say these events have revealed a hubris among the authorities and the wider community, who took for granted their initial success in keeping infection numbers low while failing to prepare for the possibility of an outbreak among the most downtrodden.

Workers hang out in a dormitory compound. About a dozen compounds have been put on quarantine, which means workers are confined to their rooms.
“For the first two months, we engaged in a lot of self-congratulation,” said Alex Au, vice president of rights group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2). “If anyone had cared to look, the dangers were already there.”

Authorities had planned for the epidemic with a focus only on citizens, he said, distributing surgical masks, hand sanitizer and reusable masks only to Singaporean households. Singaporean residents returning from the United States and Britain, meanwhile, were put up in four- and five-star hotels paid for by the government.

“This reflects the deliberate invisibilization of the foreign worker; the whole machinery of state operates as though they don’t exist,” Au said.

 A volunteer at the Migrant Workers Center helps organize bottles of hand sanitizer that will be distributed to the workers.
HealthServe, a nonprofit providing subsidized health care to migrant workers, said migrants had been anxious as early as February about the virus and their level of risk in overcrowded living conditions. But a change in regulations meant volunteer doctors and nurses staffing the organization’s nonprofit clinics could no longer serve part-time, forcing it to cut services by 90 percent.

“This was a situation we felt was going to come, even if we were hoping for the best,” said Suwen Low, spokeswoman for HealthServe.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Manpower responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post with a news release, issued April 14, saying that authorities are working to “reduce the number of workers in the dormitories and also implement a medical support plan at all dormitories.”


Workers in essential services have been moved out of dormitories, the ministry said, while officials were identifying alternative accommodations for others, such as army camps, sports halls, vacant housing blocks and shipping containers.

“Our immediate priority for the workers in the dormitories is to help them stay healthy and minimize the number that get infected,” said Josephine Teo, Singapore’s manpower minister, in a news conference last week.

In an address to the nation on Tuesday, Singapore prime minister Lee Hsien Loong began by noting that the number of new cases in the local community has leveled off before acknowledging the problematic sharp rise in total cases overwhelmingly among migrants.

“We will care for you just like we care for Singaporeans,” he said. “We will look after your health, your welfare and your livelihood.”


HealthServe volunteers prepare to attend to patients at a clinic. The organization provides low-cost medical services to migrant workers.

Authorities are also working with organizations such as the Migrant Workers Center, which has a program of “ambassadors” who are helping their colleagues and friends understand hygiene practices, social distancing and practicalities like how to send remittances online. Yeo Guat Kwang, the group’s chairman, said the focus should be on improving conditions in the future.

“In hindsight, everyone would be wiser,” Yeo said. “But this is really an unprecedented global pandemic.”

A second wave of coronavirus infections began taking root in Singapore in mid-March, similar to other places in Asia, like Hong Kong and Taiwan, as residents abroad flocked back to the region when outbreaks intensified in Europe and the United States. But while Hong Kong managed this spike, getting new cases down to single-digits for more than eight days straight, and Taiwan recorded several days this month with no new cases, Singapore now has among the highest number of cases per capita globally.

The migrant workers bearing the brunt of the outbreak are overwhelmingly male and employed in construction and other labor-intensive sectors that Singaporeans avoid. The typical construction worker in Singapore earns about $430 a month, while the median monthly income for Singaporeans is $3,227.

 This field is usually crowded with migrant workers enjoying a day off.
“To keep them cheap, we have to exploit,” said Au from TWC2. “We pack them into [trucks], we pack them into dormitories, and now, when a crisis hits, they have no buffer.”

Clusters have been identified in many dormitories. More than a dozen dormitories have been placed under quarantine, meaning workers cannot leave their rooms, while nearly all dormitory residents are now barred from leaving the facilities, which are guarded by police.

The more than 200,000 dormitory residents are now anxious, bored, isolated and scared. Unable to buy their own groceries, cook for themselves or purchase phone cards to call home, they are almost completely dependent on charity and handouts.

A worker in one of the worst-hit dormitories, who only wanted to be identified by his first name, Ali, was treated for a sore throat and fever before the lockdown, and placed on sick leave until April 9. He was given an “advisory for patients with respiratory tract infection” — a status that means he has to isolate himself from others or be fined $7,000.

That was impossible in his 12-person room, he said. Ali’s cough persisted, but under lockdown, he was unable to seek medical attention for several days.

“Who will give me any treatment or help?” he said in an interview. “I am so scared I will die before any help comes.”


Authorities say that infected dormitory residents have been linked through common work sites, and through places like shopping malls, where many gather on their days off. In the dormitories, before the lockdown, men were able to socialize with each other and cook together, a distraction from their physically demanding jobs and the difficulty of being away from their families.

In an interview Thursday, Ali said he was finally able to see a doctor, who gave him cough syrup and tested him for the coronavirus. He has not heard back. His 11 roommates are trying to keep their distance from each other, but find it near impossible. On a trip to the bathroom on Thursday evening, he found that there was no hand soap.

Furthermore, its damn arbitrary as to how we define ""community"". Govt could have stratified it any other way, they could have excluded prisons, they could have excluded old folk's home, they could have even excluded people living in Yishun.

The government is the biggest developer in singapore due to infrastructural contracts. They also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure. Some news reports here: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116)

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins.

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

They get injured in the workplace, they get shipped back to their home countries after patching them up. You think a fine + bills is a ""wake up call"".

The calculations for them is such that they can mistreat them and still be in the green (cos you know, these events don't happen every year).

They will just gladly pay up and mistreat them again. And you know what? They won't follow, they will try to bend the rules further (like people who flout SHN/CB rules) and that will result in worse conditions for the workers. For instance, if a worker gets XYZ communicable disease (assuming it isn't hard to test like COVID-19), instead of reporting, they will just quickly ship that worker back to this hometown on the grounds of ""slacking off at work"". There, we mitigated the spread, absolutely nothing happened in our dorms! Bring in the next healthy batch of workers.

What we need isn't punitive punishment only (not saying that they shouldn't foot the bill). What we need is regulations and oversight.

* Solve the now exploding increase of infection rate
* Sweep their crap way of handling treating of FW from the past till current under the rug (inspection criteria)

DOs usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels. What are the demands? How do we balance between quality and cost. I believe that you wouldn't expect DOs to operate at a loss unless they're doing charity and expected to make some profit.

Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others. Do you think that I will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other, lousier dormitories are charging?

Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price? Would DOs that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive? Those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general.

Then you might say that, why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better. Then again who is paying for it? If it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories, how do we get people to do it? If the cost increases, are the workers suppose to pay for the increase? Or are the employers expected to absorb the fee? Or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers. And we have another recurring problem.

9679,"Thanks for this reply. Too many Singaporeans ignore the economics of the situation.

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

We need to be careful with this as well, otherwise the costs for the better dorms will be passed to the workers. A majority of them won't want this - they just want to do their time, earn enough, and leave as soon as possible.",14/4/20,0,1.0
9680,"Thanks for this reply. Too many Singaporeans ignore the economics of the situation.

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

I don't have issues with the size per room. I have stayed before. But I do with two things, the maintenance and the size of dorm.

The size is fixed by the MOM guidelines of certain sqft per pax. Not the most comfortable but they are just cheap accommodation. For the maintenance, I know and I've seen how sloppy it can get. On facilities and all. Yes, I think they should be subjected to fines for that.

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

9877,"Nice opinion, but this is literally a slap on the wrist. For companies, these construction workers are expendable. They get injured in the workplace, they get shipped back to their home countries after patching them up. You think a fine + bills is a ""wake up call"". Nah, it's just a ""one-off expense"", ""we got caught fine"", basically a gamble for them. The calculations for them is such that they can mistreat them and still be in the green (cos you know, these events don't happen every year).

They will just gladly pay up and mistreat them again. And you know what? They won't follow, they will try to bend the rules further (like people who flout SHN/CB rules) and that will result in worse conditions for the workers. For instance, if a worker gets XYZ communicable disease (assuming it isn't hard to test like COVID-19), instead of reporting, they will just quickly ship that worker back to this hometown on the grounds of ""slacking off at work"". There, we mitigated the spread, absolutely nothing happened in our dorms! Bring in the next healthy batch of workers.

What we need isn't punitive punishment only (not saying that they shouldn't foot the bill). What we need is regulations and oversight. Which is why I feel, just like our HDBs, housing for them should be government run. That way, the government has control over it and we have indirect control over how the government treats them (e.g. making it a voter issue for pete's sake).",14/4/20,1,1.0

The calculations for them is such that they can mistreat them and still be in the green (cos you know, these events don't happen every year).

They will just gladly pay up and mistreat them again. And you know what? They won't follow, they will try to bend the rules further (like people who flout SHN/CB rules) and that will result in worse conditions for the workers. For instance, if a worker gets XYZ communicable disease (assuming it isn't hard to test like COVID-19), instead of reporting, they will just quickly ship that worker back to this hometown on the grounds of ""slacking off at work"". There, we mitigated the spread, absolutely nothing happened in our dorms! Bring in the next healthy batch of workers.

What we need isn't punitive punishment only (not saying that they shouldn't foot the bill). What we need is regulations and oversight. Which is why I feel, just like our HDBs, housing for them should be government run. That way, the government has control over it and we have indirect control over how the government treats them (e.g. making it a voter issue for pete's sake).",14/4/20,1,1.0

I see all these moves by the governing agency to move them out as a way to 

* Solve current ""satisfactory but deplorable"" conditions on paper
* Solve the now exploding increase of infection rate
* Sweep their crap way of handling treating of FW from the past till current under the rug (inspection criteria) 
* Acknowledge but don't apologize for past failings wrt. handling of the foreign workers situation

Ultimately, we as a society need to pay the price for the situation mentioned above. Prices of HDB have remained pretty cheap while cost of workers have increased over time. We as a society have also chosen to push them away from general population areas in fear of losing property value etc.

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be. 

There are restrictions on how many beds you can put in a certain area, how many toilets per number of ppl, fire safety requirements, a sickbay separate from living qtrs must be planned, WiFi is compulsory, even entertainment is a must. These are all set out by big G not the dorm owners. Why will any dorm owner go beyond the basic requirement to make a loss? 

Most people will not believe it but the obscene environment is actually caused by the workers themselves. The best example is hanging clothes. By law, the dorm owner must specifically have an area just for hanging clothes because hanging clothes in your sleeping qtrs is asking for disease to spread but the workers would rather hang them in their own rooms for convenience. 

Many do not practice basic hygiene. My own employees said it was a living hell with bedbug infestations so we moved them out.

DOs usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels. What are the demands? How do we balance between quality and cost. I believe that you wouldn't expect DOs to operate at a loss unless they're doing charity and expected to make some profit.

Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others. Do you think that I will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other, lousier dormitories are charging?

Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price? Would DOs that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive? Those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general.

Then you might say that, why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better. Then again who is paying for it? If it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories, how do we get people to do it? If the cost increases, are the workers suppose to pay for the increase? Or are the employers expected to absorb the fee? Or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers. And we have another recurring problem.

Then how are we going to ensure that cost of housing and maintenance does not increase if the cost is passed on the employers? How are we going to help those whos affected by this change?

DOs usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels. What are the demands? How do we balance between quality and cost. I believe that you wouldn't expect DOs to operate at a loss unless they're doing charity and expected to make some profit.

Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others. Do you think that I will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other, lousier dormitories are charging?

Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price? Would DOs that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive? Those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general.

Then you might say that, why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better. Then again who is paying for it? If it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories, how do we get people to do it? If the cost increases, are the workers suppose to pay for the increase? Or are the employers expected to absorb the fee? Or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers. And we have another recurring problem.

Then how are we going to ensure that cost of housing and maintenance does not increase if the cost is passed on the employers? How are we going to help those whos affected by this change?

They aren't living in inhuman conditions. I doubt they will be fined except for if safe distancing law applies to the dorm supervisors. The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well.

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

> SINGAPORE: A resident of a migrant worker dormitory has become Singapore’s first likely case of COVID-19 re-infection, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday (Feb 6).

> 

> The case is a 28-year-old Bangladeshi work permit holder who lives in a dormitory at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Apr 12 last year, and on Jan 25 this year, he tested positive again.

> ""He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH’s surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their postinfection immunity,"" said the ministry.

> When the man was confirmed to have had COVID-19 last year, he was identified as Case 2513 and was part of the cluster of infections at Tech Park Crescent dormitory, which is located at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> He recovered from that infection and tested negative for COVID-19 from last June onwards.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> However, the man tested positive for COVID-19 once again on Jan 25 this year and he was isolated. ""Numerous repeat tests conducted subsequently were also positive for the virus,"" said MOH on Saturday.

> 

> The man's new infection was not previously stated in the ministry's situation reports. CNA has sought further information from MOH.

> 

> In its press release on Saturday, MOH said the man reported feeling unwell on Jan 22 and 23, but was otherwise asymptomatic.

> Advertisement

> He is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and all his identified close contacts have been isolated and quarantined. None have tested positive for COVID-19 so far.

> 

> “While re-infection is rare, the expert panel, which comprises infectious diseases and microbiology experts from NCID, Singapore General Hospital and the National Public Health Laboratory, has assessed that the clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that this is a likely case of re-infection,” MOH said.

> “In addition to his positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results, there was a corresponding marked increase in antibody titres compared to the period prior to the likely re-infection, suggesting that he was exposed to a new infection which boosted his antibody levels.

> “The virus detected in his samples taken in January 2021 is also genetically distinct from that associated with the dormitories outbreak in 2020, suggesting that this is likely a different and new infection.”

> 

> MOH said it will continue to monitor recovered COVID-19 cases to determine their post-infection immunity. No significant loss of post-infection immunity has been detected among recovered workers in dormitories so far.

It’s just like how at least 10 (or more) years ago, companies that employ just a small number of foreign workers used to rent an entire HDB unit for their workers, and such “dorms” were often overcrowded as well, until HDB set down the maximum occupancy for each unit (no matter 3/4 room or bigger) to be 6. 

Back then, most worker dorms around were built and managed by the employers, usually large companies that employ a lot of workers, such as SembCorp, Keppel shipyard, etc. Those dorms usually have more amenities & facilities and generally offer a better living environment (but still cannot compare to SAF bunks la).

The rise of the external dorm operators came about after the new ruling, I believe.",6/4/20,0,1.0

*Migrant worker NGOs have campaigned about overcrowding in dormitories for years. A 2014 medical sciences paper noted previous outbreaks of typhus and pneumonia, possibly due to dorms’ “high density” and “occasionally less than satisfactory sanitary living conditions”.*

*After the first cases in February, activists and NGOs sounded the alarm.

This is not hindsight. We all knew that bosses in construction companies were cutting corners by giving these workers shitty living conditions.

However, NSFs and NSmen are probably better educated with regards to hygiene practices and precautions to be taken against the virus, and are also likely to be less clustered in general.

Hence the danger and potential for a cluster to form in camps. Also, i'm sure stand by bunks are being conducted more rigourously now but still...i wouldn't exactly trust the standards of a typical NSF haha.

10266,"Yeah I’m surprised too that people think migrant worker dorms look like SAF bunks. Anyone who has seen how an average (read: not the worst) foreign worker dorm room looks like will surely not suggest such a comparison. IMHO, when compared to foreign worker dorms, SAF bunks will easily qualify as being five star standard. Not just the aspects of cleanliness or amenities (even just the basic need of having a working toilet), though those are very important factors, but I’ll put them aside since many would assume these aspects are due to the workers not taking care or keeping clean. 

I believe the key issue behind how fast the virus can spread in worker dorms, potentially making it a “petri dish” situation, aside from the lack of cleanliness and/or hygiene in a majority of the dorms, are the issues of poor ventilation and the severe lack of physical distancing. Most worker dorm rooms would pack say, three bunk beds within the size of a bedroom in an average HDB flat (the BTO ones, not the older flats), leaving only enough room for everyone to get up and down the beds. FWIK (from being a volunteer with ItsRainingRaincoats), most of the rooms also do not have any drawers/cupboards/wardrobes/storage. Most of the workers store their belongings in their one luggage bag which they store underneath the bottom bunks of their beds.

And by the way, about the issue of cleanliness, most migrant workers do clean up after themselves, but as with all communal living, it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for everyone else. Just to quote an example, I’ve once had a housemate (I’m a room renter) who was super gross, leaving food waste and used sanitary pads lying around in the open everywhere in the house, even all over the floor of her room. 🤮 *shuddering just from recalling 😖. So no, it’s not about one’s level of education.

It’s how to balance everything with minimal effect to daily lives or minimal effort for recovery after all is over because damage is inevitable. It’s definitely not an easy task, and many people seem to glance over this point when they criticize the policies enacted. 

Sure, it’s easy to say close schools and work places. But that would have downstream effects which you need to plan for very carefully and prepare for. I think that secretly, they have been ramping up the efforts in the background without telling us exactly what they’re doing. For example the recently abandoned precinct near my place due to en bloc is now being refitted with many new facilities, with rumors that it will be a quarantine/SHN center. There’s absolutely no news about that, but residents are seeing the work done and the urgency of speed that it’s done at, it’s not hard to put two and two together.  Also when you start to look at everything from multiple angles you really start to fathom how critically complex the whole response and coordination is and that’s when you realize that the government has been many steps ahead of where they are. This is not something many people come to realize in the midst of of their criticism. So it’s easy to stand there and say “they should have done this and that” in hindsight, but it’s all people speaking from the limited knowledge they have.

> SINGAPORE: A new COVID-19 cluster was reported on Saturday (Aug 22) at Singapore's biggest purpose-built dormitory, about a month after it was declared to be ""fully cleared"" of the coronavirus.

> 

> Two of the newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore are linked to 55 previous cases to form a new cluster at Sungei Tengah Lodge dormitory at 500 Old Choa Chu Kang Road, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday.

> 

> Advertisement

> The cluster at Sungei Tengah Lodge was among the largest in Singapore before the dormitory was declared cleared of COVID-19 by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Jul 21.

> More than 2,200 confirmed cases had been linked to the cluster. MOH closed the cluster on Jul 18.

> Sungei Tengah Lodge is Singapore's biggest purpose-built dormitory, with about 16,000 workers living there.

> It was first declared an isolation area on Apr 9, and was among the first dormitories be gazetted as an isolation area under the Infectious Diseases Act. The notification was revoked on Jul 18.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> MOM and MOH said on Aug 18 that about 100 new COVID-19 cases have been detected in migrant worker dormitories that were previously given the all clear from the virus.

> Some of the new cases were picked up through routine testing that is conducted biweekly, and some of the workers had gone back to work.

> 

> EMPLOYERS MUST SCHEDULE SWAB TEST

> 

> On Saturday, authorities said employers must ensure their workers have completed a COVID-19 swab test in the past 14 days by Sep 5, as part of plans to ensure the safe restart of work. Those who have not done so will not be able to return to work.

> Workers who are staying in dormitories and those in the construction, marine and process sectors, as well as those going into the work sites, are required to undergo rostered routine testing every 14 days.

> To date, about 16,000 employers have scheduled their workers for rostered routine testing using the Health Promotion Board's swab registration system, the authorities said. About 102,000 workers who need to undergo routine testing have yet to be scheduled for a swab test.

> 

> “Employers are reminded to quickly schedule appointment slots for their workers if they have not done so, to avoid disruption to business operations,” the authorities said on Saturday.

> 

> There are currently about 13,700 workers who are still serving out their quarantine period, said MOH on Saturday, adding that they will be tested when their quarantine ends.

> ""We expect the case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter,"" the health ministry said.

> Singapore reported 50 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, including two in the community and five imported infections.

> This brings the total number of cases in the country to 56,266, with fatalities remaining at 27.

> 

> Both of the community cases are Singaporeans and are currently unlinked to previous cases, the health ministry said.

> 

> One of the cases, a 63-year-old woman, was tested after being admitted to a hospital for another medical condition. The other community case, a 56-year-old woman, had gone to work at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College Central. She was detected to have the coronavirus after she was diagnosed with acute respiratory infection.

> The five imported cases include a Singaporean man who returned from Iran on Aug 10, two dependant's pass holders, a student's pass holder and a work permit holder currently employed in Singapore.

> 

> The five imported cases were placed on stay-home notices upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their stay-home notices at dedicated facilities.

No. What you wrote is not how it's done. In a larger country, we go by towns, cities, or districts. With Singapore, we can go by GRC boundaries or drawing boundaries base on the nearest supermarket. The idea is simple. Stop all public transports that go further than however far it is needed for people to get to the nearest supermarket and have everyone do grocery shopping there and there only. This limits everyone's movement range and ensure outbreaks occur in a geographically limited manner. Not this going across the island just to buy food.

Then we establish a red, yellow, green areas. Green = no community cases for 1-2 weeks + not bordering red zones. Yellow = no community cases in 1-2 weeks but bordering a red zone. Red = active community cases. in green zones, things can be pre-covid, except masks. In red zones = maximum restrictions. Yellow = some restrictions. 

Then how people get to work. Well most should work from home. For the essential workers that relied on public transports: use the freed up buses to perform pickups, business-by-business; or restrict MRTs to ""work only"". Within businesses, do like some Singapore hospitals do and split staff into small non-interacting teams.

No we don't. Oral-fecal (or inhaled fecal aerosol) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been established. Viral RNA is found in feces and sewage, but viability and transmissibility has not been demonstrated. Still a good idea to flush with the lid down though.   
Spread of SARS in Hong Kong due to flushing of toilets wasn't because of flushing with the lids up. It was because of a lousy plumbing system (since banned) where floor U-traps dried out and flushing of the toilet in one apartment caused aerosol to spew out of the floor drain of the apartment above.

Then they can provide support to fulfill needs from bubbles under lockdown. 

However, this is definitely not as easy as it seem. A lot of issues to think about. What if certain essential service not available in the some bubble? How do you enforce it?

> This is the highest daily number reported to date and brings the total number of cases here to 1,910, as the global number of cases crossed the 1.5 million mark.

> Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean is now advising the multi-ministry taskforce on handling the Covid-19 situation in foreign worker dormitories, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that the police and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are involved in operations there.

> To cut the chain of transmission in dormitories, thousands of foreign workers who are healthy - especially those working in essential services - will be moved to army camps, floating hotels, and vacant Housing Board blocks.

> Singapore has also started active case finding and is swab-testing workers in various dormitories, said the Health Ministry's (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Thursday.

> Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories.

> Associate Professor Mak said the ministry believes that foreign workers had visited Mustafa Centre, where some employees had fallen ill, and gotten infected there.

> They then transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who subsequently infected others at their dormitories.

> ""Many had very mild symptoms and so they continued to work, that's why there was a delay in picking them up,"" said Mr Wong, who chairs the ministerial task force along with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. It is likely that the virus had been spreading in dormitories for some time, he said.

> MOM is supported by the Ministry of Health, National Environment Agency, the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, Migrant Workers' Centre and other agencies.

> Explaining the Government's decision to set up a task force, Mr Wong said: ""We cannot rely solely on dorm operators any more, given the current situation.""

> Manpower Minister Josephine Teo noted that there has been no cluster in dormitories until recently, even though a number of foreign workers have tested positive for the virus.

> ""Bear in mind that dorms are home to foreign workers,"" she added. ""Within dorms workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely, they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there.""

Isn't this a convoluted reasoning? You are looking at it specifically from a time frame whereby it augments your statement.

ie There is community spread. The community spread has ALREADY reach the dormitory. Therefore an earlier lockdown, regardless, will still spread among the dormitory resulting in huge case numbers because of the conditions. Basically the only way for your statement to be true, you need a first spark to start the fire.

However, when ppl are talking about earlier lockdown, ppl meant it as a whole, to even prevent community spread(dormitory being an ideal hotspot does not equate to the virus will travel there by themselves) .

10514,"Ok first of I'd like to say that I'm not intentionally being edgy. And I'm fine with using my real name because I haven't said anything that I'm ashamed of, and if anyone tries to doxx me, they automatically lose all moral high ground. Let me rephrase what I'm trying to say here: the workers should be given the best possible conditions that we can afford. Key phrase: that we can afford. And when I say ""take office first"", I don't literally mean that you have to assume an official position in order to try and enact change, I'm asking you to look at it from a different perspective. It's very easy to criticise but if you were actually there on the ground trying to recruit volunteers, distribute medical supplies, and relocate healthcare workers, I think you would better appreciate what is already being done. I'm not saying it's perfect, not by a long shot, but I'm saying that I trust the government is doing all that it can within a reasonable capacity. I do agree that there are and will continue to be flaws, lapses and slip-ups, but I also trust that such issues will be addressed in the fastest and best possible way. I mean already in that article it outlined how efforts were being made to improve living conditions: ""cleanliness and hygiene being stepped up""', ""sickbays being scaled up"", ""thousands of workers moving to army camps, floating hotels and empty HDBs"" to ease up on the cramped conditions... I mean it doesn't really sound a lot like Omelas to me, sounds like they're actually trying hard to make it better.

Second point about hierarchy. I maintain that the Singpore government's first priority rightfully is, and always should be, Singaporean nationals. Does this mean that we should simply neglect everyone else and leave them to die in crowded conditions? Of course not! But consider if we quarantined all 20,000 workers identically to how we have been quarantining our own citizens. Our systems would be completely overwhelmed in no time. It would leave no margin whatsoever for future infections, many of whom would be nationals. If we had the space and the resources then of course they should give workers the same conditions, but sadly this isn't the case. I just want to put across the point that when we have such limited resources, no matter what couse of action you take there is always going to be someone who loses out.

Okay, as for the bit where you said this isn't just for the government, it's for everyone, I agree with you almost completely. However, it is incredibly difficult to see any kind of change coming about in the immediate future. And frankly, you should be the change that you want to see. If you're really passionate about this, then you should volunteer to cook/clean for the workers. You might say, ""oh I'm busy, I still have to work from home, etc etc"", all of which is perfectly understandable. Then maybe you should consider that this is the same situatiom which other Singaporeans are in. Now again, I'm not saying, ""you must be a volunteer, then only you can talk about how people should be more sympathetic"", I'm just saying that if everyone expressed concern online but never enacted any real change, people would be a lot more caring for our workers but the actual workers' situations would not improve.",10/4/20,1,1.0

10568,"> # 7,000 migrant workers quarantined after some 100 new COVID-19 cases detected in cleared dorms

> SINGAPORE — About 100 COVID-19 cases have been detected in foreign worker dormitories that were given the all-clear, resulting in some 7,000 workers being quarantined, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday (18 August).

> These cases – some of whom have resumed work – were detected through routine testing conducted bi-weekly for workers living in dorms as well as those who work in construction/production sites and the construction, marine, and process sectors, said the ministries in the joint statement.

> Over 100,000 workers have started on their biweekly routine tests to date, while seven in 10 employers have logged on and used an online swab registration system set up to schedule such tests.

> “We have taken timely actions to contain and isolate the COVID-19 positive cases. We have also taken aggressive actions to contain, trace, and isolate the close contacts. To date, over 60 per cent of cases have been closed,” the statement added.

> Out of some 7,000 workers quarantined from the new infection cases, less than two per cent were reported to be infected with COVID-19, said both ministries.

> The quarantined cases are “being managed according to strict protocols and reinforced with more centralised quarantine facilities made available through the completion of dormitory clearance”, they added.

> The new infected cases in cleared dorms and decant sites are a reminder of the need for vigilance, said the ministries.

> “As we gather more real-life data, we will be better able to assess the impact of safe distancing measures (SDM) and segregation measures. This will help us assess patterns in the spread of infections, and review the extent of quarantine required to contain a detected case,” they added. 

> Authorities here have completed the testing of all workers in the dorms, with around 18,600 of them currently serving out their quarantine period, including 800 who were announced by the MOH last Wednesday to be newly quarantined after the discovery of a COVID-19 case among them in a cleared purpose-built dorm block.

> Both ministries said that authorities are taking “a measured approach” to tackle such situations. It includes conveying immediate close contacts of the infected worker to serve a 14-day quarantine at a dedicated quarantine facility and testing the remaining residents.

> “We have quarantined the whole block in the first instance while the assessment is being made as a precautionary measure. We will rescind the quarantine subsequently for workers who are assessed to be not at risk,” the ministries said.

> “While this approach could affect up to a few hundred migrant workers for each case, it ensures that we contain the detected case and minimise spreading that could end up affecting thousands others,” they added.

> Other measures taken to prevent a second wave of infections in the cleared dorms include segregating workers staying in the dorms by the type of industry that they work in. Sector agencies will also work closely with the employers to assess the risk at the workplaces and put in place safety timeouts if necessary, with aggressive testing operations conducted.

> The MOH confirmed another 100 COVID-19 cases in Singapore on Tuesday, taking the country’s total to 55,938. Of the tally, some 95 per cent are foreign workers living in dorms.

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed 94 more COVID-19 cases as of Friday (28 August) afternoon, bringing Singapore’s total to 56,666.

> Of them, four – all Singapore residents – are classified as cases in the community, while 10 are imported cases who have been placed on the stay-home notice or isolated upon their arrival here.

> Amongst the remaining 80 cases residing in dorms, 58 – over half of Friday’s daily tally – are from Sungei Tengah Lodge, who had all been placed on quarantine earlier, said the MOH.

> The vast majority of them were tested during quarantine to determine their status, or picked up through the rostered routine testing.

> “Following the detection of cases at Sungei Tengah Lodge, we had placed about 4,500 workers on quarantine, and tested about 3,000 of them so far,” added the ministry.

> The number of cases from the dorms is expected to continue to be high in the coming days as authorities complete testing of the remaining quarantined workers, it said.

> More details will be shared in the ministry’s press release later at night.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 168 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Thursday, 55,139 cases – some 97.4 per cent of the tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while none is in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 1,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 27 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 15 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

10606,"> # Measures to tackle COVID-19 cases in dorms early on were 'insufficient': Teo Chee Hean

> SINGAPORE — Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore’s migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures “turned out to be insufficient”, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

> During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.

> In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date. Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.

> “On 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,” said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.

> “However, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.”

> While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, “no two crises are the same”, Teo said. The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is “a major challenge”, he added.

> On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.

> “But they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines”, he noted.

> The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH’s overall medical support plan.

> Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.

> “The operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak. About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,” he added.

> Teo’s delivery is the third in a series of national speeches by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday. Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing is scheduled next to deliver his speech on Sunday.

> In his speech on “Resilience in a changing external environment”, Teo also spoke at length about Singapore’s efforts in providing community care facilities for patients who have mild or no symptoms.

> “We had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and had started to build them. We accelerated these plans and scaled them up, adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April,” he said.

> At the peak on 12 May, some 20,000 patients were being cared for at community care and similar facilities, with as many as 1,000 are admitted daily, Teo said.

> “This is more than the total number of beds in all our public acute hospitals. We mobilised resources from across our public service, government-linked companies, and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities. Healthcare volunteers stepped forward to help man them,” he stressed.

> “This is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our healthcare system and putting lives at risk.”

> The clear lesson learned during the COVID-19 outbreak is that Singapore needs to plan in peace-time “on facing the unknown, and build deep reserves of people and capabilities, so that when we face a crisis, we can act decisively, and respond flexibly and rapidly”.

> He referred to past challenges in Singapore’s history such as in 1967 when the British announced the withdrawal of their troops from the city-state. With the move, Singapore was poised to lose 20 per cent of its gross domestic product and 70,000 jobs at a time when the population was half of what it is today, Teo said.

> “We are far more resilient today than in 1967, and better positioned to create new markets, businesses, and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.”

> Singapore also rode out the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Asian and global financial crises. “COVID-19 is an even bigger test,” he added.

> The outbreak is the first major crisis for many of the new generation of ministers and civil servants taking the lead in efforts to tackle the situation.

> The ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of their older Cabinet colleagues as well as consulted widely within and outside the government, Teo said.

> He added, “Over the past few months, I have worked very closely with them. We speak daily and exchange views freely. They have stepped up to the task, worked together as a team, and led from the front. This is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore.”

As for what Minister Jo Teo's did / said, I think the lapses under her ministry, while not directly responsible for Covid-19, did contribute to the rapid spread of the disease amongst our migrant worker population. Had she been more amiable, less arrogant, I think more people would have given her a pass (She seems to be trying for Minister Shanmugam's style, without having his charisma). Covid-19 has really wrecked havoc all over the world. Again, all of the above are my opinions. 

With regards to Ho Ching, I wholeheartedly agree with you. It's embarrassing to see the wife of our PM act in such a childish and classless manner. So far in this crisis, I see PM Lee only when he's giving speeches, but he has been reassuring, and his messages in different languages tailored to the audience. His speeches have been lauded, on reddit, on my facebook feed from my foreign friends, as well as on the news. So, to see Mdm Ho Ching act in such an infantile manner is really disappointing. But, she's not a politician, and free to act and say as she please. I just think the way she acts and speaks isn't befitting of my respect, at least on social media.

10718,"Some thoughts - given the high level numbers and the disparity between cases in the various categories (dorms only, Singaporeans/PRs, work pass holders, work permit holders etc), I barely pay too much attention anymore to the preliminary high level number that comes out at \~3pm everyday. We have to wait for the detailed updates at night to get a better sense of how the situation is progressing.

In particular, I'm paying close attention to community cases and work permit holders not living in dorms (I'm conservatively assuming these people are still part of the community, but most should be serving 14 day SHNs). I reckon we need to see both community cases only (Singaporeans/PRs + work pass holders) AND community cases + work permit holders not in dorms stay low for at least 2 weeks before we start getting our hopes up. Dorm cases pretty straight forward there - given the tight living conditions and aggressive testing, i reckon we see high numbers for a while more before we start seeing the results of the distancing measures that were implemented about 2 weeks back for the dorms.  


Also - keeping brief track of unlinked cases is also somewhat important. In particular, both the absolute number of unlinked cases on a particular day AND following up the next day or couple to see if those unlinked cases have been linked (they do tend to take a while to link some cases because contact tracing etc is a VERY tough job). This is important because if they can link a specific case to an existing cluster and/or infected person, there is a lower possibility of there being existing further community spread that the authorities don't yet know about. Ideally would like to see those unlinked numbers stay low AND have the authorities constantly being able to link cases on a daily basis (which they have).

Traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture was also allowed to resume for pain management.

> Some businesses, including hairdressers and home-based food businesses, will also be allowed to resume operations from May 12, with a gradual resumption of selected activities and services over a few weeks.

> As part of the gradual easing of circuit breaker measures, schools will start to bring back students in small groups for face-to-face lessons from May 19, with priority given to graduating cohorts.

> Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong cautioned in a press conference on Friday that Singaporeans should not rush to go out when businesses reopen on May 12.

> “I know some people may not have had a haircut for some time, but there is no need to rush to go out to have a haircut on May 12. There will be time to do so,"" said Mr Wong, speaking at a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference.

> “We are making progress because of the circuit breaker and we should continue to do our part to comply with the measures for the rest of the circuit breaker period. We should remain vigilant and not take any chances,” he said.

10765,"\[opinion\] My Interpretation of [""backlog](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-singapore-new-cases-moh-may-3-12697698)"" cases

tldr: I am guessing that the ""backlog"" consist of the suspect cases of people who are staying in dorms which have known infections. It is different from some of you, who thinks that the ""backlog"" is due to ""less testing on weekends/ public holiday"".

I feel that new clusters with big spikes is more alarming than old clusters with big spikes (probably due to backlog).

short essay:

In early April, there was a need to increase ""**testing width**"" (to test people from different dorms to identify clusters) to quickly take action in dorms with infections. Due to finite testing capability, there was a **trade-of**f for ""**testing depth**"" (to test all suspect cases within a known cluster). This results in a large number of **suspect cases** being identified, possibly being treated as pseudo-cases in terms of medical care/quarantine, but **not immediately tested**. This develops into this ""**backlog**"".

In early May, I presumed MOH had met the ""testing width"" (tested a sizable group of people from each dorm), and now is ""widening"" the testing to include healthcare workers etc (to identify the ""community transmission""). Since the ""testing width"" is met, I presume MOH now has the ""bandwidth"" to test those previously identified suspect cases, and thus explains the spike in number for these (old) dorm clusters.

Nevertheless, I find it concerning that, on average, there are still more than 5 new clusters identified for recent days, and some of them even have a large number of new cases linked within the first few days of identification.

For example, the cluster at 5 Fourth Chin Bee Road is identified on 6 May but has 38 newly identified cases of that day linked to it, As that cluster is a new cluster, this means that these 38 cases are not ""backlog"". Hence, I consider these more alarming than old clusters having a big increase (which is probably due to ""backlog"").",9/5/20,0,1.0
10766,"Testing backlog being cleared is one possibility.

Another possible explanation - the CB in its current form might have already reached its full potential. To push the numbers down further, it probably has to be tightened further, but we have to consider diminishing returns. Dumping tens of billions of extra dollars and extending to July (for example, but please no) to push the average from 10 to 8 is not worth it.

More realistically though, we should think about how we can exit CB while keeping the numbers manageable and preventing them from exploding.",9/5/20,1,1.0

Sure, it's probably China's blame to take since they're eating all the weird shit that most people have never even heard of, but it also shines a light on most governments around the world- they're super unprepared. 

If by now, China (and its neighbouring countries) has seemingly recovered, but the rest of the world hasn't, then is it really all China's fault to take?

Take for example someone bringing some spoiled food to a party, and 20minutes in Carol tells everyone that she just puked because she ate the spoiled chicken, and told everyone who has been exposed to the chicken to please take some medication now. Everyone at the party couldn't give a shit, and tells Carol to fix her shit, she probably caught something and it ain't the chicken. People continue to have the chicken, ate it then got sick, then blamed Carol for causing all the problems.

Singaporeans on this sub - do you not see this comment for what it is? This person is not differentiating between Singaporean Chinese and China Chinese.

We’re sliding into a world where racism based on your ethnicity is permissible. And this is not okay. The reactions of Western govts are actually enabling these attitudes amongst their citizens. 

Sinophobia can easily backfire on most of Asia, because racist Westerners aren’t going to differentiate us. Vietnamese, Koreans are already targets of hate crimes overseas, what more Singaporeans who actually speak Chinese? I’m already expecting a more hostile world when I travel after the pandemic. 

It’s really critical we play a moderating role in this China vs world situation. And we have to speak up where it’s critical. Because if not, it could easily come bite us in the butt.

> SINGAPORE - Cruise ships are being assessed for their feasibility as temporary housing for foreign workers who are recovered from Covid-19 and tested negative for the virus.

> SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius, mid-sized cruise ships operated by Genting Cruise Lines, will be checked for consideration by the Government for factors such as ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures.

> If deemed feasible, the two cruise ships may be used to complement other interim facilities such as Singapore Armed Forces military camps and vacant Housing Board blocks that have been refurbished to house healthy workers.

> By reducing numbers of workers in existing dormitories, health measures can be implemented more effectively, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in a media statement on Friday (April 17) morning.

> Cruise ships are being considered for use as temporary housing as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact, added STB.

> SuperStar Gemini, which arrived from Hong Kong on Friday, is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SuperStar Aquarius may be activated for assessment at a later date.

> If deemed suitable, the two ships may accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers in total.

> STB said that ""if activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times"".

> Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

> Related Story Coronavirus: 3 more foreign worker dormitories declared isolation areas

> Related Story Coronavirus: Floating facilities ready to house healthy foreign workers

> While the spread of the coronavirus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially.

> As of Friday morning, the total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689, which is about 60 per cent of all Singapore's cases.

> There are now a total of 12 dormitories declared as isolation areas where workers at these lodgings must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.

10829,"Came here to say, this will not help and it’s such a terrible decision.  
  
I know our Frontlines in charge of Covid containment is overwhelmed with work but this has to be said:  

**Edit: ignore the first 3 points. Cruise for recovered FW.**  
1.They will do swap test first on those being relocated to these cruise- **but tests are known to have turn out negative initially** so they can still be infected.
   
2.These FW aren’t fully quarantined, **they are still going to work**.  
(Another concern, are we asking FW to continue wearing mask throughout work? again, if not then it’ll obviously be more likely to spread Covid. Perhaps their work already requires them to wear a mask idk.. I’ll just point this out so anyone in the know can work it out so no FW faints doing  labour work because of a suffocating mask whole day.)
   
3. Bad publicity worldwide. Once an outbreak occurs on this cruise(unless it’s contained very well, which is just betting ur luck.)
   
4. We should be applying lockdown for all FW living in crowded/shared dorm for at least 14days to make sure our healthcare doesn’t get strained more.
   
5. Imo, It makes no sense to let our FW continue work during this CB and Dormitory spike. We should solve the crowded dorm issues first, since we currently have community spread going on we shouldn’t react as if FW bringing Covid back to temporary dorm or causing further spread in community isn’t likely. 
   
My suggestion: I don’t know the capacity our country can do to house as many of them separately. But if surveillance is an issue, we can make mid shift shelters and get general public to help monitor via camera(we report to authorities if anyone try to sneak out) hopefully this will help slow the spread and we can get some breather for our frontlines.  
(For the sake of everyone, We will have to endure and work together if rubbish and cleaning or other essentials done by FW is disrupted.)
   
Before *you* start flaming aimlessly. Lockdown and surveillance means, **temporary** build a fenced shelter/tents for few weeks so the dormitory issues doesn’t turn tragic(we will only monitor the fences to make sure no one flout).

Edit: just realised it was for recovered FW, heard on TV and saw the comments hence I didn’t check the article first sorry. But some of my points can be considered.

This is confusing though: 
>The STB said: ""If activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times.""

> SINGAPORE — All 43 purpose-built foreign workers dormitories here will soon be “effectively” on lockdown, affecting some 200,000 workers.

> During a virtual press conference led by the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce on Tuesday (14 April), Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that the authorities aim to apply the same safe distancing measures implemented in isolation areas to the remaining dorms.

> Thus far, eight dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, with the latest being Cochrane Lodge II.

> “While these (other) dorms are not presented as isolation areas, we aim to apply the same safe distancing measures so that they are effectively also on lockdown,” said Teo.

> Some 7,000 healthy workers who are providing essential services have already been moved out of the dormitories.

> They would be placed at various activated sites such as SAF military camps, the Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels, or floatels, that are typically used for offshore accommodation, as well as vacant Housing Board blocks in Tanjong Pagar and Jurong.

> About 1,300 healthy workers will be progressively relocated in batches to three floating hotels berthed at Tanjong Pagar Terminal over the next few weeks. The first batch of 31 healthy workers have been moved to a floatel.

> At least 19 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified as of Monday night, including the largest cluster of 586 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol.

> Those linked to S11 account for nearly half of the total 1,193 cases linked to clusters at foreign worker dorms and construction sites.

> On Tuesday, the Ministry of Health’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said there were another 334 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, taking the total to 3,252.

10912,">Agreed with you on the masks, the govt could have just be transparent (we don't have enough for everyone

The government wasn't lying. The scientific consensus in late Feb was that there wasn't convincing proof of asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission. 

[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/no-proof-of-asymptomatic-transmission-of-coronavirus-ncid](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/no-proof-of-asymptomatic-transmission-of-coronavirus-ncid)

It didn't help that a case study written up in Germany published in a very high profile scientific journal was retracted after it turned out that the woman had symptoms after all. And the other case studies of asymptomatic transmission were rather dodgy reports from China. 

If Covid was only transmitted by sick, coughing people (like the way it was with SARS), then only sick people and health workers would need to wear masks. Wearing a cloth mask to protect yourself didn't make a lot of sense because the holes are huge. Only when it was confirmed that Covid was quite infectious before symptoms emerged did it make sense for people to wear cloth masks to protect others from their flying droplets. Try holding your hand out in front of your face and blowing with and without a cloth mask on -- you won't feel the ""wind"" when you're wearing a mask, so even if your droplets make it through the cloth, they aren't traveling far.",18/12/20,0,1.0
10913,"To add on to your point, even if the government was deliberately lying because they knew they didn’t have enough masks for everyone, the problem is basically that of the boy who cried wolf. You have public organisations like schools who take guidance from the government when it comes to this sort of thing. If they say no masks, then the schools are not going to enforce the wearing of them. You may also have teachers who end up reinforcing the same wrong messaging to the students, or who want to wear masks but are concerned it may lead to send the wrong messaging to others. 

So we have situations where teachers and students are facing each other the entire day, without face masks, because we trusted the government. It just didn’t help their (and our) credibility. 

Second, as a teacher, I will say that the best time to close schools and implement a CB would have been right at the start of the March holidays. To me, it’s not even hindsight, just plain common sense. You give everyone a grace period of a week to get ready what they need to prepare (eg: childcare arrangements for parents, teachers get time to prepare for HBL). Instead, the most moronic thing that could happen was that people continued to travel overseas (because what else would they do during the holidays?), despite knowing that we were in the midst of a pandemic, and the government said or did nothing! 

It was only after the holidays were almost over, that the govt slap a retroactive 2-week SHN notice on everyone who had left the country. But schools still remained open, so schools were taxed because you had staff who couldn’t show up for work, teachers were taxed because they had to prepare online lessons for students who didn’t show up for school, on top of conducting their normal classes. 

The situation was just messy and chaotic and it was clear the various ministries were not coordinating with one another. 

It’s easy to say that the government only did one or two things wrong, but these have ripple effects that affect a lot of other organisations and people, and us on the ground bore the brunt of the fallout. Just a lot of negative work that could have been avoid right from the get go, had the government been a lot more firm and decisive.",18/12/20,0,0.0

As for countries that reached quickly enough, Taiwan? Thanks to nature of their relationship with China, they rightfully suspected that China was trying to cover up the pandemic as early as in December, and so started screening passengers from China, as well as stocking up on sufficient quantities of PPE and mandating the wearing of masks early on. 

You are talking about a lag time of 3-4 months. 

Meanwhile, it was painfully clear early on that the WHO was in cahoots with China in covering up the spread of the virus, and our government still continued to listen to and adhere to their guidance like suckers.

Remind me again - why were the beneficiaries when all the foreign workers were being housed in crammed living conditions? And who are the ones paying for housing and feeding them now? Definitely not the dorm owners who previously raked in all the profits, that’s for sure. 

The point isn’t that the money cannot be used for the benefit of our people and the economy of our country. You have to take it out, you have to take it out. I continue to stand by my initial assertion that the money wasn’t used as efficiently as it could because of missteps by the government.

I mean, look at the current situation. Our borders are still closed (more or less), but many businesses are still able to operate (shopping malls are packed), people are still able to WFH and connect with foreign businesses via Zoom or Webex, and life goes on.

Here's what I believe would have happened had we closed our borders earlier like what Taiwan did. It's like when a company recalls all their products because a small batch may be faulty. It's extreme, but you know that you won't have any more cases because of it. You can then focus on managing the issue internally, without having to worry about what's happening beyond your shores.

Yes, there would be companies that would suffer like SIA and tour agencies, but the amount of money that would need to be channeled towards propping them up would be a drop in the bucket compared to the 92 billion spent in total. Or just let them close, like what happened with Robinsons.

So people can't come in and out of Singapore (at least not easily). We can still import food and other necessities. The government would be able to focus all their energies on managing the dormitory situation because their attention is not split between 2 battles on two different fronts. We may not even have needed a CB in the first place if the cases were coming mostly from the foreign workers (whom the government continued to confine in the same places anyways).

Sometimes, all it takes is one wrong decision to have a domino effect. This may have been it. The decision to take China and the WHO at their word. And we have been paying for that mistake ever since.

Credit where credit is due for the situation currently being under control.

They did not shift the goal posts. The case count goes up only if the person tests positive using a PCR test. They are not added in if they test positive only for serology. This is in line with international practice.

If anything I think MOH has been transparent in all their information provided. Of course, more information would be appreciated but still. IMO, look at the press releases instead of looking at the media reports. Prepare for more BTW, they still have 65k left to serology test.

The 2 things that I think they can do better are the dorms & mask wearing. Given that they did contain a small cluster initially at a construction site successfully & the scientific evidence that suggested that no masks were required then + little understanding of asymptomatic spread, I think it is reasonable how they have performed.

> SINGAPORE: Foreign domestic workers (FDWs) should avoid congregating in large groups on their rest days as Singapore moves into Phase 2 of its reopening, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday (Jun 17).

> 

> Previously, such workers had been advised by the ministry to stay at home during their rest days in the first phase of Singapore's post-""circuit breaker"" reopening.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> In its advisory to employers on Wednesday, MOM outlined ""appropriate arrangements"" for foreign domestic workers during the next phase of reopening, adding that the advisory would ""remain in force until withdrawn"".

> These arrangements include seeking the consent of employers for taking rest days on a weekday, maintaining safe distancing measures and downloading the TraceTogether app.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""FDWs who wish to spend their rest days outside should seek the consent of their employers to do so on a weekday when public spaces are less crowded,"" said MOM.

> They should also inform their employers of their whereabouts, said the ministry, adding that workers are also strongly encouraged to download and activate the TraceTogether app to facilitate contact tracing.

> While out on their rest day, foreign domestic workers are also advised to continue adhering to safe distancing measures, said MOM. These include:

> 

> Wearing a mask and maintaining a safe distance from one another

> Observing good personal hygiene and avoiding sharing food, drinks and other personal items

> Reducing their time spent outside and limiting the number of contacts that they meet

> Complying with safe distancing measures at malls and public places and not gathering in groups of more than five

> The ministry also advised workers not to ""gather or loiter in public spaces"" or visit crowded places such as City Plaza, Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza.

> For those who want to remit money at these places, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has already advised remittance agents that they should schedule appointments with clients, said the ministry.

> Alternatively, foreign domestic workers are encouraged to conduct remittance via electronic platforms.

> MOM said it would be carrying out inspections on the ground, and would disperse large groups and outdoor gatherings.

> Those who do not cooperate risk being fined and having their work passes revoked.

> ""As we all adapt to the new normal, it is important to maintain open communication with your FDW and help your FDW understand the above guidelines and requirements,"" said MOM.

> ""Our community needs to stay disciplined and vigilant ... so that all our efforts so far to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are not wasted.""

> On Monday, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force announced Phase 2 of Singapore's reopening, after the country exited a two-month-long circuit breaker designed to limit the spread of COVID-19.

> Phase 2 will involve the resumption of “most activities”, subject to safe distancing principles.

> 

> Small gatherings of up to five people will be allowed to resume, along with dining in at food and beverage outlets. Retail businesses may also reopen their physical outlets.

> 

> By Phase 3, social, cultural, religious and business gatherings or events should be able to resume, although gathering sizes will still have to be limited in order to prevent large clusters.

10966,"Some info to note (I can't read the full text unfortunately, might be redundant):

These migrant workers are usually subjected to medical checkups before starting work, and usually work at construction sites. Most are also under 40, and are usually in their 20s and 30s. Usually quite young and healthy. 

About 15 cases resulted in deaths, but were recorded as not due to Covid-19 infection. Causes of death were mostly ischaemic heart disease or myocardial infarction (although one was a fall from height).

Around 55,000 workers of the 323,000 in dormitories were confirmed infected through PCR testing. However, later serological tests, which 258,000 were subjected to, suggest about 98,000 more were infected than detected. This is probably due to insufficient testing in the early stages of the outbreak.

EDIT: Most of the dormitories were placed under quarantine (no one in, no one out, no intermingling between different floors, masks mandated), and the community outside the dorms was put under lockdown (masks mandated, all schools and non-essential workplaces closed, social gatherings totally banned). Despite this, by late April, infections were far outstripping testing capacity. Because of this, for a period of time those who were symptomatic were only quarantined, and so were their contacts; testing was not carried out for many who were asymptomatic, and was delayed for those who were symptomatic.

EDIT 2: The dormitories were also a ""worst case scenario"" for infections. Workers working at a single construction site usually live in different dormitories. They endured sustained physical labour, at a time when masks weren't yet mandated. And social distancing is impossible, because of how dense the dorms are.",10/2/21,0,1.0

And yes, a large majority of local cases were from the migrant worker population. However, we are told there are 59,000+ cases, not nearly as high as this article states. However, we have had 29 confirmed deaths, more than the article attests.

That's more than 5 times higher than the number reported in this article and is a vast underestimate of the real number in the US. 

Notably, this statistic is completely unaffected by their public health campaign seeking to reduce total infections. The only explanations I can think of are that 1) these migrant workers are very healthy and have a much, MUCH lower risk of serious disease; 2) they overestimated total and clinical cases by using a test with a very high false positive rate; 3) they did not collect the complete number of ICU admissions and deaths among their study population.

Option 1) is certainly true but I personally don't believe is great enough to explain the full discrepancy.

Abstract

High-density communal residences are at elevated risk of large outbreaks of respiratory disease.1,2 After an initial nationwide outbreak of 231 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Singapore, which was contained as of March 24, 2020, a surge of 244 cases among migrant workers residing in dormitories, largely from Bangladesh and India, occurred from March 25 to April 7. A national task force was formed to coordinate Singapore’s outbreak response. A national lockdown from April 7 to June 1 enforced movement restriction and confined workers to their dormitories. Medical posts were deployed on-site in all dormitories, and testing capacity for testing and screening residents increased. All workers with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result were admitted to health care facilities for isolation and treatment. We examined the prevalence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection among migrant workers in Singapore.",10/2/21,0,0.0

This is a possibility, but the high number of infections was determined by serological testing after the fact to track the full number of infections within the worker dormitories.

>3) they did not collect the complete number of ICU admissions and deaths among their study population.

This is more unlikely, given the sheer amount of public scrutiny together with how detailed the daily (!) reports that the Ministry of Health in Singapore puts out.

One thing that probably contributed to the low death rate was probably the proactive medical care going out to the workers - because there was a HUGE public backlash against the government about infections in the worker dormitories. So the health and manpower ministries instituted a pretty hard watch on any possible infectious spread - the moment a migrant worker was detected to have covid-19 (whether or not they had symptoms), they were off to a quarantine facility and under 24-hour medical observation and all their close contacts were isolated, monitored, and screened again for potential infection (and if they were infected, the chain continues). There was no cost to the workers at all, and any attempt by the dorm owners or employers to prevent workers from reporting symptoms were dealt with pretty harshly after one case created even more public backlash. So this resulted in all the infected migrant workers having really fast access to quality medical care at no financial burden to themselves, even in the early onset of symptoms.

comma is either used for decimal separation or for separating thousands. 00 is not thousands.

from a standard point of view, a comma is the preferred way to show decimals, and nothing is supposed to be used to separate thousands.

quoting the same wiki page again:

>The 22nd General Conference on Weights and Measures declared in 2003 that ""the symbol for the decimal marker shall be either the point on the line or the comma on the line"". It further reaffirmed that ""numbers may be divided in groups of three in order to facilitate reading; neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces between groups""[24] (e.g. 1000000000). This usage has therefore been recommended by technical organizations, such as the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.[25]

>Past versions of ISO 8601, but not the 2019 revision, also stipulated normative notation based on SI conventions, adding that the comma is preferred over the full stop.[26]

>ISO 80000-1 stipulates that ""The decimal sign is either a comma or a point on the line."" The standard does not stipulate any preference, observing that usage will depend on customary usage in the language concerned, but adds a note that as per ISO/IEC Directives all ISO standards should use the decimal comma.

Finland has had 50k cases and 10 deaths of people under the age of 50 (mostly young and healthy).  That means Singapore’s migrant workers have a ~100x lower death rate than finish people under 50. 

Singapore is counting their cases for migrants workers and other members of the population separately. Overall Singapore’s non-migrant population has had 60k cases, and 53 deaths. As compared to Finland’s overall cases of 50k and 700 deaths. Singapore’s ageing non-migrant population somehow has (significantly) less than a 10th of the death rate of Finland. 

I think 1 or more orders of magnitude difference in survivability suggests that Singapore’s numbers are being distorted somehow (I don’t mean to imply intentionality, I am no conspiracy theorist).

11858,"No, context matters a lot. 1 death in 100k makes sense in this extreme exceptional case. You can’t just take data at face value alone and determine if it’s “right” or “wrong”. 

Once you consider that most of these cases were actually mostly asymptomatic-mildly symptomatic migrant workers (healthy people medically certified to be well before they took up the job), and were relatively closed off from the wider community thus preventing transmission to vulnerable groups like in nursing homes, then it makes a whole lot of sense that there shouldn’t even be that many deaths. The government put the dorms in lockdown the moment this became an issue, and then aggressively *tested everyone inside regardless of symptoms repeatedly* over months. 

It’s like all the young people partying and being fine in many other countries - but the screw up comes when they bring the virus home to their parents, or interact with the rest of their community to pass it to their elderly neighbours or even the nursing homes. These migrant workers are like those healthy kids, but they didn’t bring the virus anywhere except among themselves for the most part so the screw up step didn’t happen. 

And for those who do fall sick and end up in hospital? They get the same care just like any other covid patient - the prime minister made it clear that they will be treated the same as a citizen. The problem in the US is that there aren’t even enough ventilators going around because of the massive load for instance - Singapore meanwhile has plenty to spare since the hospitals never got anywhere close to overwhelmed. So people also likely don’t die from covid when they end up in hospital because there is more than enough resources available to keep them alive even if they end up in ICU. The standard quality of care can be comparable to that of the US - the difference lies in the workload. 

Basically, if you died of covid in Singapore, you likely already had way too many other health complications that covid was simply the final straw to tip you over the edge. It’s not like in most places where covid swept through the vulnerable demographics and easily claimed a bunch of lives. It is an extreme outlier case, and can justify the ridiculously low death rate.

[https://www.moh.gov.sg/](https://www.moh.gov.sg/)

Every day, there is a full report on every single community-detected case, the location, the date, the transmission method, etc. Names are of course omitted. You can see all this for yourself.

If you got COVID and your case was not reported, you would immediately know they hid your case and the alternative news media would very likely get your case known. This has not happened.

The same site also states the contact tracing and those who were possibly exposed.

If you ask why there are so few severe cases, it is mostly because of very early detection and treatment.

In the early stages of the pandemic, getting any two of the symptoms would require a doctor to summon a team to quarantine their patient and be sent for testing. If positive, immediately afterwards every single person they were in close contact with with would be tested, **multiple times**. You immediately get medication and treatment, and in most cases it is free. The odds of dying from COVID in Singapore are very small because the hospitals are not overloaded and every patient gets their own private ward, with round-the-clock observation.

If you are wondering if the government is doing this because it cares for its citizens, please don't kid yourself. They do this for our national reputation and to keep the business community confident. Transparency is the way to people's trust, not propaganda.",11/2/21,0,1.0

The only 'harmful treatment' we did early on was putting people on ventilators too quickly, and not turning them on their sides. This was specific to Coronavirus patients.

HCQ was never a harmful treatment.

11866,"European countries have by-and-large decided to try to manage the disease through restrictions and on and off lockdowns. Frequently specifiying dates for restrictions to end in advance, and having to amend those dates later. All this creates confusion, uncertainty, and eats away at trust in institutions, as well as wrecking the economy though constantly changing conditions, and restrictions on how service industries can operate.

Inevitably people see the restriction and lockdowns failing to control the virus, and they view the restrictions as not worthwhile, for the amount of pain they cause, and see the virus as less significant compared to the toll lockdowns take. 

But looking at New Zealand, my home country, we had clear messaging, rules, and when the government didn’t know something, they told us. They also provided job security, and good unemployment coverage, to keep people employed. Our borders were also closed (mostly), so that no new cases could enter.

For example: when we locked down we got 
- a minimum time-frame 
- a review point - at which we would know if the lockdown was working
- a timeframe that told us how long the lockdown would last if we were successful (due to everyone doing their bit)
-and a disclaimer that the end date was unknowable.

Everyday, there were broadcast briefings featuring the prime-minister, and Covid-response head. 

With this system we had the confidence no one would starve or be made homeless. We cooperated with the rules. And our strict lockdown eliminated transmission. Once the lockdown was over, we could essentially return to normal life. 

Now we, as a population, know the lockdowns work, are effective, and necessary. But any undue suffering was avoided by our government stopping the virus as quickly as possible, And waiting until it was completely under control, to ease up on restrictions. If another lockdown is required, we will do it again, but we know it’ll work, and our government is doing it for a good reason - even if it sucks.  

Our economy has faired better than many of those in Europe. And we’re back to normal life - unlike almost every other country in the world. [source](https://www.ft.com/content/b8c4ab58-99db-4af2-9449-5fd70a9235ce)

TL;DR: (many of) the governments of Europe pretended to know things they couldn’t, were internally inconsistent, failed to provide clear rules and protections for their people, and kept their borders open.

11941,"While your suggestions are nice... It has a rollover effect in other sectors that affects us more immediately - for example, are you ready to pay 50% more for your BTOs at a longer waiting period due to fair wages and humane working hours? Even at its ""exploitative"" stage now, we are already complaining it's too expensive and takes too long. Realistically speaking, do we even have Singaporeans who would want to take up these occupations considering the high risk, nature of work environment and skills required? We can't even get enough young hawkers to join, and now you want them to weld, screed, plaster, clear debris, scale scaffolds in an even more unbearable condition than hawker centres?  
  
A closer case study would be Australia, which has one of the highest construction costs in the world. On the other hand, their workers are mostly locals, very highly skilled, takes pride in work, and are extremely fairly paid.  
  
So I think the solution can't be something so simplistic. Foreign labour is inherently a neutral term. The exploitative nature can be eliminated if we make sure builders AND developers play a larger role in fair employment. Right now, it's just builders being held responsible and given demerit points for work safety issues - nothing about their housing condition, work environment, fair and prompt wages, fair and prompt medical attention. Moreover, developers are so insulated from all these that when a new project goes out for tender, demerit points of a builder is almost never a point of consideration.  
  
TL;DR: I'm not saying it's great now (in fact, I'm agreeing it's bad). But the solution can't be as simplistic as saying we must replace all foreign labour.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-apology_apology



Ifpology


Attorney and business ethics expert Lauren Bloom, author of The Art of the Apology, mentions the ""if apology"" as a favorite of politicians, with lines such as ""I apologize if I offended anyone"". Comedian Harry Shearer has coined the term Ifpology for its frequent appearances on ""The Apologies of the Week"" segment of Le Show.[12]

One of the first references was in The New York Times by Richard Mooney in his 1992 editorial notebook ""If This Sounds Slippery ... How to Apologize and Admit Nothing"". This was mainly in regard to Senator Bob Packwood: ""Only in the event that someone should choose to take offense, why then he's sorry"". Mooney goes on to cite Bill Clinton, who said of Mario Cuomo: ""If the remarks on the tape left anyone with the impression that I was disrespectful to either Governor Cuomo or Italian-Americans, then I deeply regret it."" A famous example involved racially insensitive remarks made by golfer Fuzzy Zoeller about Tiger Woods; Zoeller's comments and his half-hearted ifpology were news for days and resulted in his being dropped from a commercial tie-in with K-Mart.[13] According to John Kador in Effective Apology, ""Adding the word if or any other conditional modifier to an apology makes it a non-apology.""[14]

A 2014 ifpology was made by CNN's Don Lemon, who said, ""If my question to [Joan Tarshis] struck anyone as offensive, I am sorry, as that certainly was not my intention."" This was about a question during his interview with Joan Tarshis where he suggested biting a penis as a way to avoid being orally sexually assaulted.[15]

On September 16, 2015, Matt Damon made what Salon termed a ""non-apology"" apology when he said, ""I am sorry that [my comments] offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood.""[16] This was in reference to the backlash against Damon after he made comments about diversity to African American film producer Effie Brown on the September 13, 2015 debut of the HBO show Project Greenlight that were criticized as condescending.[17]",10/4/20,1,1.0
11970,"I like how you have twisted my own words from ""he admitted he fucked up"" to being an ""apology"". In no way shape or form, have I said he apologised. I said very clearly:

>At least they're willing to admit they fucked up.

11971,"This is quite clear to me now. Unable to put forward a reasonable argument, you are left with only the option of attempting to change the meaning of your own words. If all along, an apology is not the same as admitting he fucked up to you, how come you only say it now and choose to (poorly) debate my earlier points? 

 Its ironic that in your next statement you accuse me of shifting the goal posts when you JUST did. Doesn't get any more hypocritical than that

No need to embarass yourself any further, we're done here",10/4/20,0,0.0

Also when I gave a proper reasonable reply to your 3rd comment, you gave me a Wikipedia article to what a nonapology is.

> More than 3,000 migrant workers are tested daily

> With regard to the current rate of testing, more than 3,000 workers in the dormitories are tested daily, with a total of over 32,000 migrant workers tested thus far, according to a press release by the Ministry of Health (MOH).

> The press release highlighted that many of these workers showed no symptoms when they were tested, and that MOH plans to increase the rate of testing over time.

> Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that ""progress"" was being made:

> ""For the situation in the migrant worker dormitories, we are making progress in clearing, testing the workers. We are committed to testing all the workers to make sure that they are free from infection.""

> 20,000 workers to be ready for discharge by the end of May

> He added that the rationale for doing so was to ""ensure that we are thorough and systematic cleaning up, and clearing the dorms, and verifying the status of all the workers before they resume work.""

> Wong said that about 20,000 migrant workers will be ready for discharge by the end of May, given that many of them were recovering well.

> ""It's also very encouraging to see that many workers are recovering well, they’re well on the road to recovery and many are ready for discharge. So by the end of this month we will have 20,000 who are ready for discharge, and then likewise in June we expect to see many more recovering and well on their way to being discharged and being able to resume work as well.""

> How will testing be carried out?

> As for the manner in which testing will be carried out, Wong stated that this will be done through mass polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, as well as mass serological tests.

> With regard to PCR tests, MOH stated that this is the test which has been relied on thus far to diagnose if someone is infected with Covid-19 in Singapore, and is the globally accepted testing standard.

> As for serological tests, these are used to detect antibodies to Covid-19 from a blood sample, as a marker of past infection.

> MOH further added that people who have been infected by Covid-19 for more than 10 to 14 days ago will have a positive serology test.

> As such, serological testing will be applied to dormitories with a higher rate of infection.

> Every migrant worker will be subjected to at least one of the tests

> Should a migrant worker have a positive serological test, this will mean that he has been infected at least 10 to 14 days ago.

> It will also mean that he will no longer be infectious after a period of isolation.

> Meanwhile, migrant workers in dormitories with a lower rate of infection will be subjected to a PCR test.

> Workers who have a negative result from either of these two tests, however, will be isolated for 14 days before being subjected to another PCR test, to confirm that they test negative for Covid-19.

> The 14-day isolation is necessary as a test before the 14th day will not be able to exclude the possibility of the disease developing at a later point.

> Number of cases remain high, asymptomatic cases are also being tested

> With regard to the high number of cases reported, Wong stated that this was due to the high number of tests being carried out.

> However, the high numbers were not indicative of the rate of new infections in dormitories, as the number reporting acute respiratory symptoms had fallen.

> Wong said:

> ""If you look at the actual numbers of people who report sick with acute respiratory illness, that number has been coming down by the day, compared to the peak of the outbreak. But every day, in terms of the reported cases, you will still see high numbers. That's because we are continuing to test many workers, including the ones who are asymptomatic and well, because this is part of our process to clear the dormitories systematically.""

> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 120 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday (Apr 5), the biggest daily increase since the outbreak began here in January, bringing the national total to 1,309.

> Four of the new cases are imported and the remaining cases are locally transmitted.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> A ""significant number"" of the new cases are linked to existing clusters involving two workers' dormitories, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan, said the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force in a press conference.

> S11 Dormitory @ Punggol has 22 new cases and Westlite Toh Guan has 10 new cases.

> 2 DORMS GAZETTED AS ISOLATION AREAS

> Given these figures, the Ministry of Health has gazetted the two dormitories as isolation areas.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> A total of 19,800 workers across the two dormitories have been placed under quarantine and will have to stay in their rooms for the next 14 days.

> Meals will be provided for the workers, as well as healthcare supplies including masks, thermometers and hand sanitiser, said the task force.

> Further safe distancing measures will also be implemented at all other worker dormitories, including staggering of meal times and minimising the inter-mingling of workers.

> However it should be made clear that foreign workers do not inherently have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.

> ""It's not an issue of targeting a particular group, they are not of higher risk,"" said Mr Wong.

> ""The issue we have here is foreign worker dorms have now emerged as a cluster of infection, a new vector for transmission, despite the precautions we have taken.""

> Meanwhile the authorities are readying the Singapore Expo as a community care facility, according to Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.

> ""The Singapore Expo is being prepared as the next community care facility,"" he told reporters.

> These facilities are meant for housing patients who have more or less recovered but who could still be infectious, he added.

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had on Friday announced heightened safe distancing measures to act as a “circuit breaker” to curb the spread of COVID-19.

> Under the enhanced measures which will kick in next week, schools and workplaces – except those running essential services – will be closed for nearly a month until May 4. Food establishments will stay open only for takeaways or delivery.

> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Sunday a third round of support measures will be rolled out to help businesses and households tide through these unprecedented “circuit breaker” measures.

> The “Solidarity Budget” will be announced when Parliament sits on Monday and comes less than two weeks after Mr Heng unveiled a record-breaking S$48 billion supplementary Budget.

> Since July 1, it has been a policy for all patients aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with ARI to be offered the swab test for the virus when they first see a doctor, as part of efforts to support more active case-finding in the community.

> Responding to queries from The Straits Times, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that patients who decline the swab test are given a five-day medical certificate, during which they are legally required to stay at home.

> If a doctor assesses that a patient meets the suspect case definition of Covid-19, or has prolonged ARI at the end of the five-day period, the patient is legally required to go for a swab test.

> Authorities are still completing serology tests for about 65,000 workers living in dormitories who have not taken them before.

> While most countries only do serology testing on a sampling basis to estimate the prevalence of infections in a population, Singapore is conducting them on all the migrant workers living in the dormitories.

> As some jobs “may never return”, Mr Heng urged mid-career professionals to consider changing industry and taking pay cuts to put themselves “in a better footing” after the crisis.

> The COVID-19 pandemic has dragged Singapore’s economy into its most severe downturn since independence, as the Ministry of Manpower recorded 11,350 retrenchments in the first half of the year.

> According to the ministry, this is higher than the 10,120 recorded during the SARS period, but still lower than other recessionary peaks.

> On Thursday, the Transport Ministry also announced that Singapore and Hong Kong have reached an in-principle agreement to establish a bilateral air travel bubble.

> This means that those travelling under the bubble will have no restrictions on their travel purpose and will not need to have a controlled itinerary. Travellers will also not be subject to quarantine or stay-home notice requirements.​​​​​​​

> However, travellers will need to test negative on mutually recognised COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. They will also be required to go on flights dedicated for those travelling under the bubble.

12169,"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 399 new cases; 69 more dormitories cleared

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily reported 399 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Tuesday (21 July) noon, taking the total to 48,434.

> Of the new cases, nine – including one Singapore resident – are classified as cases in the community, while three are imported cases who had been placed on stay home notice upon their arrival here.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are nine cases in the community, of whom one is a Singaporean and eight are work-pass holders,” said the MOH.

> “In addition, there are three imported cases who had been isolated or placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.

> “The higher number of cases today is mainly due to a batch of test results from the previous day reported to MOH after the 12pm cut-off for yesterday’s reporting.”

> More details will be provided later tonight, it added.

> Meanwhile, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a media release on Tuesday that 69 more dormitories have been cleared of COVID-19. These comprise three purpose-built dormitories (PBD), 59 factory-converted dormitories and seven construction temporary quarters.

> In addition, 41 blocks for recovered workers (BRWs) in 11 PBDs have been cleared. The 41 BRWs cleared include the remaining blocks in Tampines Dormitory, Cochrane Lodge 1, Cochrane Lodge 2, Changi Lodge 2 and Sungei Tengah Lodge.

> This takes the total number to 891 dormitories and 56 BRWs in 17 PBDs cleared of COVID-19. In particular, Sungei Tengah Lodge is the largest PBD with around 16,000 workers, all of whom can immediately return to work if their employers have obtained approval from their sector agencies to restart operations.

> As of Monday, about 247,000 workers have either recovered, or have been tested to be free from the virus. Some of the workers are pending movement to appropriate accommodations before they can resume work. Others can return to work once dormitory operators, employers and workers have made the necessary preparations to minimise the risk of new infections as the workers go to work on a daily basis.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 285 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Monday, 44,371 cases – some 92 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while none are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Some 3,454 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 27 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 15 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 13 July, the ministry has conducted 1,009,532 swab tests, of which 519,911 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 177,100 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 91,200 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

Although it might be somewhat indicative of how Singapore is doing (controlling the spread of COVID-19), this number might also be influenced by many other factors, such as how testing is conducted.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> These include Quick Build Dormitories (QBDs) that can be constructed “quite quickly” in a modular form with a low density. These QBDs can last for about two to three years and can house about 25,000 people in total.

> Eight sites have been earmarked for new QBDs by the end of 2020, including in Kranji, Tuas, Admiralty, Choa Chu Kang and Tampines.

> 

> Unused state properties, including former schools and vacant factories, will be fitted out temporarily to house about 25,000 workers, and the authorities are talking to contractors to build more construction temporary quarters, which are makeshift dormitories that keep the workers near their worksite.

> 

> Some of the state properties that will be refurbished include the former Bedok North Secondary School building, the former Anderson Junior College Hostel and tents at the National Service Resort and country club in Kranji.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> As part of longer-term plans, the Government is planning to build new purpose-built dormitories (PBDs) over the next few years that can house up to 100,000 workers. These dormitories, which will have amenities such as minimarts and barber services, will replace the temporary accommodations built this year.

> 

> About 11 PBDs will be ready in the next ""one to two years"", the media release said. Workers living in the PBDs will also have ready access to medical care and support.

> 

> ""With these additional PBDs in place, we will also have the capacity to decant

> workers from the existing dormitories, and to undertake major upgrading to these

> dormitories to ensure that they meet the new standards,"" the ministries said.

> Besides expanding housing availability for foreign workers, government agencies are developing a set of specifications for these new dormitories, the ministries added.

> 

> These specifications will look into the design, facilities, management and regulation of these dormitories, and will factor in social interaction and disease response needs.

> 

> “In land scarce Singapore, dormitories are a practical approach to housing our migrant workers,” the media release said.

> 

> “We aim to make dormitory living and design more resilient to public health risks including pandemics, with improved living standards that are benchmarked both domestically and internationally.

> 

> “We will take on board lessons learnt from the current COVID pandemic, and also seek feedback from relevant stakeholders.”

> 

> Some of the present set of standards that will be improved as part of a pilot include increasing the living space per resident from a minimum of 4.5 sqm per resident, including shared facilities, to at least 6 sqm, not including shared facilities.

> 

> There will also be a maximum occupancy rate of up to 10 beds per room. Currently, there are no limits - the ministries noted that in practice, there are about 12-16 beds in each room.

> 

> The new set of requirements will see only single-deck beds being used, with 1m spacing between the beds.

> More toilets and bathrooms will also be built so that there is at least one bathroom, sink and toilet for every five beds, instead of every 15 beds.

> 

> The Government is also studying the possibility of developing the new PBDs on a different model compared to the present system, where currently land is released for the commercial operators to bid, build or operate.

> 

> ""While the physical standards are being improved, it is equally important to uplift the capabilities of dormitory operators and make adjustments to the daily living habits of the dormitory residents,"" the ministries said.

> ""Everyone must do their part to minimise the risk of infection clusters. The pilot will therefore also seek to instil a new level of discipline on safe living within dormitories.""

> The ministries noted that cost will go up alongside these new housing arrangements, “but they will keep the workers safe and allow Singaporeans to continue benefiting from their contributions"".

> 

> The media release also said that some of the dormitories will be located closer to residential areas given the country’s land constraints.

> ""Singaporeans must therefore do our part too. We must reject the Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) mindset and instead appreciate these workers who keep Singapore going,"" the ministries said.

I agree that certain field like the construction field require more manual labour etc and yes we definitely need foreign workers to contribute to our economy. However, do we need such a huge amount of them ? Or are they here because corporations want them here to maximise their profits ?  When we were in the early 2000s they were here mainly for construction and S&CC services. However, more and more came to roles such as building maintenance and marine services. I believe some Singaporeans would be willing to take on such roles if not for the otherwise poor salary given as corporations wants to keep their expenses low to maximise profits and the easier option is to choose the foreign worker option.

In the view of improving living conditions, it might be necessary to build more dormitories but they could still be built at areas where the population doesn’t resides. If we have to settle them at offshore facilities or floating dormitories then so be it. Also, cleanliness of shared areas could be enforced. I wouldn’t dare to make the assumption that their living spaces is same as what the SAF provides but I would dare to say that it is at least comparable. Why are shared areas and living spaces in bunks way better than what the FWs are living in ? I think it boils down to discipline. Some SAF bunks have 8 double decker beds in a single room and yet the area is still clean af. The question is, are they committed to clean up after their own? It doesn’t matter how much space we give them at the end of the day. If they don’t bother to give a fuck about their own area, no one can help them isn’t it ?",2/6/20,0,1.0

There is no way Singaporeans would want to do the job that the FW who lives in dorms do (construction, grass cutting, road resurfacing 6 times a week etc etc)

For your second point, yes I believe that culture and mindset does play a part in the current condition of the dorms. However, there is also so much ""trash"" (for a lack of better word ) a person can create. By reducing the number of people, it brings down the total amount of ""trash"", making it easier to clean up (or cleaners to clean if they contracted any).

Society is a hot mess of discombobulating, incoherent and inconsistent ideas. And the bottom line is everyone has a voice, everyone is able to influence the outcome. It's simultaneously empowering and discouraging. 

Back in 2011, the influx of foreign labour was the, if not one of the largest, election issue. It cost the PAP a talented Foreign Minister (oh - and a GRC. Whatever). Since 2011 you can track a very clear and blunt shift in policy, focused on keeping FWs away from the public eye. The Little India Riots didn't help, and the public furor only cemented the policy turn as being the right thing to do (if only to avoid public outrage). 

Now, one can persist in laying that at the feet of the PAP, saying that's the PAP abdicating moral responsibility, etc. But another can also make the argument that the PAP was simply following their democratic mandate and listening to the people. *I find it very hard to accept any denial that the voters back in 2011 had a hand in creating the standard of living that FWs experience now*.  

Consequently, while I applauded the outpouring of goodwill to the FWs in the Covid saga, the inevitable pushback was inevitable. Because society is a hot mess. 

My response above was to the comment that we can simply ignore these people, that their views are inconsequential because they're ""wrong"". No. We can't. That's not how democracy works. They will have their voice. There will be an opposition party who will, under the temptation of quick and easy votes, champion their cause. And if none of the existing opposition parties are stupid enough to take up that flag, the likelihood of them creating their own opposition party to raise that voice only increases.

12230,"> # Singapore reports a record 287 new COVID-19 cases with more than half linked to dormitory cluster

> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 287 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday (Apr 9), the largest daily increase so far and more than double yesterday's highest record, the multi-ministry task force dealing with the coronavirus said during a press conference on Thursday (Apr 9).

> This brings the national tally to 1,910.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Of the new cases, 219 are linked to existing clusters, with at least 160 cases linked to the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol.

> A total of 19 cases are linked to previous cases, with 46 unlinked cases, the task force said. Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said.

> 

> Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his death.

>

> The task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II and Toh Guan Dormitory.

> Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.

> ""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.

> ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.

> 

> Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added.

> Singapore has seen a rise of COVID-19 cases at foreign worker domitories recently.

> Sungei Tengah Lodge became the fourth foreign worker dormitory to become an isolation area from midnight on Thursday, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.

> The other three dormitores that have been gazetted as isolation areas are: S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan Dormitory.

> On Thursday, the Land Transport Authority announced additional measures to ensure social distancing on public transport networks to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.

> This includes thermal scanners at select MRT stations and safe distancing stickers on buses, trains, train stations, bus interchanges and bus stops.

> This came after heightened safe distancing measures kicked in on Tuesday as part of a ""circuit breaker"" period until May 4 to stem the spread of COVID-19.

> About 10,000 written advisories were issued on the first two days of the circuit breaker for breaches, including individuals who gathered in public and those who failed to adhere to safe distancing rules.

> People who repeatedly flout the stricter safe-distancing measures will face a fine or be charged in court, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli wrote on Facebook on Thursday.

> First-time offenders will get a stern written warning. Anyone who commits a second offence will be fined S$300, while a third offence will lead to the person being charged in court.

> SINGAPORE - Foreign workers staying in dormitories make up 558 of the 623 new Covid-19 cases on Friday (April 16), the Ministry of Health said in its second update on infection numbers of the day.

> The other patients are 27 community cases and 37 work permit holders who did not stay in dormitories. There is also one imported case. This brings Singapore's total count to 5,050 coronavirus cases.

> MOH announced four new virus clusters as well.

> S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Singapore's largest cluster, added another 144 patients and is now linked to more than 1,000 cases.

> MOH said that it was also concerned that it is increasingly difficult to link the new cases and identify the source of infection.

> The ministry said the number of unlinked cases in the community has increased slightly, from an average of 19 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 22 per day in the past week.

> ""We have an ongoing surveillance programme, where a small sample of patients at our primary care facilities are tested for Covid-19 infections,"" said MOH.

> ""We have picked up some cases through these tests, which is an indication of undetected cases in the community.""

> Earlier in the day, MOH released preliminary figures ahead of its usual evening announcement. It is not clear why it decided to do so but there were messages circulating earlier that Singapore had logged the biggest single-day spike of 1,146 on some online platforms.

12270,"Yes, this part is super interesting especially as the Situation Report is now breaking the prevalence down by these groups too.

So as far as I can work out they are separating work permit holders out and then sub-dividing that into dorm / non-dorm.

Then others count in the community cases. What they don't really explain is what these groups include. So lets take the Situation Report population at risk numbers, Dorms - 323,000 / Non-dorm 664,000 = total 987,000

That number nicely matches up with the June 2019 numbers here: https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers Work permit total = 981,000

The interesting thing though is that those numbers include FDW permits which would seem to be the definition of residents in the 'community'.

So as far as I can work out community cases include citizens, PRs and Pass Holders (EP/SPass/PEP/Student Dependents Social etc)

Work Permits group contains 323,000 in dorms, 255,800 FDWs and then another block of 408,200 Work permit holders that do not live in dorms. 

So the only thing that really ties this remaining group together is that according to work permit rules it's the employer that is responsible for providing housing for these workers (and in a way I guess that's technically the case with FDWs).

So a theory for this is that there's a fairly fluid definition of what is and what isn't a Dormitory and sure enough the MOM helps us out again here: https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing

So maybe the missing piece of the puzzle here is the large block of construction workers who are allowed to be housed in temporary quarters and these are not being counted as 'dormitories' 

If this is the case (and the numbers seem to tally somewhat) then the only problem I can see is that the 255,000 FDWs being included in this group are reducing the prevalence in the non-dorm group.",18/4/20,0,1.0

12293,Is there a place where you can get a breakdown on the testing by different groups. The one I'm aware of states overall tests done across everyone.,25/5/20,0,0.0
12294,"I'm thinking the fact that there are so many of them with COVID makes it impossible for Singapore to re-open. That is the reason why they extended this lockdown, without foreign workers Singapore can't function as they normally do. Luckily most cases are mild, so it proves that young people aren't as vulnerable to the disease.",25/5/20,0,0.0
12295,Frankly I don't see how Singapore can open up next week without some severe restrictions on movement and interactions with our FW. We are still testing positives in the hundreds each day in that segment.,25/5/20,0,1.0
12296,If all FWs lived in 1 big dorm than yes. Or you can look at that figure as an upper bound. However the 300k workers are spread across numerous dorms. There will be plenty of dorms which end up being completely spared and have no cases. These will the tested later in the process since they are lower priority for the 100% testing. Once we get there it should be expected that the overall FW infection rate decreases.,25/5/20,1,1.0
12297,"that's not really true. it may affect the functioning of certain sectors (e.g. less construction projects can continue), but as long as community numbers are low it wouldn't have a massive impact on our daily lives.",25/5/20,0,1.0
12298,"Sadly most singaporeans dont care, and govt probs wouldnt be able to close even if they wanted to due to the negative feedback theyd get.",25/5/20,0,0.0
12299,"most FW dorms are isolated now - if you read the news, we can't test all of them fast enough (which is why the numbers are still high - we're just discovering existing cases), so they are mostly confined to their dorms, with only an allocated time for them to come out and exercise or play sports in their recreational area.",25/5/20,0,1.0
12300,"Am doing reservice with one of the dorm FAST teams. Many of the supposedly non-essential workers here are involved in logistics, building maintenance, and transport (MRT). The workers who installed solar panels on my house last year are Indians who stay in dorms. So yeah, they are very much in the ""community"" if CB is lifted.",25/5/20,0,1.0

12302,Isn’t this exactly what the government did?,23/5/20,0,0.0
12303,I agree with you. I also believe the govt will build more purpose built dormitories but have less workers per apartment.,23/5/20,0,0.0
12304,"Dormitory operators didn't do anything wrong. They operated within the confines of a structure the Singapore GOVERNMENT created. 

Singapore created this tri-furcated labor market with SG/expats, WP/S, then MW and FDW essentially indentured servants. 

Singapore is not Taiwan or HK. Singapore is Dubai or Qatar. 

End reliance on cheap foreign labor, or deal with it humanely. Until you're ready to pay for the increased cost of having SG citizens be builders, you have no choice.",23/5/20,0,0.0
12305,"these dorms are like prisons...minus the prison cells...you cant prevent these guys from mingling beyond a certain point.

you cant stop them from visiting little india too, beyond a certain point.

its very tricky to address this without attracting accusations of human cruelty.

Thats why the top guys are paid the big bucks...to figure this out so theres no recurrence when the workers get back into society. Else its back to square one.",23/5/20,0,1.0
