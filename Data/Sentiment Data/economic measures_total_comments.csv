35,"Government support will be increasingly focused on helping firms transform and seize opportunities in new markets, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said yesterday. He told an audience at Enterprise Singapore's (ESG) annual review that while the Government has responded swiftly and decisively to support firms and workers amid the pandemic, Singapore's resources are ultimately finite and must be used judiciously. ""This means that while we will continue to support our businesses, we will not be able to do so indiscriminately,"" he said. ""The weight of our efforts going forward must increasingly be targeted and shift towards helping our enterprises seize new opportunities in new markets, through new products and services. ""It is not sufficient to play defensive by trying to preserve existing enterprises and current jobs. It is even more important for us to create new opportunities for enterprises and job opportunities for our workers."" Sectors that continue to do well include those in infocommunications, precision manufacturing and biomedical. But others such as mass market tourism and aviation are still facing challenges and have to be helped to pivot to new areas, he said. The Government also wants to spur innovation among local firms regardless of size, added Mr Chan. This will be done through supporting the creation of new innovative start-ups, encouraging more private sector investment in deep-tech start-ups, boosting apprenticeship initiatives and tapping key global innovation nodes. There is also much potential for firms in the green economy. ""We will support them in areas including developing sustainability-related standards such as carbon verification, growing capabilities in sustainability and accessing new business opportunities in this space,"" said Mr Chan. ESG chairman Peter Ong agreed, and said: ""In the midst of current volatilities, enterprises will need to be highly agile to pivot as the situation affords. We will need to pick out the pockets of growth whenever and wherever we find them. ""Enterprises will need to harness innovation to meet new needs, and compete beyond pricing. ""We encourage them to develop new business models and intellectual property, or innovative products and solutions."" Besides innovation, going international is also important despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus, Mr Chan said, noting: ""Covid-19 has also emphasised the limitations of Singapore's small domestic market and the need to continue to push ahead with our internationalisation efforts. ""While internationalisation activities slowed in 2020, we maintained a positive mo-mentum."" To this end, Singapore must also build its own strong core of local firms that can compete globally in niche areas, while companies can also tap international agreements to access new markets. Mr Ong added that companies need to prepare themselves so they can quickly capture demand, with markets such as China and South-east Asia presenting new opportunities. ""While travel restrictions remain, overseas expansion will always remain a key growth driver."" Companies can go global by building capabilities, such as by increasing brand awareness through virtual platforms, he said. https://www.straitstimes.com/busines...irms-transform",2/6/21,0,1.0

Can choose from Klook, Changi Recommends, trips.com etc. The list of so-called approved agents are in the link. If your total amount for X number of people for the activity is say $72, just redeem $70. A code will be provided. Just key in the code when making payment. Since it is $72, you will have to pay $2.

624,"An $870 million support package for the hard-hit aviation sector will increase wage subsidies to 50 per cent for local workers for another six months,  the Ministry of Transport (MOT) said on Wednesday (Feb 17). The Jobs Support Scheme - which would be extended, as announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in his Budget speech on Tuesday - provides firms in the sector with wage support of 30 per cent from April to June, and 10 per cent from July to September. The Aviation Workforce Retention Grant, which will cost $330 million, will enhance that to 50 per cent of wages paid to Singaporeans and permanent residents from April to September, said MOT. This means that eligible firms will receive an additional 20 per cent of wages paid to each local employee from April to June, and an additional 40 per cent from July to September. The wage subsidy is subject to a cap of up to $4,600 of gross monthly wages. Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung noted that aviation has been one of the hardest-hit sectors during the pandemic, ""if not the hardest hit"", as Changi Airport and its stakeholders lost 97.5 per cent of its customers. As at end-January this year, total passenger movements in Changi were only about 2 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels. ""Yet for a city-state like Singapore, the air hub is essential to connect us with the rest of the world and continues to be our lifeblood,"" said Mr Ong. ""This support will help Changi tide through the crisis, while we explore ways to reopen borders safely."" In his Budget speech, Mr Heng emphasised the need to position the aviation sector for recovery as part of efforts to deepen Singapore's position as a global-Asia node. The remaining $540 million under the OneAviation Support Package will go to cost relief, said MOT. This includes extending existing rebates on fees and charges at Changi and Seletar airports for another year. The rebate on fees payable by pilots, air traffic controllers and aircraft maintenance engineers will also be extended for another year. ""The package will enable aviation companies to preserve core capabilities and tide over the crisis, and preserve Singapore's position as an aviation hub post-Covid-19,"" said MOT. The funding for the sector comes under the $11 billion Covid-19 Resilience Package announced in the Budget speech. MOT said that many aviation companies around the world had reduced their headcounts over the past year, pointing out that those in Singapore did likewise in ""a very judicious manner, mostly affecting foreign manpower"". ""We must avoid further reductions to the aviation workforce so that companies will not lose their core local capabilities, which have taken many years to build up. If the sector weakens its capabilities, this will hamper its ability to recover,"" added the ministry. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-september-mot",17/2/21,0,1.0

This includes extending existing rebates on fees and charges at Changi and Seletar airports for another year. The rebate on fees payable by pilots, air traffic controllers and aircraft maintenance engineers will also be extended for another year. ""The package will enable aviation companies to preserve core capabilities and tide over the crisis, and preserve Singapore's position as an aviation hub post-Covid-19,"" said MOT. The funding for the sector comes under the $11 billion Covid-19 Resilience Package announced in the Budget speech. MOT said that many aviation companies around the world had reduced their headcounts over the past year, pointing out that those in Singapore did likewise in ""a very judicious manner, mostly affecting foreign manpower"". ""We must avoid further reductions to the aviation workforce so that companies will not lose their core local capabilities, which have taken many years to build up. If the sector weakens its capabilities, this will hamper its ability to recover,"" added the ministry. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-september-mot No use spending so much money on them.

690,"UPDATED 4 SEC AGO SINGAPORE - A $900 million Household Support package will be introduced for families amid the uncertain economic situation in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced on Tuesday (Feb 16). The package includes vouchers that each household can use to defray expenses and support local businesses, as well as service and conservancy Charges (S&CC) rebates and goods and services tax (GST) vouchers. About 1.3 million households will receive $100 Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers that can be used at participating heartland shops and hawker centres . More details on this will be announced by the CDCs later. To fund this, an additional grant of $150 million will be provided to the CDCs. Mr Heng said the move is not only to thank all Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity but to continue supporting heartland businesses and hawkers. ""Singaporeans' sense of unity and discipline in observing the precautionary measures such as safe distancing and mask wearing has enabled our progress so far in combating the pandemic. The discipline and understanding of our local merchants and hawkers have also been important. However, they have been quite affected by the safety measures, especially during the circuit breaker,"" he noted. Eligible Singaporean households in Housing Board flats will also receive rebates to offset between 1.5 and 3.5 months of S&CC charges over the year, said Mr Heng. About 950,000 Singaporean households will be able to receive these rebates over four quarters - in April, July, October and January next year (2022). About 1.4 million lower-income Singaporeans will also get an additional GST Voucher-Cash Special Payment of $200 in June, on top of the regular GST Voucher cash payout. About 950,000 households will also get additional utilities rebates of between $120 and $200 under the GST Voucher-U-Save Special Payment that will be credited in April and July. This means they will receive 1.5 times their usual annual rebate. Singaporean children below the age of 21 will also get a $200 top-up to their Child Development Account, Edusave account, or Post-Secondary Education Account which can help fund education-related expenses. This will benefit about 780,000 children. Mr Heng said the package comes on top of immediate relief and support measures introduced for families and workers over five Budgets in 2020, including the Solidarity Payment, Covid-19 Support Grant, Temporary Relief Fund and grocery vouchers for lower-income groups. ""This Household Support Package provides some support to all families, with lower- to middle-income families receiving more,"" he said. Mr Heng also said Singaporeans have supported one another amid the pandemic, and stayed united in the face of adversity. ""Social cohesion does not happen naturally. Even before Covid-19, many societies were facing sharp divisions due to widening inequalities, increasing diversity of interests and voices, and growing distrust. The pandemic has deepened the cracks in many societies,"" said Mr Heng, adding that Singapore is not immune to these challenges. ""We must continue to strengthen our social fabric, and reject forces of division and discord.""",16/2/21,0,1.0

773,"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...on-outlook-and SINGAPORE - Work to prepare for next year's government Budget has begun, with Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and officials from several agencies, as well as GIC and Temasek, briefing President Halimah Yacob and the Council of Presidential Advisers on Monday (Nov 30). The Budget is traditionally presented in Parliament for debate in February, but preparation and consultation usually begin several months beforehand. In a Facebook post, Madam Halimah noted that Monday's discussions centred on Covid-19 and its impact. Apart from the near-term uncertainties brought on by the pandemic, she noted that a key question is whether Covid-19 has fundamentally changed the investment landscape. Other key issues that need to be studied are the structural shifts that Covid-19 has caused to the macroeconomic environment, and how these factors would impact Singapore's long-term investment returns. ""We need a good handle on these issues, as we are effectively spending from our reserves based on these assumptions,"" she said. ""These are tough questions that we need to grapple with. There are no easy answers, but it is my responsibility as custodian of Singapore's past reserves to raise them for discussion,"" added the president. ""I am glad that the Government has also been thinking hard about these same issues."" President Halimah was briefed by Mr Heng, as well as officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment company Temasek on their long-term macroeconomic outlook and the Government's proposed expected long-term real rates of return. The investment entities had earlier discussed these forward projections of the returns with their respective boards, and MOF has reviewed these projections, said Madam Halimah. ""With my concurrence, Government can later apply these rates to relevant assets to derive the Net Investment Return Contribution (NIRC) for use in Budget 2021,"" she added. The net investment returns framework allows the Government to spend up to 50 per cent of the expected long-term investment returns generated by Temasek, GIC and MAS - the three entities tasked to manage Singapore\x92s reserves. The NIRC is the top contributor to the government coffers. Mr Heng told Parliament in October that the design of the framework allows for a stable, sustainable source of income for the Budget, smoothed out over market cycles.",12/1/20,0,1.0

801,"As Singapore heads into the new year with a record Budget deficit, the Government will have to be prudent in spending and make every dollar count, even as it saves jobs and keeps the economy afloat. This was Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and National Development Indranee Rajah's assessment of the challenges planners face as they prepare next year's Budget. This year, close to $100 billion was dedicated to Covid-19 support measures over four Budgets - drawing up to $52 billion from the reserves, and leaving a hole of around $74 billion in the state coffers. But going forward, the focus must now be on how to emerge stronger from Covid-19 despite limited resources, said Ms Indranee on Wednesday (Dec 2). She said the Government's top priority is to get out of the crisis and keep everyone safe and healthy. But she noted that the fiscal road ahead will be a tough one. ""In previous years when we might have had budget surpluses, you could think in terms of goodies. ""But next year... it's more in terms of: 'With the resources that we have, how do we use them in the most careful and prudent way such that we get the most out of limited resources?'"" She was addressing 150 Singaporeans at a virtual Singapore Together Emerging Stronger Conversation (ESC) to seek their views and suggestions on next year's Budget. The two-hour session, organised by government feedback unit Reach and the Ministry of Finance, was co-hosted by Reach chairman and Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of National Development Tan Kiat How. Participants discussed how to manage the trade-off between strengthening the economy while keeping the public safe, and how to encourage social responsibility and ensure greater digital inclusion, among other issues. Ms Indranee told reporters a balanced Budget next year will be ""quite hard"" - echoing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's remarks last month that Singapore is unlikely to see a Budget surplus in 2021 given the ongoing economic crisis. She said the Government will have to be prudent, spend where necessary, and ensure good returns on the money that is put in. ""We have to make every dollar count and stretch the dollar."" But while cost management is important, she added that one must also look at the growth side of the equation and find revenue which comes from that growth. ""Growth will only come when you have the economic activity, and at the same time, we have got to balance this with the health and safety part of it,"" she said. This is why the Emerging Stronger Taskforce was formed to chart strategies for Singapore's post-pandemic recovery, she said. Under the task force are seven Alliances for Action (AfAs) - industry-led coalitions tasked to devise ideas and generate jobs in areas such as sustainability, robotics and education technology. Some growth areas she observed are logistics, mergers and acquisitions, and sustainability. In the afternoon, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat met business leaders to discuss how the Government can partner businesses to emerge stronger. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-2021-indranee",12/3/20,0,1.0
802,"https://theindependent.sg/dpm-heng-i...r-budget-2021/ Singapore \x97 The people have been invited to share ideas for Budget 2021 by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat. He made the call on Wednesday (Dec 2) when he announced that he and his team had started work on it. This year was challenging for many nations because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which worsened the already grim economic outlook. Mr Heng delivered four Budgets to help Singaporeans cope with the health and financial crises in as many months. He presented the Unity Budget on Feb 18, the Resilience Budget on March 26, the Solidarity Budget on April 6 and the Fortitude Budget on May 26. Altogether, the Covid-19 support measures cost the Government S$93 billion. Of this sum, S$52 billion comes from past reserves. Mr Heng, looking back at the events of the year, exclaimed on Facebook on Wednesday: \x93Never in my life would I have imagined that I would have to present four Budgets in one year!\x94 He added that he had hosted a virtual gathering to thank his Ministry of Finance (MOF) Budget team for their hard work on the Budgets unveiled over the year. Highlighting the support his team gave him, he wrote: \x93They worked on the details of economic and social programmes to support our workers, families and businesses in Singapore in a most challenging year. \x93They have all been working non-stop since the beginning of this year, with the work becoming even heavier and more intense as the global Covid-19 pandemic situation worsened and disrupted life and businesses. My special thanks to my MOF team, and to all staff in our public agencies and partners who have been working so closely with us!\x94 Mr Heng, who added that he was working with fellow ministers Lawrence Wong and Indranee Rajah on the coming Budget, called on Singaporeans to join the effort and share their feedback with his Budget 2021 team. He said: \x93Everyone can play a role \x97 please join us in the Budget 2021 journey by sharing your ideas. The Budget reflects our collective needs and aspirations as a society, and charts our direction as a nation. \x93My team and I value your views and suggestions, so that we can shape Budget 2021 to support our people and businesses, and your hopes and wishes for Singapore. I look forward to everyone\x92s active participation, as part of our #SingaporeTogether movement.\x94 Those who wish to provide input for Budget 2021 may do so here.",12/4/20,0,1.0

There will be live television and radio coverage of the Budget statement, and a live webcast of the delivery will be available on the Singapore Budget website, said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in a press release on Thursday (Dec 31). The full Budget Statement will be published on the Singapore Budget website after delivery, and real-time updates of key Budget announcements can be found on MOF's Facebook page and Twitter account. ""We thank Singaporeans for providing their views, whether online through REACH\x92s Budget 2021 microsite, or in person at settings such as REACH\x92s Listening Points,"" said MOF. Singaporeans can continue to provide their views until Jan 8 next year via the website. MOF said that it is also partnering the People\x92s Association (PA) and its grassroots organisations in their virtual Ask Kopi Kakis #ShareYourViews initiative to seek public views and suggestions. Details of the virtual Ask Kopi Kakis #ShareYourViews engagement platforms can be found online. ""We continue to encourage Singaporeans to share their views and suggestions on issues relevant to Budget 2021,"" said MOF. Mr Heng said in a Facebook post on Thursday that preparations for Budget 2021 is ""well under way"". He added that even though the COVID-19 pandemic has been contained locally and vaccination is ongoing, the overall outlook remains ""highly uncertain""and will be for some time to come. ""Since several years ago, it is almost a 'tradition' to announce the date of the annual Budget around the turn of the year. This year is no different. ""But this year has been far from traditional. Instead of an annual Budget, we had four Budgets and two Ministerial Statements. To support our workers, companies and households through COVID-19, we introduced several rounds of support measures,"" he added. If the trajectory of economic recovery is on track, Mr Heng said Singapore will have a more ""traditional\x94 Budget year.

903,"https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/bu...ancial-support Next month's Budget is expected to target sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, but spending overall will be reined in after extensive support measures were rolled out last year. Mr Liang Eng Hwa, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance, Trade and Industry, told a pre-Budget round table yesterday: ""I'm a bit more realistic about what to expect for the upcoming Budget because there are only so much financial resources you can use to help."" The Government set aside a $100 billion war chest to tackle the pandemic last year, with most of the funds used to support businesses and save jobs. ""I expect this Budget to be a lot more targeted and differentiated than before, so we really channel and allocate funds to those businesses that need help, grow the economy and create jobs,"" said Mr Liang during the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants round table. ""We'll still have to help, but the numbers will taper off along the way."" Trade association and industry experts said at the virtual event that more can be done to help businesses access existing grants as applications can be cumbersome. Mr Ang Yuit, vice-president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said rental relief measures were a lifeline for firms but took a long time to reach small and medium-sized enterprises. Firms have also said they face a ""laborious and bureaucratic"" process to get support to reskill workers, he said, adding: ""We are concerned that with a slowness in getting that into effect, we'll have people that have to be let go because their skills don't match."" However, less government assistance could actually be a good thing, noted Singapore Retailers Association executive director Rose Tong. She said grants could distract companies from their business objectives as they tailor their goals to meet qualifying criteria: ""This could stifle their authentic growth. Some retailers have also gotten addicted to grants and subsidies such that they may be unwilling to embark on a much-needed transformation initiative should there not be a grant available.""",15/1/21,1,1.0

949,"https://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/more...singapore-kpmg File photo of people taking picture with Merlion Additional grants, incentives, and tax rebates in the 2021 budget will help Singapore become a smart nation and a world-leading supply chain hub whilst improving food security and promoting business transformation, according to KPMG's Budget 2021 proposal. In the proposal, KPMG stressed the importance of 5G in Singapore's transformation into a smart nation. According to KPMG's partner and head of tax Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, 5G will be a key driver for data consumption and will create demand for innovation in the development of technological platforms. Sanganeria said there is a need for more government support to fast-track 5G development and adoption on a larger scale. KPMG has proposed a 5G technology and innovation fund that provides 50% of expenditure for prototyping and innovation of 5G enabled solutions and to extend the Market Readiness Assistance grant to provide funding for enterprises to explore solutions in 5G-ready markets. Aside from 5G, KPMG said the 2021 budget should also include a Digital Transformation Package that will consist of tax incentives to catalyse business transformation by supporting significant capital outlay and the workforce. Granting a 300% enhanced tax deductions for costs incurred by Singapore companies for the acquisition of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or upgrading of existing systems as well as expanding section 19B of the tax provision to allow writing down allowances on costs incurred on a broader range of intangible assets will help prevent supply chain disruption. The talent landscape should also focus on these technologies by introducing cloud technologies, AI, data analytics, robotics, and 5G at the secondary education level as well as re-skilling/up-skilling workforce in these technologies. Special tax rebates for local professionals in qualifying industries critical to Singapore's economy and ecosystem will also help in the transformation to a smart city. Job and food security The pandemic also showed several weaknesses in food supply chains. KPMG's proposal will encourage urban farming using existing real estate assets whilst maximising current land usage for vertical farming that will create more sustainable sources of protein. Sanganeria said an enhanced R&D Tax Incentive Scheme that includes extending the list of eligible expenditure to capital expenditure on plant and machinery, utilities, as well as to remove the deemed 60% rule on outsourced R&D expenditure will accelerate innovation in these industries. Sanganeria added that land intensification allowance should be extended to agri-tech and aqua-tech industries as well as introduce a new incentive for these industries like a tiered concessionary income tax rates of 5/10% that would be subject to conditions such as production capacity and nutrition value of the food produced. These measures will not only strengthen Singapore's food supply chain, it will also create additional jobs.",25/1/21,1,1.0

973,"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ity-for-budget SINGAPORE - Helping workers and businesses to adapt, innovate and grow will be a key priority for Budget 2021, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat on Friday (Feb 5). The Government will also continue to support workers and businesses, especially those in hard-hit sectors. But Singapore must press on with the economic transformation it started five years ago, he added. He said: ""Covid-19 has accelerated innovation, put a premium on resilience, and greater priority on sustainability. ""There is no turning back the clock. While we deal with the present, we must also prepare our workers and businesses for a different world post-Covid."" He was speaking during a visit to technology firm Durapower's research and development laboratories on Friday. Last year, the Government rolled out an unprecedented five Budgets, committed nearly $100 billion in Covid-19 support measures and drew up to $52 billion from past reserves in order to preserve jobs, support companies and help affected workers. According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry's advance estimates released on Jan 4, Singapore's gross domestic product contracted by 5.8 per cent for the whole of 2020 - an improvement over the ministry's earlier forecast of a contraction of 6.5 per cent to 6 per cent made in November. But while the worst of the fallout has been averted, the road to recovery will be uneven and highly uncertain, said Mr Heng. He added that he will share more on helping workers and businesses to adapt, innovate and grow in his Budget statement on Feb 16. He also outlined initiatives which were launched last year to help workers and businesses emerge stronger - from helping small and medium-sized enterprises and hawkers adopt digital solutions to support for promising start-ups and entrepreneurs. Over 100,000 opportunities have been created for workers through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, and more resources have been set aside to encourage job creation and train Singaporeans to work in new sectors, he said. Some $25 billion has also been committed over the next five years for research, innovation, and enterprise. Mr Heng observed that many companies are adapting and innovating to seek new opportunities during the crisis. ""It is not easy but we must persist. I am fully committed to support these companies through their journey of innovation and transformation,"" he said. ""Together, we can emerge stronger as an economy; together, we can create better jobs for our workers."" DPM Heng Swee Keat on S'pore's need for continued economic transformation post-Covid-19 DPM Heng Swee Keat being given a tour around Durapower's R&D labs There will be live television and radio coverage of the Budget, which will be unveiled in Parliament on Feb 16. A live webcast will also be available on the Singapore Budget website. On Monday, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu announced a Singapore Green Plan 2030 which will set ambitious green goals for each sector. She said that Mr Heng will speak more on the sustainability agenda during the Budget debate.",2/5/21,0,1.0

1011,"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...till-need-help Budget 2021 will have more targeted schemes for those who still need help: Indranee Rajah SINGAPORE - The upcoming Budget will have more targeted schemes aimed at segments of society and sectors of the economy which have not recovered as well, as the pandemic continues into its second year, said Second Minister for Finance Indranee Rajah on Saturday (Feb 6). Ms Indranee, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for National Development, added that the strategy for Budget 2021 will be to make sure that resources are channelled to those who still need help, compared with the broad-based approach at the height of the crisis last year. ""So, some areas are doing well, they probably need less support, but some areas (like) aviation, tourism and so on, will still need some continued... support,"" she added. ""And then on the social side again, some people don't need as much support as others."" She was speaking to reporters after a visit to Kin@11, a programme space in York Hill under the Community Link (ComLink) initiative, which provides proactive and integrated support to an estimated 1,000 low-income families. Her comments come as early signs point to a steady recovery for Singapore, with gross domestic product contracting by a smaller-than-forecasted 5.8 per cent last year, and unemployment rate dropping for two months in a row in November and December last year. But the hardest-hit sectors such as aviation and tourism, for instance, are still in a slump and overall unemployment, at 3.2 per cent in December last year, is still higher than the 2.3 per cent recorded in the same month the year before. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat had said on Friday that a key priority for the Budget will be to continue to support workers and businesses, but that Singapore must press on with economic transformation. Giving a broad overview of the Budget on Saturday, Ms Indranee said it will cover the immediate healthcare issues and vaccination roll-out, social support for the needy, economic transformation and sustainability. ""One of the things about Covid-19 is that it has forced us to rethink how we've been doing things. It has also provided an opportunity to reshape the future. And this Budget will be looking exactly at that. Not just tackling existing problems, (but) how to position for the future and how to grow,"" she added. Ms Indranee also spoke about ComLink as a key strategic part of the Government's efforts to tackle inequality, adding that the initiative brings together government agencies and community partners to provide more comprehensive support to low-income families. ""There are many different partners; what we wanted to make sure was that there were no overlapping services, duplication, and then some people inadvertently left out,"" she said. She added that the Government will be working more closely with the private sector, civil society and social service agencies going forward. Mr Kelvin Chia, who oversees ComLink at Jalan Kukoh, said that since the programme space opened, many volunteer groups have come forward offering classes and services. One such group was Readable. The organisation run by volunteers, which focuses on teaching children in the Jalan Kukoh area to read and count, now holds classes at the premises. Ms Aprizen Yuliana, 37, an Indonsian married to a Singaporean, said her seven-year-old son and five-year-old daughter have benefited from the classes. Her son, who used to run away when asked to read, now enjoys storybooks and even got full marks for his spelling test, she said. \x93I don\x92t speak much English so I can\x92t teach my own children.

1040,"https://theindependent.sg/heng-swee-...work-on-v-day/ \x93No long, romantic dinner, as I have to work today \x96 for Budget Day is just two days away!\x94 said the DPM Singapore \x97 Sometimes love means having to make a great many sacrifices, which perhaps the spouses of public servants know all too well. On Sunday (Feb 14), Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat penned an appreciation post to his wife, who has had to put up with his busy schedule amid this festive Chinese New Year and Valentine\x92s Day season. Mr Heng, who is also Singapore\x92s Deputy Prime Minister, is in the middle of what for him may be the busiest time of the year, preparing the country\x92s annual budget. On most years, putting the budget together is serious business indeed. And during a pandemic, with all the stressors on the economy, we can only imagine that a great deal of hard work has been done behind the scenes by Mr Heng and his team at the Ministry of Finance (MOF), leading up to Budget Day on Tuesday, Feb 16. Last year, due to the pandemic, the Government rolled out five Budgets to boost the economy and extend aid to those affected. In January, Mr Heng quipped at the The Straits Times Global Outlook Forum that he wished that for this year, there will be only one Budget. And so, while the rest of us were likely celebrating (albeit more low-key this year) Chinese New Year, and enjoying romantic dinners with our significant others, the Minister wrote in a Facebook post that he enjoyed no such luxury. He thanked his wife for her \x93love, strength and support, and for walking the journey of life with me.\x94 And then added, \x93Thank you for your understanding \x97 no long, romantic dinner, as I have to work today \x96 for Budget Day is just two days away!\x94 However, the day did not go without a loving gesture from Mr Heng, who also posted a photo of the bouquet of flowers he sent his wife. \x93During one of my recent walkabouts, I met a second-generation stallholder selling flowers in the market. She showed me the beautiful roses she brought from overseas for Valentine\x92s Day. They were beautiful, and so I ordered some for my wife.\x94 He also thanked the MOF officers and those from other Government agencies who have also had to work over the long holiday weekend. \x93A big thank you to all and your loved ones!,\x94 he wrote. And this busyness during a festive time, apparently, happens regularly. \x93Budget Day usually takes place around mid-February, so that we can complete the entire process in time for the Financial Year, which starts on 1 April. But the consequence is that Budget preparations often overlap with Valentine\x92s Day, and Chinese New Year in some years,\x94 Mr Heng explained, before greeting everyone. \x93I hope that everyone can spend some time with your loved ones, and express your love for people in your life, today and every other day! Happy Valentine\x92s Day!\x94 Mr Heng, 59, has been married to Ms Chang Hwee Nee since 1988. Ms Chang is the CEO of the National Heritage Board. They have two children. /TISG",15/2/21,0,1.0

LTA said it would continue to monitor traffic speeds and congestion levels closely and assess if ERP rates need to be further adjusted. CNA SINGAPORE \x97 Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) rates will be increased at 10 gantries along the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE), Central Expressway (CTE) and Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) next week to manage congestion during peak periods, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Monday (Feb 15). ERP rates at those gantries will be adjusted by S$1 with effect from Feb 22. ERP charges will be reintroduced at three gantries on the AYE after Jurong Town Hall towards the city, on the KPE (ECP) after Defu Flyover and on the southbound CTE auxiliary lane to PIE (Changi). Charges will also be adjusted by S$1 at the gantry on the southbound CTE before Braddell Road and the set of four gantries along the CTE after Braddell Road and PIE slip road into the CTE. The new rates will take effect during the specified time periods from Feb 22: Rates for other time periods at previously announced gantries will remain unchanged, LTA added. ""There continue to be no ERP charges on other expressways and arterial roads,"" the authority said. ERP charges were first suspended on April 6 on the expectation that traffic would be significantly reduced during the circuit breaker period. LTA reintroduced ERP charges at some gantries along the CTE in July and August, following the end of the circuit breaker. LTA said its monitoring of traffic conditions in January showed that traffic speeds have ""remained optimal on all arterial roads and most expressways, except for some time periods on the AYE, CTE and KPE"". ""As more people travel to and from their workplaces, traffic volume has been building up during weekday peak hours. This has led to congestion at specific locations along the AYE, CTE and KPE during peak periods,"" said LTA. LTA said it would continue to monitor traffic speeds and congestion levels closely and assess if ERP rates need to be further adjusted.

Technology, capital, and the actions of our people are key enablers of this Plan.

1864,"The aviation sector will get additional support and extended cost relief to the tune of $870 million, given that the volume of international air travel remains a tiny fraction of what it was. The sector is expected to remain badly affected this year, and recovery will take some time, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday (Feb 16). The funding for the sector will come under the $11 billion Covid-19 Resilience Package. Additional funding drawn from a separate $24 billion fund to help firms and workers emerge stronger will be invested in on-arrival testing and biosafety systems, said Mr Heng. This will help to secure Singapore's position as a key aviation hub that both travellers and employees trust in. ""Airports will be differentiated by their capabilities in securing public health and enabling safe travel,"" Mr Heng added. ""They will need digitalised systems and the ability to effectively reroute people and goods."" One example of work on this front is GovTech's collaboration with Temasek-founded start-up Affinidi. The two organisations are working together to develop software that can quickly verify digital Covid-19 test result certificates and vaccination records. An app developed by Affinidi is now being trialled by Singapore Airlines to verify health documents produced by travellers. But Mr Heng cautioned that Covid-19 has reshuffled the global web of connectivity. For example, the total number of passengers passing through Changi remains at about 2 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels as at end-January. ""I expect the aviation sector to use this lull to sustain and upgrade its capabilities, and to prepare for the recovery,"" he added. The land transport sector was also flagged for additional support by Mr Heng. He said $133 million has been set aside to continue the earlier announced Covid-19 Driver Relief Fund. Eligible drivers will get $600 per month from January to March, and $450 per month from April to June. Additional support for arts and culture, sports The arts and culture, as well as the sports sector, have also been ""deeply affected by the pandemic"", said Mr Heng on Tuesday. Hence, the Government will extend the Arts and Culture Resilience Package and Sports Resilience Package to support businesses and self-employed people in these sectors. A sum of $45 million will be allocated to extend and enhance the support packages, said Mr Heng. He said the enhancement will support capability development and sector transformation, among other goals. ""We look forward to activities resuming, with greater vibrancy,"" said Mr Heng. More details will be disclosed next week when debate starts on each ministry's budget. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...land-transport",16/2/21,0,1.0

1917,"https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...Q564D-jk7XCLek ERP rates to rise at 10 gantries SINGAPORE \u2014 Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) rates will be increased at 10 gantries along the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE), Central Expressway (CTE) and Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) next week to manage congestion during peak periods, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Monday (Feb 15). ERP rates at those gantries will be adjusted by S$1 with effect from Feb 22. ERP charges will be reintroduced at three gantries on the AYE after Jurong Town Hall towards the city, on the KPE (ECP) after Defu Flyover and on the southbound CTE auxiliary lane to PIE (Changi). Charges will also be adjusted by S$1 at the gantry on the southbound CTE before Braddell Road and the set of four gantries along the CTE after Braddell Road and PIE slip road into the CTE. The new rates will take effect during the specified time periods from Feb 22: Rates for other time periods at previously announced gantries will remain unchanged, LTA added. ""There continue to be no ERP charges on other expressways and arterial roads,"" the authority said. ERP charges were first suspended on April 6 on the expectation that traffic would be significantly reduced during the circuit breaker period. LTA reintroduced ERP charges at some gantries along the CTE in July and August, following the end of the circuit breaker. LTA said its monitoring of traffic conditions in January showed that traffic speeds have ""remained optimal on all arterial roads and most expressways, except for some time periods on the AYE, CTE and KPE"". ""As more people travel to and from their workplaces, traffic volume has been building up during weekday peak hours. This has led to congestion at specific locations along the AYE, CTE and KPE during peak periods,"" said LTA. LTA said it would continue to monitor traffic speeds and congestion levels closely and assess if ERP rates need to be further adjusted. CNA",16/2/21,0,1.0

On this little red dot, we must strengthen efforts to tackle climate change, and build a sustainable home for generations to come,\x94 said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister. \x93Importantly, we must continue to be prudent in our spending, and leave a better future for our children.\x94 Singapore must continue to stay vigilant, even as the country has moved into Phase 3 of its reopening and vaccination is under way. \x93As COVID-19 has accelerated changes and created new ones, we must also navigate these shifts to thrive in a post-COVID world. Our ability to plan ahead, even in the midst of a crisis, has been the hallmark of the Singapore Story,\x94 said Mr Heng. After a pandemic-hit 2020, Singapore will be ending the financial year with a record Budget deficit. But thanks to past reserves that earlier generations have built up, the country has been able to fund the deficit by \x93opening the national safe three times\x94, said Mr Heng, adding that the country\x92s fiscal situation will \x93continue to be tight in the coming years"". The Government drew an unprecedented S$52 billion from the reserves last year. Mr Heng said he met an elderly man in his 70s during a visit to Bedok recently who told him that the Budget \x93should not be about goodies\x94, but that it was more important to invest in building up people\x92s abilities and enabling them to do better. \x93Shared values such as this \x96 the desire to build on what we inherit and pass on something better to the next generation \x96 are what bind us together as a people,\x94 said Mr Heng. \x93Indeed, we can take heart that through this crisis, we have built deeper social reserves \x97 united in purpose, standing in solidarity with one another, and facing difficulties with resilience and fortitude.\x94 The Government pushed out four Budgets last year as the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic became clear. Including two supplementary budgets, close to S$100 billion was spent on support measures for businesses and individuals, and to deal with the pandemic.

1979,"Challenger' s blowout FY2020 earnings a cautionary tale about big fiscal initiatives The company' s stronger profitability, fuelled by Covid-19 subsidies, underscores why it' s time for a fiscal pullback MON, FEB 15, 2021 - 5:50 AM SHAREHOLDERS of Challenger Technologies are likely to have been pleasantly surprised by the consumer electronics retailer' s earnings report for FY2020, which was unveiled this past week. Revenue declined nearly 18 per cent to S$270.8 million, because of the absence of a trade show and lower sales as a result of the restrictions on movement imposed by the government during the year to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, Challenger reported blowout earnings of 6.73 cents per share - up 32 per cent versus the 5.11 cents per share it reported for FY2019. Profit before tax from continuing operations increased by almost S$5.6 million to more than S$26.8 million. What accounted for the company' s sharply increased profitability? In a nutshell, it was the result of the government' s efforts last year to shield businesses and their employees from the fallout of the pandemic. Challenger reported "" sundry income"" of nearly S$5.1 million for FY2020, which is some S$4.8 million more than S$0.2 million it reported for the previous year. The company said this was mainly attributable to "" receipts of government grants"" . In its half-year financial report, Challenger indicated that these grants related to the Job Support Scheme (JSS) as well as the Wage Credit Scheme. Challenger also reported a more than S$4.7 million decline in "" premises expenses"" to slightly more than S$12.9 million in FY2020. The company said this was mainly the result of "" rental waivers and rebates"" . Shareholders of Challenger are directly benefiting from the Covid-19 subsidy and support windfall from the government. The company has said it will hike its dividend to 2.7 cents per share for FY2020, up from the 1.5 cents per share it paid out for FY2019. In absolute terms, Challenger will be paying out over S$9.3 million in dividends with respect to FY2020. This is S$4.1 million more than the nearly S$5.2 million it paid with respect to FY2019. Shares in Challenger have jumped 12.5 per cent since the company reported its full-year numbers and announced the higher dividend. The stock closed Friday at 54 cents. Big government support Challenger' s strong FY2020 earnings report is a cautionary tale about the dangers of trying to shield every corner of the economy from the Covid-19 fallout. It also underscores why the enormous fiscal measures the government rushed to introduce last year should not continue for much longer - besides being unsustainable, these measures may well be excessively benefiting some segments of the corporate sector. Unlike most recessions, which tend to be preceded by a period of excessive consumption or over-investment, the economic slump last year was caused by curbs on movement and human interaction to prevent the spread of Covid-19. So, rather than trying to jumpstart demand, the government focused on subsidising business costs. The idea was to help companies keep their doors open and their workers employed, so that business could restart quickly once Covid-19 was under control. The Ministry of Finance said in a report last week that grants received by firms in 2020 topped S$27.4 billion, up from S$1.5 billion in 2019. The biggest driver of this increase was the JSS, where the government co-funds 25 per cent to 75 per cent of the first S$4,600 of each local employee' s gross monthly pay. From April to December 2020, a total of S$22.6 billion was disbursed under the JSS, the report said. Attempted privatisation Challenger deserved the help it received from the government as much as any other consumer electronics retailer. When the pandemic hit last year, it would have been unclear to the company as well as the government exactly how badly its revenues and earnings would be affected. Moreover, the company was already struggling in the face of disruption in the retailing sector. In 2019, the controlling Loo family and a private equity fund run by Dymon Asia Capital attempted to take Challenger private at 56 cents per share, stating that the company needed to make changes to its business that might affect its dividends. The offer was rebuffed by minority shareholders who understood the value of the company. Challenger is arguably one of the most successful homegrown retailing companies in Singapore, and it has an impressive track record of profitability. Despite the retailing sector facing technological disruption, the company is hardly in financial straits. While the company has been struggling to grow its revenue, its return on equity (ROE) averaged 19 per cent during the five years to FY2019. For FY2020, with the Covid-19 support measures, its ROE came in at nearly 21 per cent. The healthy ROEs are all the more impressive given the huge - and increasing - amount of cash on its books. At the end of FY2018, Challenger had a net cash position of S$63.2 million. This cash pile expanded to nearly S$77.9 million at the end of FY2019, and to almost S$85.8 million at the end of FY2020. Challenger' s net cash holdings are now equivalent to more than 46 per cent of its market capitalisation. Fiscal pullback With governments around the world gradually learning to manage Covid-19 infection rates, many investors appear to be positioning themselves to ride a strong recovery in economic activity in 2021. Against that backdrop, analysts are expecting the Singapore government to adjust its Covid-19 measures in the Budget this week, narrowing direct fiscal support to only the most hard-hit segments of the economy - such as tourism and travel. Some analysts also see the government augmenting the social safety net for Singaporeans struggling to find work, as well as reinforcing efforts to drive industry transformation and staking out promising new fields for future economic growth. UOB Global Economics & Markets Research estimates that Budget 2021 will see an overall deficit of S$12.5 billion (or 2.5 per cent of GDP), versus a deficit of S$74.2 billion (or 15.3 per cent of GDP) last year. What will this fiscal pullback mean for the local corporate sector? Logically, as life gets back to normal in 2021, corporate revenues should rebound. The big question is whether these revenues will rise sufficiently to offset the negative impact of the expiry of enormous subsidies like the JSS on corporate earnings. *For Challenger, ironically, its earnings, even in the event of a very strong economic recovery ahead, might well not match what it achieved with the Covid-19 support measures last year.*",15/2/21,1,1.0

2232,"Netizens call out SIA\x92s higher management for earning \x93fat pay cheques\x94 after the airline reported net loss of S$142 million in Q3 2020 Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group reported a net loss of S$142 million in the third quarter of 2020 \x96 compared with the prior year\x92s S$315 million profit \x96 as border controls and travel restrictions continued to be in place in many countries amid new waves of the COVID-19 infection. SIA Group said this in a statement on Thursday (4 Feb), adding that its passenger carriage shrank by 97.6 per cent as international air travel demand remained severely constrained in the quarter. It also noted that its revenue fell by 76.1 per cent \x96 from S$3,404 million to S$1,067 million \x96 during the third quarter, as all three passenger airlines within the Group recorded a sharp drop in passenger flown revenue due to low traffic. In line with Singapore\x92s progressive re-opening, the Group is expecting to see a measured expansion of the passenger network over the coming months. \x93We will continue to monitor the status of travel restrictions and adjust our capacity accordingly to meet the traffic demand,\x94 it added. Over on social media, netizens were quick to call out SIA for its financial prudency during a time of crisis, particularly in regards to those in the higher-up earning hefty compensations. One commenter asserted that these losses faced by the airline are just a scratch compared to \x93fat pay cheques\x94 earned by shareholders and people in the higher management. Many others lamented the lack of leadership in the Group, as they called out the Group\x92s CEO for profiting millions while the lower staff are retrenched. SIA CEO received S$4.2m in remuneration despite company losing S$212m in previous FY ending 31 March 2020 Last year, it was disclosed in SIA\x92s annual report for FY19/20 that its chief executive officer (CEO), Goh Choon Phong, received a total of S$4,223,274 in remuneration for the financial year ending on 31 March. Despite SIA Group reporting its first net loss of S$212 million in its 48-year history for the 12 months ending 31 Mar 2020, Mr Goh continues to receive bonuses of S$1,046,967 and shares valued S$1,643,940. Meanwhile, in September last year, SIA Group announced its decision to lay-off 4,300 positions across its airlines \x96 Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, and Scoot \x96 as losses mounted. Mr Goh blamed the pandemic over the massive retrenchment initiated by SIA, saying that \x93none of us could have predicted its devastating impact on the global aviation industry\x94 and went on to say that his priority was \x93to ensure survival and save as many jobs as possible\x94. \x93Having to let go of our valuable and dedicated people is the hardest and most agonizing decision that I have had to make in my 30 years with SIA. This is not a reflection of the strengths and capabilities of those who will be affected, but the result of an unprecedented global crisis that has engulfed the airline industry,\x94 he added. https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/202...on-in-q3-2020/",13/2/21,0,1.0

2260,"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/16b-of-...went-to-execs/ $1.6B Of Bank Bailout Went To Execs DECEMBER 21, 2008 / 3:41 PM / AP Banks that are getting taxpayer bailouts awarded their top executives nearly $1.6 billion in salaries, bonuses, and other benefits last year, an Associated Press analysis reveals. The rewards came even at banks where poor results last year foretold the economic crisis that sent them to Washington for a government rescue. Some trimmed their executive compensation due to lagging bank performance, but still forked over multimillion-dollar executive pay packages. Benefits included cash bonuses, stock options, personal use of company jets and chauffeurs, home security, country club memberships and professional money management, the AP review of federal securities documents found. The total amount given to nearly 600 executives would cover bailout costs for many of the 116 banks that have so far accepted tax dollars to boost their bottom lines. Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services committee and a long-standing critic of executive largesse, said the bonuses tallied by the AP review amount to a bribe ""to get them to do the jobs for which they are well-paid in the first place. ""Most of us sign on to do jobs and we do them best we can,"" said Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. ""We're told that some of the most highly-paid people in executive positions are different. They need extra money to be motivated!"" Trending News Fewer Americans might get a $1,400 stimulus check Eager for a stimulus check? Early tax filing might help Pharmacies offering COVID-19 vaccines: What you need to know When might you get Biden's $1,400 stimulus check? The AP compiled total compensation based on annual reports that the banks file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The 116 banks have so far received $188 billion in taxpayer help. Among the findings: The average paid to each of the banks' top executives was $2.6 million in salary, bonuses and benefits. Lloyd Blankfein, president and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs, took home nearly $54 million in compensation last year. The company's top five executives received a total of $242 million. This year, Goldman will forgo cash and stock bonuses for its seven top-paid executives. They will work for their base salaries of $600,000, the company said. Facing increasing concern by its own shareholders on executive payments, the company described its pay plan last spring as essential to retain and motivate executives ""whose efforts and judgments are vital to our continued success, by setting their compensation at appropriate and competitive levels."" Goldman spokesman Ed Canaday declined to comment beyond that written report. The New York-based company on Dec. 16 reported its first quarterly loss since it went public in 1999. It received $10 billion in taxpayer money on Oct. 28. Even where banks cut back on pay, some executives were left with seven- or eight-figure compensation that most people can only dream about. Richard D. Fairbank, the chairman of Capital One Financial Corp., took a $1 million hit in compensation after his company had a disappointing year, but still got $17 million in stock options. The McLean, Virginia-based company received $3.56 billion in bailout money on Nov. 14. John A. Thain, chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch, topped all corporate bank bosses with $83 million in earnings last year. Thain, a former chief operating officer for Goldman Sachs, took the reins of the company in December 2007, avoiding the blame for a year in which Merrill lost $7.8 billion. Since he began work late in the year, he earned $57,692 in salary, a $15 million signing bonus and an additional $68 million in stock options. Like Goldman, Merrill got $10 billion from taxpayers on Oct. 28. Your Tax Dollars At Work: Chauffeurs, Club Dues The AP review comes amid sharp questions about the banks' commitment to the goals of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), a law designed to buy bad mortgages and other troubled assets. Last month, the Bush administration changed the program's goals, instructing the Treasury Department to pump tax dollars directly into banks in a bid to prevent wholesale economic collapse. The program set restrictions on some executive compensation for participating banks, but did not limit salaries and bonuses unless they had the effect of encouraging excessive risk to the institution. Banks were barred from giving golden parachutes to departing executives and deducting some executive pay for tax purposes. Banks that got bailout funds also paid out millions for home security systems, private chauffeured cars, and club dues. Some banks even paid for financial advisers. Wells Fargo of San Francisco, which took $25 billion in taxpayer bailout money, gave its top executives up to $20,000 each to pay personal financial planners. At Bank of New York Mellon Corp., chief executive Robert P. Kelly's stipend for financial planning services came to $66,748, on top of his $975,000 salary and $7.5 million bonus. His car and driver cost $178,879. Kelly also received $846,000 in relocation expenses, including help selling his home in Pittsburgh and purchasing one in Manhattan, the company said. Goldman Sachs' tab for leased cars and drivers ran as high as $233,000 per executive. The firm told its shareholders this year that financial counseling and chauffeurs are important in giving executives more time to focus on their jobs. JPMorgan Chase chairman James Dimon ran up a $211,182 private jet travel tab last year when his family lived in Chicago and he was commuting to New York. The company got $25 billion in bailout funds. Banks cite security to justify personal use of company aircraft for some executives. But Rep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, questioned that rationale, saying executives visit many locations more vulnerable than the security-conscious U.S. commercial air terminals. Sherman, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said pay excesses undermine development of good bank economic policies and promote an escalating pay spiral among competing financial institutions - something particularly hard to take when banks then ask for rescue money. He wants them to come before Congress, like the automakers did, and spell out their spending plans for bailout funds. ""The tougher we are on the executives that come to Washington, the fewer will come for a bailout,"" he said. By Associated Press Writers Frank Bass and Rita Beamish",13/2/21,0,1.0

2333,"Taxi Driver jin kolian SINGAPORE - Trans-Cab taxi driver Steven Chua's daily earnings fell from $200 to $80 at the start of the pandemic - barely enough to cover his costs. But with assistance from several Covid-19 Budget measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, the father of three managed to tide over the tough time. The help included the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, which provided self-employed people with three quarterly cash payouts of $3,000 each, and the Workfare Special Payment, a $3,000 cash payout for lower-income workers. In April last year, at the start of the circuit breaker period, the 54-year-old drove a demanding 14 hours a day, up from 11 hours previously. The roads were empty, recalled Mr Chua, who once drove a three-hour stretch without any passenger. ""I just went round and round, hoping someone would board my taxi,"" said the cab driver of 18 years. To get by, Mr Chua, who is also general secretary of the National Taxi Association, took on a temporary job to help manage operations at a migrant worker dormitory from April to July last year. He had to don personal protective equipment (PPE) when carrying out duties such as distributing meals. ""I was worried about getting the virus but I had no choice because I needed to support my family. I could only take the necessary precautions,"" said Mr Chua, who returned to driving his cab in July. At home, his 36-year-old homemaker wife and three children aged 11 to 15 had to scrimp and save too. ""We cut down on the number of dishes we eat every meal and ate more rice,"" said Mr Chua, who lives in a five-room flat in Jurong West. ""We also used the fans at home instead of switching on the air-con."" With the payouts from the assistance schemes, he settled the family's outstanding bills and kept some money for the months ahead. ""I didn't know what would happen tomorrow,"" Mr Chua admitted. ""If not for the help, we wouldn't even have food on the table."" For now, his situation has improved slightly. He drives 11 hours daily and earns about $150 a day. ""I am now just living day by day,"" he said. ""I hope that things will get better in the coming months.""",2/12/21,0,1.0

2407,"Trans-Cab taxi driver Steven Chua's daily earnings fell from $200 to $80 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, barely enough to cover his costs. But with assistance from several Covid-19 budget measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, the father of three managed to tide over the tough time. The help included the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, which provided self-employed people with three quarterly cash payouts of $3,000 each, and the Workfare Special Payment, a $3,000 cash payout for lower-income workers. Last April, at the start of the circuit breaker, the 54-year-old drove 14 hours a day, up from the 11 hours previously. The roads were empty, recalled Mr Chua, who once drove for three hours without any passenger. ""I just went round and round, hoping someone would board my taxi,"" said the taxi driver of 18 years. To get by, Mr Chua, who is also general secretary of the National Taxi Association, took on a temporary job to help manage operations at a migrant workers' dormitory from April to July. He had to don personal protective equipment when carrying out duties such as distributing meals. ""I was worried about getting the virus, but I had no choice because I needed to support my family,"" said Mr Chua, who returned to driving his taxi last July. His 36-year-old homemaker wife and three children aged 11 to 15 had to scrimp and save too. ""We cut down on the number of dishes at every meal and ate more rice,"" said Mr Chua, who lives in a five-room flat in Jurong West. ""We also used the fans at home instead of switching on the air-con."" With the payouts from the assistance schemes, he settled the family's outstanding bills and kept some money for the months ahead. ""If not for the help, we wouldn't even have food on the table,"" said Mr Chua. Now, he drives 11 hours daily and earns about $150 a day before deducting for costs like fuel. ""I am now just living day by day,"" he said. ""I hope that things will get better in the coming months."" https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...mily-pay-bills",2/12/21,0,1.0
2408,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) has welcomed the latest measures by private insurers to adjust the terms for those on existing Integrated Shield Plans (IP) with riders that cover hospital bills in full. NTUC Income has begun informing policyholders on such plans that they will soon have to co-pay part of their bills when their policies are renewed. Four other insurers having IPs with such riders say they are moving policyholders to co-payment riders, or considering doing so. MOH said on Thursday (Feb 11) that these changes, together with other efforts by the Government such as the publication of fee benchmarks, ""will further encourage prudent use of healthcare services, and keep healthcare costs sustainable for all Singaporeans"". ""IP policyholders can continue to tap on their MediSave to pay for their co-payment amounts under all riders, subject to the MediSave withdrawal limits,"" the ministry told The Straits Times. MOH also said that it had been kept informed by the individual private insurers on their independent reviews of existing IP riders, which were purchased before March 8, 2018. ""We welcome and are supportive of the changes that have been announced, as they support MOH's overall healthcare cost management efforts."" NTUC Income had, from Feb 3, started informing around 160,000 policyholders of IPs with riders covering hospital bills in full that their plans will have a new co-payment feature for renewals from April 1. They will have to pay at least 5 per cent of the hospital bill, capped at $3,000 a year, subject to conditions such as prior approval from NTUC Income for the procedure. Otherwise, the cap does not apply. However, their premiums will be reduced by up to about 50 per cent, depending on the policy and the policyholder's age, the insurer added. And those with serious medical conditions will start co-payment only from next year. NTUC Income's switch comes after the average premiums of its Plus Rider increased between 14 per cent and 41 per cent from 2018 to last year. Meanwhile, Aviva Singapore said its 100,000 customers who are on existing full-coverage riders will have to co-pay part of their bills from April. However, they will see a reduction in their premiums on the next renewal if they are within the same premium age bands. Prudential Singapore says slightly over 10 per cent of its customers on full riders will move to co-payment riders upon policy renewals, from April. Its head of product management Stanley Ng said the insurer will keep an eye on medical inflation and find ways to ensure healthcare remains accessible to the community. In its reply on Thursday, MOH reiterated why it backs the shift away from full riders. It noted that in past years, there have been concerns over rising healthcare costs and the impact of these on the sustainability and affordability of health insurance premiums. ""In particular, full riders that cover the entire co-payment required under IPs have contributed to the over-consumption, over-servicing and over-charging by doctors and policyholders which in turn impacts healthcare costs,"" the ministry added. ""This is why MOH had worked with insurers to introduce a minimum 5 per cent co-payment for new IP riders sold from April 1, 2019."" Those who had bought IP riders between March 8, 2018 and April 1, 2019 will also need to transition to the new IP riders from April 1 this year. MOH said this was an important move to preserve the principle of co-payment in Singapore's healthcare financing system. It also explained why it did not mandate the 5 per cent co-payment for existing rider policies purchased before March 8, 2018. ""We recognised that these were commercial contracts between insurers and their policyholders,"" it said. ""However, we welcome the latest changes by private insurers."" Added the ministry: ""We also urge all stakeholders, including patients and medical practitioners, to continue to exercise responsibility when choosing and recommending appropriate and necessary care."" https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...and-require-co",2/12/21,0,1.0

2451,"tripleme wrote: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has welcomed the latest measures by private insurers to adjust the terms for those on existing Integrated Shield Plans (IP) with riders that cover hospital bills in full. NTUC Income has begun informing policyholders on such plans that they will soon have to co-pay part of their bills when their policies are renewed. Four other insurers having IPs with such riders say they are moving policyholders to co-payment riders, or considering doing so. MOH said on Thursday (Feb 11) that these changes, together with other efforts by the Government such as the publication of fee benchmarks, ""will further encourage prudent use of healthcare services, and keep healthcare costs sustainable for all Singaporeans"". ""IP policyholders can continue to tap on their MediSave to pay for their co-payment amounts under all riders, subject to the MediSave withdrawal limits,"" the ministry told The Straits Times. MOH also said that it had been kept informed by the individual private insurers on their independent reviews of existing IP riders, which were purchased before March 8, 2018. ""We welcome and are supportive of the changes that have been announced, as they support MOH's overall healthcare cost management efforts."" NTUC Income had, from Feb 3, started informing around 160,000 policyholders of IPs with riders covering hospital bills in full that their plans will have a new co-payment feature for renewals from April 1. They will have to pay at least 5 per cent of the hospital bill, capped at $3,000 a year, subject to conditions such as prior approval from NTUC Income for the procedure. Otherwise, the cap does not apply. However, their premiums will be reduced by up to about 50 per cent, depending on the policy and the policyholder's age, the insurer added. And those with serious medical conditions will start co-payment only from next year. NTUC Income's switch comes after the average premiums of its Plus Rider increased between 14 per cent and 41 per cent from 2018 to last year. Meanwhile, Aviva Singapore said its 100,000 customers who are on existing full-coverage riders will have to co-pay part of their bills from April. However, they will see a reduction in their premiums on the next renewal if they are within the same premium age bands. Prudential Singapore says slightly over 10 per cent of its customers on full riders will move to co-payment riders upon policy renewals, from April. Its head of product management Stanley Ng said the insurer will keep an eye on medical inflation and find ways to ensure healthcare remains accessible to the community. In its reply on Thursday, MOH reiterated why it backs the shift away from full riders. It noted that in past years, there have been concerns over rising healthcare costs and the impact of these on the sustainability and affordability of health insurance premiums. ""In particular, full riders that cover the entire co-payment required under IPs have contributed to the over-consumption, over-servicing and over-charging by doctors and policyholders which in turn impacts healthcare costs,"" the ministry added. ""This is why MOH had worked with insurers to introduce a minimum 5 per cent co-payment for new IP riders sold from April 1, 2019."" Those who had bought IP riders between March 8, 2018 and April 1, 2019 will also need to transition to the new IP riders from April 1 this year. MOH said this was an important move to preserve the principle of co-payment in Singapore's healthcare financing system. It also explained why it did not mandate the 5 per cent co-payment for existing rider policies purchased before March 8, 2018. ""We recognised that these were commercial contracts between insurers and their policyholders,"" it said. ""However, we welcome the latest changes by private insurers."" Added the ministry: ""We also urge all stakeholders, including patients and medical practitioners, to continue to exercise responsibility when choosing and recommending appropriate and necessary care."" https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...and-require-co while their agents continue to milk millions, our voted incumbent decided to hand more to them. how wonderful.",3/10/21,0,1.0

2616,"Without the support measures rolled out by the Government to cushion the blow of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy would likely have contracted by twice as much last year, according to a paper released by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Thursday (Feb 11). The interim assessment of the impact of key COVID-19 Budget measures found that the Singapore economy could have shrunk 12.4 per cent or more last year. Singapore's GDP fell by 5.8 per cent in 2020, based on advance estimates. Using a simulation model, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) estimated that last year's five Budgets costing about S$100 billion supported GDP growth by 5.5 percentage points. The easing of monetary policy pushed up the GDP by a further 1.1 percentage points - shaving 6.6 percentage points off GDP decline. ""The COVID-19 support measures have made a significant difference to keep our people safe and preserve our livelihoods,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Thursday at the Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa, where he spoke to hotel staff and some beneficiaries of COVID-19 Budget schemes. ""Job losses were averted and shocks were cushioned. More help went to supporting families in need, which went some way to mitigate inequality. ""The interim analysis is encouraging, as it showed that the schemes are achieving the outcomes that they were designed for."" The Budget measures, including the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), may have helped save or create about 155,000 jobs on average over 2020 and 2021, MOF said. From April to December last year, S$22.6 billion was paid out in wage support for Singaporean workers to firms under JSS. The payouts accounted for about 80 per cent of grants to businesses in 2020. The Government has also introduced measures to help create jobs and match jobseekers with work and training opportunities. The SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package placed nearly 76,000 local jobseekers in growth sectors such as ICT, healthcare and manufacturing, MOF said. The take-up rate for the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI), which was introduced later in the year, was encouraging, the ministry said. JGI supports firms that create new jobs by co-paying a portion of the salaries of new local hires for one year. In September and October, 110,000 jobseekers were hired under the scheme by 26,000 employers. In all, companies received S$27.4 billion in grants to stay afloat. Smaller firms and firms in sectors most affected by the pandemic received more support, MOF said. Singapore companies also benefitted from financing schemes, with around 20,000 firms accessing loans worth more than S$17 billion from March to December last year. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...onomy-14168694",2/11/21,0,0.0

2715,"Canvas Club, a fixture of Singapore\x92s nightlife and arts scene, has announced it will be shutting its doors indefinitely. A statement was posted on the club\x92s Facebook page yesterday evening (Feb 10). \x93It is indeed sad to say that we have to announce the curtain call for this amazing nightlife journey with you,\x94 co-owners Roy Ng and Mahen Nathan wrote. \x93It wasn\x92t easy, and our team has been battling back and forth with the pandemic to keep things afloat. We had that little ray of hope of operating again, but as our funds were almost depleted after holding on for 9 months we had to face reality and move on \x96 to learn, and accept the changes, and embrace it.\x94 Canvas Club opened in July 2014 at Upper Circular Road, taking over the space that was previously inhabited by Home Club, another beloved venue that had been a home and incubator for Singapore\x92s alternative and independent rock music scene. Eschewing typical nightlife concepts that existed in the area, Canvas hosted events that spanned art exhibitions, music-themed parties, comedy nights, corporate affairs, and concerts. Regular music nights at the venue included .Wav(y), a hip-hop night, and the trance-themed Transitions. As the pandemic forced all venues to shut their doors temporarily, Canvas turned Transitions into a series of podcasts and livestreams in April, before restarting food and beverage operations in September. Canvas\x92 closure is the latest example of the pandemic\x92s detrimental impact on event spaces in Singapore, with arts-and-F&B venues Kult Kafe and Telok Ayer Arts Club leaving their brick-and-mortar premises in recent months. A government-planned pilot programme to temporarily reopen selected nightlife venues was deferred indefinitely in January due to a recent increase in community cases of COVID-19. https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/mus...ndemic-2876794",2/10/21,0,1.0

2857,"About 540,000 Singaporeans benefited from initiatives supported by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) last year, 40,000 more than in 2019. The number of enterprises that benefited remained constant at 14,000, SSG said on Tuesday (Feb 9) in a statement on its annual yearly review. Introduced in 2015, the SkillsFuture national movement aims to build a culture of skills development and lifelong learning. Measures in response to Covid-19 ""SSG's efforts over the years to build up a robust and sizeable continuing education and training ecosystem have enabled us to respond rapidly to the impact of Covid-19 on individuals and enterprises,"" said the agency. New measures were quickly implemented, and existing initiatives were adjusted to support individuals and enterprises affected by the pandemic, it added. The SGUnited Skills Programme and SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme were launched with the aim of providing individuals with training opportunities to upskill themselves and enhance their employability for transition to new careers or roles. Both programmes are part of the national SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. As of December last year, about 9,800 individuals had enrolled in those programmes - 7,200 under the SGUnited Skills Programme and 2,600 under the company training track of the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme. The infocomm technology and media, professional services, manufacturing and healthcare sectors reported high enrolment, SSG said. Enterprises in severely affected sectors also received aid through the Enhanced Training Support Package, which was rolled out in March last year to provide enhanced absentee payroll support and enhanced course fee subsidies for eight sectors, including air transport and tourism. These two sectors had a strong take-up rate, with more than 59,000 training places and 44,000 training places filled respectively, out of a total of about 155,000 training places. Some of the skills that employees took up under this support package include data analytics, digital commerce and customer service, as well as soft skills in communication and adapting to change. In total, more than 72,000 employees across 1,300 enterprises benefited. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ture-singapore",2/9/21,0,1.0

2875,"SINGAPORE \x97 Singapore\x92s overall median household income in 2020 fell for the first time in more than a decade ago, due to the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The median monthly household income from work fell by 2.5 per cent in nominal terms to S$9,189 last year from S$9,425 in 2019, the Department of Statistics (DOS) said on Monday (8 February) in its yearly \x93Key Household Income Trends, 2020\x94 report. After adjusting for inflation, this works out to a 2.4 per cent drop in real terms. The last decline, which was also 2.4 per cent, happened in 2009 after the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, median monthly household income from work of resident employed households \x96comprising citizens and permanent residents with at least one working person \x96 rose over the last five years by 5.2 per cent cumulatively, or 1.0 per cent per annum in real terms. Median monthly household income from work per household member dropped to S$2,886 last year from S$2,925 in 2019. This marks a decline of 1.3 per cent in nominal terms or 1.2 per cent in real terms. From 2015 to 2020, the median income per household member grew by 14.6 per cent cumulatively, or 2.8 per cent per annum in real terms. The report found that lower income households were the hardest hit, with those in the bottom 10 per cent seeing a 6.1 per cent real decline in income. In contrast, households in the top 90 per cent income groups recorded real income declines of 1.4 to 3.2 per cent. Government transfers and taxes significantly reduced the Gini coefficient to 0.375 from 0.452 in 2020, larger than the reduction to 0.398 from 0.452 in 2019. The Gini coefficient measures income inequality from 0 to 1, with 0 being most equal. The reduction arose from the significant amount of government support provided during the COVID-19 crisis last year, especially for households staying in the smaller HDB flats, the DOS said. Resident households, including those with no working persons, received S$6,308 per household member on average from various government schemes last year, higher than the S$4,684 received in 2019, the DOS added. In particular, resident households in HDB 1-room and 2-room flats received S$13,670 per household member on average, almost double the transfers received by resident households in HDB 3-room flats.",2/8/21,0,1.0

2880,"Median household incomes fell last year as Singapore's economy shrank, but had increased over the last five years, according to a paper released by the Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) on Monday (Feb 8). The median monthly household income from work fell by 2.5 per cent from S$9,425 in 2019 to S$9,189 in 2020, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. After adjusting for inflation, it was a 2.4 per cent drop. However, from 2015, when the median monthly household income was S$8,666, there was a cumulative increase of 5.2 per cent or 1 per cent per annum in real terms, said DOS. To account for different household sizes, DOS also provided figures for the median monthly household income from work per household member. This fell from S$2,925 in 2019 to S$2,886 in 2020, a decline of 1.3 per cent, or 1.2 per cent after adjusting for inflation - the first decline since 2008/2009, a result of the Global Financial Crisis. But from 2015 to 2020, the number grew by 14.6 per cent, or 2.8 per cent per annum in real terms. This trend held true for households across income groups, it said. DOS said that households in the 1st to 60th percentile saw a S$37 to S$49 drop in their average household income per member, whereas households in the 61st to 100th percentile had their income fall between S$96 and S$337. After adjusting for inflation, households in the top 90 per cent income groups recorded real income declines of 1.4 to 3.2 per cent, while incomes for households in the bottom 10 per cent declined 6.1 per cent. However, their incomes all grew in the five years from 2015 to 2020, with increases ranging from 0.6 to 2.9 per cent a year. INCOME GAP REDUCED AFTER GOVERNMENT TRANSFERS The income divide as measured by the Gini coefficient was the lowest in two decades, as government transfers closed the gap. The Gini coefficient is equal to zero in the case of total income equality, and is one in the case of total inequality. Singapore's Gini coefficient was 0.452 in 2020, unchanged from 2019 but fell to 0.375 after government transfers and taxes. The Gini coefficient was 0.398 in 2019 after transfers, a record low then. ""This can be attributed to the significant amount of government support provided during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, especially for households staying in the smaller HDB flats,"" said DOS in a media release. Resident households received S$6,308 per household member on average from various Government schemes in 2020, which was higher than the S$4,684 received the year before Those in HDB 1- & 2-room flats received S$13,670 per household member on average, close to double the transfers received by resident households in HDB 3-room flats. The report noted that its analyses focused on resident households with at least one working person, which constituted 86.7 per cent of all resident households in 2020.

2886,"SINGAPORE - The Covid-19 pandemic hit Singapore households hard last year, with overall median household income from work falling by 2.5 per cent in nominal terms from $9,425 to $9,189.

In 2009, median monthly household income from work fell by 1.9 per cent in nominal terms, or 2.5 per cent in real terms after factoring inflation in. In a new report released on Monday afternoon, the Department of Statistics(DOS) found that lower income households were the hardest hit, with those in the bottom 10 per cent seeing a 6.1 per cent real decline in income.

2895,"But Malaysia will get it first. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-u...-idUSKBN2A42KF Biden calls for expanded efforts to protect LGBTQ rights globally By Alexandra Alper, Andrea Shalal 3 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday issued a presidential memorandum aimed at expanding protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer and intersex (LGBTQI) people worldwide , including potentially through the use of financial sanctions. \x93All human beings should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear no matter who they are or whom they love,\x94 said the memorandum, building on a 2011 directive issued when Biden was serving as vice president. \x93The United States belongs at the forefront of this struggle - speaking out and standing strong for our most dearly held values,\x94 the memorandum said. While a presidential memorandum is largely symbolic, Biden campaigned on a pledge to pass LGBTQ rights legislation known as the Equality Act in the first 100 days of his administration and to make LGBTQ rights a top priority. The memo directs U.S. agencies working abroad to work harder to combat the criminalization by foreign governments of LGBTQ status or conduct, and directs the State Department to include anti-LGBTQ violence, discrimination and laws in its annual human rights report. It calls for increased efforts to ensure that LGBTQ asylum seekers have equal access to protection, expanded training for U.S. federal personnel, and potential increased use of priority referrals to expedite resettlement of vulnerable people. And it instructs agencies to consider appropriate responses, including the full range of diplomatic tools, and potentially financial sanctions and visa restrictions , when foreign governments restricted the rights of LGBTQ people. Biden announced the push during a forceful speech at the State Department, vowing to rebuild U.S. credibility worldwide. \x93To further repair our moral leadership, I\x92m also issuing a presidential memo to agencies to reinvigorate our leadership on the LGBTQI issues and do it internationally,\x94 he said. \x93We\x92ll ensure diplomacy and foreign assistance are working to promote the rights of those individuals, included by combating criminalization and protecting LGBTQ refugees and asylum-seekers.\x94 Biden\x92s campaign pledge included protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, ensuring fair treatment in the justice system and advancing LGBTQ rights globally. Biden has already issued an executive order that extends existing federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ people. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday said Biden \x93stands by\x94 his pledge to sign the Equality Act in his first 100 days but noted that Congress would need to take action to pass a bill first.",2/8/21,1,1.0

2918,"bman75 wrote: But Malaysia will get it first. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-u...-idUSKBN2A42KF Biden calls for expanded efforts to protect LGBTQ rights globally By Alexandra Alper, Andrea Shalal 3 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday issued a presidential memorandum aimed at expanding protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer and intersex (LGBTQI) people worldwide , including potentially through the use of financial sanctions. \x93All human beings should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear no matter who they are or whom they love,\x94 said the memorandum, building on a 2011 directive issued when Biden was serving as vice president. \x93The United States belongs at the forefront of this struggle - speaking out and standing strong for our most dearly held values,\x94 the memorandum said. While a presidential memorandum is largely symbolic, Biden campaigned on a pledge to pass LGBTQ rights legislation known as the Equality Act in the first 100 days of his administration and to make LGBTQ rights a top priority. The memo directs U.S. agencies working abroad to work harder to combat the criminalization by foreign governments of LGBTQ status or conduct, and directs the State Department to include anti-LGBTQ violence, discrimination and laws in its annual human rights report. It calls for increased efforts to ensure that LGBTQ asylum seekers have equal access to protection, expanded training for U.S. federal personnel, and potential increased use of priority referrals to expedite resettlement of vulnerable people. And it instructs agencies to consider appropriate responses, including the full range of diplomatic tools, and potentially financial sanctions and visa restrictions , when foreign governments restricted the rights of LGBTQ people. Biden announced the push during a forceful speech at the State Department, vowing to rebuild U.S. credibility worldwide. \x93To further repair our moral leadership, I\x92m also issuing a presidential memo to agencies to reinvigorate our leadership on the LGBTQI issues and do it internationally,\x94 he said. \x93We\x92ll ensure diplomacy and foreign assistance are working to promote the rights of those individuals, included by combating criminalization and protecting LGBTQ refugees and asylum-seekers.\x94 Biden\x92s campaign pledge included protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, ensuring fair treatment in the justice system and advancing LGBTQ rights globally. Biden has already issued an executive order that extends existing federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ people. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday said Biden \x93stands by\x94 his pledge to sign the Equality Act in his first 100 days but noted that Congress would need to take action to pass a bill first.

How would one feel if you have to report to a foreigner less qualified and capable when you are in your own country?

Just so you know, 16 years ago, Alipay have not even started their online platform.  Today in the same amount of time that the LHL's administration wasted and let in 1.5 millions additional foreigners to pursue his GDP-growth via population ponzi, China had developed its contactless payment industry from scratch and is leading the world in this future high-growth industry. Same 16 years. China had moved from the backwaters with low internet penetration and patchy 2G/3G signal coverage to leading the world in IT fields like contactless payment and 5G technology. So much so that the Trump's administration felt the threat and need to set embargoes on Huawei's 5G technology around the world for the American firms to catch up. Where did the LHL""s administration lead Singapore's economy and the Singaporean workers to after these 16 years? Yes, 16 years is not enough.

In 2012, there was a question asked by the Opposition MPs in the parliament to forced the LHL's Administration to reveal this piece of data. The Ministerial answer should be captured in the Hansard. Since then, this piece of information published in the Straits Times no less, in 2012 - that 38% of foreigners paid in excess of 50% of the income tax collected in Singapore - was scrubbed clean from ST's own websites. Now, this piece of fact that foreigners in Singapore earned more income and paid more income tax in Singapore (than even the likes of new citizens such as DBS' Piyush Gupta) is only easily accessible in academic pieces from that era.

Singaporeans are highly educated by international standards and are more than capable to perform any junior, middle, senior or even top roles at any MNCs. 16 years ago when LHL's administration started his FT policy in 2004, the claims was that no Singaporeans had those high level skills to be paid high salary. 16 years later, now in 2020; the LHL's administration is still perpetuating the strawman argument that in order to attract foreign investments, MNCs need to bring in FTs because Singaporeans do not have the necessary skills; while asking Singaporeans to go for WDA and internships to ""upskills"". That 12 years-old Singaporean kid in 2004 grew up to be a 28-year-old struggling to make ends meet by delivering pizzas to FTs still working in the comfort and safety of their homes? What happened these 16 years from 2004 to 2020? Creating good paying jobs and training Singaporeans from scratch is not rocket science. It a matter of resolve and priorities. Fyi, US took just three years of training from scratch and preparation to send their first man into space. And we are talking about the Yanks working with the constraints of 1960s/70s technology, when a whole computer had to be built and house in large buildings. Even our modern day iPhone in the pockets have 1,000,000 times more processing power and 10,000,000 times more RAM. And the Americans just took three years from zero to hero to send a man into space!

Do you think businesses would keep 4 years worth of profits around just as cash flow?  And mind you 20% margin is a healthy company. So should the business take up a loan of say 80 to tide things through?  Even in normal times, it takes 4 years to earn back that loan amount. An owner  might not take that loan.

We don't really care, u are business owner, and risk is part of doing business and u should have taken profits during good times. We care abt the employee who has kids and 55yo tan who has mother with cancer. So give the money from budget surpluses direct to the citizens, 20k 40k and give businesses interest free loans. Let the industries that are profitable grow and business by nature will adjust to where profit is. This is a better way imo. But of course now is too late already la money all spent already.

Reminded moi of this story; got a part abt swim with the tide: During a robbery in Guangzhou, China, the bank robber shouted to everyone in the bank: \x93Don\x92t move. The money belongs to the State. Your life belongs to you.\x94 Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. This is called \x93Mind Changing Concept\x94 Changing the conventional way of thinking. When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her: \x93Please be civilized! This is a robbery and not a rape!\x94 This is called \x93Being Professional\x94 Focus only on what you are trained to do! When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA-trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school): \x93Big brother, let\x92s count how much we got.\x94 The older robber rebutted and said: \x93You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!\x94 This is called \x93Experience.\x94 Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications! After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: \x93Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank\x94. This is called \x93Swim with the tide.\x94 Converting an unfavourable situation to your advantage! The supervisor says: \x93It will be good if there is a robbery every month.\x94 This is called \x93Killing Boredom.\x94 Personal Happiness is more important than your job. The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. The robbers were very angry and complained: \x93We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!\x94 This is called \x93Knowledge\x93 https://www.bhavinionline.com/2013/1...-bank-robbery/",30/8/20,0,1.0

4807,"What should NTUC do for their members? Is insurance the answer? What else is missing? What did I write on this in 2011? ====== Forum: A good insurance plan can help the jobless, while avoiding pitfalls PUBLISHED6 HOURS AGO on 8th Marh 2021 in ST Forum FACEBOOKTWITTER The idea of implementing an unemployment insurance scheme in Singapore has been mooted several times over the years, and it was again discussed at a recent Parliament session. The pushback on its introduction has always been that such a scheme may lead to the unemployed not wanting to seek employment. However, implementing this scheme and encouraging the unemployed to actively seek employment need not be mutually exclusive if the insurance scheme is carefully thought out and calibrated to avoid unintended pitfalls. A potential unemployment insurance scheme could base its premium on policyholders' declared monthly income. In the event of verified unemployment, the monthly payout could be pegged at a certain percentage of the insured's last drawn monthly salary, subject to a maximum of 24 months' payout. The payout could be calibrated in such a way that it would not see the insured falling into immediate financial hardship, but yet not be lucrative enough to discourage the insured from actively seeking employment, since the payout would be only a fraction of his last drawn monthly salary, and will last for only a period of time. As the economy transforms and the employment landscape goes through structural changes, I believe more people will go through periods of unemployment during their career. Such a scheme will go a long way in helping individuals and families to weather periods of uncertainty in their lives. Luo Siao Ping",8/3/21,1,1.0

Land sales is a  contribution to our state revenue, AKA taxes.  2) Singaporean men have to serve NS- it takes away 2/40 income producing years. I consider this as a tax, the low stipend given represents a cost saving on the state (the opposite of taxes)   So if you take all of this into account, our taxes are very high indeed.

6658,"Let’s have good inclusive schemes for the low-wage Singaporeans , not just sticking to old mind sets or western HR practices blindly ! We not only need to raise the low wages of our workers at the bottom but also have to remove the social stigma against them and give them the much needed respect and career advancement opportunities .  For example ，NEA may want to think out of the box and consider an innovative proposal to draw up a common public health -essential service professional workers scheme to attract Singaporeans to join and serve as a life long career in this essential public sector . Such common service scheme respects and treasures every worker right from the bottom as a cleaner up to the top as a public health manager or superintendent. Young and old Singaporeans regardless of their educational levels or English proficiency can be encouraged to join as public health workers doing the cleaner‘s job at a good starting salary of say $2000 pm for a headstart.The more positive and ambitious ones will be given ample on-the-job career training and development opportunities under the scheme to upgrade themselves to take up various higher job responsibilities ，such as truck driver， machine & tool workshop technician, auto-machine operator，plumber，foreman，supervisor，manager ， public health inspector ，public health trainer ， public health enforcement officer，public health supprintendant and even as a certified public health consultant or a licensed cleaning contractor or SME boss in this industry,as they gain more practical experiences, higher job skills and relevant job interests while working and growing from the bottom to the top and to the best of their ability and hard work. If this pilot scheme proves to be successful for the essential public sector , similar common and inclusive schemes can then be widely implemented for other low wage Singaporeans to bring them into the main stream of our entire workforce in every industry so that we dont depend too much on FW to keep Singapore clean ,healthy and staying  ahead of others as a great city within a garden!

This is going to cause major congestions on pathways in housing estates that are so narrow and only allow one person to walk pass at a time. How do you social distance with these ridiculous new measures.   It forces us out of the safety of our compound to add to the already crowded public areas? How is this logical? It’s also now putting us at unnecessary risk! I urge you to please look at these new guideline and do something about them as they are not practical. Condominiums should be able to exercise their own guidelines where rules like this are crazy and put residents in harms way unnecessarily. My dog is a puppy and was terrified to go on the street. We already try our best to be out quickly and come back but these rules force us to go further and so take longer times outside.   Please also check all BCA’s crazy guidelines that don’t make sense.

I want to attend higher level courses at subsidised rates with just a certificate of attendance so that I can receive quality training with little stress. The old mindset of subsidies only when I pass the test is a hindrance. It takes the joy out of learning. Having training allowance is a bonus, not a must. Not everyone is yao gui.

7367,"Dear PM, I like to take this opportunity to raise the matter regarding the Govt recent set up of a team of Digital Ambassadors to guide Seniors on the usage of PayLah or Pay Now, etc. There will be a large group of Seniors who are reluctant to go digital because of various personal reasons e.g. illiterate, not gadget savvy, do not trust digital systems especially dealing with their money. May I plead to you that we do not force them, as it will make their life very stressful & miserable. Instead  I would like to suggest that they be allowed to use debit cards like the Kopitiam Card or Passion Card. All they have to do is TAP on machines located at hawker stalls & be given a receipt. And they just have to charge cash into their cards at ATMs or Banks with the assistance from the Bank officers if needed & they do not have to handle cash regularly. Thank you, Sir.",5/6/20,0,1.0

If no major spike in infection, then let’s move to 35-40 for next 3 weeks and so on (same condition - shud not stay with elderlies). This probably will help in opening up the economy faster .. also in case anyone in that age group falls sick he may not require serious medical attention, hence less burden on the medical system. May be this approach can help open up. I understand compliance is an issue, but we can use the trace app to check and monitor.

7753,"Dear Sir,   First of all, thank you for approving the Fortitude Budget. It must have been a really tough decision to make as it cuts deep into our GDP.   I too have lost my job in the digital banking sector as a MarTech Digital Analytics & Data Science specialist Singaporean. I am highly skilled.   During CB period, I’m taking global cyber security certification right now utilising my skillsfuture TOP up credit of $500. Thank you 🙏 😊 for that.   In fact, I was abruptly & unlawfully laid off by foreign talent senior managers/MDs in our own local Banks. I was new to the bank, last in, first out situation. Unfortunate or unlucky. Culture eats our livelihood for lunch!   However, we do need to cut back on our generosity and to stop giving our meals away now.   We need to stop 🛑 ✋ using globalisation as an excuse for massive FT hires with no proper screening of their competency for the roles offered in our country. MOM & SIR needs to step up on credentials validation.   Many of whom are employed with fake tech certifications laundered and layered into our workforce.   Is there a way of which we could measure the per capita income or success metric per Singaporean with these funds at a -20% deficit of our gross GDP?   As a Singaporean, it is immensely painful to have to dig deep into our reserves of which we’ve saved since our independence. My grandparents worked hard for these savings.    Earnestly, I hope these funds would really go into supporting jobs for Singaporeans as oppose to FTs who are over supplied in our current market’s macro economic situation.   With an over supply of FTs all vying for the same buffet of jobs in the Tech, AI, Data Science, Digital Banking, Analytics, Customer Experience, Agile Workflow...etc the list go on, Digital Transformation at scale type of jobs.  In comparison to FTs, Singaporeans are actually more well skilled, well travelled, well equipped as compared to many other FTs from neighbouring countries.   I do not believe the average graduate from our local universities would lack lustre in competencies as compared to those in other countries.   In fact, Singapore has TOP talents due to our education system as compared to the rest of the world.   When we create digital transformation jobs, we need to Ensure it is a Singaporean being offered the job.  I’ve personally witnessed Singaporean CVs being rejected as the senior MD or hiring managers are all from South Asia.   Is globalisation really doing Singaporeans justice in this economy or do we Singaporeans will have to resort to working overseas as FTs too and thus causing talent brain drain in our own homeland.   Yes we should and we must be inclusive in our society.   However, it must not come at the expanse of a Singaporean’s reason for being in this country, and contribution in many ways to this country of which we call,  home truly.   We really need to step up in protecting Singaporean jobs, both young and old. Constant offshoring and outsourcing of technology jobs to South Asia, isn’t growing our economy but other’s.   Many local employers cite Singaporeans being too expensive to hire.   However, FTs are even more expensive than Singaporeans with condo housing and car allowances in their total package, doing the same job function.   So why not hire a Singaporean as opposed to an entire Dept of FTs? Why isn’t the quota strictly adhered to?   I hope the Govt will look into each sector, industry and regulate the influx of FTs for the survival of our future economy, during and post covid.  Sincerely, I hope we can emerge stronger as a people and a nation of Singapore 🇸🇬 after this ordeal. #sgunited   Thank you Sir 🙏 😊 ",26/5/20,1,1.0

However, such a situation is difficult because some political  and religious leaders have their own ideals and differences. Some countries lack the resources and expertise which could make covid 19 an even bigger threat . Social behavior and mindset plays a crucial role in combating the situation. Covid 19 has crippled the world’s economies and has claimed the lives and livelihoods of many across the globe. Wonderful that Singapore is playing our part by pledging US $500,000 in response to an appeal by WHO.

The teachers too won't be double-loaded with having to prepare materials for both physical and online learning (for those on loa) and they themselves won't be exposed to a big crowd too.  Please take a look at the kids at the bus stops, car waiting area, buses, trains etc. They are jammed packed!

Their hair turns white very fast. To accuse them of receiving high salaries and not doing anything much is most erroneous.  There is no perfect government in this world. Ours is already the best that one can get.   We who live here in Singapore are very blessed people. Recognise this fact and you will be a happier person.

Probably MOH or relevant authority can look into this or implement this in all Foodcourts across S’pore. Especially, during this period of Co-VID19 - people who dines outside are very careful ...

Find this article rather insightful-😷👍  “The hustle and bustle of China has finally halted , the restless society has calmed, and the busy Chinese people gradually nested down.  “The wild animals that were once cage by humans finally managed to keep humans in ""cages"".  “Humans now have  lowered their proud head and began to think quietly: Are we still the king of the earth?    “Mankind has come head to head with the power of nature once again.  “Facing the threat of death, human beings have begun to reflect seriously, only to realize that a lack of awe-inspiring social truths will lead to more harm and more risks.  “The greedy heart is being purified , and the mouth that loves to eat is being punished by the virus.   “The people who have been soaking in the bright red and green lights, all night have been driven home by the virus.  Go home.  “There are lesser people on the street, fewer cars on the roads but , the air is getting fresher, the haze has gone, the sky is turning bluer, the sun is getting brighter, and the family is drawing closer.    “Harmony has descended in people's hearts putting a value in relationships.  “People who have not read for many long years, have picked up books at home.   “Parents and children who have had no or almost no communication with each other, couples who find difficulty talking, have opened the lid of the conversation box.   “Children who do not know how to respect the elderly have begun to be filial.  “The virus taught human beings a vivid and profound lesson. It made them understand awe.   “It shouted to one’s ear, to realize what is called ""Good Times”, feel what is true love on earth. It brought us gradually to fall in love  saying “Return to the Road"".   “We should really be grateful for this ""enemy"".   “We need such an “enemy"" in our fragility to give us a “reminder"" to have ""empowerment"" once again.   The virus will not leave so quickly, until there is a “cultivation"" of good human habits, and it will not continue to rage because human love will gather more power to defeat this plague.   “Time will tell us everything, and prove what is right.  “I really like ""quiet China"", and I hope Chinese people will take the initiative to build a ""quiet China"" without the virus reminding them again.”           ""*Quiet China; good""*  Written by a Chinese pastor sent to a brother in Istanbul via friends in Singapore.(translated and edited for clarity )",20/2/20,1,1.0

I know we we are safe and well loked after.  I am I am indebted to all who contribute, also as our scarce fiscal reserves are still safeguarded, unlike most countries in the world. We only know to well, having learned from global and regional contagion risks and crises, the importance of being prepared. Many countries have much to learn and emulate Singapore.  We also need to do our part and contribute. As for doing my part and making a humble contribution, I hope to leave to Pakistan to attend  an International Peace Conference, with the hope of learning about their peace process and peace dividends, to build relationships that will help to build stronger buisiness relationships between Singapore and 20 countries who are members of the International Peace Leaders Institute. And simultaneously, I am negotiating with many other economies and forums to partner, to achieve the same.  Many blessings for continued good health to your family, staff, and all teams fighting hard to protect the little red dot.  Singapore Special Voices also send their thanks and best wishe to all of you.  Three cheers to the World's best PM and PAP. You have my support and vote.

This is the sad local hiring culture! 2. Large portion of the people who are in the HR field are non Singaporean. Can't blame them if they preferred to look after their 'own' people.  3. The Chief Hiring Officers will not be doing their full diligence as they will be busy with office politics and getting certifications like ISO, Bizstar, etc, instead of checking how effectively their companies are in hiring locals. They just don't want to keep digging deeper and just treat the symptoms but not the root of the problem.

Social tax on foreigners eg DPH.PR. Build and maintain only if necessary. Eg East coast MRT line can be delay until they have earn enough $$ from other MRT lines. EW and NS line interchange delay in building it. Raise up those low land coastal area first since the rate of raising sea level is small. Extend the lease of HDB flat without bring it down and rebuild.This save lot of cost for the residents. Do away those useless R and D which products or services are not sellable. Eg What can a robot dog do in a confine space in search and rescue operation. Cost cutting in all Govt sectors. Eg Since most students perfer poly route into university.Cut down PU from two years to one years . Pri sch cut down to one years.O level cut down to 3 years .Study smart .Do not study hard. Spend less than the tax collected. The tax collected depend on the number of residents in the workforce and the population number. With an aging population .They will be less residents in the workforce thus comsumer spending will be less .Thus less tax can be collected.Depending too much on the internal economic for tax  .The residents will get poorer.

I have always maintained that I'm neither pro-govt nor pro-opposition, but pro-Singaporean and all these measures I believe, only seek to help Singaporeans. Certainly, there will come a time in the near future, when the economy is strong enough, that some taxes will go up to replenish our reserves. That is to be expected and if done at a time of plenty, is a less bitter pill to swallow than if no assistance is rendered now.  If you don't think DPM Heng or these measures his finance ministry came up with is deserving of a standing ovation, don't stand. No one is forcing you to. What are you trying to say when you give a standing ovation, but don't applaud? Who does that? If anyone knows of a current living culture/civilisation that practises standing ovations without applause, please enlighten me.

Who refused to shut the doors to China, when America and many other countries already shut their borders to China. Even Chinaâ€™s â€œclosest kinsâ€, Russia was among the first to shut the door, North Korea would execute any chinese crossing into North Korea. Even in China, till today, other provinces still closed their doors to Hubei people. A fight broke out between Hubei police and Jiangxi Police over the lockdown of a bridge access for Hubei people into Jiangxi. Chinese donâ€™t even trust their own people, but our PAP welcome them with open arms.   The virus had already broken our defenses.

Dear PEOPLE, the cat is out of the bag.   Bo Lwee Leow!   Whenever the Si Kwee Kia PM LHL calls the GE take the bold step and go for your life ......Vote PAP OUT!    Your lives will be better.   Fortune favours the brave.   Don't be kiasee, kisasu and kia chenghoo.   Most important:  Mm tang sio thum!  Or don't go for petty stuff (Hokkien).   Vote in the New Government.   Singapore will be RESTRUCTURED.  From the top down.   NO more wayang.  You will get The Real Deal that is truly beneficial.   P.S.  I'll reiterate:  The PM salary should be $600,000.00 a year.  NO further claim payable and NO bonus.  That's it.  All perks that go with the office stay.  The ministers will then get a proportional sum of what the PM earns.  Ordinary MPs to get $18,000.00 when first elected.  After serving one year they will be paid $20,000.00.  Monthly.   ALL politicians must work full time.  Absence from Parliament question time must be justified with a written excuse or doctor's certificate.  NO sleeping in Parliament.  Suspension if caught napping.

Below study by three Chinese scientists and a scientist at St Louis University using global data is revealing. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2?fbclid=IwAR2CGS10WR9_5KUxmsWTfNBSD7W5_OXdgLR_Pts5EcW807oRyysMg3msF78  They discovered that there are two sources and Wuhan's source (Type II) was like a child virus and it inherited from a parent (Type I). So Type 1 source could spread itself or mutate itself to create child viruses just like the case in Wuhan. But there was no Type I in Wuhan so Type I was from a different location.  Their study makes sense because when one looks at the example of Italy. Italy has banned the Chinese on Jan 31 which is also what SG had done but Italy's measure was more stringent as they banned all flights from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau too. If one looks at the current outbreak, it happened from late Feb onwards. Given the 14 days of incubation period, the outbreak if spread by Chinese visitors shd have started in mid Feb. So its current outbreak could be due to Type II (a child virus just like Type I mutation in Wuhan) or directly from Type I which source is not from China.  Indeed, as reported in the Guardian https://bit.ly/3cG7OBt : ""....laboratory tests that isolated a strain of the virus from an Italian patient, which showed genetic differences compared with the original strain isolated in China and two Chinese tourists who became sick in Rome.""  The current global outbreak happens because the western countries believe that it is a Chinese disease (by eating wildlife) and they never look at their backyard that the source is actually there.",13/3/20,0,1.0

Hwee Suan was supposedly diagnosed with a chronic, lifelong condition called Short Bowel Syndrome  (SBS), more like similar treatment, she do not have an exact diagnosis yet). I had problems explaining her conditions earlier because She don't have an exact diagnosis yet Individuals with SBS suffer from mal-absorption, compromised immune systems; rely on IV nutrition because they can't absorb nutrients, always at risk for infections that could turn fatal in second, chronic diarrhea, electrolyte deficiency, oral aversion, etc. Hwee Suan has spent over half of her life, living in the hospital; she has had over 10 surgeries including peripheral line insertions. People think that because she ""looks"" good and has stayed out of the hospital, everything is ok. We are truly grateful she is out of the hospital and has been as healthy as She can be thank Guan Yin Ma, but this is our lives. Short Bowel Syndrome in INCURABLE. I've been fighting for over 7 years now and I will continue but just like everything else, some days are tougher than others, and her Mid-Sep14 days hospital admission with zero home leave was one of those days. I recall growing up watching NKF donation on TV and saw how many people moved to tears. It’s such a horrifying condition. Well that’s before I got to know about SBS and TPN For people with kidney failure, they need each hemodialysis treatment lasts about four hours and is done three times per week. TPN needs 14hours of infusion 3-4x a week on a cycling basis. While there are outpatient centers for Dialysis.  The difference is, there NO outpatient centers for TPN Both go long term and need a port/ peripheral line to run the treatment. Both sicknesses run the risk of running out of access when all the vessels collapsed and the patients lost their “lifelines” A kidney patient gets cured with a transplant. Some TPN patients need a transplant.  The difference is, Kidney transplant (usually one organ) is approved in Singapore BUT INTESTINE TRANSPLANT (usually need 2 organs – intestine and kidney from a living donor) IS NOT APPROVED IN SINGAPORE yet. Both Kidney dialysis and organ transplant patients are covered under medishield life extended outpatient treatments. I really really MOH will understand that TPN outpatient is really a treatment that they should support. CURRENT Criteria for Long-Term and Home PN for MediShield Life Coverage and MediSave The patient will require TPN for a minimum of 90 days. The reason is even dialysis treatment which was just 4hours therapy need not administered for 90days straight to be eligible for MOH outpatient claims for outpatient treatment. https://www.moh.gov.sg/.../medishield-life-coverage-extended The issue is TPN therapy needs a COMPULSORY break to alternate between TPN and glucose/premix infusion to prevent liver failure. It's medically dangerous to infuse TPN for 90days straight without breaks (we used to alternate between premix and glucose infusion) because 90 days straight infusion of TPN will cause liver failure and death. WE NEED SUPPORT. All of you out there who have helped or supported us even by sharing a post to spread awareness. Please help us write into MOH council for a review of the TPN policy.  we sincerely hope the policymakers will speak to the patients and the doctors before issuing any policys.  A wrong policy ruin lives. appreciate if you could help us write into MOH to appeal for a review of the TPN policy. The background to this request is the medishield council is seeking people's views on these ""preliminary recommendations"", with a public consultation held till Oct 20. https://www.straitstimes.com/.../medishield-life-to-offer...? 1. ACTION 1 - Read my post below and share my post. We appeal for a change of outpatient TPN 90days policy. We will greatly appreciate if MOH will seek the doctors on the serious side effects of 90days TPN continuous infusion. A wrong policy ruin cause liver failure and ruins lives. https://www.moh.gov.sg/.../medishield-life-coverage-extended 2.  ACTION 2- Details on the preliminary recommendations can be viewed, and feedback submitted. https://www.moh.gov.sg/e-consultation/mshl2020 3. ACTION 3 - Please help us lobby for MOH to approve pediatric intestine cum live transplant ( as it it’s a system), paediatric intestine is currently not approved in Singapore. We hope for a change and need a change before some children runs out of “life lines” and lose their lives.

10775,"Ministry of Health, Singapore  I was at Bedok Polyclinic a few days ago. The staff have started measuring temperature of everyone entering the polyclinic. A staff used a forehead thermometer while another used an ear thermometer. One must insert the ear thermometer properly into the ear in order to do an accurate reading. In addition, it takes longer for the staff to measure someone’s temperature using the ear thermometer, compared to a forehead thermometer. I would suggest the Polyclinic provides forehead thermometer to their staff instead of the ear thermometer so that they don’t have to come into too close contact with visitors and patients.   Next, it’s regarding water supply in the toilet inside the Bedok Polyclinic. In one of toilets, the water from the taps at the basins were flowing out so little and cut off so fast that it has become so difficult to do a proper hand washing. I am not sure if the same happens in the other toilets in Bedok Polyclinic, or even in other polyclinics. Is this done to cut cost? I think, the polyclinics should provide an environment to facilitate the public into practicing proper hygiene measures, especially in the current time of an epidemic event.   Hope the relevant authority will look into the matters so that  the staff in the polyclinics, together with the public, can protect themselves better in face of this COVID19 epidemic.",15/2/20,1,1.0

11416,"Dear DPM, Finance Minister, good day to you. An extended Unity Budget is better than nothing. So, a big thank you. I try to re-absorb the new budget details, it is not bad a package, if possible, your Ministry can just fine-tune the package ""a bit here, a bit there"" to make it ""more fantastic"". You served Mr Lee Kuan Yew closely for many years. That speaks volumes of your (good) capabilities. After this budget, our next challenge is to fight / contain / eradicate this Covid-19 (Crisis). The Ministerial Task Force are doing well so far so good, though there are still more room for improvements. Another challenge is of course ensuring the food supplies and necessities supply chain will not be adversely abrupted. Suggestion : more red meats from New Zealand. Not sure if Taiwan is a good option for fruits / vegetables supply source. If so, highly recommend them as alternative. (I must confess I aint no expert in these foodstuffs supply chain NEA regulations etc). All said, not least, thank you once again for the hardwork and efforts. @leehsienloong @lawrencewongst @gankimyong @ongyekung @khawboonwan @teocheehean @indraneerajah ***** note : if possible, try to look into the possibility of setting up a large assembly line to produce our own masks in Singapore. This can help create some temp jobs too. Wearing masks help boost confidence & assurance. Maybe after everyone is wearing masks we can open up our business a bit (e.g. restaurants, pubs...etc) to boost our economy ? But for now with not enough masks better be safe in having ""social distancing"" which is a correct move. And, are our ventilators enough if touchwood, Singpore exploded like Italy ? US seems to be in a mess right now after they were caught unprepared by the sudden exploded outbreak. Not enough ventilators, masks etc. I am actually quite shocked by the US news, considering US is one of the ""richest, most high tech"" advanced countries in the world.",2020-03-27,0,1.0

Self quarantine of 14 days at home will cause widespread spikes in the nation. Why so? All those who return could already be infected but show no symptom yet. When they stay home, they still mingle with their family members. Majority do not have the luxury of big homes and therefore impossible to be within the safe distant from each other. Realistically, many may not be disciplined enough to do the recommended procedures.  Assuming each family has average 5 people including the helper. Assuming that just 2 family members get infected by the one who returns from overseas, these 2 will go to school, to work, to eat, to socialise without knowing that they are also infected. Their neighbours will also get infected too. Can't imagine the spread with so many thousands returning members!!! Suggest that our govt place these group of returning citizens in designated venues for 14 days instead of returning to their home. This will be safer for the nation. A total lock-down will cause the nation much more than giving designated venues to house all those who returned from overseas regardless of which country whether by air, by rail or by road.

11542,I agree with the need for prudence. It is wrong for taxpayers to be subsidising the SHN cost for some employers of domestic helpers. If they can afford to hire a domestic helper they should be able to afford the cost of the SHN. At most an installment scheme can be offered with interest. It's ludicrous that taxpayers are subsidising a portion of them.,2021-02-17,1,0.0

11554,"Feedback : The 4 budgets amt to est. $100 bil are complex and not straight forward to the masses. If $100 bil are allocated to ALL adult Singaporeans, including the very poor, the middle income, the very rich, each can get about $50,000 Cash basis approx. 2 million adults. Right now, we dont see the very ""tangible benefits or assistance"". Most of the $100 bils seem try to help big corps and sme businesses in the hope that they can retain as many employees as possible. Is this workable ? I doubt so. If an extended family of adult pa, ma, bro, sis if you use the simplest method each getting $50,000 collectively they have $200,000. This $200,000 can help them for at least 5 years even if all of them are retrenched / laid-off. (Of course you can fine-tune it by giving those in landed houses lesser, and of the $100 bils, 20% as full cash support : each adult getting around $10,000 & etc) By having a super complex 4 combined budgets, ask around, look around, how many actually directly benefited from the est. $100 bils? Look at Hong Kong. Simple approach that all the people can feel the benefits. HK$10000 for every Hong Konger. This should be the way. Ours ?Skills training budget in times of social distancing ? Go Digital incentives when most F & B owners worry most are revenues 1st and not the mode of payment ? Note : I am Pro PAP but does not mean I am Pro PAP Policies. Would Mr Lee Kuan Yew have done differently ? @leehsienloong @hengsweekeat @teocheehean @khawboonwan Note : the theory of ""teaching someone to fish"" instead of ""giving him fishes"" has to be applied according to circumstances. When deep crisis calls for it, you have to be really wise to choose which to do so. So to me it was ""an opportunity for all Singaporeans to feel directly assisted wasted"".",2020-05-29,1,1.0
11555,"Feedback 2 : if your 4 budgets amt to say $5 bil, and each Singaporean adult gets $600 cash, then I think it is ""tangibly proportionate"". But if you have $100 bil budgeted, $10,000 cash assistance would be ""a better assistance, and more keenly felt"" by the masses. Why did I say earlier that tens of billions poured to help big corps and SMEs would not ""be workable"" ? 1. It is a good time actually for ""industry consolidation"" aka reset. The industry could have been overly saturated pre Covid-19 crisis. So, to save SIA is a wise choice as it is of such importance to Singapore economy as track records have shown. But you dont go around ""bailing out"" every companies. E.g. they dont bail out Virgin Atlantic, Hertz etc. @leehsienloong @hengsweekeat @teocheehean @khawboonwan",2020-05-29,0,1.0

11761,"I am not sure about others, but personally I am extremely disappointed with this Unity Budget. I would like to quote a Yahoo commentator who wrote this feedback (Quote) : ""Veteran@VOTE2 hours ago singapore reserves are money mainly from past bearers and should be given to ALL singaporean household across the board, whom also facing the virus crisis. not just those whom got lay off due to the crisis, whom are mostly aliens. -- it will be exploited by unscrupulous employers to report 'lay offs' then 're-hired' the same after 3 months. (Unquote) There are other loopholes. E.g. Landlords who gained on zero property tax if they do not pass down the benefits to their tenants what can tenants do ? Lose Lose ? If landlords strategy is to use the gained benefits to wait out for the crisis to be over, they can easily get new tenants. Even if the landlords pass the savings, is there a clear guideline ? What can tenants do if landlords ""give them bread crumbs "" ? I listened to the Unity Budget. It seems complex, not easy to understand for many laymen or commoners. For those unemployed  due to other valid reasons say since last year, what assistance for these groups really ? Maybe I am not as smart as our leaders, but this Unity Budget for sure is confusingly complex. If Govt is afraid of giving too much direct cash handouts (as some may misuse it such as gambling), why not have assistance as such : Govt to pay 50% of PUB bills for the next 12 months ? Note that people are encouraged to do more hand washing. Surely water bills will shoot up. Or, plus S&CC charges to be waived for the next 12 months ? Whatever costs burden reduced is a good help during this crisis. For those affected that are low on CPF ordinary account balance but still have HDB mortgages to service, a top-up of 6 months equivalent will help with ""straight, direct beneficial effect'. People can see it. People can feel the benefts straightaway. And correct me if I am wrong, up the skilllscredit $ ? Now?

11797,"> # All adult S'poreans to get $100 tourism vouchers in December for staycations, attractions and local tours

> SINGAPORE - Singaporeans aged 18 and above this year will each receive $100 in digital vouchers to spend on staycations, tickets to leisure attractions and local tours.

> The SingapoRediscovers Vouchers will be accessible via SingPass from December and can be used to offset ticket purchases and hotel stays through the end of June next year. Permanent residents will not be eligible for the vouchers.

> Adult Singaporeans will also be able to purchase up to six subsidised tickets for attractions and tours - each at $10 off - for those under 18 from December to the end of next June.

> Announcing the details on Wednesday (Sept 16), Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said the duration of the voucher programme is timed to coincide with the June and December holidays and spreading out demand in between.

> The initiative is not a social assistance scheme, he added.

> ""This is an economic scheme to help our tourist attractions preserve their capabilities that have been built up over their years while they consolidate the capacity in the interim,"" Mr Chan told reporters during a visit to the Jurong Bird Park.

> The $320 million SingapoRediscovers Vouchers scheme was first announced last month and forms part of the Government’s efforts to prop up the tourism sector, which has been decimated by travel restrictions amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

> The vouchers, which will come in denominations of $10, can be used at all licensed hotels, leisure attractions and for local tours by operators that have received approval from the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to reopen or resume.

> There are currently 214 hotels, 40 attractions and 438 tour itineraries that have been given the green light to resume operations with safe management measures in place. They include Singapore's four wildlife parks, a number of activities and hotels on Sentosa and guided tours of Pulau Ubin.

> The vouchers complement the $45 million SingapoRediscovers marketing campaign, launched in July to encourage locals to holiday at home and support local businesses.

> More than 200 deals and packages have been launched so far, and the vouchers will give locals more incentive to rediscover their backyard, STB said on Wednesday.

> The tourism board said specific details on how vouchers can be redeemed will be announced in November.

> While STB expects that the redemption process for the vouchers ""will adopt a digital mode by default"", it will provide support for those who have difficulties using such methods.

> Industry players have said that the vouchers will act as a form of indirect discounting for businesses, as lowering prices is a challenge with capacity limits on their operations in place.

> HIGHER CAPACITY LIMITS FOR ATTRACTIONS

> However, tourist attractions - which are currently restricted to 25 per cent of their operating capacity at any one time - can apply to increase this to 50 per cent from Friday.

> 

> Adult Singaporeans will also be able to purchase up to six subsidised tickets for attractions and tours for those under 18 from December to the end of next June. ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG

> 

> They can also seek STB's permission to scale up the capacity at their outdoor shows to 250 people, up from 50 currently. But shows must be split into five zones with a maximum of 50 people in each, with safe distancing between groups as well as zones.

> Related Story Staycations under $180: Explore trendy locales while staying at these chic boutique hotels

> Related Story Tourist at home: Explore Singapore with cool local tours

> This means the limit for outdoor shows at attractions will be in line with the maximum number of participants soon to be allowed at approved meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (Mice) events.

> STB said on Wednesday that the easing of rules for attractions comes as operators have been effective at preventing and dispersing crowds, as well as maintaining high standards of cleanliness and hygiene.

> All attractions have also introduced online booking systems for timed-entry or pre-booking of activities to monitor and control visitor numbers, it said.

(i too, got retrenched but not saying that i dislike foreigners. More like the disdain for overly open immigrant friendly Singapore. But also acknowledging that with our low birth rate, we do need additional workforce) 

It's a great and right thing that Singapore would want to prioritise providing benefits for locals (including converted singaporeans), such as sg traineeship or the job wage support scheme. And not for other ep or spass. (sorry, not sorry). 

Should Singapore provide benefits to PRs equal to true local born and bred singaporeans, such as a hypothetical universal basic income, how would singaporeans feel?

But well, i digress. Maybe i feel triggered because there are possible self entitled (really not implying u) ppl who feel tt they deserve exact equals of locals. (despite not even having being converted to pink ic yet) Of course in this case, $100 is not a big sum of money.

It’s really interesting to see that perspective. And as a foreigner and EP holder I completely understand your position. I guess at the end of the day every country needs to look after its own. I would say 99% of foreigners understand that here. I think the only thing that truly feels a bit off living here atm as a foreigner is you can feel there is a tension in the air around us being here. I for one am so grateful for the opportunity to be here and have come here knowing how welcoming the country is. But things are changing and it’s gets harder to manage living here. So it might be time to leave soon. Some would rejoice, another foreigner gone, however I can’t help but wonder who is going to replace me as no one is Singapore is trained in what I do as there is no university course for it here or training opportunities as it’s an incredibly niche field. My company will simply move the role back to Europe or the US and the Singaporean economy will suffer as a result. It’s a lose lose I think. That’s just my perspective on the bigger picture here.

These unintended consequences **must** be weighed against the direct toll of an unmitigated pandemic.

12031,"> # Who will get SingapoRediscovers Vouchers and what can you do with them?

> SINGAPORE - From December this year, Singaporeans aged 18 and above will be given $100 worth of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers to spend on local attractions, hotel stays and tours.

> Here are some answers to common questions on the vouchers.

> 1. How much vouchers will you get?

> Each eligible Singapore citizen will receive $100 worth of vouchers to spend on approved hotel stays, attraction tickets and tours, as part of the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers scheme. The vouchers will be in denominations of $10.

> 2. Who is eligible?

> The SingapoRediscovers Vouchers will be available to all Singapore citizens aged 18 and above in 2020.

> All adult Singaporeans are also entitled to purchase up to six child or youth tickets for younger relatives under the age of 18, at $10 off per ticket. So, besides parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, other relatives and legal guardians can purchase such subsidised tickets.

> To do so, however, the adult must declare his familial relationship to the child or youth, and must have at least $10 left in your SingapoRediscovers Vouchers balance.

> 3. When can the vouchers be used?

> The vouchers can be redeemed from Dec 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.

> 4. What can I spend the tourism vouchers on?

> They can be used at all Singapore Tourism Board (STB) approved hotels, leisure attractions and local tours.

> As of Monday (Nov 23), STB said 230 hotels, 971 tour itineraries, 43 attractions and 230 hotels have been approved to resume operations.

> For now, the vouchers can be used at 178 hotels which represents about 77 per cent of hotels allowed to re-open.

> They can be spent on the tours offered by 79 tour operators.

> As for attractions, 39 of them, or 91 per cent meet the eligibility criteria for the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers.

> The full list of eligible merchants can be found here.

> 5. Can the vouchers be used on cruises, shopping and food and beverage and at weddings?

> Generally, no, even if a wedding package includes a hotel stay.

> But the vouchers may be used for retail and F&B only if they are part of an approved package including a hotel stay, attraction visit and/or tour.

> Such packages must meet certain criteria such as ensuring that the retail or F&B component is used during the same period as the hotel stay, attraction visit and/or tours.

> For instance, the vouchers could be used for a one-night room stay bundled with dinner for two at the hotel’s restaurant.

> Simlarly, vouchers can only be redeemed for cruises as part of a bundled package.

> 6. Can the vouchers be used all at once?

> You can decide on the value of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers you want to redeem for each purchase.

> Each voucher comes in denominations of $10 and any unused value in a voucher will be wasted. For instance, if you buy one $25 attraction ticket and use $30 worth of vouchers, the $5 leftover from the vouchers will be wasted. You can instead use $20 worth of vouchers and top up the remaining $5 with cash.

> You can check your current SingapoRediscovers Voucher balance at this website from Dec 1.

> 7. How do I redeem the vouchers?

> The SingapoRediscovers Vouchers can be redeemed online through five authorised booking partners: Changi Recommends; GlobalTix; Klook & UOB Travel Planners; Traveloka; and Trip.com.

> 8. Users can redeem their Vouchers by following these steps:

> - Have your SingPass ready. Citizens are encouraged to register for a SingPass account if they do not have one, or reset their SingPass password if they have forgotten it, before the scheme commences on 1 Dec 2020.

> - Choose your products. Browse the websites of SingapoRediscovers Vouchers authorised booking partners. Eligible products are marked ""eligible for SingapoRediscovers Vouchers"" or with the SingapoRediscovers Vouchers icon. Add your item(s) to the shopping cart. To pay, click ""Use SingapoRediscovers Vouchers"" at the checkout page.

> - Login with SingPass to:

> a. Select the voucher amount to use.

> b. Activate child/youth subsidies. If you are purchasing child/youth tickets, please declare details of any family members under the age of 18. Up to six child/youth tickets will be subsidised by $10 each.

> - A voucher code will be generated. Copy and paste this at the booking partner's checkout page, and pay the outstanding amount (if any). Payment modes may differ from merchant to merchant, but most debit and credit cards will be accepted for the payment of any outstanding amount.

> - You must complete the checkout process within 10 minutes. Your vouchers are only deducted after you have completed the booking.

> 9. Where can people redeem their SingapoRediscovers vouchers? Can non-seniors redeem them from physical counters?

> Authorised booking partners will provide assistance at 69 locations across Singapore, with most located within CCs or within a five-minute walk from CCs. Booking counters will also be available at selected malls and SingPost locations.

> Of the 69 counters, 30 are run by Changi Recommends, 23 are run by GlobalTix, and 16 are run by Klook and UOB Travel.

> Each physical counter caters for bookings from only one of the three mentioned booking partners. So a Changi Recommends counter only allows bookings for packages under it, not those by GlobalTix, for instance.

> STB advised customers to ascertain what packages they wish to book, before heading down to the physical counter nearest to them.

> If the counter does not have the package they wish to book, consumers can book them online or visit a physical counter by a booking partner which has the package.

> Non-seniors can also redeem their vouchers at these physical counters, although STB recommends that citizens redeem their vouchers online, and assist family members and friends who require help with online transactions.

> 10. Why do merchants have to pay a commission to booking platforms?

> When asked, STB did not say why booking platforms can charge merchants commissions. But it said that booking partners provide marketing resources to help Singaporeans discover eligible merchants.

> These partners also have the manpower to operate physical counters islandwide and the resources to provide customer and merchant support.

> 11. Will hotels, attractions and tours jack up their prices due to the vouchers?

> STB said it takes a serious view of practices such as profiteering and said it will penalise merchants found to have done so.

> 12. Are vouchers transferable between individuals and can they be pooled with other people's vouchers?

> Your SingapoRediscovers Vouchers cannot be stacked or combined with another person's within the same redemption.

> But you may purchase an eligible product using your vouchers, and transfer the product to another person provided the merchant allows it.

> For more information, please visit this website. A how-to video on how to redeem your vouchers is available online as well. Alternatively, a hotline (1800-2828-228) is open from 8am to 10pm daily, for those who might require further assistance.

Hey guys,  
  
Testing the waters to see how useful this is.  
  

I noticed the STB website only listed the names of the attractions and not much info. I've gathered the addressees, tripadvisor ratings and categories for the Attractions where you can use the Rediscover Singapore Vouchers. This is to hopefully kickstart some discussion and make it easier for you guys to decide where to use your vouchers.

> Here's how you can use your vouchers to fund one or more migrant workers to have the experience of riding the Singapore Flyer:

> 1. Go to the Klook link.

> The tickets can be purchased on Klook here.

> 2. Select the date and number of tickets.

> Scroll down to the package options. Click ""Check availability"" and select Mar. 8, 2021 as the date.

> Select the number of tickets that you wish to purchase. Each ticket is S$35, and includes entrance to the Singapore Flyer and its newest attraction, The Time Capsule.

> Once you have done so, click ""Book now"".

> 3. Log in or sign up for an account to proceed with the order.

> Once you have either logged in to or signed up for a Klook account, you will be directed to a new page to enter your booking info.

> Tick the box acknowledging that the purchase goes toward IRR, to purchase tickets for migrant workers.

> 4. Fill in your contact information

> 5. Select the ""Use SingapoRediscovers Vouchers"" option.

> Once again, click ""Use Singaporediscovers Vouchers"", which will open up a new window of the LifeSG SingapoRediscovers website.

> There, select ""Redeem vouchers"", which you can redeem using your SingPass.

> Select ""Copy voucher code"".

> 6. Enter voucher code(s).

> Back on Klook, paste the copied promo code(s) into the box.

> Select ""Redeem"", and then ""Book now"".

The problem with these events is that every single crisis is different with varying impact on industries. For instance, retail sales (of non-essential goods) probably dropped somewhat during 1985, 1997, and 2009, but sales certainly didn't go to zero for two months. Prudent retailers would plan for a repeat of 2009, but probably not 2020-style lockdowns around the world.

Yeah, this is the moral hazard of governments mounting a rescue operation every time there is a crisis, so I believe that companies getting a bailout should feel some pain -- a dilution of the common stockholders would be a good start. 

However, letting lots of companies fail isn't tenable either -- ultimately when companies go bankrupt, it is citizens like you and I that get laid off and end up with no income.

I tend to think of it this way, because it is literally the point of stuff like counter-cyclical fiscal policy. Tax more during good times, stimulus during bad.

> Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said the measures to support workers, businesses and households will be announced when Parliament sits on Monday.

> To be called the Solidarity Budget, the supplementary measures mark the first time in history that the Government has released three Budget statements in less than two months while tapping on Singapore's reserves, and come as enhanced measures to break the chain of virus transmission come into effect next week that will result in all schools and most workplaces closing.

> Mr Heng said the Covid-19 situation has taken a very sharp turn, both globally and locally, and strong measures have to be taken to protect lives.

> But the economy has taken a hit as a result.

> ""We must remain steadfast in the face of crisis, and stand in solidarity with one another during these difficult times,"" he said.

12436,"Some points mentioned by Pritam and Sylvia are interesting:

>Mr Singh asked if the measures in the various schemes would represent a “new normal” for Singapore, especially after the nine months that several schemes in the Resilience Budget covers.

>“Will these schemes represent a new normal akin to a multi-year ‘New Deal’ to help Singaporeans cope and bounce back from economic hardship? For Singaporeans who will continue to see disruption and technology reducing their job prospects, can we expect continued support for them in the nine months after this package expires, particularly for training and wage support?” the secretary-general of the opposition party asked.

>The New Deal is an economic support package by the late American president Franklin Roosevelt to provide relief in the aftermath of the Great Depression from 1933 to 1939, and was arguably a temporary approach to help the United States recover.

>But it became a defining moment in American politics that cemented the US as a “welfare state with a strong federal government and a perennial national debt problem”, Mr Singh said.

Hopefully, there are longer term measures that will kick in when the economy gets better. Pritam is right,there needs to be caution when providing benefits to the whole nation for an extended period of time. Not to mention this includes the rich, instead of focusing on vulnerable groups.



>Later, WP chairman Sylvia Lim pointed out how the Jobs Support Scheme, for example, provides wage offsets to the employers rather than the employees directly. The scheme provides substantial government subsidy to businesses to help them pay the wages of their staff members in a bid to help them retain workers.

>However, Ms Lim said that many employers have already initiated cost management schemes by asking employees to take salary cuts, such as airline companies. 

>Retail employers, hard hit by the pandemic, have also asked their staff members to work reduced hours, while other employers in non-essential services have told employees that their job situation was not assured due to the stay-home measures, Ms Lim added.

>“To be sure, employers without revenue have to make tough choices, and I understand that. To that end, I know Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat’s speech included a hope that those who receive support will use the resources wisely and responsibly, and that the Government will not hesitate to take action against any abuse.”

>Ms Lim asked Mr Heng to clarify what would be a form of abuse by employers under the Jobs Support Scheme.

It's no secret that some companies are enacting pay cuts, like SIA. However, with Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), the question is how will it be enforced? 

The easy way out is looking at CPF contributions but that may be manipulated by unscrupulous employers. The hard part is potentially receiving thousands of complaints about reduced or unpaid leave once the JSS kicks in. Even once the JSS kicks in, companies with a lot of employees with above $4600 salaries will still suffer a lot. What will be their decisions?

Looking at the schemes and measures for COVID-19, hopefully the government has already planned properly how to properly enact them. 

Hopefully this will be unlike the property tax hoo-ha, social distancing measures' difficulty of enforcing or the work from home directives which clearly didn't deter most businesses from insisting their employees work from their workplaces.",7/4/20,0,1.0
12437,"Not all companies use JSS payouts for SG'reans. JSS is saving companies but not singaporeans.

The massive funds, in turn does not fully 'help' SG'reans save jobs, but the whole workforces' jobs, (40% foreigners inclusive and ~10-20% PR). The default decision made was contributed by prolonged periods of ""HR has to rule-keep if not companies will be blacklisted by MOM and quota will be reduced- again to save foreigners jobs"". 

Also, for SG/PR support grants that were issued, namely TRF and Covid-19 support grant, money was credited without thorough fact checking on the documents, reason being that govt knows that their people are in need of money / cash fast.

Also, the money can still go to the employers, but the employers are not bound to keep the employees even as they will get JSS payouts. This is tricky since many jobs are actually impacted this year starting in Feb 2020. In fact, the payout itself is to put more resources to firms and to really cut their costs, but employers have discretion on how they intend to use the rebates. Some will keep jobs as is, some will reduce wage bills and make people go on no pay leave.

Therefore, they are not really spending $x amount of money, more like small portions of that amount is actual money given away with no strings attached.

> SINGAPORE: Local banks in Singapore are using the wage subsidies from the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to create new jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, they told CNA on Thursday (May 21) .

> In response to queries, a DBS spokesperson said that it will use the payouts to continue hiring amid the economic downturn.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The JSS is a wage subsidy programme aimed at helping companies retain and pay their workers as businesses take a hit from the impact of COVID-19 -

> For the month of April and May, the subsidies cover 75 per cent of the first S$4,600 of each local employee’s salary.

> “We are committed not only to protecting jobs but also creating new ones,” said a DBS spokesperson.

> DBS, which employs about 12,000 people in Singapore, has previously announced that it plans to hire more than 2,000 people this year.

> Half of them will be placed in new roles, the spokesperson said, adding that many of these new roles will also go to graduates.

> The Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) also plans to use the JSS payouts to create new jobs and improve existing positions.

> Its group brand and communications head Koh Ching Ching said that the bank is “intensifying training and development across the organisation” to prepare its workers for a post-COVID-19 future.

> “New roles will be required and some existing roles have to be reviewed for redesign to fit into the future job landscape,” she said.

> The JSS will help to fulfil these plans, as well as support “a wide range of welfare schemes for our employees”, she added.

> On Thursday, Citi Singapore announced that it was joining a list of companies that have returned the wage subsidies.

> The Ministry of Finance announced early this month that 32 companies had returned JSS payouts worth a combined S$35 million as of May 9.

> These companies also pledged to decline future JSS payouts from the Government, MOF said then, adding that the S$35 million in returned payouts would be used for future disbursements.

> Both DBS and OCBC pointed out their charitable efforts in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> DBS said that it is donating S$2.5 million to provide 700,000 meals to the elderly, low-income and migrant worker communities in Singapore, while OCBC said it had given out about S$1.5 million worth of aid to help vulnerable seniors, migrant workers and needy families.

> Both banks, as well as United Overseas Bank, pledged in April not to lay off employees because of COVID-19.
