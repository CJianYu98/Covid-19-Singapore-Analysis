2626,3025,Good morning!everybody I have some very heartwarming  n rather important views regarding the Wuhan virus which i wanna share w everybody.yes.no doubt bcos of this infectious n scary virus it has indeed caused much fears  n scaring every Sporean .not just only us Sporeans but the whole world is very worried n frankly speaking very alarmed.however i personally feel that we cannot just bcos of one fatality n 106 cases bcos of this serious virus therfore ban those Hubei or china people from travelling to n fro from Singapore.My most respected n highly esteemed  ministers  of Singapore.please kindly listen to an honest  yet sincere citizen of Spore.firstly as i have read through certain comments on this very sensitive issue regarding this Wuhan virus yes.of course it is indeed a very deadly n infectious virus.however we cannot  ban these businessmen from travelling to n fro from china to Spore n vice versa.firstly this ban if really put into implementation will indeed cause a lot of disharmony n inconvenience between China n our  country.the mutual well maintained closeness n friendship between China n Spore will be greatly affected diplomatically.Rather than banning Hubei chinaman from visiting Singapore why can't we sit down togethet n think of ways n methods on how to improve our own personal hygiene n cleanliness.i believe many sicknesses are the cause due to lack of personal hygiene.many occasions i personally see little children dropping sweets n these kids simply just picked up those sweets n popped them into their mouths again when their parents were not observing them.i understand that  very young children are not aware of personal hygiene.perhaps good hygiene habits ought to start from the home Such as teaching a child the proper n correct way of handwashing N the precautions one ought to take at this crucial moment like this.monitering a child's temperature when the child is down a fever.seeking help from a doc immediately if the fever is above 38.perhaps our Spore govt could implement some rather good n quick ways of checking up n making sure before these China man make a trip to Spore.,28/1/20,0.17680177626606194,0.5242120181405898,0.107,0.72,0.172,0.9786,fear
2627,3026,Maybe a thorough medical report of their state of health within the past few weeks.a  full certified report to be presented before they can take the flight to Spore I personally believe in this saying When there is a will there is a way Let me ask the parliament one very honest n straightforward yet very direct question.if supposing one Sporean suddenly contracted a weird kind of deadly virus n he or she brings  this fatal n deadly vieus over to China how will these China  population react to this matter.sometime things might looked very  very complicated ncertain issues are indeed very sensitive but frankly speaking for me as a very good n honest Spore citizen i feel we ought not n must not bcos of one person who brings in this Wuhan virus then feel that it is the whole China who is at fault.rather than being so worried n scared what the govt needs to do now is to think of a way of .to solve this edgy issue.prevention is better than cure.the parents are the one who can teach n train a child very well good hygiene habits.maybe we ought to consider the pros n cons  N sit down  n hopefully a new vaccine might be found to save our lives from this virus.perhaps at the customs there ought to be more stands for some kinds of medical check upd.perhaps those coming to n fro from Hubei need to provide a full  cerified report of their medical n health condition for the past few werks before they bard the plane headed 4  Spore.thank u.Sir.for your listening ears.i  have to rush to work.thank u have a great day,28/1/20,0.14050993809058326,0.4973688497882047,0.041,0.826,0.132,0.9825,fear
