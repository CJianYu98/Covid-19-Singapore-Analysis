10336,11949,Are they allowed to do that?,24/1/21

10355,11968,I agree that additional measures over the Chinese New Year period is necessary to prevent further outbreaks in the community.,24/1/21

10357,11970,"It is great that Singapore is staying on top of the pandemic with the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine, and adjusting public health measures to keep new community cases low.",24/1/21

10362,11975,Shldn't we tightened on the number of imported cases 1st instead of pushing the blame and restricting the local community.,23/1/21
10363,11976,We have visitors who do not even need to be quarantine and there are already cases that are negatives when 1st tested and later tested positive.,23/1/21
10364,11977,They could be the one that spreads it to our community.,23/1/21
10365,11978,Please take steps as well to review condition in Mrt as there are many close contacts due to crowded trains.,24/1/21
10366,11979,"Plugging the loop holes from imports  is very important and urgent  It is proven 14 days quarantine for imports may not be enough , we should increase to 21 days or more .",23/1/21
10367,11980,And insist  weekly swab test for 4 weeks minimum !,23/1/21
10368,11981,Tightening community safe distancing measure may not be hitting the nail on the head !😊,23/1/21
10369,11982,"We will overcome, tomorrow will be better",23/1/21
10370,11983,How come cases increased in Singapore again.....😌😑 We were following masks and social distancing so well,23/1/21
10371,11984,My family and I was planning this arrangement or might even be tighter like Hari Raya.,23/1/21
10372,11985,During Hari Raya last year the Muslim arrangement was much tighter than current CNY so we should also try to be like during then too,23/1/21
10373,11986,What I can say is singapore still the best!👍,23/1/21
10374,11987,People should learn to shut up their mouth when commuting via bus or rail.,23/1/21
10375,11988,There's not enough posters reminding people about this and it can also empower others to tell people to shut up for safety reason.,23/1/21
10376,11989,Technology can help: Just 2 suggestions  We can record the auspicious words and playback on Bluetooth speakers on restaurant tables.,23/1/21
10377,11990,Or record a sound clip in our phones and play them in unison during the tossing.,23/1/21

11742,13528,This Fabunan Anti-viral Injection is the only true drug for Covid 19.,24/5/20
11743,13529,"In this study, which used the most advanced facilities, equipment, methods and techniques of the University of North Carolina in Greensboro or UNCG (""the drug research and development capital of the world""), it has been established that FAI not only inhibits the growth of virus-infected cells but KILLS virus-infected cells through ""Apoptosis.""",24/5/20

11745,13531,"According to the Nobel-prize winning scientist who discovered and identified the HIV AIDS virus, Dr. Luc Montagnier,the Covid 19 virus is very similar to the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus.",24/5/20

11748,13534,This is why no drug and no vaccine on earth can deal effectively with the Covid 19 virus just as no drug and no vaccine on earth can deal effectively with the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus EXCEPT FABUNAN ANTI VIRAL INJECTION ONLY.,24/5/20
11749,13535,"As per the study of the UNCG on Fabunan Anti-viral Injection or F.A.I., only F.A.I.",24/5/20
11750,13536,can KILL (not just inhibit the growth of) the drug resistant strains of the HIV AIDS virus.,24/5/20

12587,14508,"🙏Let’s commemorate Vesak Day today by reaffirming our vow as Buddhists to strive for the peace and happiness in our world, our lives and that of others just before his passing, Shakyamuni Buddha urged his disciples to regard his teachings as their teacher because only the truth,the Law of life, is eternal .",8/5/20
12588,14509,"💁‍♀️  He stressed that the way to pay homage to him was not merely by offering flowers, incense, and lights, but by truly and sincerely striving to follow his teachings.",8/5/20
12589,14510,"🙏  The Essence of Shakyamuni’s teachings is contained in his highest teaching, the Lotus Sutra, which states that Buddhahood , a condition of absolute happiness and freedom from all fear and illusions, is inherent in all life, and is eternal.",8/5/20
12590,14511,👉This means that “ the Buddha” is nothing other than an ordinary person who is aware of this state in his or her life.,8/5/20
12591,14512,"The development of this inner life state can enable all people to overcome their problem and live a fulfilled and active life, engaging fully with others and society.",8/5/20
12592,14513,"✨After Shakyamuni’s death, Buddhism spread in two main forms, the Theravada and the Mahayana.",8/5/20

12596,14517,Buddhism later reached Japan in many different schools.,8/5/20
12597,14518,"🙏  Nichiren Daishonin after years of research, because convinced that the key to transforming people’s suffering and enabling society to flourish lay in the Lotus Sutra, and particularly its title,  Myoho Renge kyo.",8/5/20
12598,14519,"He declared that the correct Buddhist practice in this age is to chant Nam Myoho Renge kyo, which enables everyone to manifest one’s innate Buddhahood, gaining life force and wisdom to challenge any adverse circumstances, attaining enlightenment and true happiness throughout their lives.",8/5/20
12599,14520,"🇷🇴 💙💛❤️The spirit is expressed in the objective of the SGI, as explained by President Ikeda states: “ Our goals is become happy not only ourselves, but to enable others to become happy as well.",8/5/20
12600,14521,It is to bring harmony to local communities and to help our nations flourish and bring peace to the whole world.,8/5/20
12601,14522,"The lives of those who pray and work to achieve these goals pulse with faith dedicated to realising kosenrufu .”  🇷🇴As we commemorate Vesak Day today, let us reaffirm this spirit and the conviction that the practical philosophy of Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism teaches individual empowerment and inner transformation, which at the same time contribute to global peace.",8/5/20

12789,14734,I’d like to suggest that those of us who are serving Singapore so well by increasing the birth rate not be penalised by having to get a separate kid’s table when we eat out at restaurants.,23/9/20

12799,14745,And why dining with immediate family members still restricting it to 5 persons per table?,23/9/20
12800,14746,Can't comprehend,23/9/20
12801,14747,What about religious prayers with karaoke type singing in private homes.,24/9/20
12802,14748,Are this allowed?,24/9/20
12803,14749,How about those who flout the rule of wearing masks?,23/9/20

12805,14751,But then eat outside with my family only 5 pax lai I clap for you forever and ever,23/9/20
12806,14752,"When covid-19 (or coronavirus as it was named) first started, the gov was slow to react and even advised that wearing of face mask was not required then.",26/9/20
12807,14753,"Even though there is a decreased in number of cases here in SG, there are still transmissions happening, especially in the dormitories.",26/9/20

12822,14768,Why can't we remove our mask when are are outside?,23/9/20
12823,14769,I think the change on wearing mask adjusted from 2yo to 6yo may need to review again.,23/9/20
12824,14770,"At 6yo, kids are practically attending K2.",23/9/20
12825,14771,Most centers grouped their K1 & K2 in the same center....from my personal encounter.,23/9/20
12826,14772,Which means these K2 kids may be wearing mask while the K1 kids do not need to do so.,23/9/20
12827,14773,It may be a measure tough for centers to adhere.,23/9/20
12828,14774,May i suggest that this measure be either adjusted from 2yo to 5yo or 7yo.,23/9/20
12829,14775,Then it’s either all kindergartens kids to wear or not to wear mask.,23/9/20
12830,14776,This will also help centers from encountering issues where some parents arguing abt age for kids whose birthdays are around end of year.,23/9/20
12831,14777,"I think Ministry of Health, Singapore should review restrictions for incoming travelers from India.",23/9/20
12832,14778,Why does It takes so long for you to implement this measure when you ban China pretty early?,23/9/20
12833,14779,I thought i read that they are supposed to be tested covid free before departure but apparently seems not so.,23/9/20
12834,14780,And Does the covid cert now helps?,23/9/20
12835,14781,There are so many fake certs made in India as your media reported.,23/9/20

12840,14787,What about sports I’m larger groups?,24/9/20
12841,14788,Soccer for example.,24/9/20
12842,14789,22 people playing sports together is less than 50 people at a wedding ain’t it?,24/9/20
12843,14790,Plus you’d get more verbal interaction at a wedding than among those 22 people playing soccer.,24/9/20
12844,14791,Consistency much?,24/9/20
12845,14792,Rahmah Hussin for your info,23/9/20
12846,14793,Better to also enforce everyone to wear a mask when taking public transport this will be even more effective in slowing the spread of the virus,3/4/20
12847,14794,No wonder you guys taking tighter measure cause it is spreading like crazy: https://youtu.be/lMjGt0YHxxs,3/4/20

16833,18940,If your time on earth is not due nothing can happen to make you go home with the Lord stop worrying unnecessarily.How many people can claim to have survived two charges by an angry 11 feet 9 ton elephant?,27/1/21
16834,18941,"?Based on a true account a pro hunter did just that and lived to tell his tale in old age.In fact he happily retired in one piece despite suffering broken bones,ribs which was common in the life of a pro hunter .But none can claim to come close to him,two safaris twice charged by a different elephant.With different clients of course.The first was he and his tracker,client tracked the spoor of a few bulls and they crept slowly through the 10 ft tall grass unable to see 1 meter in front of them even if a lion was sleeping they could step on it.They could hear the cracking of branches when the elephants were feeding to crawling like a leopard they moved closer to 20 meters and could get a better view of four bulls one with massive tusks which was just the trophy his client was looking for.But its trunk raised up suspiciously before they could fire a shot the wind changing direction and the elephant got the human ordour and without warning charged towards them at 20 meters now you think you could outrun an angry elephant it could cover in 3 seconds no man could outrun not Usain Bolt.It came charging straight at Stan the hunter name crashing through the branches,bushes flattening everything in its path determined to get its prey at all cost.Stan aimed his .470 double rifle and let go but the beast continued its charge like nothing happened it snatched Stan hat which flew on the ground and stamping on it instead of him.He was sprinting for dear life never ran so fast all his life but he thought this was the last day of his life in the African bush if the elephant continued  charging which was 1 meter behind him thank goodness it lost interest and broke off  with a sigh of relief sweat dripping from head to shirt later around the campfire he told all around why the elephant did not finished him off when it could something he failed to understand well maybe his time on earth was not up to meet the Lord.The second charge was with a french client seeking a huge trophy of maybe 100  pounder.Stan was one of the best most experienced hunter of his day so looking for one was not a problem together with his trusted tracker they saw spoor of a huge bull so just like the first one they crept among the bushes unable to see due to the tall grass.But they could hear the elephant in front the ideal range to have a shot was 20 meter so they tried to get to within that range again the elephant got the human odour and before they could fire a shot it came crashing through the branches grasses like a train eyes bulging ears flapping trunk raised a sure sign of an angry elephant.The client fired but the elephant continued its charge like the bullet was nothing Stan too fired but before he could fire the second round the elephant was on him,trying to skewed him against the tree with its tusks and Stan was clinging onto its massive tusks for dear life knowing if he let go that was the end of it.The beast swing its target but Stan by all means must hold on his gunbearer got hold of Stan gun which had flung off his hands onto the dusty ground and at point blank range of 2 feet pointed at the brain of the beast and fired.The client too followed with 2 shots and the elephant fell down but with Stan holding onto its tusks though the elephant was now dead he went down with the elephant on top of him thats 9 tons of weight Stan suffered a dozen broken ribs and had to seek treatment for the next few years in and out of hospital before he could hunt again but he had to suffer the back pain for the rest of his life.Now twice charged by elephants twice survived how could that be possible?Someone told him your time to meet the Lord not due good luck see you around again when you recovered that exactly what happened,he continued bringing clients in their quest for a trophy not necessarily an elephant,any trophy a lion,buffalo,rhino leopard.So if your time is not due nothing can make you go home with the Lord a clear example",27/1/21

24285,26718,"For those cases, a better solution would be online ordering, click and collect or even personal kerbside service.",19/1/21
24286,26719,Allowing them to opt out of protecting everybody else doesn't seem like the right thing to do.,19/1/21

24296,26729,If he committed manslaughter in Singapore I'd expect him to be sentenced according to their laws.,19/1/21

24326,26759,He hasn’t been sentenced to that.,18/1/21
24327,26760,It’s the maximum penalty depending on the seriousness of the breach.,18/1/21
24328,26761,The final decision is decided in court after due process.,18/1/21
24329,26762,The court system in Singapore is loosely modelled on the U.K. system.,18/1/21
24330,26763,And it is a false comparison.,18/1/21
24331,26764,The level of potential damage from the 2 crimes are totally different.,18/1/21
24332,26765,Also you can accidentally speed.,18/1/21

24334,26767,"He had a 2% chance of having Covid, that's much larger than the risk of speeding.",18/1/21
24335,26768,That's like comparing the risk of being struck by lightning to the risks of running across a motorway.,18/1/21
24336,26769,That's very silly maths because each person infected then infects others who infects others etc.,19/1/21

24338,26771,"In the same way that if someone speeding on the motorway hits another driver, that other driver spins and hits someone else and the incident ends up with a 20 car pile up, the initial driver speeding would be responsible for the entire accident, not just for the one car that they 'only' technically hit.",19/1/21
24339,26772,Which is why there are harsher punishments for speeding on the motorway.,19/1/21
24340,26773,And I'm saying that that's a stupid comparison.,19/1/21

24346,26780,You can't just put all the blame on one arbitrary individual in the chain...,19/1/21
24347,26781,Please explain why comparing laws is stupid?,19/1/21
24348,26782,It very well highlights their justice system.,19/1/21
24349,26783,The people coming out of the woodwork in this thread to support authoritarian laws of a flawed democracy on a UK sub is alarming.,19/1/21
24350,26784,You think that if someone does 200 mph down a motorway that they wouldn't get a sentence as long as they didn't hit anyone?,18/1/21
24351,26785,"Based on other breaking of the rules in Singapore, he will probably get fined and deported.",18/1/21
24352,26786,"But, for that, we would have to wait and see",18/1/21
24353,26787,Rate of covid in the uk right now.,18/1/21
24354,26788,"For arguments sake, let's pretend this did escape from a lab.",19/1/21
24355,26789,"And the person who let it escape wasn't following protocol, maybe wore their lab jacket to meet a friend in the park during lunch which is why it escaped.",19/1/21
24356,26790,Let's just say that this individual infected their friend.,19/1/21
24357,26791,"That friend didn't even notice they were ill, and that's how this whole thing started.",19/1/21
24358,26792,Do we punish the individual working at the lab based on breech of protocol but that he/she didn't actually harm anyone?,19/1/21
24359,26793,Or do we punish the individual working at the lab based on breech of protocol which started a worldwide pandemic?,19/1/21
24360,26795,Because it doesn't matter how much you agree or disagree with the law in a foreign country - as a tourist it's your responsibility to find out and follow those laws.,19/1/21
24361,26796,In this case it is clearly his own damn fault and hardly a surprise.,19/1/21
24362,26797,"Given that nowhere in the UK has a 190mph speed limit, your comparison doesn't fit our discussion.",18/1/21
24363,26798,"I hope so, and hey, hopefully this threat of ""up to 6 months"" will have scared enough travellers to be point it never has to be used.",18/1/21

24366,26801,"ZOE estimate there to be ~700k people with covid in the UK right now, so just over 1%.",18/1/21

24371,26806,"Well yeah, but if we just accept everything in every news article, we wouldn't have very interesting discussions...",19/1/21
24372,26807,How does it not fit.,18/1/21

24374,26809,"The amount of damage you can do at 200 mph is actually less than the damage introducing covid would do, since that either triggers a local lockdown or death of 0.5% of the country, depending on how the government acts.",18/1/21
24375,26810,"Assault is up to 6 months, assault includes slapping someone.",18/1/21
24376,26811,So the UK is being disproportionate for having 6 months as the sentence for slapping someone.,18/1/21

Still, this is a crime that has the potential to seriously affect thousands, while regular crimes generally only affect a couple of people.",18/1/21

24386,26821,Or would the company be responsible for causing a worldwide pandemic?,19/1/21
24387,26822,Honestly I don't have any sympathy for someone who willingly travelled in the middle of a pandemic and then willingly broke their quarantine.,19/1/21
24388,26823,> How does it not fit.,18/1/21
24389,26824,Because I raised the discussion point of 10mph over the speed limit.,18/1/21
24390,26825,"Regardless, potential damage is not a very good basis for sentencing.",18/1/21
24391,26826,Damage likelihood is far more reasonable.,18/1/21
24392,26827,I.e.,18/1/21

25244,27703,The fines and jailing is specifically for those who are aware of the rules and yet selfish enough to just bochup,27/3/20
25245,27704,Its because of the elderly and youngster who bochup that's why gahmen must fine everything.,27/3/20

25302,27762,Yea better to record their details & give warning for first offenders so they know it is serious this time.,27/3/20
25303,27763,I think a lot of the people calling for lockdowns are those that benefit from it (lazy students) or aren't really affected by it (they can easily work from home).,27/3/20

25317,27778,Finding traces =/= Found alive/viable,27/3/20
25318,27779,Yeah so why am I being downvoted instead of the dumb guy who ask for a lockdown,27/3/20
25319,27780,However if there is no lockdown the situation may end up being worse.,27/3/20

25325,27786,"The reverse is true as well, we may not need a lockdown to stop the virus spreading.",27/3/20

1.",27/3/20

3.",27/3/20
25329,27791,"Current measures are enough, virus burns out

My observation of lockdown proponents is that there's always this assumption that you NEED a lockdown to get the situation under control.",27/3/20

25395,27858,The sources of each cluster are also haven’t been found and isolated yet.,21/1/21
25396,27859,This means that there are potentially many pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic/mild symptom carriers who are still going about their daily life without realising they are spreading the virus.,21/1/21
