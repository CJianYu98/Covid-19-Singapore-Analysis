12007,13904,The reserves which I have observed are mainly due to overseas investment returns and prudent spending  The good thing is people have a much easier lives and higher salaries but the bad thing is reliant on pap  That is the reason why Singapore is state controlled but wealthy  But moving forward we have to be more independent if not more tension and problem ahead  The behaviour is due to strict laws and accountability  But if bad networks are forming and the law can’t detect then we will have severe fairness and safety issues  I speak with the nation interest at heart  We have to create wealth and not let pap control all our lives  They have helped singaporeans a lot but I think we have to be more independent if not cost of living fairness and safety will be an issue  We will soon lose our autonomy and freedom and voices and people will start breaching privacy and judge others and group hungry for power and wealth will start forming  We could see every time there is police operation there are lots being arrested and investigated  We will be deeply entrenched in a single party dominance  This is my advice and obviously you could ignore it if majority think this system is still the best forward,6/2/21

13440,15432,We not only need to raise the low wages of our workers at the bottom but also have to remove the social stigma against them and give them the much needed respect and career advancement opportunities .,25/6/20

13444,15436,"If this pilot scheme proves to be successful for the essential public sector , similar common and inclusive schemes can then be widely implemented for other low wage Singaporeans to bring them into the main stream of our entire workforce in every industry so that we dont depend too much on FW to keep Singapore clean ,healthy and staying  ahead of others as a great city within a garden!",25/6/20
