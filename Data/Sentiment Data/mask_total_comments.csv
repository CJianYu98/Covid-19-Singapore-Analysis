I am wearing high grade surgical mask which is real surgical standard brought way  before all these random mass production surgical masks on the market How to make surgical mask feels better on you ears..... Loosen the elastic tension on the ear loop... Holding the 2 connecting points (elastic loop and mask) using your thumb and index finger, stretch the elastic loop a few times. This makes the elastic band lose and won't strap to your ear too tightly. Also for mask in the current market, they are mess produced at normal open air factories and not inside Clean Room Environment..... And not certified to medical standards. So it justify the $2.90 for 50 masks catergory. Usual pricing pre Covid-19 is $8~$10 for medical practices purchase. (Dental or clinic).",3/9/21,0,1

British national Skea Nigel, 52, was serving a 14-day stay-home notice at the hotel when he left his room without a mask on three occasions on Sep 21 last year. According to court documents, he loitered along the corridor outside his room on the 14th floor twice, for about 10 minutes each time. On the third occasion, he met his Singaporean fiancee, Agatha Maghesh Eyamalai, 39. She was not serving a stay-home notice but had booked a different room on the 27th floor of the same hotel. The pair met on the 27th floor, with Eyamalai opening the emergency exit door for Nigel, the charge sheet read. They then spent the night together in the room from about 2.30am to 11.40am. Nigel was charged under the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 \x96 Stay Orders) Regulations 2020 and COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020.

There is no such thing as lion's share of the credit going to the PAP. The shares are evenly divided to all stakeholders concerned, including us.

Chen claimed that a Starbucks staff in her 20s immediately sprayed disinfectant in his direction upon hearing him cough. She allegedly sprayed the disinfectant at his face four times, which he said caused his eyes so much pain that he teared up and could not open his eyes. He rushed to the nearest washroom to wash them out. According to Chen, the staff also sprayed disinfectant in the direction of a bag containing his drinks.

Chen told Lianhe Wanbao that he understands that people might be more wary of others' coughing during this period.

238,"From April to December last year, over 8,600 fines - totalling more than $2.5 million - were meted out to people who did not follow safe distancing and safe management measures and who did not wear masks. From April to December last year,  more than 6,900 fines were meted out to individuals who did not follow safe distancing and safe management measures. During this same period, more than 1,700 fines were imposed on those who did not wear masks, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) told The Sunday Times. First-time offenders who breach safe distancing measures are fined $300, and second-time wrongdoers $1,000. Offenders may also face prosecution in court for egregious cases and higher fines if convicted. The figures mean that fines for failing to follow safe distancing and safe management measures amounted to more than $2 million. Fines for not wearing masks totalled more than $510,000. MSE added that gathering in groups larger than the permitted size was one of the most common infringements of the Covid-19 safety measures. Another common offence was intermingling at food and beverage outlets, game courts in Housing Board estates as well as parks and beaches. The MSE said: ""Covid-19 remains a serious threat and we must not become complacent, including during festive periods, when there will be an increase in social interactions."" On Friday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, cautioned against easing measures introduced to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Since Jan 26, households can have a maximum of eight unique visitors per day. This additional measure comes on top of those already in place, such as the wearing of masks outside one's home which was mandated from April 14 last year. Under phase three of Singapore's reopening which began on Dec 28, groups of up to eight people can gather socially, up from five previously. MSE urged the public to observe the tightened measures announced by the multi-ministry task force. It said: ""All of us must comply with these measures to avoid a resurgence in community cases, which could have devastating impacts on lives and livelihoods. ""Agencies will continue to step up enforcement inspections on F&B premises, malls, parks and beaches, where needed."" In response to queries from The Sunday Times, the police said it supports other agencies to enforce safe management measures at known hot spots. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) conducts inspections of workplaces to ensure that companies abide by safe management measures. Close to 140 firms were told to cease on-site operations after serious violations of workplace safe management measures, which were introduced in March last year. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...afety-measures",21/2/21,0,1

Bought 4 boxes. Big regret. Masks were thick and looked good and but omg, the fibres! They tickle and irritate your nose and I find myself pulling and adjusting the mask non-stop.  Tried again and again with a fresh mask from a 2nd and 3rd box and they were all the same. The elastic straps were also too tight and the ears hurt after a while. Threw all 4 boxes away as I was risking my health when I kept on pulling and touching the exterior of the mask to get the fibres out of my nose. When I buy disposable masks now, I don't get those that look thick, soft and cushiony. I associate them with loose fibres.",20/2/21,0,1

On 7 February, she was tested for COVID-19 as part of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\x92s requirement for air crew to be tested following their return from overseas. Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 8 February, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for an individual swab, and isolated. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Her previous test on 22 January following another turnaround flight was negative for COVID-19. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. She has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further confirmatory tests.* Case 60102 received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2 February. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, she could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.* Besides Case 60102, 4 passengers on the same flight (Cases 59885, 59893, 59901 and 59902) have tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and are also preliminarily positive for the B117 strain. In view of her recent travel history, and the possibility that she might have been infected onboard the flight, we have preliminarily classified this case as imported.* https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...feb2021-update Didn't they wear masks on board?",2/10/21,0,1

434,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released new guidance about the best ways to use masks to help prevent transmission of covid-19. One key recommendation highlights the added benefits of using a more snugly fitting mask or pairing a cloth mask with a surgical mask. Experimental data collected by the agency suggests that either option should greatly reduce the risk of transmission between people. Rochelle Walensky, the newly appointed CDC director, discussed the new recommendations during a White House coronavirus briefing on Wednesday. Walensky first reiterated the current consensus that properly worn masks can help limit the spread of the coronavirus. Some masks are better at protecting the wearer from infection (N95 and KN95 masks in particular), but they all limit the outward transmission of potentially infectious droplets and aerosols to others. New research from the CDC, however, looked at the relative effectiveness of different methods using cloth and surgical masks and how it could be improved. In the study, even cloth masks were more effective than no masks at limiting the spread of aerosol and droplet particles the size of those emitted by people with covid-19. But surgical masks that were more snugly fit or that had a cloth mask worn on top of them were the most effective at protecting the user and others. In an experiment that simulated being exposed to an infectious person breathing nearby, having both parties wear better-fitted or double-layered masks reduced the level of exposure by more than 95 percent, Walensky said, compared to no mask at all. \x93I want to be clear that these new scientific data released today do not change the specific recommendations about who should wear a mask or when they should wear one, but they do provide new information on why wearing a well-fitting mask is so important to protect you and others,\x94 she added. The CDC has now updated its website on improving the effectiveness of masks based on this new data. To make surgical masks better-fitting, for instance, the CDC recommends first knotting the strands of the ear loops and tucking in the outer layer of the mask fabric (there\x92s a helpful guide and visual provided by the CDC if that description isn\x92t clear enough). There are also other products, such as mask fitters and braces or masks with nose bridges, that will make a mask tighter. However it\x92s done, you can tell a mask is snug enough if you can feel warm air come through the front of the mask and the mask moves with every breath you take. As for double-masking, the CDC recommends either wearing a cloth mask with multiple layers or wearing a cloth mask over a surgical mask. However, it doesn\x92t recommend wearing two surgical masks at once, or combining an KN95 mask with any other mask (to be fair, these masks are already very good at protection when worn correctly). In addition to wearing masks in public, people should obviously still practice physical distancing whenever possible, avoid crowded indoor spaces, and wash their hands regularly. https://gizmodo.com/cdc-releases-new...ing-1846242314",2/11/21,1,0

This is why when the infection rate in the population is low, only the infected need to wear mask and there is no point for a healthy person to wear mask.  A healthy person wearing a mask can still easily get the virus through his/her eyes if he/she is exposed to the virus.  This is why quite a number of the community cases were workers wearing masks during work but still got infected after some time.

Quote: When a mannequin exposed to the virus was equipped with various masks (cotton mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask), the uptake of the virus droplets/aerosols was reduced. A cotton mask led to an approximately 20% to 40% reduction in virus uptake compared to no mask (Fig. 2B). The N95 mask had the highest protective efficacy (approximately 80% to 90% reduction) of the various masks examined; however, infectious virus penetration was measurable even when the N95 mask was completely fitted to the face with adhesive tape (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission, whereas the N95 mask showed considerable protective efficacy (Fig. 2C). There was a synergistic effect when both the virus receiver and virus spreader wore masks (cotton masks or surgical masks) to prevent the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols (Fig. 2D and E). However, it remains unknown whether the small amount of virus that was able to pass through the N95 masks would result in illness.",2/10/21,0,0

Wearing mask is just giving people a false sense of security. Add : If the infected rate is high, the chances of catching the virus in crowded places would be high even if everyone wears mask. The main reason why so many people in Singapore are still crowding around in hawker centers and shopping malls (including Chinatown during CNY) is the infected rate in the population is very low (thanks to the various government measures). The testing, isolation and SHN of travelers coming into Singapore are also greatly reducing the possibility of the virus spreading from outside the country to the community.  So, contrary to the concerns of some people, the number of import cases is actually not a concern at current levels (<50 each day). Based on the number of new community cases each day, the infected rate in the population might be 1 in 2 million each day. When the infected rate is so low, the chances that someone in a crowd of a few hundreds has the virus is extremely low.  Add to this, the chances of an infected person spreads the virus to the surrounding is reduced when he/she wears a mask. This is why we have not seen any explosion of the number of new cases despite so many people crowding in hawker centers, supermarkets, shopping malls and public transport everyday. Therefore, as long as the infected rate in the population remains this low, crowds of a few hundreds or even a few thousands is, contrary to some people's thinking, not a major concern.

Somemore below was not B117 variant.... https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/11/20-3299_article Transmission of SARS-CoV 2 During Long-Haul Flight Transmission on flight VN54 was clustered in business class, where seats are already more widely spaced than in economy class, and infection spread much further than the existing 2-row (36) or 2 meters (37) rule recommended for COVID-19 prevention on airplanes and other public transport would have captured. Similar conclusions were reached for SARS-CoV superspreader events on a flight in 2003, in which a high risk for infection was observed for passengers seated farther than 3 rows from the index case (4). This finding also concurs with transmission patterns observed for influenza virus (38) and is generally in line with the mounting evidence that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major yet underrecognized transmission route (39,40). Making mask wearing obligatory and making hand hygiene and cough etiquette standard practice while on board and at airports seems an obvious and relatively simple measure (27). Blocking middle seats, currently recommended by the airline industry (7,35), may in theory prevent some in-flight transmission events but seems to be insufficient to prevent superspreading events. We conclude that the risk for on-board transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during long flights is real and has the potential to cause COVID-19 clusters of substantial size, even in business class\u2013like settings with spacious seating arrangements well beyond the established distance used to define close contact on airplanes.",2/10/21,0,0

In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission, whereas the N95 mask showed considerable protective efficacy (Fig. 2C). There was a synergistic effect when both the virus receiver and virus spreader wore masks (cotton masks or surgical masks) to prevent the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols (Fig. 2D and E). However, it remains unknown whether the small amount of virus that was able to pass through the N95 masks would result in illness.",2/8/21,0,0

561,"And one more thing, HCWs wear N95s as being the PPE that has the lowest PF/Protection Factor when dealing with covid +ve patients currently. Due to the elevated risks in covid wards, HCWs also wear half face respirators.  Some wear full face respirators which is 1 level up above half face respirators in protection level (it's slightly better than half masks coz there are actually 2 layers of seal if you are talking bout possible nose/cheek leaks) .   Also they wear PAPR, which is yet another layer up. I know for local hospitals, they dont don half masks or full face masks like in overseas......but they jump straight to PAPR.  This is reserved for ICU ward workers tho....... Of coz overseas they also do use PAPRs. But those scenarios are not typically faced in the real world of coz. Why full face mask has a higher PF than half face masks Possibly coz of the double seal for the nose/cheek area?",2/8/21,0,0

It is not too late at this stage for Singapore and we definitely can overcome this as a population. Cheers. In before PAP IBs reply The circumstances did not change. Can easily prove that Singapore public health policy was based on fake news that the PAP Ministers and MOH spread. 1) When evidence has been published, the PAP Ministers and MOH Chief Scientist cannot pretend to be blind and say no evidence was seen. Did MOH Chief Scientist spread fake news when he claimed he saw no evidence of community spread on 27 Feb? Yes or no. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...t-is-over-says Professor Tan Chorh Chuan told The Straits Times: ""Singapore's approach of actively looking for new cases and quarantining close contacts has been effective in ring-fencing clusters of infection so far, and we have not seen evidence of community spread. Here is the definition of community spread from USA CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html What is community spread? Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. As of Feb 27, MOH reported a total of 96 cases. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...-case-12475870 Based on MOH report on 28 February, there were a total of 32 unlinked cases out of 96 confirmed cases = 33% unlinked cases. 33% of confirmed cases were unlinked according to MOH report on 28 Feb, so on what basis did MOH Chief Scientist claim that he did not see any evidence of community spread? https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...ion-confirmed/ Unlinked cases 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10 11,12,14,15,16,17,18 22,23,29 32,35,37 43,45,46 64 76,78 83,85,87,89 92 Linked cases 8,9 13,19 20,21,24,25,26,27,28 30,31,33,34,36,38,39 40,41,42,44,47,48,49 50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59 60,61,62,63,65,66,67,68,69 70,71,72,73,74,75,77,79 80,81,82,84,86,88 90,91,93,94,95,96 2) Science is based on peer review. Did MOH spread fake news when they said no evidence of aerosol transmission on 10 Feb? Yes or no. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...n-moh-12418446 ""Based on evidence available in China, an expert from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said that there is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through aerosol,"" said MOH. On what basis did MOH claim there was no evidence, just by citing only 1 single publication from China? Did MOH suspect that China publication was fake news propaganda? Remember Dr. Li Wenliang already whistleblew how China tried to coverup the Wuhan virus spread in Dec 2019. He was arrested for fake news. He died on Feb 6 2020 due to the virus. https://www.theguardian.com/world/20...om-coronavirus Did MOH review the confirmed case of the Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship [Diamond Princess] and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator? Did MOH not review the possibility that if MERS-CoV can be spread by aerosol transmission, why did they rule out Covid-19 being spread by droplets as well? http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-persp...ction-covid-19 Droplet or aerosol infection spread? Surgical mask or respirator? Asymptomatic transmission or symptomatic only? These are the defining questions surrounding the person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 that have yet to be answered\x97or answered sufficiently\x97for US experts monitoring the disease. And the answers hold the key to infection control policies that will become necessary as the disease continues to infect tens of thousands in China and hundreds more across the globe. Yesterday the media reported that a Japanese doctor who was monitoring cruise ship passengers quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess in the port of Yokohama contracted the virus despite wearing gloves and a surgical mask. He joins the more than 500 healthcare workers in Wuhan, China, who have also reportedly contracted the disease\x97just by the middle of January. These infections put into question how effective infection control policies are at preventing transmission. Masks vs respirators\x97key differences In its newly published infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of N95 respirators in a healthcare setting with the suspected novel coronavirus, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended surgical masks for general patient care and respirators for aerosol-generating procedures only. Face masks have become ubiquitous in China, sold on the street, and worn by almost everyone in public. A new survey, the Premise Coronavirus Awareness Survey, showed that in Taiwan 79.9% of people questioned said they were wearing masks in an effort to protect themselves from COVID-19. A similar percentage was noted in the Philippines. Bruce Ribner, MD, medical director of the Serious Communicable Diseases Unit at Emory University Hospital, said the two masks serve very different functions. A surgical mask, or procedural mask, is meant to protect the environment from the wearer. ""It's meant to keep the surgeon's respiratory issues away from a patient,"" Ribner explained. A surgical mask does a good job of trapping large droplets, and some aerosol transmission, he said. Many of the masks being worn in China, though, are not designed for medical use or to any standards and so their effectiveness in trapping droplets is unknown. A respirator, such as an N95, fits tighter to the face and is meant to help protect the wearer from inhaling infectious droplets in the environment. ""We don't really know how the coronavirus is being transmitted from person to person, because no one has done the NIOSH studies that simulate the cough big droplets that land 3 to 6 feet away from a person or the little droplets that can travel long distances and in air handling system,"" Ribner said. ""So we have to use what we know about other coronaviruses and influenza when it comes to this disease."" What we know, Ribner said, is that multiple modes of transmission are likely at play, including large droplets, small droplets (or aerosols), and contaminated hands. At Emory, Ribner is responsible for the care of patients treated for Ebola, Lassa fever, and other serious pathogen diseases. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which publishes CIDRAP News, says, ""The very unsettling data regarding the number of infected healthcare workers in the Wuhan area and the infection of a Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator\x97should be a real wake-up call to all of us about how do we really protect against this critical occupational risk."" How the virus travels in the air Donald Milton, MD, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, helped prove via the use of his Gesundheit machine that influenza could be spread via aerosol transmission. He said he is in contact with colleagues in Singapore who are attempting to study the transmission of the COVID-19 viruses, which are often called nCoV, for novel coronavirus. Though Chinese officials said earlier this week that they believe the coronavirus is transmitted only via droplets, implying they do not believe airborne or contact transmission plays a role, Milton said that statement is likely rooted in fear, not science. ""To me this sounds like someone trying to deal with panic, because people panic when they hear airborne transmission and long-distance transmission,"" he said. He said there has been scientific evidence of aerosol transmission of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), so it is likely possible for this novel coronavirus, as well. Milton cautions that the difference between aerosol and droplet transmission is largely in name only. Respiratory droplets, emitted with a sneeze or a cough, are commonly thought to land within 6 feet of patients and are too large to be buoyant on air currents. Respiratory aerosols are droplets too, Milton said, but smaller and light enough to travel farther. ""You cannot tell the difference epidemiologically between something aerosol transmitted by weak sources and large droplet spray,"" said Milton. ""They behave so similar, it's very hard to pick up the difference."" He said he suspects the capability of long-distance transmission with COVID-19 will be connected to source strength, or how symptomatic a person is. Protection may depend on resources For Ribner, the issue of correct mask use will linger until the exact route of transmission is documented, and it is established if an asymptomatic person (one having no symptoms) can shed the virus before becoming sick. ""If we have a person who is shedding nCoV in the environment, the best way to stop transmission is to stick a surgical procedure mask on them,"" Ribner said. ""In the best of all worlds, anyone coming into the room with an nCoV patient would wear a respirator."" But if a respirator is not available, because of cost or manufacturing, the next best option is a surgical mask, Ribner said. He said that likely contributes to the WHO's surgical mask recommendation. ""The WHO is sensitive to the fact that not every part of the world has the resources of the US and Western Europe,"" he said. Keeping health workers from becoming patients But Osterholm counters, ""Frankly, the WHO recommendation that surgical masks provide adequate protection for healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients is not consistent with data we have from similar transmission dynamics we see with influenza virus."" In an op-ed today in the Washington Post, Osterholm and coauthor Mark Olshaker stressed, ""In a very real sense, what happens to our health-care workers will be the metric of how we respond to this unfolding crisis. If we don't do all we can to protect them, they will quickly transition from providers to patients, further stressing already overburdened facilities."" They add, ""Governments must support private-sector manufacturers in providing N95s and other equipment to front-line health-care providers and other essential workers. In terms of minimizing illness and death, this will be more important than any border closing, airport screening, or quarantine.""",4/5/20,1,1

What was not right is that our leaders shouldn\x92t have followed those advice when it is clear by early February asymptomatic persons could also be spreading the virus. They could have got this info from the China CDC easily, which they probably did but doubted the integrity of the info, which I do not understand why until today. In such cases, it would have been better to be safe than sorry. Maybe they were complacent and thought they could contain this pandemic easily with or without masks. Nevertheless, it is admirable that they are finally doing the right thing despite loss of face. Let\x92s not harp on it anymore and move on.

Quote: WHO Interim guidance 29 January 2020 General Advice Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including 2019-nCoV, in affected areas. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. If masks are to be used, this measure must be combined with hand hygiene and other IPC measures to prevent the human-tohuman transmission of 2019-nCov. sunsetbay wrote: Haha~ I already know they were not telling the truth cos WHO was pretty complacence on the Corona virus as there was mere few cases in Europe & US back then~ Also when LW said they heard from the experts advice, he didn't quote it was from WHO, he also didn't explain who are this ""experts"" were~ then in Feb the four local doctors came out their own health 2M advisory, wear mask & stop mingling~ MOH chief was quick to rebut them, he didn't quote WHO as well~ when CCS audio leak came out, he said he took a gamble to give out 4 masks to make sinkies shiok shiok~ if it was WHO advise, then there wasn't a need to give fake advise~ Worst thing is people like Calvin Cheng and his readers are defending hard for the ministers u-turn advisory~ unbelievable~",4/8/20,1,1

In a closed door meeting with SCCI members, PAP Minister Chan Chun Sing said that supply of masks is not enough if everyone rush to buy. The public only knew about this because someone recorded the meeting and leaked it online, which spread viral before finally picked up by MSM and reported as news. 2) MOH Chief Scientist spread fake news that he saw no evidence of community spread on 27 Feb. Why is Singapore public health policy based on fake news? In MOH report on 28 Feb, 32 out of 96 cases were unlinked. That meant 33% of cases were unlinked. On what basis did MOH Chief Scientist claim he saw no evidence of community spread? 3) MOH spread fake news no evidence of aerosol transmission on 10 Feb. Why is Singapore health policy based on fake news? On what basis did MOH claim there was no evidence, just by citing only 1 single publication from China? [Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ] Did MOH suspect that China publication was fake news propaganda? Remember Dr. Li Wenliang already whistleblew how China tried to coverup the Wuhan virus spread in Dec 2019. He was arrested for fake news. He died on Feb 6 2020 due to the virus. Did MOH review the confirmed case of the Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship [Diamond Princess] and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator? Did MOH not review the possibility that if MERS-CoV can be spread by aerosol transmission, why did they rule out Covid-19 being spread by droplets as well? 4) The fact is Singapore public health policy is based on fake news spread by PAP Ministers and MOH Chief Scientist. If PAP Ministers dont step down or harakiri after spreading fake news and implement it for public health policy, then I worry.

And yes, he's very yaya papaya. reading his shitpost can tell he is not very wise. very xiasuay for him to give bad analogies: 1) in defending the policy of asking people not to wear masks, he compared probability of encountering an infected to encountering a celebrity, ignoring the fact that 100 infected can become 1000, 10000, etc in no time, while number of celebrities remain constant What is 100? Roughly, that\x92s probably the number of MediaCorp actors and actresses we have? I suspect MediaCorp has more. How often do you get to meet Zoe Tay or Fann Wong? I have never seen them in person in my life. Note that you can only catch COVID from someone who has been infected.

No need to argue until the cow come home. Putting some much disclaimer at the beginning of the article just to protect his ricebowl and at the same time trying to play angel. No need to argue whether Dr Tan is right or wrong. The fact is every country was facing exactly the same crisis and getting the same information and updates since the Covid 19 outbreak was made known on 31 Dec 2020 but other countirs can handle better than our MTF. On the shortage of masks, Singapore is not the only country facing this problem, the rest if not all are also not having enough mask for their people. just take example of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Taiwan's and Hong Kong's Government did not discourage their people to wear mask even there wasn't enough to go along. They (the Authorities and the people) started to improvise - homemade mask after many could not get the mask. Many videos on youtube showing long long long queue in Hong Kong but they soldiered on. As it is better to at least having a mask than no mask be it not as effective as a surgical mask. THIS IS THE POINT WHERE WE FAILED MISERABLY. Our MTF have given many wrong messages to the public. 1. No need to wear mask if you are not sick. They should not have said this. They should in fact just leave it to the public to make their own judgement. Also because of this message, those who worn mask at that time were discriminated.  I remember reading an article about a pre-school kid being penalised for wearing mask to kindergarten and the parent was called to bring him home if he insisted to wear the mask. 2. Covid 19 (Wuhan Virus at that time) Not as deadly As SARs 3. Encourage people to go stayacation and visit places of interest in Singapore. Allow Chingay Parade and Airshow to go on. And of course the hindsight, foresight and whatever sight or even backside,  the explosion of the infection in the Dorms until today, the fire is still burning high.",24/5/20,1,1

I don't know but I feel like SG trying to hint those positive cases may not get infected from the expo environment in order to maintain image? Sometimes it's not good to 100% rely on ""local evidences"". They must also study global evidences. This is a new virus, it's always better to learn from each other. Don't take chances. SG took chances with masks, delay in closures, a step too late with the FWs dorms and we end up in our current situation now. The consequence for being late is really that much.. I really hope they change their approach with the quarantine facilities in months to come.. Start planning now before the deadlier strains comes in... (Please hope not. I doubt SG can survive those strains.) Those community facilities where they pack many in one place are really not good..

I cannot say the same for Singaporeans. Some Singaporeans I saw in FB are praising the expo out of sense of patriotism and only because they thought they will never ever get infected with the virus. But here's the hard truth. Those same Singaporeans who praised expo... if they themselves get infected, I'm sure... most if not all will never want to be quarantine in those community facilities. Do people think they will never ever get it? The virus is also more infectious than your common flu. See that other thread, that NTU guy stayed at home during whole CB period also get infected. FWs are happier in expo because it's an upgrade to stay in those community facilities compared to the dorms. Singaporeans will 100% be depressed and feel like in jail if end up in those places because we're used to the comfort of our own homes. Those praising the expo also don't give a thought on those frontlines healthcare workers, volunteers and NSmen who may end up deployed those community facilities. It's really very risky for them to be there.. there're countless of evidences globally with similar concept. Then, now we start to have healthcare workers infected in expo locally. I don't know but I feel like SG trying to hint those positive cases may not get infected from the expo environment in order to maintain image? Sometimes it's not good to 100% rely on ""local evidences"". They must also study global evidences. This is a new virus, it's always better to learn from each other. Don't take chances. SG took chances with masks, delay in closures, a step too late with the FWs dorms and we end up in our current situation now. The consequence for being late is really that much.. I really hope they change their approach with the quarantine facilities in months to come.. Start planning now before the deadlier strains comes in... (Please hope not. I doubt SG can survive those strains.) Those community facilities where they pack many in one place are really not good.. It must be either hotel quarantine (if many people in same home) or home quarantine for mild, recovering and assymptomatic confirmed cases. I saw few said in the past maybe we don't have enough hotels. We have more than enough hotels... They even used Siloso Beach resort for healthy FWs.. (which covid-19 patients need it more than healthy ones). SG is technically doing semi-home quarantine for undetected cases through CB already. Those who doesn't need clinical care anymore but still positive, home or hotel quarantine is better, safer for both patients and healthcare workers than those community facilities. like to ownself masturbate to make ownself feel shiok shiok so that it's kkj can be long long & stiff stiff.

1371,Guys I find that some of you are right ! Especially for those who “ don’t exercise” when you run you run and you have sweat on your body [ and don’t use exercise as an excuse to do some leisure sight seeing of the whole city ] I most of the time make sure that my mask is attached to my Chin and put it on up to my nose when I know there group of runners come by... and then I open again..   Please bring spare dry masks if you run longer so you can use the fresh one when you enter the lifts and public area.   For some of us exercise is key to being healthy.  Some of us have problems with some of member of the house but can’t afford to get another housing for example they do need some space ... [ we never know ]   So please don’t judge others and be kind coz every house members fighting their own war .. I hope everyone can be kind to each other ..   I suffered from depression [ and I am still fighting with insomnia and anxiety ] and and it helps a lot to run... no one knows only yourself know .. I appreciate your comments who can understand that some of us really need fresh air ... but also make sure to bring distance with others ...,24/4/20,0,1

If you wash your hands before making, you need to make sure you need to wash all the tools before using as well. Isn’t using needle and thread way better than using staples which can pose a risk when you wear or wash the mask? And with that masking tape, confirm damage after one wash. With the use of thread, staples and masking tape become redundant 💆🏻‍♀️  Yes, its simple but not practical (and ugly).

1660,"Hi, just a few pointers:  1. Please don’t use staples especially if disassembly is suggested after wearing. If you prick your finger/face while disassembling this mask while preparing to wash it, bacteria and viruses may directly enter through the prick and into the blood - it can be as bad as a needle injury in hospitals (eg healthcare workers accidentally poking their fingers w needles from patients w infectious diseases). Maybe sewing is a better option, or how about velcro?  2. The tied ends of the loops touching the cheeks may cause some skin excoriations especially if worn for long periods of time. Maybe use cloth instead?  3. Not sure how breathable the waterproof totebag side can be 😅 I just tried putting a waterproof totebag over my nose and mouth - I can’t breathe at all 😂  Cute initiative though! But perhaps its safety can be looked into just a little more, before releasing it out to the public. Many may try this and may do more harm than good.

1767,"COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES  PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money. The governments moon shot daily testing program will cost £100 Billion roughly two thirds of the annual NHS budget.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.

Widely reported asymptomatic incubation period was the critical blind spot that the MTF failed to address in Feb when the Wuhan couple started the church cluster resulting in unnecessary Circuit Breaker and drawing down more than necessary from our reserves.  2) There is a growing number of ""soveriegn"" public  who openly pull down their mask to expose their nose or mouth in public, neighbourhood shop area with zero enforcement from the authority.  3) A growing number who AFTER exercising and after cooling down, are not wearing mask walking relaxingly in public on their way home. In the first place, majority did not even hv a mask around their neck.  4) Many diners at F&B outlets are talking more than eating and most of the time with their mask pulled down.  We learnt from other countries that re-surgence of clusters mainly occurred in crowded and closed areas. As such, govt should have ZERO tolerance on non compliance to proper social distancing and wearing of facemask when we talk about further opening up. Setup easy and effective hotlines for public to report non compliances to follow up with fines and penalties.

The epidemiology of local unlinked cases (eg. 11 workers at Mandarin Orchard) in the last few weeks suggests that the virus has been circulating undetected for a while, with people getting no symptoms or mild symptoms. The MRT is jam packed, and many people have long commutes on MRT. I see many people on crowded MRT with masks hanging below their noses.

Based on the indicated “four weeks or more” Phase 1, it is hardly any difference from extending the CB. We have been caught  off guard by our blind spot, thus the explosive cases amongst foreign workers. We can debate extensively how we have been prepared and the challenges in managing foreign workers prevention, but fact is, we had a mis-step. Let’s not create another mishap on the economy, the livelihood of the people on the street. Their livelihood are unfortunately, not on “iron rice bowl” terms like some minority. Businesses will retrench, based on this timeline and progress. The pay subsidies are great but not enough to keep business owners from nightmares each night if you are talking about a 3 months and longer business shutdown. You can ask people to innovate. Yes, we should, from business strategies, operational model and foreign labour. But, all these is on the pretext of we survive this round. The concentration now is within the foreign workers in dorm. We don’t have a cure or vaccine thus we will continue to have cases, unless you have a way to keep everyone locked in separate cells and keep them alive and sane with no human intervention. Instead of rushing to open construction sites and sectors requiring foreign workers in dorm, we should hold these until the infection there comes down to single digit.

While MOH claims 'there are no harmful effects of 5G/4G/3G/2G/WIFI or artificial man-made electromagnetic fields', they haven't provided ANY studies conducted by Singaporean scientists/doctors/experts at all as evidence or proof! They haven't showed any statistically significant evidence/research/data in the Singaporean population for current 2G/3G/4G/WIFI to back up their claims that 5G is safe, given also they haven't done any research themselves on 5G!!! There is sudden research and interest in testing and research for COVID-19 a very new disease, but absolute ZERO, ZILCH research on electrohypersensitivity/cancer/multi-chemical-sensitivities/autoimmune or other environmental pathologies with a wireless radiation focus/bias at all?!!!

However, given the potency of the virus to spread itself, even 1 unlinked case can cause the situation to spiral out of control, again.  Even during this period of enhanced CB, many of the measure were not well implemented, people do not follow them (I’ve seen this myself during my once a week grocery runs). Ultimately, it is the individual’s responsibility to understand, accept, and adhere to these measures, enforcement can only do so much. Yet unfortunately, if people do not adhere to the measures during strict enforcement, chances are it will be worse once the gov relaxes the measures.  I fully understand the need to minimize the economic “damage” and to protect the businesses and the livelihoods of employees (Im speaking as an individual who lost my job thanks to this pandemic), but relaxing the measures at this juncture is extremely worrying.   If a second wave happens and we have to be put through this again, or worse, our efforts so far would have been put to waste.

2710,"From a start, CB is implemented by closing non essential services and schools so tat people can reduce the contact in public as the risk is higher. By then people instead of staying home, they decided to make use of this free off to do some things as life as usual. Some even go to park to exercise which is nothing wrong if they just responsibly walking or running alone with a safe distance but it is not, most decided to gather close to each other instead of exercise it became a mouth chatting exercise. Perhaps they thought if I am well and can still exercise I should be free from virus, likewise if the other people r doing exercise they should be fine right. So that notion continues to make them so comfortably to behave in that manner. What they didn’t know beside not be responsible to those in the park, those who r complying to the CB strictly by keeping themselves from public feel very frustrated and disappointed too. These group of people exercising but chatting together didn’t care of community responsibility by acting responsibly, your action r giving a wrong examples to young ones and how would u expect others to comply with CB when still a bunch of people still live in the world by themselves ? Dear SG old and young, u r living in one of best country and u r supposed be one of people who have self discipline and society responsible.

2711,"Please spare a thought for parents with no alternatives eg parents who are both essential workers and whose children do not attend school; parents who are struggling with working and caring for their young child(ren) at home while their partners (who are essential workers) take on 12-hour shifts tirelessly; and single parents...amongst others. Many of whom have had their children cared for by grandparents (living in another household) all this while. It is not right to forcefully separate a young child from his parents — just like how it’s not right to force elderly grandparents to look after their young grandchildren 24/7 for nearly a month.   Employers are advised to practise flexibility during this period, but that’s all it is — an advice. For many companies, workloads remain the same, if not more. Employees are expected to always answer a Skype call or ZOOM conference during office hours — who cares if you have a wailing toddler who needs your attention, a sick child to look after, or an infant playing with and eating his own poop?   These measures, albeit implemented in an effort to curb the spread, are but knee jerk reactions that affect an entire country’s citizens. You want to close all non-essential offices, yet it is not possible to stop work completely because this has an impact on the economy — so we are made to work from home; no two hoots given about the difficulties we face both at home and at work. You want to force everyone to stay home, yet you still need your essential workers (which make up a significant number of your population) — many of whom are now lost and helpless after the announcement of these stricter measures.   Please don’t encourage your citizens to boost your population by giving birth to more children if you can’t take care of them. I’m not sure about others, but I’m certainly thankful that I’ve only got one child; and this just made me think twice about having another. ",10/4/2020,0,1
2712,"it's time to rein in on the virus. CB, safe distancing and whatever you have will be wasted if you do not efficiently search out the virus carriers, isolate and contain them. Please do not rely on PHPC as they can only wait 5 days to decide if to get patient to hospital for testing. Some patients even push their luck and ask for 5 more days.  During SARs time SG had 993 and very effectively rounded up all carriers as the disease had high fatality rate. This round if government don't quickly identify the carriers and allow 5 or 10 days to spread, SG will have a hard time solving this COVID problem. A suggestion though is to set up a group of transporters such as grab hirers/taxis (with subsidy by government for each trip)fully geared with PPE and windows wind down for picking up COVID patients. PHPC is then not allowed to provide 5days medical leaves for patient with COVID symptoms. An emergency no. should be dedicated for suspect patients / PHPC to call, and trained transporter to be dispatched to pickup patients at subsidized rate. After swab test patient should be sent back by same transporter and asked to self isolate and quarantine. Once COVID patients are identified, ambulance or trained transporter should be again activated by hospital to bring patient to hospital or designated area for treatment. While there could be a sharp spike of new cases during the first 2 weeks, the cases could eventually taper down quickly once it crosses the peak. The dormitories issue should be treated separately as their isolation and safe distancing are different. Government must quickly provide safe distancing for FWs, identify the sick ones and get them treated  Please help get this done so that SG will not be wasting resources after putting in so much to carry out Circuit  breaker.

IT IS THE MAIN CULPRIT !  COVID-19 VIRUS NEED LESS THAT 0.06 MICRON HEPA FILTERS.  HEPA FILTERS MUST BE DISCARDED AFTER EVERY TRIP.  THIS FILTER CANNOT BE A SHEET, IT MUST BE CORRUGATED TO HANDLE THE VOLUME OF AIRFLOW THROUGH THE MESH.  HAS ANY AIRLINE COMPANY MAINTAINED A HEPA FILTER MAINTENANCE ORDER SHEET SIGNED AND DATED ?  DO THEY HAVE EVIDENCE ??  THE ANSWER IS NO !!  THE USED HEPA FILTER SHOULD BE PLACED AND SEALED IN A PLASTIC BAG; A SPECIFIC BIOHAZARD BAG IS A MUST.  AN AUXILIARY POWER UNIT MUST BE USED TO PROVIDE VENTILATION WHEN THE AIRCRAFT IS ON THE GROUND, BEFORE THE MAIN ENGINES ARE STARTED.  AIRCRAFT MUST HAVE RECIRCULATION SYSTEMS, WHICH RECYCLE LESS THAN 20% OF CABIN AIR; SAME WITH CRUISE SHIPS.  EVERY AIRCRAFT MUST HAVE A HUMIDIFIER TO KEEP HUMIDITY MORE THAN 60% DURING TIMES OF PANDEMIC.  LOW HUMIDITY IS A FRIEND OF COVID-19 VIRUS !

What happens when an infected person who doesn’t know that he/she is infected, does not wear a mask, and unknowingly infects another  healthy person without a mask ?? And the government leaders are saying that non-infected persons don’t need to wear a mask ???   Why did the government allow bulk buying of masks and sanitisers, which were mostly sent to China (from many reports), leaving Singaporeans in a lurch ??   Why did the government not ban visitors from China until so late ?? Too little, too late, it seems. So many infections now, according to reports in the main stream media.  From the exercise to distribute 4 face masks per family in Singapore, one cannot but notice the calm and collected manner in which Singaporeans went about it. That shows that it is not the Singaporeans that are hoarding face masks and sanitisers; and causing a severe shortage. It can only point to visitors and residents from China and other countries buying up as much as possible, to export to their countries of origin. So, instead of lecturing our citizens about hoarding and when NOT to use face masks , the government may do well by stopping the export of face masks and sanitisers.

2809,"Dear Mr Lawrence Wong,  When the government decided to make it compulsory for those returning from China to go on Leave of Absence, did you consider that the majority of these people will be returning to their rented rooms and staying together with their landlords? While not going to work as a precaution to ensure the safety of the general public, landlords and their families are then forced into a situation where they have to be in close proximity to these “suspect” cases 24/7 for 14 days.  These same people will be going to work and going about their daily business as usual.  Does that not contravene the original purpose of your action – which is to safeguard the general public?  Isn’t there a glaring loophole here?  I am a landlord to such a tenant who returned home just yesterday.  And because I am not so unreasonable as to stop her from coming back to my place, I have decided to self-quarantine myself too as I also feel responsible to the general public.  Fortunately, I am self-employed and work from home most of the time and so I can do this.  But I am still inconvenienced as I have to refrain from visiting my elderly mother these two weeks or to meet my son when he books out of BMT for fear he may not be able to book in when he declares this situation to his army superiors.  But what about those landlords and family members who have to go to work?  Wouldn’t it be the same as if the returning Chinese people were not required to go on Leave of Absence at all?  That defeats the purpose of your action in the first place, wouldn’t it?  Last by not least, in this interview here, https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/about-30000-work-pass-holders-from-china-yet-to-return-josephine-teo Mr Shanmugam said and I quote: ""You know they are on leave of absence or home quarantine so that the rest of Singapore, all of us, can be saved. So if they are tossed out onto the streets, where are they going to go? We have to avoid these sorts of irrational actions.""

If you want the people to stop wearing mask when they r not sick, then you have to ensure those who r sick must wear masks in public places. You must enforce and carry out actions such as catching those sick people who do not wear masks in public while coughing, ask for their reasons and give warnings or fine. The gov have to drill into the minds of the group of inconsiderate people to practice social responsibility and practice wearing masks in public when they r sick. Teach people not to sneeze and cough directly into others.

They keep changing rules and regulations like changing diapers and underwear!  Most importantly, they are totally out of touch from the reality on the ground and they lack differential common sense as well!  For a start, how can we actually have confidence in PAP leader who thought Cotton comes from Sheep?   How can we have confidence in leaders who keep changing Rules and Regulations.  From You don't need to wear mask to, compulsory must wear mask.  From food handlers can wear spit guards to spit guards not allowed.  From Face Shields are as good as face mask to Face Shield can only be used  when social distancing is possible to face mask is default!  It really makes people wonder whether they know exactly what they are doing in the first place!   Putting on a mask or face shield or even a spit guard will have Two functions with varying degree of effectiveness. It is PROTECTION from infection by others and PREVENTION of infecting others.  In order to understand what are suitable in different situations, we must understand the nature of how this virus spread.   The virus spread by large and tiny droplets of saliva and mucus. It may also be spread by aerosal.  It can spread through speaking, coughing or sneezing.   Although I am no expert but common sense tell us that as long as ALL people could prevent their droplets of mucus or saliva from getting spread to other people through speaking, coughing or sneezing, everyone will be protected by such preventive measures.   In the context of UNIVERSAL Masking, the most important function is Prevention of spreading saliva and mucus to others, while Protection from infection will become secondary.  Thus, no matte what, we must ensure that everyone should put on something which will PREVENT WEARERS from spreading saliva and mucus to others EFFECTIVELY.  Between a Plastic Shield vs a piece of paper based mask, which will be more effective in preventing water droplets from passing through and spread to others?   That's a no brainer question.   I have dealt with face mask sourcing and there is something called Splash Test.   Surgical masks have to pass the Splash test  by blocking up to 95% of fine droplets before it could be certified effective.  Splash test is a simulation of saliva and mucus  being cough out or sneeze out at a certain pressure.   Many of the face masks in the market are actually not certified or even tested!   Cloth mask which are not made of non woven material will have doubtful effectiveness as well.   A plastic shield or even a plastic spit guard will definitely be more effective that a paper mask which is not tested or certified.  Spit guard may have much weaker prevention of infection by others due to the fact it is open on the top but it is close to the mouth as well as the nose. Whatever sneeze, coughing or saliva from wearer will be effectively blocked right at the outlets of mouth or nostrils.  Face shield protects the eyes, mouth and nose, from direct hit while at the same time prevent droplets from straight trajectory. The only weakness is that droplets could still drop directly downward from the mouth. But as long as no one is position below the wearer, that's pretty OK.  Face shield may not be suitable for MRT or buses because there might be people sitting below the wearer. Other than that it is perfectly alright in the context of universal masking!  Face shields with proper cover on the forehead provides good protection for most situation. It should be made mandatory for those who are jogging or exercising where they can't wear face mask.   When you are exercising, you will be breathing out heavily and there will be occasional cough or sneezing. Thus it is illogical to exempt those who are jogging from putting up a face shield or at the very least, a spit guard!  If those highly paid headless chicken had really walk around and observe, they will realize that a lot of people will wear their masks with nostrils exposed.   Due to our hot weather, a lot of expats and people from temperate countries are not used to wearing a face mask under hot sun and high humidity. This is why we can see so many Caucasians are resistance to wearing masks.  Not to mention those who work as hawkers and cooks in hot kitchens. It is impractical and unnecessary for them to wear face masks when a spit guard would be more sustainable and effective.  Most people have misconception of universal masking. They were thinking more on the Protection function rather than the more important function of Prevention in the context of Universal Masking where everyone is putting on something in front of their mouths and noses.   Well, I would not take issue when people have such mistaken view or concept which made them coming to the wrong conclusion about Face Mask and Spit Guard, but for THOSE SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT and Highly paid Experts, Civil Servants and Ministers to be so clueless about Universal Masking, that's really TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  Well if they are really clueless, just learn from the very front line country, China!  Right from the start, they have put up a comprehensive masking directive cater to different situations and scenario. They classify situations into High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk...Etc.   They differentiate between different types of masks and now, they encourage the use of face shield in practical and pragmatic situations.   How could our HIGHEST PAID Ministers in the world become so mediocre in comparison to the Chinese counterparts who are only paid a fraction of their salary?   How could Singaporeans have any confidence left in PAP leadership if they can't even get such simple things right?",1/6/2020,1,1

The experts here can only GUESS the 'possibilities' of what is happening.  There are many ways of improving your own immune system to act as immunity against any viral infection. Studies have shown a 90% reduction of severe symptoms just by taking Vit D. Cleaning up your diet by eating whole foods and reducing processed foods works too.  Weigh the benefits and risks by asking the doctor to list them out to you. Don't just believe that the 'benefits outweigh the risks' narrative repeated everywhere. The ONLY benefit I could see so far is the reduction in severe illness.  Another reminder. Other than the 29 deaths here, all the rest of the survivors recovered. We are certainly not in any emergency. This experimental drug is not approved by FDA. Go check it out yourself. It's only approved for Emergency Use. Understand the difference!",30/1/21,0,1

4596,Thank you for lifting some SD measures so the economy can restart to gear 1 again. But I must say that there are still many disobedient selfish residents who still disobey the previously imposed SD rules until today and the enforcement is very lacking even today when I visited Bedok Mall to buy some essentials I saw a person standing at the entrance exit of the mall eating and with mask on chin. He's probably very hungry but at least can eat in the car or some corner away from public. Nobody bother to stop him and no ambassador was in sight to advise him otherwise. I hope the authority can place more emphasis on enforcement and rid the society of these selfish people that will lengthen the CB period than it already had.,2/6/2020,0,1

When Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan remove a safe distancing sticker from the seat of an MRT train, isn't it allowing people to gather together in a compact close space in the train.

I would like to suggest the govt should enforce employers to have staggered shift for reporting to work. Work from home should first be enforce follow by staggering shift. Employers will not follow if govt just says it is advice. Many employers still don't buy the ideas of WFH. They will adopt traditional way because employers don't trust employees working independently out of office. After COViD-19 life will never be back to pre COViD. It will new normal.

MOE did little little to high classroom density (1:35 teacher to child ratio) to futureproof against future covid-X attacks.  In contrast, MOM does more for dormitory workers.  High classroom density does not make sound safe-distancing sense.  As parents , we hope more sustainable and permanent efforts to reduce the high classroom density.

However, this is not happening easily, leaving many ID, contractors and home owners in a very frustrating and binding position. My family has been deeply affected. Our house don’t even have a main door due to sudden suspension of work. A home is the basic necessity of a family and with seniors as well as an infant in the home, we are living in uncertainty everyday. Thus far, the BCA procedure has been ineffective, confusing and very frustrating. While my ID has received approval, many of her sub contractors have not. In addition, there were insufficient slots for workers to sign up for the safety course and swap test that needs to be done before work can resume. This could take weeks or even months to complete. We need this procedure to be reviewed in order for the much needed suspended work to resume. It is meant to be prioritized right after circuit breaker so let’s make it a priority.

But with Phase 1, dont even say Phase 3, with the opening to allow more people to go to work, maybe you can advise or suggest how possible is it to do it, rather than just say should still practice safe distancing in trains. Everyone knows, should. But how?? Your suggestions may not get a reply, i believe they are also trying to figure out a way on how to do it. Like what, from Pasir Ris once full with people at all markings and seats taken up with 3 empty seats between them, dont allow anymore people to board when reach Tampines? Doors dont open and continue to Simei? Or put up a bell to press like on buses to indicate you want to alight, so that from that door if 3 alight only 3 can board? Cmon, give suggestions for them to consider and think also. Its simply not possible. CB period can be done, cos not many people out there.

By implementing the 3phase I think is a very good move.  But still we see alot pple not complying the rules so how can we help ??  By calling police ?  By telling them wear mask ?  By reminding them ???   I been highlight n cakes the police at least 10 times me n my neighbours that my BLK 678 hougang AVE 8 #01-519  everyday 530am to 6am  More than 15 pple are gathered to buy veg   No one came   So I'm quite disappointed to see such.  Here we are all working so hard n complying the rules but other such pple jus break it.   All elderly everyday they jus gathered to wait for the veg vendor to reach   I hope n urge Mr Lee pls assist   Thank you very much,1/6/2020,0,1

4976,"Dear Mr Lee  My house renovation works was stopped when the CB was implemented. I understand the need to do so.  However, today my renovation Contractors tell me that they cannot start work after 2 june on my 90% completed house because of bureaucracy and delay in getting their required certification and approval from the authorities even though they have made applications more an a week ago since the announcement by you were made.  The earliest they can start is in end June ( almost a month later)because they are allocated that timing for them to do the online test???   They all tell me they are ready and will follow the measures implemented but the timeline announced by the government is not realistic due to the current obstacles they are facing😓.  Please explain what is happening? Why make such optimistic announcements when on the ground it is not ready or possible to start. Hope you can look into this hiccups and bottlenecks with the relevant authorities.   We, home owners are suffering and being constantly being chased by Contractors and suppliers to deliver and complete their obligations as they are incurring holding and other cost and we are also incurring cost ourselves as we cannot shift into our homes.  We all understand the need to be cautious but why make such announcements when on the ground it is not helping us all. Some of the other homeowners that I spoke to express their frustrations too as our contractor are push around by the various departments when they try to expedite this process.   Please assist to address this in your coming discussions and next parliament session during this difficult time.   Hope to obtain a favourable reply soon ",1/6/2020,0,1

So the benefit at this stage to the country vis-a-vis the risks we are importing does not quite add up. Should we not consider further tightened custom control? As an example,I was somewhat surprised to learn that we still have inbound flights   coming in from Chennai, Mumbai and New Delhi today (total pax size of 600), of which there are numerous old folks and kids when India is in the midst of a lock-down and our country into the first week of heightened measures.

Focus the Gov machinery on over-communicating on stay-home and mask-wearing. Blanket the airwaves. Sound the air raid siren every day. Tell people to show solidarity to the nurses and doctors risking their lives by wearing a mask as a totem of solidarity.   Wrt to saving plastic food containers. We have an integrated PE value chain in Singapore and plenty of finished goods(plastic container) manufacturers with production lines that are happy to run 24/7. With estimates as high as 60% of F&B outlet facing bankruptcy according to their own trade association - we won't run out of food containers in Singapore but we will and can squander the next 28-days. Focus and beyond over-communicate. Minimize Yak-shaving, bikeshedding - aka ""when you're up to your neck in alligators, it's hard to remember that your initial objective was to drain the swamp"".  The German federation has made mask-wearing as a major return to work plank to complement social distancing. The Taiwanese have emphasised mask-wearing over physical spacing.

I understand why this may be necessary to contain the infection rates.  But I have some concerns.  (1) why is my mom still required to go to work at a childcare Center to take care of the children to essential service workers when she cannot look after my child.  (2) why are we still silent about elderly workers going to work in essential services, (3) Can there be exceptions made to allow us to at least go to our parents house for childcare if we meet stringent conditions like we don’t go out of the homes (order food in), we only go to parents house in our own car. Hope the Task Force can consider this.  (4) Can the government or task force help explain why there is a flip flop of the rule on dropping kids with grandparents within a day.  This can help many Singaporeans accept the decision better.  For your consideration pls.  ",10/4/2020,0,1

Not only their attitude was bad, they even scolded others for squeezing through passed them. The disgusting thing about this couple is that their attitude changed completely and they became super polite and civil when they saw a social distancing ambassador who witnessed the incident, and even tried to explain that they were in their sixties and walked slowly. BTW, there was a lift at the bridge the couple could take. More importantly, if they are old they should not be even going out and about. Isn't this against what the government had advised - that the elderly should stay home and not venture out?  Apart from the circuit measures the government has introduced, it is also important for the government to educate our senior citizens on their manners and hygiene. Since I returned home around six years ago from overseas where I was based for more than a decade, I’ve encountered so many of our senior citizens who have this ‘I and old and am always right’ attitude with absolutely no concept of personal hygiene, coughing and sneezing openly and even spitting anywhere and whenever they like.

5831,"Today I encountered a selfish Singaporean couple in their sixties who walked by side along the stairs up a bridge and refused to give way to the others even when they were asked to be excused. Not only was their attitude bad, they even scolded others for squeezing through them. The disgusting thing about this couple is that their attitude changed completely and became super polite when they saw a social distancing ambassador around who witnessed the incident, and  explained then that they were in their sixties and had to walk  slowly. BTW, there’s a lift which the couple could have used. More importantly, they are elderly and should stay home and not leave home if they can’t even walk normally.   Apart from the circuit measures that the government has introduced, it is also important for the government to educate our senior citizens on their manners and hygiene. Since I returned home from overseas where I was based for more than a decade, I’ve encountered so many of our senior citizens who have this ‘I and old and am always right’ attitude with no concept of personal hygiene at all, coughing and sneezing openly and even spitting anywhere and whenever they like. Like what Dr Tommy Koh had said “Singapore is a First World country with Third World citizens”. I can now see where Dr Koh is coming from.",10/4/2020,1,1

5860,"Prof. Knut Wittkowski, which has been an epidemiologist for 35 years and has been modeling epidemics for 35 years. He worked for 15 years with Klaus Dietz, a leading epidemiologist who coined the term “reproduction number”, on the Epidemiology of HIV before heading for 20 years the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at The Rockefeller University, New York.   He says: With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity. About 80% of the people need to have had contact with the virus, and the majority of them won’t even have recognized that they were infected, or they had very, very mild symptoms, especially if they are children. So, it’s very important to keep the schools open and kids mingling to spread the virus to get herd immunity as fast as possible, and then the elderly people, who should be separated, and the nursing homes should be closed during that time, can come back and meet their children and grandchildren after about 4 weeks when the virus has been exterminated…. We are experiencing all sorts of counterproductive consequences of not well-thought-through policy….  Well, we will see maybe a total of fewer cases—that is possible. However, we will see more cases among the elderly, because we have prevented the school children from creating herd immunity. And so, in the end, we will see more death because the school children don’t die, it’s the elderly people who die, we will see more death because of this social distancing….  If we had herd immunity now, there couldn’t be a second wave in autumn. Herd immunity lasts for a couple of years, typically, and that’s why the last SARS epidemic we had in 2003, it lasted 15 years for enough people to become susceptible again so that a new epidemic could spread of a related virus. Because typically, there is something that requires cross-immunity, so if you were exposed to one of the SARS viruses, you are less likely to fall ill with another SARS virus. So, if we had herd immunity, we wouldn’t have a second wave. However, if we are preventing herd immunity from developing, it is almost guaranteed that we have a second wave as soon as either we stop the social distancing or the climate changes with winter coming or something like that….  [Extreme reactions] cost the US taxpayer $2 trillion, in addition to everything else that it costs, but it also has severe consequences for our social life, and depression is definitely something that we will be researching. I can say for myself, walking through New York City right now is depressing….  We should be resisting, and we should, at least, hold our politicians responsible. We should have a discussion with our politicians. One thing we definitely need to do, and that would be safe and effective, is opening schools. Let the children spread the virus among themselves, which is a necessity to get herd immunity. That was probably one of the most destructive actions the government has done. We should focus on the elderly and separating them from the population where the virus is circulating. We should not prevent the virus from circulating among school children, which is the fastest way to create herd immunity…. And the final question and answer:  “So, is there anything else you want to say about this that—what’s been aggravating you the most? Or what would you like people to know?”  I think people in the United States and maybe other countries as well are more docile than they should be. People should talk with their politicians, question them, ask them to explain, because if people don’t stand up to their rights, their rights will be forgotten.  https://www.aier.org/article/stand-up-for-your-rights-says-professor-knut-m-wittkowski/",9/4/2020,1,1

Due to our structural limitations, and that migrant workers are essentially younger, fitter and healthier, perhaps we may explore a form of “herd immunity” strategy to mitigate this crisis provided that infected symptoms are mild or asymptomatic, not in danger and that welfare prioritized.  Recovered patients can voluntarily donate plasma to help speedy recoveries of their friends.  Recovered patients can become and add to our increasing “immunized” core migrant workforce numbers to further help our economy and start more virtuous cycles.  Our best and brightest scientists can study this and plan this into a workable strategy and maybe the world may also start their own workable “herd immunity” strategy which is safer for the population.",17/4/20,0,1

6256,"We have had overlooked the FW angle in this crisis. The possibility of future outbreaks exist so post CB should be carefully planned  1. Although it may affect human rights or privacy , a tracing app should be made mandatory for all. The app is installed automatically on all mobile phones by the telco . Visitors are not to be exempted . We need to work out the security and this app disabled on departure for visitors. ( Perhaps we can work out an agreement among the ASEAN members) 2. It may be difficult to put back all the FW into the dorm again and alternatives cannot be produced overnight .  Suggest that the temporary accommodations be used as long as practicable such as yet to be demolished HDBs , empty schools , empty barracks etc. Floatels and cruise ships are just too expensive .  3. In the long run , we have to consider seriously the question of FW accommodations . It is impossible to have hygienic communal toilets and kitchens . Remember all those SIT flats that were torn down.

Please add just a few more measures: give all infected persons with mild symptoms and frontline personnel vitamins A, C, D and zinc (10,000 IU, 1000 mg, 5000 IU and 30 mg every day); ensure all meals are low in sugar and refined carbohydrates but rich in vegetables, fruits and fibre; and add a serving or two of yogurt with live cultures every day. They must have adequate protein in their meals. And make sure they all have 15 minutes sun exposure on large areas of their bodies between 10am to 4pm. Dark-skinned folks will need to spend more time under the sun (2-4X). These measures will give them internal qi to fight the infection or prevent frontline from getting struck down by the virus.

6292,"Dear Mr Lee, I have some suggestions on how to combat the pandemic outbreak. There is much we can learn from how South Korea successfully arrested the outbreak after a terrifying start.   Firstly, we need to significantly ramp up testing so as to identify the infected, especially the asymptomatic ones. I watched a video in which a South Korean medical expert explained that the main reason why they could contain what seemed like widespread community transmission was by extensively testing the population so that the infected could be quarantined. Even though South Korea's situation is now under control, they still have public booths available for any member of the public to be tested.   Contrast that to Singapore's situation. My friend who was sick visited a clinic and requested for a coronavirus test but was rejected. He was deemed not to exhibit sufficient symptoms to be tested. But hasn't the coronavirus been proven to be asymptomatic? In light of that, we should not be turning people away for tests. We have to be more proactive in order to quickly identify the infected before the spread worsens.   I understand there is a political price with extensive testing, as the numbers could significantly increase. Indeed the South Korean president was initially embarrassed by the speed of the outbreak, but his willingness to swallow the bitter pill has won him the respect of his people as he managed to arrest the outbreak. His party won a resounding electoral victory. We too must swallow the bitter pill in order to stop the outbreak.   Secondly, may I suggest that we get the best PITs from the SAF to design some home-based fitness routines for all ages. In the absence of a vaccine, the best medicine to fight the virus is exercise. Exercising is crucial in building up our immune system, which is an important way for us to fight off the coronavirus. It is also a good way to relax our mind and cost nothing. We can air exercise routines live on tv, and encourage everyone to participate at home. This is a good way for the nation to bond in this time of crisis. ",17/4/20,1,1

For the population at large to be able to grasp the effectiveness of the CB measures for which they are taking ownership of, 2 sets of curves must be shown(community & FW).

Please spare a thought for them and everyone involved by being socially responsible and offer our sincere concerns with constructive feedbacks. During such critical period , everyone including foreign workers must trust and work together with the authorities . Each and everyone of us has a part to play and should to a certain extent be personally responsible for ourselves. Thank you PM Mr Lee sir , frontline warriors and everyone involved for your efforts and sacrifices during the pandemic.🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼👍👍👍",16/4/20,1,1

Because nobody knows which dormitories are already infected and how many are.   After 100% test, those confirmed cases are to be separated out immediately for quarantine. Those tested negative are to continue stay in their dorms for another 3 weeks or so. Then the testing n monitoring process continues.  We will also need to look into the welfare of our maids. Probably previously they have made contact with friends in the dormitories. To play safe, or kiasu, it should be compulsory for employers to send their maids to go for test.

While the exponential increase in the cases is a cause of concern, it's also a real opportunity for us Singaporeans, 4G leaders and young Singaporeans who may not have gone through ww2 to go through the baptism of fire.   Comments from other countries media have pointed that the 2nd wave of transmission has knocked us off our feet. It has. The question is how we bounce back. Bouncing back with ingunity and guts lets us learn a better lesson than if we had got by with solutions such as hotel stays at rasa Sentosa. We want to be remembered for bouncing back, beating the curve, being able to continue our lives after the CB. That shall be our gold standard.   It is clear that the leaders are moving away from the strong statesmen approach of the yesterday towards a consultative, multi agency, evidence based approach. We all have to rise to the challenge. The 3 prong approach does not sound aggressive enough. In time to come, more solutions will be need to be deployed to solve the issue of migrant workers density.

So in the end, if the agency and Ministry had been Responsible in the JOB, the workers will comply in keeping the place clean, Why, because if they don't,  they would lose their place of stay hence losing their jobs ! Yes, old habits die hard, but to them, No Job for them,  they die harder. I don't think we are here to point finger on who's at fault, we are just saying, if one have make a mistake,  admit it and change. No one is perfect. Where as on why they use their hand to eat, most of them are Muslims, this is how they eat, but they only use their right hand after washing. Why they eat on the floor, grassland, do they have a choice? Can you get a table to dine in the middle of nowhere if they are working in the construction site? Obviously she doesn't know about this, I know because I'd worked in construction site, shipyard and earthworks areas.

Some of my workers have food poisoning after eating the food... How is this accepted and allowed? We, as employer want to take care of them and want to supply edible and better food for these workers yet not allowed. When we feedback to dormitory operator, they say it’s under MOM care but when we inform MOM, they feedback it’s dormitory operator care, SO who should we really look for to change?

The latest mask really looks good but I found that the filter is really difficult to be assembled to the mask. Please spare few minutes to try it and I am sure you will be aware of the issue. Further more, the filter will not be able seamlessly cover the edges of the mask, the air will take the least resistance path during breathing. This makes the filter basically useless. The previous distribution of DET30 mask does not have all these issues. I whole heartily give this feedback and hopefully the procurement for the mask will make more effort to try out before mass purchase of the masks, to give better products to all of us and to ensure money well spent..

7023,"How are can emulate Vietnam with zero COVID death toll. Firstly Vietnamese already using masks for umpteen years when riding motorcycles as their primary mode of travel which is also self-isolation travel rather than public buses. So these effectively prevent mass infections. Maybe our government if they think carefully should reintroduced PMD (Personal Mobility Devices) and also allow these PMDs on the road rather than pavement while shifting the buses lane to the middle lane and only filter to the left when stopping for the few passengers instead. Likewise, the SMART super long buses are actually quite empty wasting public funds and we should now focus on using mini-vans like in Hongkong. Generic routes are considered inefficient nowadays. With mobile Apps passengers can book the travel in advance and regional mini-vans will use AI or databases SQL to match their destination and pickup times to optimize fuel and costs.  https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/29/a...hnk/index.html",30/5/20,1,0

However, our FW's are now sequestered and receiving their due care, and, businesses are suffering, albeit, there is evidence from Germany of a second wave. It maybe be prudent to be patient and err on the side of safer model. Another pet peeve of mine is petrol prices.

7202,"Dear PM, I learned today the new cases came down to 486 but it’s because one of our labs is not working.  This means if we had more testing capacity, we would find more cases.  I also learned today that the UK has a similar problem... their labs are too slow and as a result, they sent 50,000 samples to the US for testing.  I really think we should collect a lot more test samples from the dorms and ask Korea for support to test some of the samples for us.  As we ramp up to 40,000 tests a day, and if Korea can help us to test quickly, say, 100,000 in the next couple days, we should be able to isolate all the infected.  Today, there are still hundreds and hundreds of infected foreign workers in the dorms not showing symptoms yet and they continue to spread the virus.  Sending samples to Korea for testing while we ramp up our capacity is the best way to quickly isolate all the infected.",11/5/2020,1,1

May we who have the flexibility to care for our children when their schools close remember those children who will go hungry with no school meals. May we who have to cancel our trips remember those with no place to go. May we who are losing our margin money  in the tumult of the economic market remember those who have no margin at all. May we who settle in for quarantine at home remember those who have no home. As fear grips our country let us choose love.

My family member is currently staying at Swissotel The Stamford Ram 1056 and she is experiencing difficulty in breathing due to an allergy to smoke. Yes, since yesterday she could smell cigarette smoke several times a day in the bathroom. Multiple complaints have been lodged with the hotel managers but this still did not stop. Someone is smoking in the hotel room and I’m appalled and offended that the hotel has no contingency plan to deal with this. A change of room is planned pending approval from the authorities and it’s been 4 hours since this request was made but still the approval is pending. I’m very concerned about this as smoking in the room is against the law, a safety hazard and a medical hazard to my family member. I ask for your help before any bad happens.

I have just heard that some pupils whose parents have been identified as workers of essential services have been allowed to go to school everyday. However, this constant contact of the teachers in rotation and these children puts even more people at risk of infections! Not just the children but the teachers who have families would be at risk as well. I understand that the teachers are rotated to ensure contact tracing is possible, but contact tracing does not mean no infections. There must be an end to this.  You would argue that it is necessary for us to support the families of those who are in essential services but yet we don't do the same accommodations during month long or week long school breaks which just goes to show that these children do have other caretaking arrangements that are possible! Not to mention, the criteria for these children to qualify is extremely low, only one of the parents need to be in essential services to qualify for their child to continue physical attendance at school.

7435,"Dear Mr Prime Minister,  I call your attention to the rapidly rising price of essential foodstuff such as rice, which had risen by 11% since March this year. (From . $625/metric ton to $699/metric ton, source: indexmundi.com)  As an island with neither land nor natural resources, it is a worrying trend that our sources of basic necessities are not as secure as we might think, when countries where we import our usual essentials such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia are reeling just as badly from this plague.   As much as handing out financial aids might assist poor families, it is all pointless if the price of essentials raise to the point where no amount of money can afford. Hyperinflation is a real threat, and there is no sign in the weeks to come that the issue can just be wished away. Also, unlike the 2007-8 hyperinflation, the price of commodities this time is driven by an existential crisis - it is not artificial debt that is driving the price up, but the existence of a reliable supply.  I believe we should call attention to our pressing needs at this moment and consider food and fuel rationing. Put a clean stop to food/water/electric wastage, and issue food stamps. I can only pray that my gloomy predictions are unfounded, but in these days of crisis, the only thing that one can trust is oneself - unless there are sufficient reasons for otherwise.

That way, residents can simply go down stairs at their own convenience, open their locked mailboxes and get the package. Instead, its become so bureaucratic and inefficient. Must go to a RC or CC designated to your block, must line up don't know for how long, must go within such and such hours, must show IC, etc. We are trying to avoid being the public as much as possible, but this is forcing us to expose ourselves in the line ups. Also, the poor volunteers in the RC and CC are seeing thousands of people coming in, and they are also getting exposed to potential carriers of the virus. ",2/2/2020,0,1

7792,"Dear Mr Lee, Happy CNY! I'm a new Singapore citizen, who just accompanied my relatives to ICA in the hope of extending their short term visit pass this morning. My aunt and uncle, who are both over 60 years old, arrived in Singapore from Harbin on Jan 7th and didn't go anywhere outside of Singapore after their arrival. Their daughter, my cousin, and her husband are both PR but they aren't qualified to apply LTVP for my aunt and uncle. But when they visit yearly, they sometimes make use of the normal one-time, one-month extension to spend a time longer than one month with family. Yesterday, their extension application was rejected. We also saw on CNA that extension to short term visa is suspended. We went to ICA very early this morning to try to find out if any kind of appeal was possible, and the answer was no. Even though Scoot airline had already canceled their original flight that was scheduled for Feb 6th, the officers told us we have to book them tickets from other airlines for them to go back before the one month visa expires. Outside ICA Level 4 waiting area and around the information counter, the whole area was filled with Chinese families, and what looked like two hundred people, all having the same hope of not having the option of extension cut off. After all, these family members arrived early enough in January and didn't go to China again. But there was no exception. Some officers said they sympathize that people's family members have to go back to China at a risky time even though they don't pose threat in Singapore, and that they couldn't get an extension all in a sudden, the officers had no choice but following the new instructions. I would like to tell you how saddening it is for us to send our families back to China right now, when just two days ago we felt lucky that they arrived early enough, they could still use the extension of 30 days to avoid the risk of catching the virus back in China. I'm trying my best to get in touch with Singapore officials who might be able to consider a more appropriate action at this time. Do you think this action alone by ICA is absolutely necessary? Thank you and best regards, Tianshu",31/1/20,0,1
7793,"Dear PM Lee, refering to the latest announcement from MOH https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/extension-of-precautionary-measures-to-minimise-risk-of-community-spread-in-singapore. Just few days ago, 4G leader Ong Ye Kung said ""己不欲勿施于人"" when being asked whether Singapore should consider a total travel ban from China. Now, with this announcement, it is a sheer slap in his own face. Some more, this new measure is not only targeting travellers from mainland China, but also affect all PRC passport holders from the rest of the world. Can you imagine a PRC passport holder who stayed in Australia or Japan wants to travel or transit in Singapore and banned from doing so?  Can you help to clarify why this measure has to target nationalities or specific passport holders?",31/1/20,1,1

7803,"Sir, Just my humble opinion. I am worried.  Because i think It is a not a good idea for the distribution of masks to all residents in Singapore, to be done by getting people to come to the RC centres and community centres because,  1) The chances of getting virus infection will be increased thousands of times as crowds of millions of people, including the old and the handicapped , line up , and infect each other with viruses , which defeat the very purpose of having masks ,and 2) it is so unproductive for people to take leave , just to go collect those masks and 3) Its a waste of time of so many volunteers to help in the distribution exercise and 4) A smart idea would be to just get the post office delivery men , to open up the back of the mail boxes at bottom of each block of HDB flats and then slot in all the masks into all the letter boxes, and this could be done within a few seconds for each block of flat. Imagine the huge time savings ,and getting the task done so quickly and efficiently , compared to getting millions of people to spend hours going to RC centres and community centres to Q up ,and having hundreds of thousands people infecting each other with viruses .  Please do consider my humble opinion, to do the distribution of masks, through mail box.  Thank you",1/2/2020,0,1

7809,We appreciate the gesture and efforts .. however won’t it be more effective if these masks were be mailed out to individual households instead of having someone to collect ?   Firstly the mobilisation of manpower and logistics be massive and expensive considering the suddenness of the demand ...!  Secondly large crowd would descend to the collection centres and this is definitely not a good idea for people to crowd around waiting to collect ...!!!   The cost would be negligible considering the light weight and compactness of the masks.   And conveniences of receiving the masks by post would certainly also prevent mass hysteria should certain popular centres run out the masks ...not to mention the inconveniences of a family member having to make time just to collect 4 masks ..!!!!,30/1/20,1,1
7810,"Dear Mr Lee, we appreciate the gesture of allocating 4 masks per household. However, the govt should also consider during these times to mandate that GPs give out at least one mask to patients who are genuinely unwell. We visited a reputed medical chain yesterday as a family member was down with cough and cold. We asked for one mask as we did not have any and were unable to get any. However, we were told that the clinic does not supply ANY mask. We were not asking to buy a whole box, just ONE mask for the sick patient. And our request was denied. I find this practice highly illogical especially in such times given that patients who are unwell should be wearing masks and yet the clinic in question is not able to provide. And meanwhile, the sick patient is spreading the virus around because there are no masks available! BTW, this is not an isolated experience at just one clinic!",31/1/20,1,1

7835,"Dear PM, I do agree the purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent spreading the virus if one is sick.  BUT to avoid getting the virus from the sick who is not wearing mask, it’s still safer better for us to wear mask if one understand well the whole picture.  In Singapore, even in this sensitive time, it is still common to see people with coughs and running nose not wearing mask because most of us don’t have the habit of wearing mask when they having flu cough running nose.  And on this Wuhan virus, seriously we don’t know who is having the early symptoms of the virus when you are in the public.  This issue of masks to Singaporean and PR in the Community Centres can be worrying too if it create a contained crowd, cos I feel it is better to avoid crowd places.  4 masks for each household is seriously barely enough in this risky time.

7981,"I'm not convinced this is a good idea at all. During SARS we learned that these masks get damp due to the water vapour in exhaled breath and the damp cloth provides a surface for the virus to attach, thus actually increasing the risk of infection. Hence the best advice is that only those with an infection should wear them. I guess the government has a short memory.",30/1/20,1,0
7982,"I do not quite agree that only people feeling unwell need to wear masks. I read from a doctor in China only today that infected people rarely show symptoms like nose block and running nose. That basically makes it difficult for others to differentiate them from healthy people. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the virus can spread so fast in Wuhan. I can understand that the current stock of surgical masks is inadequate to meet demand. However, whoever has the mask now should be advised to wear it especially when in crowded places. This will effectively minimize the prospect of a widespread outbreak of the Wuhan virus in our communities. We never can tell whether there are healthy carriers walking around at the moment especially among people who have just returned from China. So ideally, we should have everyone wearing mask in public as soon as supply is adequate to enable us to do so. 小心驶得万年船。",30/1/20,1,1

This might potentially alleviate the mass hysteria problem of everyone buying masks.   There is one point though which I disagree... “Masks are only for unwell people and you do not need it if you are well” I can’t control if people sneeze or cough at me, at least I can control/minimise the droplets from getting into my mouth and nose... I would say that’s darn important... even it’s a 5percent increased chance of avoiding the virus. I’ll take it.  I’ma chemo patient and my immunity is weak! A simple cough can causes me a serious infection and pneumonia is instant death. I could use that 5 percent.  So even without the Wuhan virus or not, I hope education on this subject matter gets around more to the people of Singapore.   We simply need to wash our hands as often as we can and avoid touching our faces so much. Wear a mask if you are sick but also wear a mask if you’re more prone to sickness too.  I love SIngapore.

KIndly correct  your  ministers  for  their  baseless  remarks  where  this  is  concerned.  They  need to  govern  and  listen with  a  heart.  Glad  to  know  more  solid  steps  are  being  taken  compared  to  the  initial  half-baked  ones.  I  hope  the  government  will  do  contact  tracing  and  get  hold  of  those  who  entered  our  shores  once  the  news  of  the  virus  broke out  and  quarantine  them  or  get  them  to  go  back.    They  are  so  many  and  it’s  important  to  trace  who  are  the  ones  from  Hubei  (not  just  recent)  and  to  follow  through.  As for the government’s advice re wearing of masks. Since you all dont take mrt trains and buses, you dont understand that there are many coughing and sneezing in the carriages without covering their mouths or wearing a mask.  We  face  that  every  time  we  take  the  train.  So the advice that there is no need to wear a mask if generally well, is not the right advice because we may be well but there  are  others who have no qualms spreading their germs.

To minimise this risk, can I propose having a hotline (in different languages) for individuals suspected of being contracted with the virus to call in.  A trained operator can assist the caller with basic questions like those answered by the polyclinic hotline to help us determine whether to visit a polyclinic. This new Wuhan Virus hotline will allow individuals to determine if one’s chance of being a suspected case is high.  If the result is affirmative, the trained operator can advise the caller to stay where he/she is or moved to a less crowded place and send a special transportation to transport the individual to a designated location for further testing before determining if quarantine measures are required.

That means you can spread without even knowing you yourself is the carrier. You wear a mask only when you're unwell? By the time you're unwell, everyone else is alrdy infected.  Maybe some of you guys dont go around the neighbourhoods or take public transport that's why you dont understand how theres tons of irresponsible people out there coughing at peoples face. Irresponsible aside, theres also those who dont see the seriousness in this, the older generation especially. Pretty sure they will only start wearing if the government tells them to and emphasize the severity of the situation.   Sorry to be rude but please wake up. If you want to convince us that its not a severe case yet for us all to be wearing mask, then show us some scientific proof that we're safe without doing so. You should know by now the generation now are educated, we're not like the older generation who will just believe you saying it's alright and continue coughing at people's face.",29/1/20,1,1

We know your addressed the general  masses as 'fellow Singaporeans' but CCS called us idiots. Is he saying this on a personal capacity  or is he representing the government to air his displeasure.   He further reiterated the reason/rational of telling Singaporeans to wear a mask only if you are sick it seems there is a hidden agenda; there is not enough masks to go around as opposed to other MP saying there is ample in the stockpile. Please address this pertinent query, as a Singaporean i am entitled to know. His derogatory mannerism is beyond tolerance. So far, we have not heard you as a Head of the country coming out to clarify his behaviour. I am utterly dismay at his command of the English language, it sets me wondering what has happened to our bilingualism policy.

8577,"Dear PM Lee,  first I really appreciate the measures that our country has taken including setting up quarantine facilities ; providing free masks and many others.  You, your leaders and many are working very hard to help manage and contain the situation.  But at the same time,  I am feeling very frustrated and worried with the climbing number of cases in SG.  All the cases are Chinese nationals who arrived SG on 19th Jan and after.  At that time, we already knew about the Virus, its source City Wuhan, and that it is highly infectious, spreading and taking lives .  So why did we still allow them to enter Singapore and freely move about. This is a burning question. Why we seemed slow to act towards this? As a result, SG though a very small country is now ranked top 3 behind China and Thailand.   Can we act fast and step up more effective measures before it is too late.  As the saying goes... you got to nip it at the bud.  We got to stop people from the high risk Country ( and not just Wuhan city) from coming into our land . Or at least they should be quarantined upfront for 2 weeks upon arrival before joining our civilization.  The schools and companies are already stepping up measures and asking those who have been to China or been in close contact with such ;  to stay away from their premises .  But their efforts alone are not going to be enough.  We need our Country to do the same and stop them on our shores.   Second,  those from Wuhan who are still amongst us, can we trace and quarantine-  so that we don’t have new cases each day and they have already made contact with many others by then.  I seek your consideration and hope to hear your responses.  We continue to look to your leadership , vigilance and courage to protect our country, our home, our people.  Let’s unite and stand up for Singapore.  Respectfully yours ....",28/1/20,1,1

Scientists have found that dried SARS CoV can retain its viability for 5 days in temperature between 22 and 25 degree celsius. At higher temperature of 38 degree and humidity >95% its viability is rapidly lost.  So we should  not create an ambient environment for these viruses to grow.

But I think to wear it all day long outdoors is almost impossible as it is both uncomfortable to start off with apart from the fact you need to take it off at some point. Cleanliness and strict hygiene helps but the  critical point is still, I   think would be that of a temporary ban of travellers from China. It would be appropriate to safeguard our health interests due to the very nature of the coronavirus. 1 month ban would do.  Apart from this, I would like to suggest home based learning and working instead of travelling out for the time being. We should make use of technology to get us through this period.  Perhaps ordering food and groceries could be made via online too. Get professionals to deliever them to the door instead of people travelling out.

We believe prevention is better than cure and sometimes it is good to be a bit kiasu. So even if there is an outbreak of the virus within schools, this group of parents will not blame MOE. Fyi, some people including my family can't buy a single piece of mask as everywhere is out of stock. We don't wish to put our kids at risk as they need to travel to and fro school by public transport.  For those parents who are comfortable to let their children to go to school tomorrow, they can go ahead to do so. No one is stopping them.

8650,"Looking at the statistics so far released and noticing their patterns, it is true that the virus spreads very fast. But its fatality rate is not so alarming. So far about 25 deaths are added today while about 1800 new cases are confirmed. The day before it was 24 deaths for the day and about 700 new cases. From these numbers, we see that while the number of deaths remains somewhat stable, the spreading rate doubles. The same pattern was observed on earlier days. If this is anything to go by, the death figure for tomorrow will be between 140 and 150. But the number of confirmed cases may reach 9000 cases going by the pattern. At this spreading rate, it's going to overwhelm the medical team and logistical arrangements in Wuhan. I am sure our government is aware of it. A very important point to note is that recovery rate from the disease is very low too. Coupled with low death rate and rapid increase in new cases, the resultant demand for more hospital wards and beds is going to be alarming. This must be taken into account in formulating our contingency plan. As it is believed that the virus is potent even during the incubation period, which stretches from 2 days to 14 days, there's no way of telling if we already have carriers walking around without showing any symptoms. So the best safeguard for Singaporeans now is to wash hands regularly, avoid crowded places and wear mask in those places. I hope by now free masks are available.",28/1/20,0,1

8672,"Dear PM  I write this message as a Singaporean who is gravely concerned for the well being of all Singapore citizens and residents, and who is worried at the style and speed with which your government is acting.  1. First Observation - within a matter of days, Singapore has run out of face masks. None of the pharmacies I visited today have a single piece of mask left. Why is this so? Is it because our supply chain is not robust? Is it because we allowed visitors to buy an indiscriminate number of masks? Are these visitors exporting masks? Are businesses being held accountable or are they diverting the masks to the next most profitable client / country? Is the government doing anything to investigate / verify / and place measures to counteract the above-mentioned points via solid actions? I strongly recommend that the government work to Ensure a strong supply of masks. A suggestion - Restrict Tourists to purchase only 1 piece per passport per day and reserve at least X pieces of mask per Singapore residing household per day, depending on the number of family members. You have all the data. Please Ensure that you remember a fundamental principle: Singaporeans should be entitled to a safe environment and it is your duty to deliver on that entitlement.  2. Second observation - Only today was it released that Hubei residents will be restricted from entering Singapore. 3 questions come to mind - Why only Hubei and not Whole of China? n-COV is more contagious than SARS. Why only today and not within 48 hours of the crisis? Why did we allow approx 2000 China visitors to roam the streets freely? I am sure you and your team of able Ministers had consulted very able and talented Doctors, Professors, International agencies. It is public news days ago that this virus is more virulent and contagious than SARS. Should stronger measures not have been put into place within 24-48H of the virus becoming international news? Have you questioned the speed, efficiency and confidence with which you and your fellow ministers have put in place measures?  Minister, do remember that the health & safety of all Singaporeans is your responsibility.  And it seems to many Singaporeans at this juncture, that this responsibility is not being carried out well. Prove us wrong. Just ask yourself if we want Singaporean deaths and infections arising from this. Many families will suffer the consequences.  Please also activate our defence force . The army ambulances should be activated to cope, non-sensitive camps should be used as a “fever centre” to ease the load on Hospitals and GPs.   Please, implement with speed. Take a strong stand, and take risks, that would pay off for the well being of Singaporeans.   Thank you.",28/1/20,1,1

8684,"I follow the Wuhan virus news closely like most ordinary folks out there, especially when I have the vulnerable young and elderly.  I believe this Wuhan virus is not causing huge panic here in Singapore, but more of frustration.  The latest frustration would be the lack of face masks, despite the assurances from the government that face masks are readily available. Showing photos of warehouse stock full of face masks only add to our frustration as many people were trying to just get hold of some for themselves and their family. I believe most of us are civic-minded and will not buy in bulk so that everyone has the chance to get their hands on the masks.  I can say I am responsible, taking care of personal hygiene, covering up when sneezing or coughing and go out less often. Likewise for my family. But you just need one irresponsible person to sneeze and cough in public without covering and people surrounding this person would be affected (especially now where most of us could not even get any masks - how to protect oneself then?).  As such, masks should be available to all households during this critical period. If this is still not deem as critical period, then what is? Till a community breakout? We should always “Hope for the Best but Prepare for the Worst”.  I feel that RCs come in particularly handy during this period. Instead of organizing tours and distributing free fruits to residents, RCs can be the  designated point for each household to pick up their masks.   The RC can be open for residents at their estate to pick up the masks during weekends (Sat and Sun).  Each person should get 7 masks to tide over one week. One person in each household will go collect on behalf of all, taking photo of the NRIC/birth cert of the person staying in the household. This is to verify how many people are staying in the house by verifying the address. I know some will say “privacy” issue, but we are not talking about joining contests or whatsoever. We are talking about critical period where masks have been flying off the shelves and leaving many with none. This will allow control and the government can stock-take their masks and not cause any further frustration.  The same exercise will happen again one week later so that no one will stock so many masks at home unnecessarily.  Some might point out that this is a logistic nightmare. But what is logistic nightmare when this Wuhan virus is already causing deaths in China and we now know it can be transmitted human-to-human? I believe such distribution can surely be done.   In addition, restricting Wuhan people from arriving to Singapore is definitely a late, but welcome move; but many have already escaped the “loophole” of the lockdown period. As CNY ends soon, many would be coming back to Singapore to work. Serving LOA is not going to deter them from going out; it serves not much purpose actually, if that individual is a selfish and irresponsible being. The best way would be to ferry them to Pulau Ubin (as Outward Bound is reported to be a quarantine facility) the moment they arrive in Singapore and quarantine these people for two weeks to ensure they are “all-clear” before stepping foot into our densely populated country.  I believe if the government is swifter in their decision, people would be less frustrated. We as Singaporeans will stand united to fight this Wuhan virus together, so as our pledge says   “We, the CITIZENS of Singapore. Pledge ourselves as one UNITED people”  人民一心，打到病菌",28/1/20,1,1

8689,"“29 Jan, 7.30pm JUST IN: There are 10 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore as of 2pm today. All of them are Chinese nationals, with 9 Wuhan residents.”  It started with 2 cases and increased to 10 within a very short period of time. While many Asian countries had already stopped Chinese visitors onto their shores, Singapore just only stopped Chinese nationals with Hubei passports to enter. A most effective way to contain the current situation in my opinion but only came way too late; with the slightest consolation is that it’s better late than never.   Please DO NOT just look at the absolute numbers.  Even so, with 10 confirmed cases thus far, it isn’t even reflecting good anyway.   Geographical and population size wise, Singapore is the smallest of all the countries that have confirmed cases of the Coronavirus. Put that into percentage against geographic and/or population size, we are undoubtedly ranked No.1 in terms of confirmed cases as of this moment.  Singapore strives to be No.1 in the world in many aspects but certain No.1’s isn’t worth it.   I strongly believe this number or percentage could have been better contained or stopped from rising had our government implement the temporary ban on Chinese nationals (at least those holding onto Hubei passports) much earlier. This approach came late because the government have over estimated their abilities to contain the situation at the earlier stage.  Please do not put fellow Singaporeans and our medical personnel into further risks by reacting slower.   There is not much use by telling people to practise good hand hygiene, wear masks, stay calm and vigilant etc if we keep allowing the risks to come in.  Do something more timely and practical please, monitor and react/implement the most effective ways to combat the situation.   Just like when SPF wasn’t capable to stop the Little India Riot, and while alcohol is a catalyst but not the root cause, the government took to banning alcohol almost immediately after the incident, islandwide after certain hours.  Then why can’t we refuse the entry of Chinese nationals or at least people from Wuhan way earlier then?   And though it’s nothing wrong to do some good deeds in times like this where we have donated 120,000 masks to Wuhan but why are our people needing to wait long in queues to buy masks, and some shops even jack up the prices and nothing is done to improve the situation here? Eg., if we can send masks to Wuhan, it is also much appreciated if the MOH could send out masks at places where there’ll be crowds like MRT stations too rather than just telling people to stay vigilant. Surely we have more than enough in our surplus to give out masks to the public especially in times like this and the reason couldn’t have been more valid.",28/1/20,0,1

8725,"Dear PM Lee, kindly check with health authorities if this is true. Been widely circulated on FB. Do hope that there is a cure soonest and that there is no need for pulau ubin to be used as quarantine area for this virus.  Below stated is what has been shared and posted by someone claimed from medical facility.   Thanks to the sender  Good News re: CORONA Virus  1st good News: China has developed a testing kit for CoronaVirus & will have it distributed nationwide. It can accurately confirm the presence of coronavirus on any suspect who has fever within 2-3hours. (Don’t know if this will soon be available in our country).  2nd good news: The new coronavirus can’t stand high-temperature environments.  -CoronaVirus will die in 56’C environment for 30mins.  -Utensils should be regularly sterilised /disinfected or boiled in 100’C water to totally eliminate all viruses. -eat cooked foods; don’t eat raw foods for the time being.  3rd good news: New coronavirus is easily eradicated by medical grade alcohol. -75%alcohol or  Chlorine disinfectant can effectively eliminate the coronavirus.  (Tip: bring alcohol in your bag to regularly disinfect your hands esp while outdoors; use alcohol to sanitize doorknobs in your home if someone develops flu-like symptoms; keep those who get sick inside their bedroom or bring to a doctor immediately).   According to a research professor’s advice: this winter; those with heating system in the house should keep the indoor temperature above 20’C. Don’t worry about wastage of electricity. -Coronavirus can’t survive long in a warm environment. Thus all households should keep the house heating & ventilation system on during this period. (Praying that our warmer climate is enough deterrant to its spread here.)  Thank you.",30/1/20,1,0

I doubt we can find another government which can match this level of efficiency. May I just suggest that instead of mass collection which could increase the risk of potential infection. How about Using postal delivery to send out the masks? This would cut unnecessary queuing and gathering of large groups during this period. Grateful to you and the many agencies and people during this anxious period. Praying for Singapore and all countries to unite to win this battle. Amen🙏,29/1/20,0,0

8731,Good morning!everybody I have some very heartwarming  n rather important views regarding the Wuhan virus which i wanna share w everybody.yes.no doubt bcos of this infectious n scary virus it has indeed caused much fears  n scaring every Sporean .not just only us Sporeans but the whole world is very worried n frankly speaking very alarmed.however i personally feel that we cannot just bcos of one fatality n 106 cases bcos of this serious virus therfore ban those Hubei or china people from travelling to n fro from Singapore.My most respected n highly esteemed  ministers  of Singapore.please kindly listen to an honest  yet sincere citizen of Spore.firstly as i have read through certain comments on this very sensitive issue regarding this Wuhan virus yes.of course it is indeed a very deadly n infectious virus.however we cannot  ban these businessmen from travelling to n fro from china to Spore n vice versa.firstly this ban if really put into implementation will indeed cause a lot of disharmony n inconvenience between China n our  country.the mutual well maintained closeness n friendship between China n Spore will be greatly affected diplomatically.Rather than banning Hubei chinaman from visiting Singapore why can't we sit down togethet n think of ways n methods on how to improve our own personal hygiene n cleanliness.i believe many sicknesses are the cause due to lack of personal hygiene.many occasions i personally see little children dropping sweets n these kids simply just picked up those sweets n popped them into their mouths again when their parents were not observing them.i understand that  very young children are not aware of personal hygiene.perhaps good hygiene habits ought to start from the home Such as teaching a child the proper n correct way of handwashing N the precautions one ought to take at this crucial moment like this.monitering a child's temperature when the child is down a fever.seeking help from a doc immediately if the fever is above 38.perhaps our Spore govt could implement some rather good n quick ways of checking up n making sure before these China man make a trip to Spore. Maybe a thorough medical report of their state of health within the past few weeks.a  full certified report to be presented before they can take the flight to Spore I personally believe in this saying When there is a will there is a way Let me ask the parliament one very honest n straightforward yet very direct question.if supposing one Sporean suddenly contracted a weird kind of deadly virus n he or she brings  this fatal n deadly vieus over to China how will these China  population react to this matter.sometime things might looked very  very complicated ncertain issues are indeed very sensitive but frankly speaking for me as a very good n honest Spore citizen i feel we ought not n must not bcos of one person who brings in this Wuhan virus then feel that it is the whole China who is at fault.rather than being so worried n scared what the govt needs to do now is to think of a way of .to solve this edgy issue.prevention is better than cure.the parents are the one who can teach n train a child very well good hygiene habits.maybe we ought to consider the pros n cons  N sit down  n hopefully a new vaccine might be found to save our lives from this virus.perhaps at the customs there ought to be more stands for some kinds of medical check upd.perhaps those coming to n fro from Hubei need to provide a full  cerified report of their medical n health condition for the past few werks before they bard the plane headed 4  Spore.thank u.Sir.for your listening ears.i  have to rush to work.thank u have a great day,28/1/20,1,1

Arrived at Changi we kept on asking about tests, was given bracelets packs at immigration, told to go home quarantine and wait for few days later for information to go and get tests, go online get refund because tests are free. Dangerous situation as well as confusion. 20 passengers arrive on Sg airlines, some transfer to other airlines, you never know who got co.19 but not showing symptoms.

We can ill-afford another costly budget should the situation become bad again. Setting quota on the number of visits and visitors is a good start but the risks of complacency still linger. Hopefully, we all will bear in mind the severity of the consequences and watch what we do during CNY. Wear a mask when visiting except when eating or drinking; do not dig into food or snacks directly with your chopsticks or bare hands, practise social distancing when there are guests; avoid coughing, shouting or singing karaoke at home, and practise  good hygiene to keep everyone safe.

Clearing of a forest takes weeks if not months to complete. Meanwhile where is the oversight, supervision and communication by JTC with the contractors, I wonder?

9128,"Feedback to the Ministerial Taskforce : Remember this. Wuhan started with a few. Then a few hundred. Then a few thousand. Then tens of thousands. And a few hundred / a few thousands infected China nationals then went all over the world. And now ? More than 1.2 mil infected. UK, Italy, Spain, France, USA the same stories. It all started with a few, then a few hundred. And then ? Exploded. Out of Control. Like Italy. Like Spain and etc. Singapore started with a few. Now ? More than a thousand. There were ""many overlook"" Singapore Govt made. One of them : letting in tens of thousands of Malaysians before Malaysia borders lockdown. My feel is? Singapore Govt tried to balance $ making (aka economy) with virus crisis management. So a bit here . A bit there. Some good measures here. Some loopholes there. In the end ? We get to ""nowhere"". Is our economy intact by ""this balancing act"" ? No. Because is serious now, we have this ""circuit breaker"" (much like a lockdown). Our economy went from bad (in Jan) to worse (in Apr) . My frank assessment is this : what ""saved"" Singapore from ""explosion phase"" is : our very good healthcare systems. BUT bear in mind, once the community spread get out of control, from a thousand can easily shoot up to tens of thousands. Touchwood. Should that happen, not even Singapore World Class healthcare systems can save Singapore residents. Singapore would be like Italy. Spain. USA. I am sad, worried, very disappointed. Yes we have good Govt. But I feel our Govt was ""too complacent"". Initially our Govt countered it like SARS. Flashback (CNA 1 Feb) : Dr Brenda Ang : “We have a few SARS veterans here. One of the things I said at the first briefings (for the Wuhan coronavirus) was don’t worry, we have been through this before. We can handle it.”“I saw Singapore's first SARS case, I’m still alive and standing,” she said. On how widespread the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to be, Dr Ang said current literature suggests that even people who are exposed to the virus do not necessarily get infected.“It probably isn’t that infectious, (even though) people are wearing surgical masks all over the place.” (UNQUOTE). @leehsienloong@gankimyong@ongyekung",6/4/20,0,1

(UNQUOTE) It is our Govt's job to do it (ensuring enough masks for the people to wear in public e.g. in crowded mrts and buses). Whether is it buying from China or setting up a factory to produce masks, just do it. Wearing masks definitely is effective in the overall containment efforts. You cannot have 1 good measure in say foodcourts distancing control and then ""overlook or fail"" in another area : e.g. mrt , buses. If so, the overall containment efforts will not be as effective. @leehsienloong@lawrencewongst@khawboonwan @gankimyong @ongyekung @teocheehean So in my opinion, our Govt have done a good job in many areas but ""overlook, fail or loophole"" in other areas.

9132,"Dear Minister Wong, I’m very glad to know that returnees from the UK and USA will have to serve SHN at designated hotels starting on Thursday (although it’d have been better to apply to everyone). Though it’s late, it’s the right move forward. Everyone should be treated as a suspect case and be tested upon arrival, and not just those who present symptoms at the border (which I believe is the protocol now). Mass testing has proven to be the tipping point for South Korea. We need to nip it in the bud - test, isolate, treat. Time is crucial, we can’t afford to wait for symptoms to show up then have patients present themselves at the hospital. If we can gift the Philippines with 3000 test kits surely we can do it for our fellow returnees? Also, at this point we should make it mandatory to wear mask. Wearing one is essential in the fight -  just look at China, Taiwan, SK, HK. “Wear one only when you’re sick” is not medically correct at this point in time. Experts in China have said people shed virus even before symptoms are present. Only by wearing a mask can we protect ourselves and people around us. I know there’s a shortage of masks in Singapore which makes it unfortunate but we can use cloth recyclable masks or any home made ones. When everyone wears one, it doesn’t matter if one’s quality is better than another. It really has helped those countries in containment. That’s certain. But to tell people that healthy people don’t need to wear one is just plain wrong, pardon me for saying. I’m writing as a concerned Singaporean - we must look at the above countries and learn from them. My next worry is when Malaysia ends her lockdown and thousands of people start to cross the causeway into Singapore... since it’s been proven with our recent imported cases that most don’t show symptoms at the border (meaning temperature can no longer be used as a gauge), how then? Thank you and the team once again for the hard work. We appreciate it and to the frontliners who are doing such a incredible job , it’s going to be a much tougher fight but together we shall overcome.",24/3/20,1,1

Toilet paper and maggi mee are essentials. Never eat maggi mee will die. No toilet paper don't know how to wash butt will die. 3) Don't travel overseas. Actually don't travel anywhere. Just stay at home 24/7. Maybe you want to close window also so virus cannot enter. When order online must wear hazmat suit to collect delivery then do full decon outside house first. 4) Cut off all ties from all China people. Might as well cut off all ties from your Chinese heritage as well. 5) When new rumour comes out, must share on every chat group you have. Make sure the people you send to also forward the rumour. Make chain messages great again! Sounds pretty ridiculous right? But that's exactly what is happening now.

In SG, we had not duly restricted air travel nor insisted on precautionary mask usage. By end February, masks were required and some expected a sort of lock-down - but meanwhile it was much business like usual. By the time the circuit-breaker was announced to be put into effect a fortnight later, there was already six weeks or more for MOM Enforcement unit to ensure the FW dorms and communal living supervisors will have implemented the same strict (if not stricter) norms than what was recommended for Singapore generally. This did not happen. The few cases seemingly from Mustafa then were reported and when testing - and only then - were implemented at the affected dormitories that the situation (of clusters erupting) became known as the data showed it had escalated prior to testing. The eventual handling was excellent but the cost of caring for the 50,000 odd infected, not to mention 'exposed' persons has yet to be revealed. The Opposition should call for an independent Public Inquiry into that matter, not for fault finding, but because it represents what has to be accepted as a real, known risk, as long as we have hundreds of thousands in this type of communal living, not to mention aged homes, student dormitories and the such. The data will help us in the future. But Mrs Teo must cooperate and not conceal critical information however condemning. 🕊💐",4/9/20,1,1

> Those dining out during the CNY period should keep their face masks on during the tossing of yusheng, the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) announced in a press conference on Jan. 22, 2021.

> Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong said during the press conference that they had anticipated a greater level of transmission in Phase 3 due to the increased interactions in the community.

> ""Indeed, in the past two weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of locally-transmitted cases,"" Gan added, saying that some of these cases have resulted in community clusters.

> Given the situation, Covid-19 safe management measures will be tightened during the CNY period, including measures such as limiting the number households that a family should visit.

> Lohei practices

> Regarding dining out, the MTF said that face masks must not only be worn during the tossing of yusheng, but lohei should also be done without any verbalisation of auspicious phrases.

> Minister for Education Lawrence Wong said, ""There should be no shouting of auspicious phrases by the F&B staff or by the patrons in the restaurant.""

> He also said that we have to be ""especially careful"" during this CNY period.

> F&B establishments and enterprises serving lohei must ensure that both the staff and patrons comply with these requirements.

> The maximum group size for social gatherings outside the house will remain at 8 people for now, but people are encouraged to keep their social circle small instead of mixing with multiple groups.

> Stepping up enforcement checks at F&B outlets

> There will also be more enforcement checks at F&B establishments, malls and other crowded public spaces during this period.

> Strict enforcement actions will be taken against individuals and operators who do not comply with safe management measure.

> The penalties include fines and prosecution in court, depending on the severity of the offence. For operators who do not comply with the measures, their operations will be suspended.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here

No

No

Once I had happily bought an ice cream from United square in novena and walked to novena sq via the nearby underpass which connects both novena square and novena mrt.

Happily minding my own business as I was going down the escalator slurping my ice cream when this guy asked at me from behind NO EATING IN THE TRAIN STATION!!!

In my mind I was like I am not eating in the train station. This is an underpass that connects to the train station but not the train station itself. I scolded him by shouting back this is not the train station there's no sign saying I can't. We had some unpleasant exchanges. He said he's an SMRT staff so he knows. If I wasnt in a rush, I would have brought him to the train station itself and hopefully have him scolded by the train station guys if he was an imposter.

Singapore is super welcoming and a multicultural country which welcomes all races, but there’ll always be that 1/50th man who will try his absolute best to kick out every foreigner from his country. Earlier this year, a fucking security guard of my own condominium yelled at my brother for having his mask down when cycling out. When my brother told him that you’re allowed to remove it while cycling, the bitch literally called him “a motherfucking Indian” and came ahead to physically assault him.

Yeah, we did report him and he got transferred out. But now he still works at a mall 500 meters away run by the same security guard agency. Having personally known every single security guard in the condominium, they were aware of the fact that we are friendly, outgoing people who wouldn’t unnecessarily pick fights.

This was during the lockdown, and the security guard was probably brought in from overseas due to a shortage of labor.

It is sad, but once in a blue moon, it does happen. What does relieve me is that, for every 1 in 50 idiots, there are 49/50 welcoming locals who’ll always smile and welcome foreigners for who they are.

me off lied to me it was english speaking when I  went from a horrible previous job with miscommunication and honestly bullying with chinese as the main language. why do I feel ashamed, scared to speak about experiences of me living in singapore as my race. why  do I feel better that I can come off as non white person because my features can look like a non white person too? 

u act like there arent singaporean big shots ? Malaysian big shots? Indian  big shots ? Chinese big shots? other country expat big shots etc;? I read there are singaporeans respected and high up the hierarchy of the cooperate world in other countries like Australia. on a post like this that is suppose to deter xenophobia, please refrain from a comment like urs spurring xenophobia towards white ppl in singapore. nothing good comes from judging a person based on a race. we cant and should not want to change the color of our skin, the features on our face, just because majority of the ppl decided that this particular minority group can be discriminated against. increasingly and scarily among young singaporeans white ppl are the easy to pick on group in singapore. theres so many reddit posts against white ppl, im worried for the future that we will find white ppl become even worse the scapegoat of discrimination but its fine cos for some reason ppl like to justify their racism with racism.


 I definitely dont want to come off as victimizing myself and excusing that ppl sometimes treat me badly because of my race. I want to always strive to be better, more understanding, communicative and productive, but I definitely have lapses in doing so. honestly think sometimes ppl are welcoming, intrigued and well responding. Ive been told I was attractive solely because im mix which is weird. its just im a reserved person that can come off as rude and anti social. its like if a singaporean etc chinese is like that its fine but for my race it ""stands out"" as stuck up or rude. my sibling was literally called ""hao lian yang ren"" for just stacking things on a shelf. what the fuck? its just been clicking in my mind that all these posts on reddit are revealing the true underlying (racist) feelings of singaporeans that can affect how they see a white person that deeply disturbs me.. my white American father  was abandoned by his parents and raised by his abusive uncle working on a farm. packed his bags and left at 18. faced a lot of racism and discrimination and got scammed a lot in asian countries even tho he was not well to do. his Sister was shot by a black man to steal her purse, (this really affected him because he was very close to her) . he got ganged up on and beaten by a group of black man for playing a game of pool in the wrong bar. I have to say this has influenced my thought process, I have no prejudice against black ppl, well by the definition ""Prejudice is an unjustified attitude or opinion, usually a negative one, directed toward an individual for something the individual cannot control"" I really try not to, but i get very annoyed by posts like these, I dislike the blm movement  that were about supporting george floyd heavy on drugs and stealing a pregnant lady things at gun point, ppl going around destroying white businesses and bullying white cops.
we always will want to one up each other, be smarter be better, or else u become the loser. I see that black ppl have had fought for their rights and rightfully taken it. and white ppl shouldnt stop to fight for theirs. either way in singapore at least u shouldnt be judged by race but by merit to build a democratic society, based on justice and equality, so as to achieve happiness prosperity and progress for our nation.",22/12/20,1,1

My parents’ generation also group people in terms of nationality and would usually refer to all caucasians as “angmohs”. For me, I “unlearned” these “taught” perspectives as I grew older in JC and uni, but it’s almost impossible to get my parents to change their views on nationality/race. I tried getting my parents to recognise their remarks made to me in private, while not malicious in intent, are casually racist (they said that the predominantly “white” town I study in is safer than another city which had “a lot of black people loitering” who made them feel unsafe).

If you ever see a woman with a tudung + short sleeve shirt at food stores (e.g: at fast food places) or somewhere, it's most likely not local because that's their normal fashion style in their country.

10112,"I mean, I did acknowledge that racism exists everywhere. Perhaps the most inclusive places (that I’ve heard of) would be NZ and Canada then. I guess I was very blessed that in the four years that I lived in Canberra, I didn’t really experience severe cases of racial discrimination. It could also be that Canberra tends to be a uni/student town, more educated, and the local families who live there are very comfortable with international students and actually reach out to us to make us feel at home while abroad. Been to Sydney many times on trips and it definitely doesn’t feel as “warm”. Sydney is just a big city like any other. The likelihood of there being racist people is just higher.

As for making white friends, I’ll agree that for me personally, I’m pretty introverted so I found it hard to get close with them (also I don’t enjoy clubbing so that’s a lot of social events in the hall that I missed out on haha). I definitely found it easier to connect with my Korean Australian friends etc. The caucasian aussie that was close to us grew up in Taiwan so culturally, we found it easier to connect with him, but he also made the extra effort to connect with international students. That’s not to say that white Aussies were unfriendly or racist; I have many extroverted SG friends who integrated with the (white) locals very well. I’d say that generally it does take more effort on both sides to reach out to make a connection. The people at the local church I joined really went the extra mile to help internationals feel at home in Canberra; they became our family for the years we were there.

10115,"Late 90s and early oughts. I was there for all of my teens. I went back as part of work a few years ago when I still worked for a certain big yellow American heavy equipment company. The urban areas are slightly less racist. There is a huge international student bubble that you can get lost in and never have to see a local. The rural areas are even more racist than I remember. The problems with the Australian economy are even worse right now, even as the place has become a lot more prosperous for that sizable minority of people who have their fingers in real estate, agriculture and mining. If you are a property speculator, a miner or a farmer and have not found a way to rent seek off of these industry, Australia is going to be a terrible place. Extremely expensive with no opportunities.

The thing with the US is that there are an abundance of good schools. Many non brand name mid western schools count over a dozen nobel prize winners as their alumni. They have very strongly funded research programs such that you will have access to career enhancing research opportunities even as an undergraduate. The quality of instruction is typically very high at a good school. The thing with the US are so many of these schools that you will almost certainly get in to one of them as long as your grades are even slightly competitive.--Of course surviving to graduate may be a different matter, but the key thing is that if you are late bloomer and are willing to work hard, you can punch above expectations. I went in with good grades, but I feel that this is is a system that I strongly prefer over systems like Singapore's where there is all kinds of pointless and invented rationing of opportunities for the sake of elitism. There will be opportunities for you to participate in engineering design teams building cars aircraft and machinery for competitions. These teams tend be democratic in the US and open to everyone prepared to contribute, even those who are not engineering students.The research and the engineering teams I was part of made finding a job out of University very easy. It made finding internships in University relatively easy even though I was disadvantaged by the H1B visa nonsense.

 I heard from my Australian colleagues that Australian universities ration these opportunities for favored students and they are certainly not open to everyone. I invite you to take a look at your prospective university's formula student team. This is an important indicator even if you aren't planning to be an engineer. You will likely find that even as these Australian universities happily take your money, they will reserve the best opportunities for white students. This is true at all levels of Australian society The same is simply not true of the US. I still mentor my old student design teams. The leadership in my shell marathon team has had exactly 2 white guys in the last 10 years. Both this team and the FSAE team are majority non-white. Both team have recently been led by women. No one had to tell them to be diverse. There was no diversity program or any shit like that. Just being open to the contributions of people regardless of race made things this way.  I am very proud of this and would be very happy if my kids could go to the same school when they are older. 

The other advantage that choosing the US would have is that, unless you pick a university in downtown NYC or SF or LA, your cost of living is going to be hugely lower. Fees at a midwestern public University are comparable or lower than an Australian University. Many US college town have decent amenities and are near enough to have the big cities to make weekend trips feasible, but not near enough that you wind up paying over 500USD a month in rent even right now. Owning a used car is cheap and the US is sufficiently relaxed about tuning and so on that you can really get something cheap and fix it up into something nice. Working on your car there is seen as a human right. It is a very different environment to Singapore and you will find it to be a great opportunity to learn many new things and make friends that will follow you for a long time.",20/12/20,0,1

That’s why our govt said to wear masks out only if we were sick (just in case it was COVID). Now that the shortage is more or less dealt with, and our local (and untraceable) cases here are increasing, the govt is saying to wear masks if we go out - as we may be asymptomatic carriers.

As we saw more cases and collected our own evidence of asymptomatic transmission, they probably knew a mask would be helpful, but likely didn't want to cause a frenzy by advocating masks when it was so difficult for the general public to buy any.

Not just a case of 'immediately produced'.

The tensions across the Taiwan strait meant that Taiwan was very up to date, compared to other countries (minus Japan/US). The government eventually went to all the mask making factories, offered them the machines (for free, on conditions) and offered them extra manpower (their conscripts) to use the machines.

They recently donated 10 million masks to EU, US and other countries. That was less than a day of their production amount. There's also [news that they would be donating to 7-8 ASEAN countries, including Singapore](https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004070012).",9/4/20,0,1

While the latter, waiting for concrete evidence before taking action is too reactive and slow, when one considers that the cost of the action (everybody mask up, even if not surgical) is relatively low compared to the consequence of the inaction. In other words, a proactive approach of getting everyone to mask up (even with cloth mask), when there's no strong evidence of asymptomatic transmission yet but one can infer that it's possible (for asymptomatic transmission) and that low symptom expressing infected may not wear masks if it's not normalised for everyone to wear it in public, might result in a circuit breaker being unnecessary now.

The appeal to international or superpower authority is just intellectually dishonest IMHO. I've seen over the years WHO, CDC and what other countries' say and do being used as a justification for various decisions. However, if one looks clearly, they're often merely cherry picking what backs their choices. Also, if one's choices are grounded in logic and evidence, there's no need to appeal to authority. Appeal to authority here is used to placate the masses, but also as a convenient scapegoat to blame when decisions turn out to be bad in hindsight.

> If they changed their stance early on, there just be a rush of hoarders. We don't want a situation like in the US or UK where the healthcare workers don't have PPE and are having to re-use them or MacGyver up their own plastic protection.

This is actually a moot point. The government controls the supply of surgical masks and rice. Hence, it's not possible for PPE for public healthcare workers or for food for emergency rationing to gone as a result of consumer hoarding.

What's important now is for the CB to work so we can regain some normalcy ASAP.

As for the initial misstep regarding masking up in public, it's not something I really want to harp about, to attribute blame or whatever. It is however, something worth analysing, whether it's about government decision making, to the public relying too much on the Govt and hence not go beyond the prescribed recommendations (arguably though, in the initial phase, it was actual active discouragement from wearing masks. Though it was changed later, could the initial strong discouragement have contributed to low mask wearing even when the discouragement advice was dropped?), to the public following the letter but not the spirit of the law etc.",9/4/20,0,1

There is already a shortage of surgical and n95 masks, it's a global issue. That's why they're resorting to giving out reusable cotton masks for regular people even if they're not as effective. 

We don't know how long this pandemic is going to last and we don't know how large is the stockpile of masks. Food isn't really a concern, PPE for healthcare workers is seeing as how many of the big countries are under equipped.

For Singapore, our govt is afraid to anger the CCP, so we didn't ban Chinese arrivals until another country started it, or WHO announced something (cannot remember exactly). It's not too bad as the damage done by Chinese visitors was limited.

Q: Does wearing a mask cause you to be exposed to MORE virus than not wearing? (ie virus created out of nothingness or able to replicate without a host)

A: No.

Q: Does the probability (p) that an outside droplet containing COVID19 reaches the protected nose/mouth of the mask wearer go down?

A: YES! It's illogical to even suggest p(no mask) <= p(mask) when a other distance & handwashing regimens are done. Arguments surrounding touching outside mask, improper use, you still need to social distance, or in the case of surgical mask: (droplet can go under mask), are all logical fallacies! Learn how to quickly identify fallacious arguments since this one is the 'Strawman argument'! Answering an argument NOT presented.

NEVER accept a statement about anything from someone using a clear strawman argument.

I claim: Never let perfection be the enemy of the good. As such, the statements above are a dishonest way to argue this scenario. No claim is EVER made by ANYONE that N95 or surgical will bring p=0!!!

This thought experiment is NOT proof. But ponder if you really believe p=0 for mask wearers inhaling the virus.

In Nederland adviseren we alleen mondkapjes voor medisch personeel. Mensen die werken met (mogelijk) besmette mensen gebruiken professionele mondkapjes. Deze mondkapjes helpen alleen als je ze op de juiste manier gebruikt; ze moeten heel goed sluiten over neus en mond en je moet ze regelmatig wisselen.

I would support mask up if you go out, but that might not be possible for SG since there is a shortage of masks in SG.
