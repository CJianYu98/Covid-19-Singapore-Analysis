1135,1402,The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released new guidance about the best ways to use masks to help prevent transmission of covid-19.,2/11/21
1136,1403,One key recommendation highlights the added benefits of using a more snugly fitting mask or pairing a cloth mask with a surgical mask.,2/11/21
1137,1404,Experimental data collected by the agency suggests that either option should greatly reduce the risk of transmission between people.,2/11/21
1138,1405,"Rochelle Walensky, the newly appointed CDC director, discussed the new recommendations during a White House coronavirus briefing on Wednesday.",2/11/21
1139,1406,Walensky first reiterated the current consensus that properly worn masks can help limit the spread of the coronavirus.,2/11/21
1140,1407,"Some masks are better at protecting the wearer from infection (N95 and KN95 masks in particular), but they all limit the outward transmission of potentially infectious droplets and aerosols to others.",2/11/21
1141,1408,"New research from the CDC, however, looked at the relative effectiveness of different methods using cloth and surgical masks and how it could be improved.",2/11/21
1142,1409,"In the study, even cloth masks were more effective than no masks at limiting the spread of aerosol and droplet particles the size of those emitted by people with covid-19.",2/11/21
1143,1410,But surgical masks that were more snugly fit or that had a cloth mask worn on top of them were the most effective at protecting the user and others.,2/11/21
1144,1411,"In an experiment that simulated being exposed to an infectious person breathing nearby, having both parties wear better-fitted or double-layered masks reduced the level of exposure by more than 95 percent, Walensky said, compared to no mask at all.",2/11/21
1145,1412,"\x93I want to be clear that these new scientific data released today do not change the specific recommendations about who should wear a mask or when they should wear one, but they do provide new information on why wearing a well-fitting mask is so important to protect you and others,\x94 she added.",2/11/21
1146,1413,The CDC has now updated its website on improving the effectiveness of masks based on this new data.,2/11/21
1147,1414,"To make surgical masks better-fitting, for instance, the CDC recommends first knotting the strands of the ear loops and tucking in the outer layer of the mask fabric (there\x92s a helpful guide and visual provided by the CDC if that description isn\x92t clear enough).",2/11/21
1148,1415,"There are also other products, such as mask fitters and braces or masks with nose bridges, that will make a mask tighter.",2/11/21
1149,1416,"However it\x92s done, you can tell a mask is snug enough if you can feel warm air come through the front of the mask and the mask moves with every breath you take.",2/11/21
1150,1417,"As for double-masking, the CDC recommends either wearing a cloth mask with multiple layers or wearing a cloth mask over a surgical mask.",2/11/21
1151,1418,"However, it doesn\x92t recommend wearing two surgical masks at once, or combining an KN95 mask with any other mask (to be fair, these masks are already very good at protection when worn correctly).",2/11/21
1152,1419,"In addition to wearing masks in public, people should obviously still practice physical distancing whenever possible, avoid crowded indoor spaces, and wash their hands regularly.",2/11/21

8886,10437,Putting on a mask or face shield or even a spit guard will have Two functions with varying degree of effectiveness.,1/6/2020
8887,10438,It is PROTECTION from infection by others and PREVENTION of infecting others.,1/6/2020
8888,10439,"In order to understand what are suitable in different situations, we must understand the nature of how this virus spread.",1/6/2020

8902,10453,A plastic shield or even a plastic spit guard will definitely be more effective that a paper mask which is not tested or certified.,1/6/2020
8903,10454,Spit guard may have much weaker prevention of infection by others due to the fact it is open on the top but it is close to the mouth as well as the nose.,1/6/2020

14092,16363,"He worked for 15 years with Klaus Dietz, a leading epidemiologist who coined the term “reproduction number”, on the Epidemiology of HIV before heading for 20 years the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at The Rockefeller University, New York.",9/4/2020
14093,16364,"He says: With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity.",9/4/2020
14094,16365,"About 80% of the people need to have had contact with the virus, and the majority of them won’t even have recognized that they were infected, or they had very, very mild symptoms, especially if they are children.",9/4/2020
14095,16366,"So, it’s very important to keep the schools open and kids mingling to spread the virus to get herd immunity as fast as possible, and then the elderly people, who should be separated, and the nursing homes should be closed during that time, can come back and meet their children and grandchildren after about 4 weeks when the virus has been exterminated….",9/4/2020

14097,16368,"Well, we will see maybe a total of fewer cases—that is possible.",9/4/2020
14098,16369,"However, we will see more cases among the elderly, because we have prevented the school children from creating herd immunity.",9/4/2020

14101,16372,"Herd immunity lasts for a couple of years, typically, and that’s why the last SARS epidemic we had in 2003, it lasted 15 years for enough people to become susceptible again so that a new epidemic could spread of a related virus.",9/4/2020
14102,16373,"Because typically, there is something that requires cross-immunity, so if you were exposed to one of the SARS viruses, you are less likely to fall ill with another SARS virus.",9/4/2020
14103,16374,"So, if we had herd immunity, we wouldn’t have a second wave.",9/4/2020
14104,16375,"However, if we are preventing herd immunity from developing, it is almost guaranteed that we have a second wave as soon as either we stop the social distancing or the climate changes with winter coming or something like that….",9/4/2020

14110,16381,"Let the children spread the virus among themselves, which is a necessity to get herd immunity.",9/4/2020
14111,16382,That was probably one of the most destructive actions the government has done.,9/4/2020
14112,16383,We should focus on the elderly and separating them from the population where the virus is circulating.,9/4/2020

15051,17379,What you mention is mass testing?,19/4/20
15052,17380,(at population level) i.e.,19/4/20

15066,17394,"Dear Mr Lee, I have some suggestions on how to combat the pandemic outbreak.",17/4/20
15067,17395,There is much we can learn from how South Korea successfully arrested the outbreak after a terrifying start.,17/4/20
15068,17396,"Firstly, we need to significantly ramp up testing so as to identify the infected, especially the asymptomatic ones.",17/4/20
15069,17397,I watched a video in which a South Korean medical expert explained that the main reason why they could contain what seemed like widespread community transmission was by extensively testing the population so that the infected could be quarantined.,17/4/20
15070,17398,"Even though South Korea's situation is now under control, they still have public booths available for any member of the public to be tested.",17/4/20
15071,17399,Contrast that to Singapore's situation.,17/4/20
15072,17400,My friend who was sick visited a clinic and requested for a coronavirus test but was rejected.,17/4/20
15073,17401,He was deemed not to exhibit sufficient symptoms to be tested.,17/4/20
15074,17402,But hasn't the coronavirus been proven to be asymptomatic?,17/4/20
15075,17403,"In light of that, we should not be turning people away for tests.",17/4/20
15076,17404,We have to be more proactive in order to quickly identify the infected before the spread worsens.,17/4/20
15077,17405,"I understand there is a political price with extensive testing, as the numbers could significantly increase.",17/4/20
15078,17406,"Indeed the South Korean president was initially embarrassed by the speed of the outbreak, but his willingness to swallow the bitter pill has won him the respect of his people as he managed to arrest the outbreak.",17/4/20
15079,17407,His party won a resounding electoral victory.,17/4/20
15080,17408,We too must swallow the bitter pill in order to stop the outbreak.,17/4/20
15081,17409,"Secondly, may I suggest that we get the best PITs from the SAF to design some home-based fitness routines for all ages.",17/4/20
15082,17410,"In the absence of a vaccine, the best medicine to fight the virus is exercise.",17/4/20
15083,17411,"Exercising is crucial in building up our immune system, which is an important way for us to fight off the coronavirus.",17/4/20
15084,17412,It is also a good way to relax our mind and cost nothing.,17/4/20

16777,19225,So these effectively prevent mass infections.,30/5/20
16778,19226,Maybe our government if they think carefully should reintroduced PMD (Personal Mobility Devices) and also allow these PMDs on the road rather than pavement while shifting the buses lane to the middle lane and only filter to the left when stopping for the few passengers instead.,30/5/20

18322,20889,"I'm a new Singapore citizen, who just accompanied my relatives to ICA in the hope of extending their short term visit pass this morning.",31/1/20
18323,20890,"My aunt and uncle, who are both over 60 years old, arrived in Singapore from Harbin on Jan 7th and didn't go anywhere outside of Singapore after their arrival.",31/1/20
18324,20891,"Their daughter, my cousin, and her husband are both PR but they aren't qualified to apply LTVP for my aunt and uncle.",31/1/20
18325,20892,"But when they visit yearly, they sometimes make use of the normal one-time, one-month extension to spend a time longer than one month with family.",31/1/20
18326,20893,"Yesterday, their extension application was rejected.",31/1/20
18327,20894,We also saw on CNA that extension to short term visa is suspended.,31/1/20
18328,20895,"We went to ICA very early this morning to try to find out if any kind of appeal was possible, and the answer was no.",31/1/20
18329,20896,"Even though Scoot airline had already canceled their original flight that was scheduled for Feb 6th, the officers told us we have to book them tickets from other airlines for them to go back before the one month visa expires.",31/1/20
18330,20897,"Outside ICA Level 4 waiting area and around the information counter, the whole area was filled with Chinese families, and what looked like two hundred people, all having the same hope of not having the option of extension cut off.",31/1/20
18331,20898,"After all, these family members arrived early enough in January and didn't go to China again.",31/1/20
18332,20899,But there was no exception.,31/1/20
18333,20900,"Some officers said they sympathize that people's family members have to go back to China at a risky time even though they don't pose threat in Singapore, and that they couldn't get an extension all in a sudden, the officers had no choice but following the new instructions.",31/1/20
18334,20901,"I would like to tell you how saddening it is for us to send our families back to China right now, when just two days ago we felt lucky that they arrived early enough, they could still use the extension of 30 days to avoid the risk of catching the virus back in China.",31/1/20
18335,20902,I'm trying my best to get in touch with Singapore officials who might be able to consider a more appropriate action at this time.,31/1/20
18336,20903,Do you think this action alone by ICA is absolutely necessary?,31/1/20
18337,20904,"Thank you and best regards, Tianshu",31/1/20

18342,20909,Can you imagine a PRC passport holder who stayed in Australia or Japan wants to travel or transit in Singapore and banned from doing so?,31/1/20
18343,20910,Can you help to clarify why this measure has to target nationalities or specific passport holders?,31/1/20

18351,20919,Is a mask really a proven protection?,31/1/20

18357,20925,"We were told to Avoid crowded place , but wouldn’t it be crowded when everyone line up for the masks ?",30/1/20
18358,20926,Why not distribute it to our letter box instead ?And 4 to every family ?,30/1/20
18359,20927,How about some Families have more then 4 members ?,30/1/20
18360,20928,"Sir, Just my humble opinion.",1/2/2020
18361,20929,I am worried.,1/2/2020
18362,20930,"Because i think It is a not a good idea for the distribution of masks to all residents in Singapore, to be done by getting people to come to the RC centres and community centres because,  1) The chances of getting virus infection will be increased thousands of times as crowds of millions of people, including the old and the handicapped , line up , and infect each other with viruses , which defeat the very purpose of having masks ,and 2) it is so unproductive for people to take leave , just to go collect those masks and 3) Its a waste of time of so many volunteers to help in the distribution exercise and 4) A smart idea would be to just get the post office delivery men , to open up the back of the mail boxes at bottom of each block of HDB flats and then slot in all the masks into all the letter boxes, and this could be done within a few seconds for each block of flat.",1/2/2020
18363,20931,"Imagine the huge time savings ,and getting the task done so quickly and efficiently , compared to getting millions of people to spend hours going to RC centres and community centres to Q up ,and having hundreds of thousands people infecting each other with viruses .",1/2/2020
18364,20932,"Please do consider my humble opinion, to do the distribution of masks, through mail box.",1/2/2020
18365,20934,"Thank you  sir... this helps for now, hope the stocks arrives soon in retail shops too.",30/1/20
18366,20935,"As for those who don't really need free masks as they most likely already have their own, forgo it and the forgo masks will stay in our national stockpile reserves for future emergency release.",30/1/20
18367,20936,😀 Upkeep and show the betterment of Singapore spirit and not plunder for things that's free.,30/1/20
18368,20937,😀 Wishing each and all safe and well.,30/1/20
18369,20939,"If every household go to the cc, you are encouraging a crowd which is not a good idea, fast way to transmit infection.",30/1/20
18370,20940,"Suggest to drop into letter box instead, use less manpower and less contact.",30/1/20
18371,20941,We can Count on Singapore to do their best for the citizens.,30/1/20
18372,20943,Give also complain.. Don't give also complain..... Haizzz...,30/1/20
18373,20944,We appreciate the gesture and efforts .. however won’t it be more effective if these masks were be mailed out to individual households instead of having someone to collect ?,30/1/20
18374,20945,Firstly the mobilisation of manpower and logistics be massive and expensive considering the suddenness of the demand ...!,30/1/20
18375,20946,Secondly large crowd would descend to the collection centres and this is definitely not a good idea for people to crowd around waiting to collect ...!!!,30/1/20
18376,20947,The cost would be negligible considering the light weight and compactness of the masks.,30/1/20
18377,20948,And conveniences of receiving the masks by post would certainly also prevent mass hysteria should certain popular centres run out the masks ...not to mention the inconveniences of a family member having to make time just to collect 4 masks ..!!!,30/1/20
18378,20950,"Dear Mr Lee, we appreciate the gesture of allocating 4 masks per household.",31/1/20
18379,20951,"However, the govt should also consider during these times to mandate that GPs give out at least one mask to patients who are genuinely unwell.",31/1/20
18380,20952,We visited a reputed medical chain yesterday as a family member was down with cough and cold.,31/1/20
18381,20953,We asked for one mask as we did not have any and were unable to get any.,31/1/20
18382,20954,"However, we were told that the clinic does not supply ANY mask.",31/1/20
18383,20955,"We were not asking to buy a whole box, just ONE mask for the sick patient.",31/1/20
18384,20956,And our request was denied.,31/1/20
18385,20957,I find this practice highly illogical especially in such times given that patients who are unwell should be wearing masks and yet the clinic in question is not able to provide.,31/1/20
18386,20958,"And meanwhile, the sick patient is spreading the virus around because there are no masks available!",31/1/20
18387,20959,"BTW, this is not an isolated experience at just one clinic!",31/1/20
18388,20960,What's the reason and rationale behind this collection  instead of previous successful mailing to households?,30/1/20
18389,20961,Thanks PM Lee !,30/1/20
18390,20962,You indeed think of everything!,30/1/20
18391,20963,God bless !,30/1/20
18392,20964,Tq PM LHL for the supplies.,30/1/20
18393,20965,I've wrote in Dr Lam's earlier posting and I'll like to make the same suggestion that the RC members could do good by sending these surgical masks to the residents via their  Post boxes and so helping the elderly and may also prevent the spreading of viruses during queuing.,30/1/20
18394,20966,Tq Sir!,30/1/20
18395,20967,"Sir, pls advise the ministry to avoid consolidating huge crowds to collect the masks!",30/1/20
18396,20968,Mail to each household is the best.,30/1/20
18397,20969,Thkq,30/1/20
18398,20970,I dun think 4pcs per household is enough as maybe more than 4 person in a household.,30/1/20
18399,20971,Mail instead of collect is better.,30/1/20
18400,20973,Mask price have be highly markup at this point sir.,30/1/20
18401,20974,Hope control measurements should take place soon.,30/1/20
18402,20975,Also ppl are over stocking the mask leaving those who need it have none!,30/1/20
18403,20976,The retailers should control the limit of purchase.,30/1/20
18404,20977,"Why this time round, didn't mail directly  to households like what was done previously during SARS?",30/1/20
18405,20978,We were told to avoid crowd and those who are coughing and sneezing away without any masks,30/1/20
18406,20979,Thank you SAF armies men...you work hard day and night.May you be rewarded,30/1/20
18407,20980,"Thanks PM,, I pray For our Singapore and no infected or Death..All will be Protected in Jesus Mighty name..Amen",31/1/20
18408,20982,But I feel it will be better to sent the masks by post to each household instead of collecting at CCs and RCs as it will be crowded and people will be exposed to more risks.,30/1/20
18409,20983,"If I recalled correctly, we received masks and thermometer by post during the SARS outbreak.",30/1/20
18410,20984,"Thank you Sir....Deeply Appreciative and very proud of our SAF, PA and other supporting agencies during this Crisis that we have to fight it together !",31/1/20

18417,20991,"Dear PM Sir, firstly thank you for distributing the masks for free.",30/1/20
18418,20992,It's a kind gesture.,30/1/20
18419,20993,However I'm perplexed why is it 4per household?,30/1/20
18420,20994,"It would make more sense to give out say, 2 masks per capita?",30/1/20
18421,20995,Encourage folks to have more children but this decision doesn't quite fall in line does it?,30/1/20
18422,20996,"I have 3 kids and everywhere else is still out of stock, only the unscrupulous ones are selling them unchecked.",30/1/20
18423,20997,Thank you sir for the thoughtful and kind gesture!,30/1/20
18424,20998,"Hi ~PM Sir, great initiative!",30/1/20
18425,20999,will it be better to mail to every household instead of people queuing up for the masks?,30/1/20
18426,21000,Pretty sure the queue will be long and it will not be easy especially for the senior citizens and family with young children(especially babies).,30/1/20
18427,21005,"Dear Prime Minister, we appreciate this move made by you.",30/1/20
18428,21006,We are just wondering if a supply of these masks could be distributed to the pharmacies in the Neighbourhood Polyclinics; which is more convenient for senior citizens to go and collect instead of the RCs/CCs.Many thanks and Best Regards.,30/1/20
18429,21007,good move by government.,30/1/20
18430,21008,"but instead of getting resident to collect from CC, would it be better to distribute to mailbox directly?",30/1/20
18431,21009,"anyway, every household is entitled 4 piece.",30/1/20
18432,21010,it will avoid human crowd and hence risks of infection.,30/1/20
18433,21011,Hi PM Lee!,30/1/20
18434,21012,My colleague who travelled to and fro Malaysia daily spotted how poorly equipped our ICA officers are.,30/1/20
18435,21013,The Malaysia custom officers have gloves and masks put on (to take passport).,30/1/20
18436,21014,The temperature checks were taken by folks in nearly Hazmat gear.,30/1/20
18437,21015,"While it might be over the top, I think our ICA officers at the Causeway and Tuas Checkpoint should put on masks and gloves.",30/1/20
18438,21016,Let's not forget those officers who are perpetually seeing foreigners and in the front line to guard us against the virus.,30/1/20
18439,21017,"Sir, I think it is better to allocate the quantity base on the number of pax per household instead of just 4 pcs per household.",30/1/20
18440,21018,"Some families have 3 generations, 4 is definately too few for them... just my 2 cents worth...",30/1/20

18445,21024,"Come on, we queue for hours to buy masks, TOTO, hello kitty etc; This should be manageable.",30/1/20
18446,21025,Why create gap whereby later there’s people said did not receive etc?,30/1/20
18447,21026,The giving out period is at RC and CC and for days so there will be no or minimum crowd.,30/1/20
18448,21027,Do you find crowd at election time which is also a spread out 1 day event?,30/1/20
18449,21028,Please let volunteers/Govt do the needful and to those who really need helps.,30/1/20
18450,21029,People let’s do our minimum to help in this.,30/1/20
18451,21030,"Seriously if you find it troublesome to collect, then thanks in advance to you as these can go to frontline",30/1/20
18452,21031,"Dear PM, I do agree the purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent spreading the virus if one is sick.",31/1/20
18453,21032,"BUT to avoid getting the virus from the sick who is not wearing mask, it’s still safer better for us to wear mask if one understand well the whole picture.",31/1/20
18454,21033,"In Singapore, even in this sensitive time, it is still common to see people with coughs and running nose not wearing mask because most of us don’t have the habit of wearing mask when they having flu cough running nose.",31/1/20
18455,21034,"And on this Wuhan virus, seriously we don’t know who is having the early symptoms of the virus when you are in the public.",31/1/20
18456,21035,"This issue of masks to Singaporean and PR in the Community Centres can be worrying too if it create a contained crowd, cos I feel it is better to avoid crowd places.",31/1/20
18457,21036,4 masks for each household is seriously barely enough in this risky time.,31/1/20
18458,21037,Be safer than sorry.,31/1/20
18459,21038,Just sharing my opinion and hope it can help the government to do more better for the people 🙏 ❤️Peace and Love to ALL❤️,31/1/20
18460,21039,Thank you respected PM.,30/1/20
18461,21040,Just want to clarify if the masks would be distributed for Singaporeans or Singapore residents(includes PR and EP holders)?,30/1/20
18462,21041,How abt foreign staff who working in singapore????,30/1/20
18463,21043,This isnt enough.,30/1/20

18465,21045,Shouldn’t the allocation be based on number of resident per household?,30/1/20
18466,21046,Do we have to share the 4 masks allocated per household?,30/1/20
18467,21047,"Prime Minister Sir.. Its not about the quantity of the mask that is to be given for each household or the mode of how it is to collected by us,but I very much believed that our Singapore goverment is very concerned about our well being.",30/1/20
18468,21048,Our leaders are doing their upmost BEST in their care and concern for all Singaporean.,30/1/20

18472,21052,Thank you Sir for the thoughtful distribution of the masks .,1/2/2020
18473,21053,But the mask is not the solution to this serious epidemic.,1/2/2020
18474,21054,"Rather, could the Singapore Govt please consider putting China /Wuhan visitors on quarantine in Pulua Ubin - for a safe period of time.",1/2/2020
18475,21055,There are many infected ones right now who are roaming on our streets and neighbourhood which pose a high risk to my fellow citizens and residence of Singapore.,1/2/2020
18476,21056,This is a worrying thought - the mask alone will not solve this worrying situation.,1/2/2020
18477,21057,"Can Ministry of Health, Singapore explain why we only need to wear face masks if we are unwell?",30/1/20
18478,21058,"Unless they can give a good explanation on this, it really can’t convince us.",30/1/20
18479,21059,This is esp when the recent reports showed that many carrying the virus didn’t show any symptoms.,30/1/20
18480,21060,"Unless MOH is refuting these reports, please explain to us on this directive.",30/1/20
18481,21061,Thank you sir for the care and kindness,30/1/20
18482,21062,Thanks for this government initiative.,30/1/20
18483,21063,Perhaps every Singaporean should get one mask instead of allocating 4 per household.,30/1/20
18484,21064,Some households have more people than others.,30/1/20
18485,21065,I have a family of 5.,30/1/20

18488,21068,We are using the limited N95 masks that we have at home.,30/1/20
18489,21069,A person carrying the virus may not be showing the symptoms yet and therefore not wearing a mask as you advised.,30/1/20

18769,21375,came here for Tina’s comment ):,31/1/20
18770,21376,"Sir you doing the best as head of nation,sir at these critical period to save the nation,sir the best is if flights from china stopped,before more harm happened ,that is best to safe singapore from more coranvious virus,thank you only suggestion god bless simgapore.",30/1/20
18771,21377,I'm not convinced this is a good idea at all.,30/1/20
18772,21378,"During SARS we learned that these masks get damp due to the water vapour in exhaled breath and the damp cloth provides a surface for the virus to attach, thus actually increasing the risk of infection.",30/1/20
18773,21379,Hence the best advice is that only those with an infection should wear them.,30/1/20
18774,21380,I guess the government has a short memory.,30/1/20
18775,21381,I do not quite agree that only people feeling unwell need to wear masks.,30/1/20
18776,21382,I read from a doctor in China only today that infected people rarely show symptoms like nose block and running nose.,30/1/20
18777,21383,That basically makes it difficult for others to differentiate them from healthy people.,30/1/20
18778,21384,Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the virus can spread so fast in Wuhan.,30/1/20
18779,21385,I can understand that the current stock of surgical masks is inadequate to meet demand.,30/1/20
18780,21386,"However, whoever has the mask now should be advised to wear it especially when in crowded places.",30/1/20
18781,21387,This will effectively minimize the prospect of a widespread outbreak of the Wuhan virus in our communities.,30/1/20
18782,21388,We never can tell whether there are healthy carriers walking around at the moment especially among people who have just returned from China.,30/1/20
18783,21389,"So ideally, we should have everyone wearing mask in public as soon as supply is adequate to enable us to do so.",30/1/20

18816,21424,More needs to be done for national interest.,28/1/20
18817,21425,I think a travel ban beyond Hubei is necessary for at least 10 days.,28/1/20
18818,21426,"That way, any incubation period will be set from that lockdown date.",28/1/20
18819,21427,We are now experiencing newer cases who have been in Singapore for longer Jan 18/ Jan 20 etc.,28/1/20

18832,21440,"As for advices regarding how healthy people shouldnt wear masks, isnt it sending wrong signal?",28/1/20
18833,21441,There are cases whereby no symptoms shown but the person is still infected.,28/1/20
18834,21442,"And all it takes is one infected person to cough into the face of a healthy person not wearing a mask, its still a high risk no?",28/1/20
18835,21443,"Maybe govt shod ensure singaporeans, both healthy or not, have ample supply of masks first?",28/1/20
18836,21444,Perhaps a national body could be responsible for dispensing masks of the right quality at a fair price ... and not allow pharmacies and other retailers to profit from this situation.,28/1/20
18837,21445,Is that not a national service or agenda that a state agency should undertake?,28/1/20

19187,21818,"While I thank the government for giving out the masks, I’d appreciate if more efficient methods can be used to distribute the masks instead of getting people to queue (crowded and exposed) to get the masks.",28/1/20
19188,21819,"For example, we can utilise SingPost to distribute the masks to our home letter boxes.",28/1/20

19199,21830,Is that the true?,28/1/20
19200,21831,"Because many people in the public places are not wearing masks when they are sick and have symptoms like cough, running nose, etc .",28/1/20

19221,21856,I REALLY would like to see the government put more emphasis and promotional materials on hand hygiene adopted by the hospitals to educate and INGRAIN the public to understand why washing your hands properly and not touching your face can be more effective than wearing a surgical mask.,29/1/20
19222,21857,This might potentially alleviate the mass hysteria problem of everyone buying masks.,29/1/20
19223,21858,"There is one point though which I disagree... “Masks are only for unwell people and you do not need it if you are well” I can’t control if people sneeze or cough at me, at least I can control/minimise the droplets from getting into my mouth and nose...",29/1/20

20331,23030,"At that time, we already knew about the Virus, its source City Wuhan, and that it is highly infectious, spreading and taking lives .",28/1/20
20332,23031,So why did we still allow them to enter Singapore and freely move about.,28/1/20
20333,23032,This is a burning question.,28/1/20
20334,23033,Why we seemed slow to act towards this?,28/1/20
20335,23034,"As a result, SG though a very small country is now ranked top 3 behind China and Thailand.",28/1/20
20336,23035,Can we act fast and step up more effective measures before it is too late.,28/1/20
20337,23036,As the saying goes... you got to nip it at the bud.,28/1/20
20338,23037,We got to stop people from the high risk Country ( and not just Wuhan city) from coming into our land .,28/1/20
20339,23038,Or at least they should be quarantined upfront for 2 weeks upon arrival before joining our civilization.,28/1/20
20340,23039,The schools and companies are already stepping up measures and asking those who have been to China or been in close contact with such ;  to stay away from their premises .,28/1/20
20341,23040,But their efforts alone are not going to be enough.,28/1/20
20342,23041,We need our Country to do the same and stop them on our shores.,28/1/20
20343,23042,"Second,  those from Wuhan who are still amongst us, can we trace and quarantine-  so that we don’t have new cases each day and they have already made contact with many others by then.",28/1/20

20348,23047,Need Government to protect us... and safe us 🙏🙏🙏,29/1/20
20349,23048,I suggest the Govt.,28/1/20
20350,23049,to shut out all China PRC from entering Singapore temporary and not just on wuhan PRC only since at the meantime all infected are China PRC and to quarantine immediately 14days for those Singapore travelling back from China.,28/1/20

20354,23053,"Stay positive, no need to panic guys!",28/1/20
20355,23054,That's not enough because the virus has already spread beyond residents of Hubei province to people in major cities in China like Beijing and Shanghai.,28/1/20
20356,23055,"Add to the fact that China has always not been forthcoming with their infection rates medical data, there is a real risk that anyone from China coming into Singapore now can be carriers, do not display fever symptoms and go on to then infect people in Singapore.",28/1/20
20357,23056,Philippines and North.Korea has already closed their borders to China.,28/1/20
20358,23057,The fact that the government has not closed borders with China is a major reason why people are panicking and stockpiling face masks.,28/1/20

20376,23076,Your office temperature and humidity is conducive for virus growth like SARS or Wuhan viruses.,30/1/20
20377,23077,Scientists have found that dried SARS CoV can retain its viability for 5 days in temperature between 22 and 25 degree celsius.,30/1/20
20378,23078,At higher temperature of 38 degree and humidity >95% its viability is rapidly lost.,30/1/20
20379,23079,So we should  not create an ambient environment for these viruses to grow.,30/1/20
20380,23080,I guess our National Infectious Disease Centre or SGH temperature and humidity level is currently most conducive for the Wuhan viruses to retain its virility.,30/1/20

20392,23093,I arrived in Changi Airport from Indonesia yesterday.,28/1/20
20393,23094,There was no screening for us.,28/1/20
20394,23095,Also saw alot of China people arriving in the airport and many are not wearing masks.,28/1/20
20395,23096,These people may not care about hygiene or rules.,28/1/20
20396,23097,Why are we risking our lives and health because of these people who do not care about rules or health of other people?,28/1/20

20400,23101,But I think to wear it all day long outdoors is almost impossible as it is both uncomfortable to start off with apart from the fact you need to take it off at some point.,28/1/20
20401,23102,"Cleanliness and strict hygiene helps but the  critical point is still, I   think would be that of a temporary ban of travellers from China.",28/1/20
20402,23103,It would be appropriate to safeguard our health interests due to the very nature of the coronavirus.,28/1/20
20403,23104,1 month ban would do.,28/1/20
20404,23105,"Apart from this, I would like to suggest home based learning and working instead of travelling out for the time being.",28/1/20
20405,23106,We should make use of technology to get us through this period.,28/1/20
20406,23107,Perhaps ordering food and groceries could be made via online too.,28/1/20
20407,23108,Get professionals to deliever them to the door instead of people travelling out.,28/1/20
20408,23109,This way it cuts down the risk of contacting the virus.,28/1/20
20409,23110,Any particular reason not to start the ban of Hubei visitors with immediate effect and must wait till noon tomorrow?,30/1/20

20500,23211,"Looking at the statistics so far released and noticing their patterns, it is true that the virus spreads very fast.",28/1/20
20501,23212,But its fatality rate is not so alarming.,28/1/20
20502,23213,So far about 25 deaths are added today while about 1800 new cases are confirmed.,28/1/20
20503,23214,The day before it was 24 deaths for the day and about 700 new cases.,28/1/20

20617,23336,Showing photos of warehouse stock full of face masks only add to our frustration as many people were trying to just get hold of some for themselves and their family.,28/1/20
20618,23337,I believe most of us are civic-minded and will not buy in bulk so that everyone has the chance to get their hands on the masks.,28/1/20
20619,23338,"I can say I am responsible, taking care of personal hygiene, covering up when sneezing or coughing and go out less often.",28/1/20
20620,23339,Likewise for my family.,28/1/20
20621,23340,But you just need one irresponsible person to sneeze and cough in public without covering and people surrounding this person would be affected (especially now where most of us could not even get any masks - how to protect oneself then?).,28/1/20
20622,23341,"As such, masks should be available to all households during this critical period.",28/1/20

20632,23351,"I know some will say “privacy” issue, but we are not talking about joining contests or whatsoever.",28/1/20
20633,23352,We are talking about critical period where masks have been flying off the shelves and leaving many with none.,28/1/20
20634,23353,This will allow control and the government can stock-take their masks and not cause any further frustration.,28/1/20
20635,23354,The same exercise will happen again one week later so that no one will stock so many masks at home unnecessarily.,28/1/20
20636,23355,Some might point out that this is a logistic nightmare.,28/1/20
20637,23356,But what is logistic nightmare when this Wuhan virus is already causing deaths in China and we now know it can be transmitted human-to-human?,28/1/20
20638,23357,I believe such distribution can surely be done.,28/1/20

20642,23361,The best way would be to ferry them to Pulau Ubin (as Outward Bound is reported to be a quarantine facility) the moment they arrive in Singapore and quarantine these people for two weeks to ensure they are “all-clear” before stepping foot into our densely populated country.,28/1/20
20643,23362,"I believe if the government is swifter in their decision, people would be less frustrated.",28/1/20

20651,23370,I concur with u that the disease is infectious but not so lethal as SARs.,30/1/20
20652,23371,I see from facts that there is no fatality outside China.,30/1/20
20653,23372,I request as a chronic patient on medication that MOH gives directives to polyclinic s to dispense small amount of chronic meds for those who need to replenish their meds at polyclinics but would not like to add to the crowds .,30/1/20

20662,23381,"All of them are Chinese nationals, with 9 Wuhan residents.”  It started with 2 cases and increased to 10 within a very short period of time.",28/1/20
20663,23382,"While many Asian countries had already stopped Chinese visitors onto their shores, Singapore just only stopped Chinese nationals with Hubei passports to enter.",28/1/20
20664,23383,A most effective way to contain the current situation in my opinion but only came way too late; with the slightest consolation is that it’s better late than never.,28/1/20
20665,23384,Please DO NOT just look at the absolute numbers.,28/1/20
20666,23385,"Even so, with 10 confirmed cases thus far, it isn’t even reflecting good anyway.",28/1/20
20667,23386,"Geographical and population size wise, Singapore is the smallest of all the countries that have confirmed cases of the Coronavirus.",28/1/20
20668,23387,"Put that into percentage against geographic and/or population size, we are undoubtedly ranked No.1 in terms of confirmed cases as of this moment.",28/1/20
20669,23388,Singapore strives to be No.1 in the world in many aspects but certain No.1’s isn’t worth it.,28/1/20
20670,23389,I strongly believe this number or percentage could have been better contained or stopped from rising had our government implement the temporary ban on Chinese nationals (at least those holding onto Hubei passports) much earlier.,28/1/20
20671,23390,This approach came late because the government have over estimated their abilities to contain the situation at the earlier stage.,28/1/20
20672,23391,Please do not put fellow Singaporeans and our medical personnel into further risks by reacting slower.,28/1/20
20673,23392,"There is not much use by telling people to practise good hand hygiene, wear masks, stay calm and vigilant etc if we keep allowing the risks to come in.",28/1/20

20675,23394,"Just like when SPF wasn’t capable to stop the Little India Riot, and while alcohol is a catalyst but not the root cause, the government took to banning alcohol almost immediately after the incident, islandwide after certain hours.",28/1/20
20676,23395,Then why can’t we refuse the entry of Chinese nationals or at least people from Wuhan way earlier then?,28/1/20
20677,23396,"And though it’s nothing wrong to do some good deeds in times like this where we have donated 120,000 masks to Wuhan but why are our people needing to wait long in queues to buy masks, and some shops even jack up the prices and nothing is done to improve the situation here?",28/1/20
20678,23397,"Eg., if we can send masks to Wuhan, it is also much appreciated if the MOH could send out masks at places where there’ll be crowds like MRT stations too rather than just telling people to stay vigilant.",28/1/20
20679,23398,Surely we have more than enough in our surplus to give out masks to the public especially in times like this and the reason couldn’t have been more valid.,28/1/20

20805,23533,Should hv ban from day 1....,28/1/20
20806,23534,Good morning!everybody I have some very heartwarming  n rather important views regarding the Wuhan virus which i wanna share w everybody.yes.no doubt bcos of this infectious n scary virus it has indeed caused much fears  n scaring every Sporean .not just only us Sporeans but the whole world is very worried n frankly speaking very alarmed.however i personally feel that we cannot just bcos of one fatality n 106 cases bcos of this serious virus therfore ban those Hubei or china people from travelling to n fro from Singapore.My most respected n highly esteemed  ministers  of Singapore.please kindly listen to an honest  yet sincere citizen of Spore.firstly as i have read through certain comments on this very sensitive issue regarding this Wuhan virus yes.of course it is indeed a very deadly n infectious virus.however we cannot  ban these businessmen from travelling to n fro from china to Spore n vice versa.firstly this ban if really put into implementation will indeed cause a lot of disharmony n inconvenience between China n our  country.the mutual well maintained closeness n friendship between China n Spore will be greatly affected diplomatically.Rather than banning Hubei chinaman from visiting Singapore why can't we sit down togethet n think of ways n methods on how to improve our own personal hygiene n cleanliness.i believe many sicknesses are the cause due to lack of personal hygiene.many occasions i personally see little children dropping sweets n these kids simply just picked up those sweets n popped them into their mouths again when their parents were not observing them.i understand that  very young children are not aware of personal hygiene.perhaps good hygiene habits ought to start from the home Such as teaching a child the proper n correct way of handwashing N the precautions one ought to take at this crucial moment like this.monitering a child's temperature when the child is down a fever.seeking help from a doc immediately if the fever is above 38.perhaps our Spore govt could implement some rather good n quick ways of checking up n making sure before these China man make a trip to Spore.,28/1/20
20807,23535,Maybe a thorough medical report of their state of health within the past few weeks.a  full certified report to be presented before they can take the flight to Spore I personally believe in this saying When there is a will there is a way Let me ask the parliament one very honest n straightforward yet very direct question.if supposing one Sporean suddenly contracted a weird kind of deadly virus n he or she brings  this fatal n deadly vieus over to China how will these China  population react to this matter.sometime things might looked very  very complicated ncertain issues are indeed very sensitive but frankly speaking for me as a very good n honest Spore citizen i feel we ought not n must not bcos of one person who brings in this Wuhan virus then feel that it is the whole China who is at fault.rather than being so worried n scared what the govt needs to do now is to think of a way of .to solve this edgy issue.prevention is better than cure.the parents are the one who can teach n train a child very well good hygiene habits.maybe we ought to consider the pros n cons  N sit down  n hopefully a new vaccine might be found to save our lives from this virus.perhaps at the customs there ought to be more stands for some kinds of medical check upd.perhaps those coming to n fro from Hubei need to provide a full  cerified report of their medical n health condition for the past few werks before they bard the plane headed 4  Spore.thank u.Sir.for your listening ears.i  have to rush to work.thank u have a great day,28/1/20

21078,23819,I know many people already planning to hold food and drinking gatherings for different groups of 8 friends on different days....,26/1/21
21079,23820,A very good way to stop home visitation is to mandate majority Chinese armed forces units like Air Force and Armour to mobilize during the CNY period.,24/1/21
21080,23821,"With one less family member at home, people are less likely to go out and visit.",24/1/21

21087,23828,"If we do not take this pandemic seriously, I really worry that we may see an uncontrollable spike-up in infections after CNY, much like what Ireland experienced in January when they became complacent during the Christmas holidays.",25/1/21
21088,23829,We can ill-afford another costly budget should the situation become bad again.,25/1/21
21089,23830,Setting quota on the number of visits and visitors is a good start but the risks of complacency still linger.,25/1/21
21090,23831,"Hopefully, we all will bear in mind the severity of the consequences and watch what we do during CNY.",25/1/21
21091,23832,"Wear a mask when visiting except when eating or drinking; do not dig into food or snacks directly with your chopsticks or bare hands, practise social distancing when there are guests; avoid coughing, shouting or singing karaoke at home, and practise  good hygiene to keep everyone safe.",25/1/21
21092,23833,I hope brochures can be handed to every household and be posted in the house to remind everyone of such measures during CNY.,25/1/21

23908,26798,Thanks for the reply!,19/12/20
23909,26799,You lived in Aus back in the 199x?,19/12/20

23928,26818,I’d say that generally it does take more effort on both sides to reach out to make a connection.,18/12/20
23929,26819,The people at the local church I joined really went the extra mile to help internationals feel at home in Canberra; they became our family for the years we were there.,18/12/20

24004,26896,felt I gotta give some input here as a Singaporean.,4/4/20
24005,26897,"From what I understand, the initial advice from the govt to not wear masks was because singaporeans were stocking up heavily on them, and this caused a shortage esp to those who really needed them (healthcare workers, those who were actually sick etc).",4/4/20
24006,26898,That’s why our govt said to wear masks out only if we were sick (just in case it was COVID).,4/4/20
24007,26899,"Now that the shortage is more or less dealt with, and our local (and untraceable) cases here are increasing, the govt is saying to wear masks if we go out - as we may be asymptomatic carriers.",4/4/20

24022,26914,They only made the announcement when they were ready to offer masks for every household.,4/4/20

24024,26916,I don't think they ever said its ineffective.,4/4/20
24025,26917,What they did is to discourage the use of it to ensure adequte supplies for healthcare professionals and sick ppl.,4/4/20

24036,26928,No but they said no need to wear,4/4/20
24037,26929,It is important to note they did not say they encouraged the use of masks now but rather they will not discourage the use of masks.,4/4/20

24041,26933,That's amazing because I thought Singapore had been using masks.,5/4/20
24042,26934,They were having so much success for a while I assumed masks were part of their toolkit.,5/4/20

24119,27060,"In other words, a proactive approach of getting everyone to mask up (even with cloth mask), when there's no strong evidence of asymptomatic transmission yet but one can infer that it's possible (for asymptomatic transmission) and that low symptom expressing infected may not wear masks if it's not normalised for everyone to wear it in public, might result in a circuit breaker being unnecessary now.",9/4/20

24393,27347,I bought my N95s for ~ $2@ back in January.,4/4/20
24394,27348,"After the Surgeon General’s comments, they were $20@.",4/4/20
24395,27349,I love how people try to justify the lies of the government by coming up with fantastic scenarios of panic.,5/4/20
24396,27350,They could have recommended home made masks.,5/4/20
24397,27351,They had a couple weeks to secure the masks AND order Americans to all get ANY kind of face covering.,5/4/20
24398,27352,It would have been vastly better.,5/4/20

24402,27356,Employers could have demand anybody who comes to work wear a masks.,5/4/20
24403,27357,It's not hard to find one shirt and make cut it into several mask.,5/4/20
24404,27358,We could have had PSAs on TV telling Americans to make masks until the surge in mask demand had gone down.,5/4/20
24405,27359,"The info was already all over Youtube, mostly people HAD TO BE TOLD for any chance of rapid recovery and having minimal impact on the economy.",5/4/20
24406,27360,In the fear to take action their inaction cost far more than the negative impacts of people staying home until they got masks on their faces.,5/4/20
24407,27361,Even now they won't do it for real and are playing around in many countries.,5/4/20
24408,27362,Go on... this should be interesting,4/4/20
24409,27363,Please elaborate on why it would be necessary to have the virus spread for a couple months and still institute measures such as stay at home orders and closing borders.,4/4/20
24410,27364,Where did you get that lmao,5/4/20
24411,27365,You can easily instruct citizens to use homemade masks and leave surgical masks and respirators for medical personnel who have greater risk of catching the virus due to constant and close contact to the most severely infected.,4/4/20
24412,27366,"The WHO isnt preventing a global run on masks, they're agitating an already bad situation with literal lies and disinformation.",4/4/20

24420,27374,"Haha hahah

The WHO prevents a global run on masks

Haha hahah",4/4/20
24421,27375,Essential medical supplies should basically all be nationalized at a time like this anyway.,4/4/20
24422,27376,"The whole ""they'll have to compete for masks"" argument is a joke.",4/4/20
24423,27377,They only have to compete if the government wants them to have to compete.,4/4/20

24426,27380,Ask anyone from Taiwan why they don't trust the WHO.,4/4/20

24433,27387,"they have told us repeatedly they don’t work in the uk, most recently in the friday briefing",4/4/20

24440,27394,I live in Europe too and have not seen official national disinformation from individual western countries (beside the US) that masks are completely  useless.,4/4/20
24441,27395,"In fact, I have seen news that specific masks are functional for specific purposes.",4/4/20
24442,27396,"This isn't misinformation, it is very specific and factually correct.",4/4/20
24443,27397,You deducting it as misinformation is worrisome.,4/4/20
24444,27398,"Therefore I'm asking for a source that shows:

In the western media other than the US.",4/4/20

24554,27509,Why do singapore& other western countries say no need wear masks but why do all other east asians wear masks🤔,21/3/20
24555,27510,mostly due to production / sourcing.,20/3/20
24556,27511,You guys are able to manufacture & source for masks more easily than us.,20/3/20
24557,27512,"So you guys get to be able to use and distribute masks more freely, whilst we have to keep ours for people who need them, like frontline healthcare workers",20/3/20
24558,27513,Masking up healthy-looking people can reduce transmission by the asymptomatic infected.,20/3/20
24559,27514,The low number of cases in HK and Taiwan is possibly evidence of this.,20/3/20
24560,27515,Singapore is the same though?,20/3/20
24561,27516,Despite not masking up,20/3/20
24562,27517,Not as low as HK and Taiwan though.,20/3/20
24563,27518,But it could also be attributed to other factors.,20/3/20
24564,27519,For example I read that the cancel culture (for social distancing) is very high in Taiwan.,20/3/20
24565,27520,How is the cancel culture over in HK?,20/3/20
24566,27521,In SG it's only in the past week where we're getting larger daily new cases where the Govt call for cancelling large events especially with elderlies.,20/3/20
