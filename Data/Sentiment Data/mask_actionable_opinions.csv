2626,3025,Good morning!everybody I have some very heartwarming  n rather important views regarding the Wuhan virus which i wanna share w everybody.yes.no doubt bcos of this infectious n scary virus it has indeed caused much fears  n scaring every Sporean .not just only us Sporeans but the whole world is very worried n frankly speaking very alarmed.however i personally feel that we cannot just bcos of one fatality n 106 cases bcos of this serious virus therfore ban those Hubei or china people from travelling to n fro from Singapore.My most respected n highly esteemed  ministers  of Singapore.please kindly listen to an honest  yet sincere citizen of Spore.firstly as i have read through certain comments on this very sensitive issue regarding this Wuhan virus yes.of course it is indeed a very deadly n infectious virus.however we cannot  ban these businessmen from travelling to n fro from china to Spore n vice versa.firstly this ban if really put into implementation will indeed cause a lot of disharmony n inconvenience between China n our  country.the mutual well maintained closeness n friendship between China n Spore will be greatly affected diplomatically.Rather than banning Hubei chinaman from visiting Singapore why can't we sit down togethet n think of ways n methods on how to improve our own personal hygiene n cleanliness.i believe many sicknesses are the cause due to lack of personal hygiene.many occasions i personally see little children dropping sweets n these kids simply just picked up those sweets n popped them into their mouths again when their parents were not observing them.i understand that  very young children are not aware of personal hygiene.perhaps good hygiene habits ought to start from the home Such as teaching a child the proper n correct way of handwashing N the precautions one ought to take at this crucial moment like this.monitering a child's temperature when the child is down a fever.seeking help from a doc immediately if the fever is above 38.perhaps our Spore govt could implement some rather good n quick ways of checking up n making sure before these China man make a trip to Spore.,28/1/20,0.17680177626606194,0.5242120181405898,0.107,0.72,0.172,0.9786,fear
