11971,12635,It has been evident in the past two weeks of 'Circuit Breaker' that delivery riders have faced tremendous pressure in their job of delivering F&B to customers at home.,22/4/20
11972,12636,"Shortly after the announcement of tightening and restriction of what is deemed to be “essential”, a number of videos have circulated on the internet which displayed the rowdy behaviour of delivery riders and F&B workers.",22/4/20
11973,12637,Some of the commotion between the riders and stores resulted in close contact of these persons in their individual bids to put their point across.,22/4/20
11974,12638,Such behaviour is fairly understandable- likely due to the pressures of increased orders and lacklustre management of orders.,22/4/20
11975,12639,These delivery riders on the ground are helpless except to do their utmost to fulfil their daily orders.,22/4/20
11976,12640,The delivery platforms have also been purported to be almost impossible for delivery riders to cancel orders in view of unforeseen situations such as long waiting times or out-of-stock items.,22/4/20

11981,12645,It would take just one infected individual in the nucleus to spread devastating consequences deep into the homes of families waiting for their orders.,22/4/20
11982,12646,The measures at wet markets and supermarkets are quite effective in allowing families to purchase groceries.,22/4/20
11983,12647,Food establishments also remain open and people should have little difficulty to get food and drinks for consumption.,22/4/20
11984,12648,It is timely that the Ministry consider a shutdown of the delivery platforms to minimise potential outbreak of the virus within the community.,22/4/20

12119,12801,Good one Mark XLii Goh...100% agree.,21/4/20
12120,12802,"One of the best perspectives of the current situation that I read so far :-  From Dr Sharmil de Silva:  I think the thing most people don’t understand is that the lock down is in place to slow the progression of the disease, NOT to eradicate it by end of May.",21/4/20
12121,12803,I think people are missing the point because they naively think the govt will somehow get rid of it so life goes back to normal.,21/4/20
12122,12804,These are people who have ignored the global reality since January.,21/4/20
12123,12805,"This is the dangerous delusional thinking that some people are applying in their assessment of the situation when advocating we should stop the lockdown because they are literally only waking up to this thing now, or when we were initially shut down.",21/4/20
12124,12806,So let’s lift the curtain a bit.,21/4/20
12125,12808,Flattening the curve means slowing down the disease so that hospitals can cope with the sick.,21/4/20
12126,12809,It does not mean eradicating the disease all together.,21/4/20
12127,12811,No government will be able to eradicate the disease this year.,21/4/20
12128,12812,It’s here until a cure or a vaccine is found   3.,21/4/20
12129,12813,A vaccine is at least a year away.,21/4/20
12130,12814,That’s April 2021.,21/4/20
12131,12815,The earliest vaccine trials just started late last month.,21/4/20
12132,12816,"It takes 18 to 24 months to make, test and assess the efficacy of a vaccine.",21/4/20
12133,12817,So 1 year is literally a Hail Mary.,21/4/20
12134,12819,There is NO going back to normal.,21/4/20
12135,12820,Your normal will not exist for at least a year.,21/4/20
12136,12821,Economies globally will keep bleeding and we are likely to have rolling lockdowns until a vaccine is found.,21/4/20
12137,12823,"Even when the ban is lifted, tourism and hospitality industry, and many others will not see an increase in business for at least a year.",21/4/20
12138,12824,Until a vaccine is found people will continue to self isolate even when a lock down is lifted.,21/4/20
12139,12825,6.,21/4/20
12140,12826,The only reprieve we are going to get is if we have thousands of people who have been infected and recovered and minimum deaths so that we have some level of herd immunity.,21/4/20
12141,12827,That is also still a theory that is yet to be proven because some countries think they may be seeing people get reinfected.,21/4/20
12142,12828,Even with that in place normal is not feasible because fear still reigns and people will remain isolated until safety is guaranteed- cure or vaccine.,21/4/20
12143,12829,Refer to point 3.,21/4/20
12144,12830,7.,21/4/20
12145,12831,The above is still 6 months away.,21/4/20
12146,12832,We are projected to reach our peak in September.,21/4/20
12147,12833,"That means, bleeding economy, rolling lockdowns, death and chaos until then.",21/4/20
12148,12834,8.,21/4/20
12149,12835,The decisions made in the lockdown like no alcohol and no dog walking or running and no e-commerce are not made with the privileged in mind.,21/4/20
12150,12836,They are made with the masses in mind.,21/4/20
12151,12837,What you allow in the suburbs you must allow in the townships and those two things look very different in execution.,21/4/20
12152,12838,Now our government is doing the best it can and they have reacted faster than most developed countries.,21/4/20
12153,12839,Our progress is still better than most and right now we’re riding the dumb hope that somehow BCG gives us some fighting chance (still unproven).,21/4/20
12154,12840,"So please please we all need to do whatever we can to help our neighbors, help each other, support our government and stop having delusional ideas about any level of normalcy at the end of this month.",21/4/20
12155,12841,Adjust your projections and hunker down.,21/4/20
12156,12842,This is not a joke and it’s not even anywhere near any semblance of real yet.,21/4/20

14738,15878,Symptomatic people to get tested --> these are the true community cases.,19/4/20
14739,15879,What you mention is mass testing?,19/4/20
14740,15880,(at population level) i.e.,19/4/20

14754,15894,"Dear Mr Lee, I have some suggestions on how to combat the pandemic outbreak.",17/4/20
14755,15895,There is much we can learn from how South Korea successfully arrested the outbreak after a terrifying start.,17/4/20
14756,15896,"Firstly, we need to significantly ramp up testing so as to identify the infected, especially the asymptomatic ones.",17/4/20
14757,15897,I watched a video in which a South Korean medical expert explained that the main reason why they could contain what seemed like widespread community transmission was by extensively testing the population so that the infected could be quarantined.,17/4/20
14758,15898,"Even though South Korea's situation is now under control, they still have public booths available for any member of the public to be tested.",17/4/20
14759,15899,Contrast that to Singapore's situation.,17/4/20
14760,15900,My friend who was sick visited a clinic and requested for a coronavirus test but was rejected.,17/4/20
14761,15901,He was deemed not to exhibit sufficient symptoms to be tested.,17/4/20
14762,15902,But hasn't the coronavirus been proven to be asymptomatic?,17/4/20
14763,15903,"In light of that, we should not be turning people away for tests.",17/4/20
14764,15904,We have to be more proactive in order to quickly identify the infected before the spread worsens.,17/4/20
14765,15905,"I understand there is a political price with extensive testing, as the numbers could significantly increase.",17/4/20
14766,15906,"Indeed the South Korean president was initially embarrassed by the speed of the outbreak, but his willingness to swallow the bitter pill has won him the respect of his people as he managed to arrest the outbreak.",17/4/20
14767,15907,His party won a resounding electoral victory.,17/4/20
14768,15908,We too must swallow the bitter pill in order to stop the outbreak.,17/4/20
14769,15909,"Secondly, may I suggest that we get the best PITs from the SAF to design some home-based fitness routines for all ages.",17/4/20
14770,15910,"In the absence of a vaccine, the best medicine to fight the virus is exercise.",17/4/20
14771,15911,"Exercising is crucial in building up our immune system, which is an important way for us to fight off the coronavirus.",17/4/20
14772,15912,It is also a good way to relax our mind and cost nothing.,17/4/20
14773,15913,"We can air exercise routines live on tv, and encourage everyone to participate at home.",17/4/20

18983,20411,Lol nothing to be excited about.,16/7/20
18984,20412,That’s because shit hits the fan and there are too many dorm workers infected.,16/7/20

19045,20475,"In my opinion, the tests and numbers only serve two purposes, to let us know if current measures are effective and to guide our next moves.",16/7/20

19047,20477,I support your opinion here.,16/7/20
19048,20478,I think nitpicking exists because we (mostly) have our basic needs met thus issues picked out are beyond these basic needs.,16/7/20

20870,24614,"But sadly, you know how it is here in Sg, they’re just gonna keep with the status quo until the Govt slaps them with a warning.",6/4/20
20871,24615,"Cos even if the migrant workers or advocates sound out to the dorm’s building management, nothing happens.",6/4/20
20872,24616,Which is why most of those who voice out about this issue (as well as other issues relating to migrant workers) direct it towards the Govt.,6/4/20
20873,24617,"It’s just like how at least 10 (or more) years ago, companies that employ just a small number of foreign workers used to rent an entire HDB unit for their workers, and such “dorms” were often overcrowded as well, until HDB set down the maximum occupancy for each unit (no matter 3/4 room or bigger) to be 6.",6/4/20
20874,24618,"Back then, most worker dorms around were built and managed by the employers, usually large companies that employ a lot of workers, such as SembCorp, Keppel shipyard, etc.",6/4/20
20875,24619,Those dorms usually have more amenities & facilities and generally offer a better living environment (but still cannot compare to SAF bunks la).,6/4/20
20876,24620,"The rise of the external dorm operators came about after the new ruling, I believe.",6/4/20

20887,24632,They have all consistently advocated for better living conditions for migrant workers for many many years.,6/4/20

20889,24634,This is not hindsight.,6/4/20
20890,24635,We all knew that bosses in construction companies were cutting corners by giving these workers shitty living conditions.,6/4/20
20891,24636,They knew they could do it because MOM doesnt enforce and couldnt give a flying f. Once a year maybe they will make an example by fining one company a measly sum but then its all back to business.,6/4/20
20892,24637,Hindsight my ass lol.,6/4/20

20903,24648,This issue has been raised for at least 20 years already.,6/4/20
20904,24649,Isnt the whole point of the multi-ministry task force to look at this from all angles?,6/4/20
20905,24650,"If multiple people can point out that the dorms were a problem, then someone dropped the damn ball right?",6/4/20

20907,24652,"Better than most, yes.",6/4/20
20908,24653,But hardly fantastic.,6/4/20
20909,24654,Many of the measures are reactive rather than proactive.,6/4/20
20910,24655,"From an economic standpoint, I think they've been brilliant.",6/4/20
20911,24656,Not so much for public health.,6/4/20
20912,24657,Many doctors have been pushing for full school closure and work closure for weeks now.,6/4/20
20913,24658,"There have been say, quite a few lapses in logic that I wont say publicly because I dont want to be identified- the prevailing attitude among GPs is we have been gambling for the sake of our economic health- the CB is too little too late.",6/4/20
20914,24659,I thought all foreign workers are allowed in casinos?,6/4/20
20915,24660,But what are the protocols that SAF taken to minimize potential spread compared to normal routine?,6/4/20
20916,24661,NSFs are also largely sheltered from the rest of Singapore for most of the week.,7/4/20
20917,24662,"Even on weekends, they are likely to spread out among various households, and not congregate in, say, Little India.",7/4/20
20918,24663,Downvotes shouldn't matter if you're asking a valid question.,6/4/20
20919,24664,"But as another guy u/junnies commented, 

>SAF bunks are quite similar; 50-100 men sharing the same toilet facilities, 10-20 men sleeping in bunks with beds separated 1-2 metres apart.",6/4/20
20920,24666,Hence the danger and potential for a cluster to form in camps.,6/4/20
20921,24667,"Also, i'm sure stand by bunks are being conducted more rigourously now but still...i wouldn't exactly trust the standards of a typical NSF haha.",6/4/20
20922,24668,However he also makes a good point that NSFs are more probably more inclined to report sick as they have less to lose.,6/4/20
20923,24669,Can refer to his comment for the full details.,6/4/20
20924,24670,Yeah I’m surprised too that people think migrant worker dorms look like SAF bunks.,6/4/20
20925,24671,Anyone who has seen how an average (read: not the worst) foreign worker dorm room looks like will surely not suggest such a comparison.,6/4/20
20926,24672,"IMHO, when compared to foreign worker dorms, SAF bunks will easily qualify as being five star standard.",6/4/20
20927,24673,"Not just the aspects of cleanliness or amenities (even just the basic need of having a working toilet), though those are very important factors, but I’ll put them aside since many would assume these aspects are due to the workers not taking care or keeping clean.",6/4/20
20928,24674,"I believe the key issue behind how fast the virus can spread in worker dorms, potentially making it a “petri dish” situation, aside from the lack of cleanliness and/or hygiene in a majority of the dorms, are the issues of poor ventilation and the severe lack of physical distancing.",6/4/20
20929,24675,"Most worker dorm rooms would pack say, three bunk beds within the size of a bedroom in an average HDB flat (the BTO ones, not the older flats), leaving only enough room for everyone to get up and down the beds.",6/4/20
20930,24676,"FWIK (from being a volunteer with ItsRainingRaincoats), most of the rooms also do not have any drawers/cupboards/wardrobes/storage.",6/4/20
20931,24677,Most of the workers store their belongings in their one luggage bag which they store underneath the bottom bunks of their beds.,6/4/20
20932,24678,"And by the way, about the issue of cleanliness, most migrant workers do clean up after themselves, but as with all communal living, it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for everyone else.",6/4/20
20933,24679,"Just to quote an example, I’ve once had a housemate (I’m a room renter) who was super gross, leaving food waste and used sanitary pads lying around in the open everywhere in the house, even all over the floor of her room.",6/4/20
20934,24680,🤮 *shuddering just from recalling 😖.,6/4/20
20935,24681,"So no, it’s not about one’s level of education.",6/4/20
20936,24682,P.S.,6/4/20
20937,24683,The general public will likely be surprised to know that a lot of migrant workers who are working here in Singapore actually have at least a diploma from their home countries.,6/4/20
20938,24684,ALL BOOK OUT LOL.,6/4/20
20939,24685,Honestly?,6/4/20
20940,24686,Use the NSMan bunks.,6/4/20
20941,24687,"Many ICTs have been affected or deferred, there should be extra space to split the guys in camp now I think.",6/4/20
20942,24688,ah shit.,7/4/20
20943,24689,thats pretty fucked up.,7/4/20
20944,24690,i’m lost for words.,7/4/20
20945,24691,thats just short of “can they quickly get over their sickness so i can get what i want”,7/4/20
20946,24692,Perhaps it's time to make dorm operators liable for (at least a portion of) medical costs related to outbreaks like this.,7/4/20
20947,24693,Just like how we basically told yolo citizen travelers to stop going overseas by making them liable for their own covid related medical bills.,7/4/20
20948,24694,Nothing is going to change until their pockets start hurting.,7/4/20
20949,24695,Can I get a timeline?,6/4/20
20950,24696,Those cases sound fairly recent.,6/4/20
20951,24697,"Earlier than the 75 cases two days ago and the 120 cases yesterday, correct?",6/4/20
20952,24698,I think you’re looking at it from just one perspective of healthcare but you need to remember that the government has the uphill task of balancing all sectors of the country.,6/4/20
20953,24699,It’s how to balance everything with minimal effect to daily lives or minimal effort for recovery after all is over because damage is inevitable.,6/4/20
20954,24700,"It’s definitely not an easy task, and many people seem to glance over this point when they criticize the policies enacted.",6/4/20
20955,24701,"Sure, it’s easy to say close schools and work places.",6/4/20
20956,24702,But that would have downstream effects which you need to plan for very carefully and prepare for.,6/4/20
20957,24703,"I think that secretly, they have been ramping up the efforts in the background without telling us exactly what they’re doing.",6/4/20
20958,24704,"For example the recently abandoned precinct near my place due to en bloc is now being refitted with many new facilities, with rumors that it will be a quarantine/SHN center.",6/4/20
20959,24706,Also when you start to look at everything from multiple angles you really start to fathom how critically complex the whole response and coordination is and that’s when you realize that the government has been many steps ahead of where they are.,6/4/20
20960,24707,This is not something many people come to realize in the midst of of their criticism.,6/4/20
20961,24708,"So it’s easy to stand there and say “they should have done this and that” in hindsight, but it’s all people speaking from the limited knowledge they have.",6/4/20
20962,24709,"Granted, I do not know much too but I can understand and see why the policies and implemented the way they are.",6/4/20
20963,24710,"And to blame the government on such issues they are receiving heat for, it’s not all fair to them.",6/4/20
20964,24711,"At the end of the day, the government makes the policies but it is the people who enact them.",6/4/20
20965,24712,We wouldn’t have needed to reach the stage of a CB if the common folk took social distancing more seriously.,6/4/20
20966,24713,"Look at the queues at ikea, supermarkets, etc even after the CB is announced.",6/4/20
20967,24714,The government can only do so much if the people won’t listen.,6/4/20
20968,24715,Agree with you on all points there.,6/4/20
20969,24716,"Enforcing social distancing, fall in must have gap in between, company activities done in platoon level instead, cookhouse only 1 or 2 coy at the same time, clerks stay home etcetc.",6/4/20
20970,24717,"Some might argue the effectiveness of the measures because at the end of the day all still sleep in same bunk, but it’s still something",6/4/20
20971,24718,no idea.,6/4/20
20972,24719,call it blind trust.,6/4/20
20973,24720,"worker dorm operators otoh, cannot be trusted at all.",6/4/20
20974,24721,I still remain in contact with some of my regular friends and quite a bit is being done.,6/4/20
20975,24722,"A bit too much, imo, but they aren't hand-waving this unlike what some people are claiming.",6/4/20
20976,24723,But I can't present this as concrete information because that'd make me a leaker lol,6/4/20
20977,24724,Not sure about entire SAF but I've a cousin whose whole camp outrationed food.,6/4/20
20978,24725,Probably just threaten to confine the whole company if any one of them gets the Wuhan flu.,6/4/20
20979,24726,As of tomorrow visits to the pussybush in kallang are off limits for one,6/4/20
20980,24727,Is there still stand by bunk when you’ve graduated from course?,6/4/20
20981,24728,My unit stopped that shit the minute you graduate.,6/4/20
20982,24729,People complaining about SAF bunks should go have a look at the factory converted dorms that many workers stay in.,6/4/20
20983,24730,Those are even worse than the dorms mentioned in this article.,6/4/20
20984,24731,"Poor ventilation, filled with rats/cockroaches and completely lacking in amenities.",6/4/20

20992,24739,"And those dorms are the worst of the lot, with major fire hazards too such as from overloading of electrical sockets.",6/4/20

21506,25265,Keep in mind that the conditions we've provided for them are already arguably better than what they have in their home countries (e.g.,10/4/20

21512,25271,i saw a group of aunties and uncles hanging out at the void deck as if they’re not part of a group thats the most vulnerable to the virus,10/4/20

21523,25282,I hope this exposes how little Singapore gives a shit about the foreign workers.,10/4/20
21524,25283,The contractors are even worse treating them like slaves.,10/4/20

> SINGAPORE — About 100 COVID-19 cases have been detected in foreign worker dormitories that were given the all-clear, resulting in some 7,000 workers being quarantined, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday (18 August).",18/8/20
21879,25646,"> These cases – some of whom have resumed work – were detected through routine testing conducted bi-weekly for workers living in dorms as well as those who work in construction/production sites and the construction, marine, and process sectors, said the ministries in the joint statement.",18/8/20
21880,25647,"> Over 100,000 workers have started on their biweekly routine tests to date, while seven in 10 employers have logged on and used an online swab registration system set up to schedule such tests.",18/8/20
21881,25648,> “We have taken timely actions to contain and isolate the COVID-19 positive cases.,18/8/20
21882,25649,"We have also taken aggressive actions to contain, trace, and isolate the close contacts.",18/8/20
21883,25650,"To date, over 60 per cent of cases have been closed,” the statement added.",18/8/20
21884,25651,"> Out of some 7,000 workers quarantined from the new infection cases, less than two per cent were reported to be infected with COVID-19, said both ministries.",18/8/20
21885,25652,"> The quarantined cases are “being managed according to strict protocols and reinforced with more centralised quarantine facilities made available through the completion of dormitory clearance”, they added.",18/8/20
21886,25653,"> The new infected cases in cleared dorms and decant sites are a reminder of the need for vigilance, said the ministries.",18/8/20

21888,25655,"This will help us assess patterns in the spread of infections, and review the extent of quarantine required to contain a detected case,” they added.",18/8/20
21889,25656,"> Authorities here have completed the testing of all workers in the dorms, with around 18,600 of them currently serving out their quarantine period, including 800 who were announced by the MOH last Wednesday to be newly quarantined after the discovery of a COVID-19 case among them in a cleared purpose-built dorm block.",18/8/20
21890,25657,> Both ministries said that authorities are taking “a measured approach” to tackle such situations.,18/8/20
21891,25658,It includes conveying immediate close contacts of the infected worker to serve a 14-day quarantine at a dedicated quarantine facility and testing the remaining residents.,18/8/20
21892,25659,> “We have quarantined the whole block in the first instance while the assessment is being made as a precautionary measure.,18/8/20
21893,25660,"We will rescind the quarantine subsequently for workers who are assessed to be not at risk,” the ministries said.",18/8/20
21894,25661,"> “While this approach could affect up to a few hundred migrant workers for each case, it ensures that we contain the detected case and minimise spreading that could end up affecting thousands others,” they added.",18/8/20
21895,25662,> Other measures taken to prevent a second wave of infections in the cleared dorms include segregating workers staying in the dorms by the type of industry that they work in.,18/8/20
21896,25663,"Sector agencies will also work closely with the employers to assess the risk at the workplaces and put in place safety timeouts if necessary, with aggressive testing operations conducted.",18/8/20

> SINGAPORE — Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore’s migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures “turned out to be insufficient”, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",12/6/20
21997,25768,"> During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.",12/6/20
21998,25769,"> In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date.",12/6/20
21999,25770,Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.,12/6/20
22000,25771,"> “On 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories.",12/6/20
22001,25772,"Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,” said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.",12/6/20
22002,25773,"> “However, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.”

> While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, “no two crises are the same”, Teo said.",12/6/20
22003,25774,"The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is “a major challenge”, he added.",12/6/20
22004,25775,"> On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.",12/6/20
22005,25776,"> “But they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines”, he noted.",12/6/20
22006,25777,"> The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH’s overall medical support plan.",12/6/20
22007,25778,> Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.,12/6/20
22008,25779,"> “The operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control.",12/6/20
22009,25780,But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak.,12/6/20
22010,25781,"About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,” he added.",12/6/20
22011,25782,"> Teo’s delivery is the third in a series of national speeches by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday.",12/6/20
22012,25783,Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing is scheduled next to deliver his speech on Sunday.,12/6/20
22013,25784,"> In his speech on “Resilience in a changing external environment”, Teo also spoke at length about Singapore’s efforts in providing community care facilities for patients who have mild or no symptoms.",12/6/20
22014,25785,> “We had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and had started to build them.,12/6/20
22015,25786,"We accelerated these plans and scaled them up, adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April,” he said.",12/6/20
22016,25787,"> At the peak on 12 May, some 20,000 patients were being cared for at community care and similar facilities, with as many as 1,000 are admitted daily, Teo said.",12/6/20
22017,25788,> “This is more than the total number of beds in all our public acute hospitals.,12/6/20
22018,25789,"We mobilised resources from across our public service, government-linked companies, and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities.",12/6/20
22019,25790,"Healthcare volunteers stepped forward to help man them,” he stressed.",12/6/20
22020,25791,"> “This is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our healthcare system and putting lives at risk.”

> The clear lesson learned during the COVID-19 outbreak is that Singapore needs to plan in peace-time “on facing the unknown, and build deep reserves of people and capabilities, so that when we face a crisis, we can act decisively, and respond flexibly and rapidly”.",12/6/20
22021,25792,> He referred to past challenges in Singapore’s history such as in 1967 when the British announced the withdrawal of their troops from the city-state.,12/6/20
22022,25793,"With the move, Singapore was poised to lose 20 per cent of its gross domestic product and 70,000 jobs at a time when the population was half of what it is today, Teo said.",12/6/20
22023,25794,"> “We are far more resilient today than in 1967, and better positioned to create new markets, businesses, and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.”

> Singapore also rode out the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Asian and global financial crises.",12/6/20
22024,25795,"“COVID-19 is an even bigger test,” he added.",12/6/20
22025,25796,> The outbreak is the first major crisis for many of the new generation of ministers and civil servants taking the lead in efforts to tackle the situation.,12/6/20
22026,25797,"> The ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of their older Cabinet colleagues as well as consulted widely within and outside the government, Teo said.",12/6/20
22027,25798,"> He added, “Over the past few months, I have worked very closely with them.",12/6/20
22028,25799,We speak daily and exchange views freely.,12/6/20
22029,25800,"They have stepped up to the task, worked together as a team, and led from the front.",12/6/20
22030,25801,"This is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore.”

22333,26111,"Some thoughts - given the high level numbers and the disparity between cases in the various categories (dorms only, Singaporeans/PRs, work pass holders, work permit holders etc), I barely pay too much attention anymore to the preliminary high level number that comes out at \~3pm everyday.",1/5/20
22334,26112,We have to wait for the detailed updates at night to get a better sense of how the situation is progressing.,1/5/20
22335,26113,"In particular, I'm paying close attention to community cases and work permit holders not living in dorms (I'm conservatively assuming these people are still part of the community, but most should be serving 14 day SHNs).",1/5/20
22336,26114,I reckon we need to see both community cases only (Singaporeans/PRs + work pass holders) AND community cases + work permit holders not in dorms stay low for at least 2 weeks before we start getting our hopes up.,1/5/20
22337,26115,"Dorm cases pretty straight forward there - given the tight living conditions and aggressive testing, i reckon we see high numbers for a while more before we start seeing the results of the distancing measures that were implemented about 2 weeks back for the dorms.",1/5/20

22339,26117,"In particular, both the absolute number of unlinked cases on a particular day AND following up the next day or couple to see if those unlinked cases have been linked (they do tend to take a while to link some cases because contact tracing etc is a VERY tough job).",1/5/20
22340,26118,"This is important because if they can link a specific case to an existing cluster and/or infected person, there is a lower possibility of there being existing further community spread that the authorities don't yet know about.",1/5/20

22427,26207,The 14 days limitation only makes sense if you assume that every infected WP holder outside a dorm dutifully seeks medical help.,1/5/20

tldr: I am guessing that the ""backlog"" consist of the suspect cases of people who are staying in dorms which have known infections.",9/5/20
22479,26260,"It is different from some of you, who thinks that the ""backlog"" is due to ""less testing on weekends/ public holiday"".",9/5/20
22480,26261,I feel that new clusters with big spikes is more alarming than old clusters with big spikes (probably due to backlog).,9/5/20
22481,26262,"short essay:

In early April, there was a need to increase ""**testing width**"" (to test people from different dorms to identify clusters) to quickly take action in dorms with infections.",9/5/20
22482,26263,"Due to finite testing capability, there was a **trade-of**f for ""**testing depth**"" (to test all suspect cases within a known cluster).",9/5/20
22483,26264,"This results in a large number of **suspect cases** being identified, possibly being treated as pseudo-cases in terms of medical care/quarantine, but **not immediately tested**.",9/5/20
22484,26265,"This develops into this ""**backlog**"".",9/5/20
22485,26266,"In early May, I presumed MOH had met the ""testing width"" (tested a sizable group of people from each dorm), and now is ""widening"" the testing to include healthcare workers etc (to identify the ""community transmission"").",9/5/20
22486,26267,"Since the ""testing width"" is met, I presume MOH now has the ""bandwidth"" to test those previously identified suspect cases, and thus explains the spike in number for these (old) dorm clusters.",9/5/20
22487,26268,"Nevertheless, I find it concerning that, on average, there are still more than 5 new clusters identified for recent days, and some of them even have a large number of new cases linked within the first few days of identification.",9/5/20
22488,26269,"For example, the cluster at 5 Fourth Chin Bee Road is identified on 6 May but has 38 newly identified cases of that day linked to it, As that cluster is a new cluster, this means that these 38 cases are not ""backlog"".",9/5/20

22959,26752,There was a circuit breaker back in April because local cases are on the rise.,18/12/20
22960,26753,Because we were slow to close our borders and were still allowing people to enter and leave the country.,18/12/20
22961,26754,That and the case if the foreign worker dorms.,18/12/20

22964,26757,We contained the outbreak from China.,18/12/20

Abstract

High-density communal residences are at elevated risk of large outbreaks of respiratory disease.1,2 After an initial nationwide outbreak of 231 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Singapore, which was contained as of March 24, 2020, a surge of 244 cases among migrant workers residing in dormitories, largely from Bangladesh and India, occurred from March 25 to April 7.",10/2/21
23480,27288,A national task force was formed to coordinate Singapore’s outbreak response.,10/2/21
23481,27289,A national lockdown from April 7 to June 1 enforced movement restriction and confined workers to their dormitories.,10/2/21
23482,27290,"Medical posts were deployed on-site in all dormitories, and testing capacity for testing and screening residents increased.",10/2/21
23483,27291,All workers with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result were admitted to health care facilities for isolation and treatment.,10/2/21
23484,27292,We examined the prevalence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection among migrant workers in Singapore.,10/2/21
23485,27293,This sounds incredibly implausible to me.,11/2/21
23486,27294,How could they get the death rate to 0.001% when the usual death rate is between 0.3%-1%?,11/2/21
23487,27295,It is useful to remember that Singapore *is* an authoritarian state without free media.,11/2/21
23488,27296,Its entirely likely the numbers are fudged or that they are only counting Singaporean citizens.,11/2/21
23489,27297,"If it's the latter, that is still very impressive.",11/2/21
23490,27298,It means they controlled the spread within their city.,11/2/21
23491,27299,Yeah but if you spit on the ground they arrest you.,11/2/21
23492,27300,"While this is really great and a wonderful approach for Singapore we must understand that they are a tiny country that has little to no informal areas, no rural areas to speak of, highly centralised government, and high population density.",11/2/21
23493,27301,Its far easier to organise a response to a problem for the smaller nations than that of a large federalised country.,11/2/21
23494,27302,Like I said it is a great response from them but very different for large countries.,11/2/21
23495,27303,We have too many freedoms in America!,11/2/21

23500,27308,"If you have 111,000 confirmed infections, how can you only have one death when the mortality rate is at least one percent?",11/2/21
23501,27309,How does testing and monitoring mitigate that?,11/2/21
23502,27310,And how many have permanent lung damage or other long term effects?,11/2/21
23503,27311,"and seggregstion of foreign labor

taiwan has much bettter numbers btw",11/2/21
23504,27312,That... number doesn’t look real,11/2/21
23505,27313,OR...maybe COVID is negligible on people who aren't already almost dead?,11/2/21
23506,27314,People forget that the entire country of Singapore only covers an area of 789 sq.km.,11/2/21
23507,27315,"Every male living there in the age of majority has to do regular military or police duties, so at least half the population more or less is more than willing to deal aggressively with anyone breaking lockdowns or not wearing masks, and has government countenance to do so.",11/2/21
23508,27316,It's not as hard to police a country that small with the population size than it is to police somewhere the size of anywhere in North America or most other places in the world.,11/2/21
23509,27317,YES YES YES!!!,11/2/21

23521,27329,Well hold on a minute.,11/2/21
23522,27330,I have a friend in Singapore who has to get frequently tested for covid (weekly?),11/2/21

23530,27338,The NFL had 700 confirmed COVID cases this season and no deaths.,11/2/21
23531,27339,I wonder if it was because they are in the lowest possible risk group or because they were tested a lot?,11/2/21
23532,27340,It's amazing what can be achieved with a competent dictator,11/2/21
23533,27341,Also Singapore isn’t America so the populace won’t be as dumb,11/2/21
23534,27342,"Wrong, testing, tracing doesn't affect the death rate.",11/2/21
23535,27343,What does affect the death rate is the health of the population being infected and the amount of virus they are exposed to.,11/2/21
23536,27344,"The migrant worker population in Singapore is very healthy and has no old people, they are health screened every year so the rate of pre-existing conditions is very low.",11/2/21
23537,27345,"The climate of Singapore ensures that viral exposure is low, corona virus doesn't like the heat, it is seasonal prefering cold climates (hence the seasonal recurrence in the northern higher latitudes this winter)",11/2/21
23538,27346,"Singaporean here, there is no underreporting.",11/2/21
23539,27347,"The population density is so damn high here, how are we going to hide the numbers?",11/2/21
23540,27348,I can assure u we will definitely kick up a fuss if they(government) try to hide the numbers.,11/2/21
23541,27349,"The fact is simple, 99% of the infected are from the dormitories, most of the communities clusters are traced, isolated and treated early.",11/2/21
23542,27350,It mandatory to wear mask and our location are traced.,11/2/21
23543,27351,No... it is because covid isnt deadly at all if you are young,11/2/21
23544,27352,Singapore has the BEST healthcare infrastructure of any nation.,11/2/21
23545,27353,I’m not surprised,11/2/21
23546,27354,So basically COVID was a big nothing burger.,11/2/21
23547,27355,1 death out of 110k cases.,11/2/21
23548,27356,"I know this is a little off topic, but people on Reddit in general really need to stop comparing Singapore’s Covid response to the United States’s covid response.",11/2/21
23549,27357,5.7 million compared to 350 million+.,11/2/21
23550,27358,There are multiple cities in the United States that eclipse the population of that entire country.,11/2/21
23551,27359,"20 out of 24,197 cases going to ICU is far-fetched if you ask me.",11/2/21
23552,27360,Just another scientific tabloid.,11/2/21
23553,27361,"Shame really, because I don't even want to read it now.",11/2/21
23554,27362,"Though it possibly contains quality content, I won't entertain articles that purposely obscure the findings with the title.",11/2/21
23555,27363,How does contact tracing and isolation reduce hospitalizations?,11/2/21
23556,27364,"I would think it would reduce transmissions, but transmissions aren't being pointed at here, but rather the low hospital rate.",11/2/21
23557,27365,Could it also be a situation where racial genetics affect the severity of the disease?,11/2/21
23558,27366,Because of its younger population and warmer climate!,11/2/21
23559,27367,There's several huge issues in stating that their testing and COVID measures had anything to do with low death rate.,11/2/21
23560,27368,First it assumes Singapore is as transparent and truthful as Western countries in reporting COVID data.,11/2/21
23561,27369,"Second migrant workers in most parts of the world tend to be significantly younger than the host country's population, and the death rate for people in that age range, 20s & 30s is .01% to .001% which is close to the reported death rate reported here.",11/2/21
23562,27370,"If you take anything a non western country says about their COVID data and measures without severe skepticism, you're getting hoodwinked",11/2/21
23563,27371,"Because of better therapeutics and less harmfully useless therapies and fewer over-medicated patients, you mean?",11/2/21
23564,27372,This statement makes no sense.,11/2/21
23565,27373,"If they had indeed 100k infections we would expect about 10-15k hospitalizations, 2-3k ICU admissions and around 500 - 1000 death.",11/2/21
23566,27374,"All these ""success"" stories of authoritarian regimes are just great examples on how to massage numbers.",11/2/21
23567,27375,I guess national pride beats the truth every time,11/2/21
23568,27376,Do they cane people for not wearing a mask?,11/2/21
23569,27377,Wish the USA would implement that policy.,11/2/21
23570,27378,How is that even possible?,11/2/21
23571,27379,"Testing, tracing, and isolation are all well and good but they don't make Covid any less deadly so how are their deaths per 100k so low?",11/2/21
23572,27380,They're Also like hardcore nonauthoritarian authoritarian.,10/2/21
23573,27381,The people had to comply or else.,10/2/21
23574,27382,They’re also a disguised dictatorship with a small population...,11/2/21
23575,27383,They also put you in a cage in the side of the road is they catch you jaywalking,11/2/21
23576,27384,"""if we stop testing, the cases will go down!""",10/2/21
23577,27385,If you trust any numbers from countries in LatAm or the 3rd world... You're doing science wrong.,10/2/21
23578,27386,"Yeah, something tells me they likely had issues with the false positivity rating of their tests.",11/2/21
23579,27387,"111,000 confirmed cases and 1 single death?",11/2/21
23580,27388,I considerably doubt this.,11/2/21
23581,27389,there is such a personal wealth disparity between the US and Singapore additionally.,11/2/21
23582,27390,USA is #1 on the list for personal wealth and singapore is about 12- 26 countries behind that.,11/2/21
23583,27391,I’m sure there statistics are skewed as it wouldn’t be the first country to somewhat falsify reports in covid.,11/2/21
23584,27392,It’s all about money and tourism.,11/2/21
23585,27393,So they deflate  covid statistics to appear lower.,11/2/21
23586,27394,Sounds ridiculous and not that i have anything against the country but it’s been apparent that many countries have done this already.,11/2/21
23587,27396,Theyre probably lying and 2.,11/2/21
23588,27397,Singapore is a dictatorship.,11/2/21
23589,27398,People dont have basic human right like freedom of travel and privacy in their home unless the dictator says they do.,11/2/21
23590,27399,"So they can force people to quarentine, force vaccines, force compliance without having to deal with a pesky Bill of Rights",11/2/21
23591,27400,Or that the virus was designed to be less deadly with Asian and more deadly with the rest of the world.,11/2/21

23593,27402,Not buying their numbers at all.,11/2/21
23594,27403,Remember this is a dictatorship.,11/2/21
23595,27404,"Sure, it's not evil North Korea, but it's much easier to lie and cook the books there when you don't have to answer to anyone.",11/2/21
23596,27405,Singapore is a police state and unlikely to provide true statistics on anything.,10/2/21
23597,27406,Singapore is also one of the most authoritarian countries on Earth so *not* being able to mass-control its population shouldn't be a surprise.,10/2/21
23598,27407,I'll help.,10/2/21
23599,27408,They lied about their numbers,10/2/21
23600,27409,Thats because you may get caned if you spread it.,10/2/21
23601,27410,"Gunna be sardonic here, but how OLD are those migrant workers?",11/2/21
23602,27411,I ask since younger people are less likely to need a trip to the ICU,11/2/21
23603,27412,Lots of sunshine in Singapore,10/2/21
23604,27413,"Also most of Singapore's covid cases were in the migrant worker community (ie construction workers) , of which an almost negligible proportion would be overweight.",11/2/21
23605,27414,"I didn't know we passed 40%, let alone in 2018.",11/2/21
23606,27415,"It's been increasing almost linearly since 2010, wow.",11/2/21
23607,27416,There is an entire movement that is gaining major traction where people are saying “obese” is a slur and should not be used because it “fat shames people.” Groups of people on Twitter say ob*se and get thousands of likes.,11/2/21
23608,27417,It’s mind boggling.,11/2/21
23609,27418,"Not even taking into account all the health problems that come with obesity, it is a huge risk factor for having complications from Covid.",11/2/21
23610,27419,You would think that in the age of a global pandemic that major publications like Cosmopolitan would try their hardest or at least try not to glorify obesity.,11/2/21
23611,27420,"Instead, they release magazine covers of obese women saying “this is healthy!”

I get being progressive and trying not to fat shame people, but do they really need to go out of their way and say “this is healthy!”?",11/2/21
23612,27421,All they’re doing is telling people who are obese that they are perfectly fine the way they are- which they’re not.,11/2/21

23616,27425,">migrant workers in Singapore will tend to be young

You are right, most of them are not the vulnerable groups.",10/2/21
23617,27426,And yes most of our cases are from migrant workers where the infection rate is high in dormitories.,10/2/21
23618,27427,"These workers were isolated from the community, nothing much relevant to contact tracing though.",10/2/21
23619,27428,"Living in Singapore at the moment, and the government was really great at pre-emptive testing.",10/2/21
23620,27429,"Before they allowed schools to reopen, everyone working in schools had to go through COVID testing.",10/2/21
23621,27430,"As a result, they caught a LOT of asymptomatic cases.",10/2/21
23622,27431,"All contacts of those COVID cases, including asymptomatic cases had to go through COVID testing & quarantine, and they caught even more asymptomatic cases that way.",10/2/21
23623,27432,That’s why the case numbers were so high but the death rate was so low.,10/2/21
23624,27433,We were warned that COVID is far more infectious but way less lethal than previously thought ages ago.,10/2/21
23625,27434,Singapore had a 2 month lockdown but life is nearly back to normal now.,10/2/21
23626,27435,"My daughter goes to preschool & she’s maskless since she’s under 2, restaurants & bars are open, malls are busy.",10/2/21
23627,27436,The only difference is we all wear masks.,10/2/21
23628,27437,"If they manage to avoid infecting vulnerable groups, it's very possible.",10/2/21
23629,27438,"The infection death rate for people under <40 is estimated to 0,002%, or 1 out of 50.000.",10/2/21
23630,27439,It can help by limiting exposure to more vulnerable populations.,10/2/21
23631,27440,"For example, pretend a migrant worker works in a restaurant.",10/2/21
23632,27441,That person gets sick.,10/2/21
23633,27442,"They contact trace everyone who was in the restaurant during that time, and find people who work in the local nursing home, people with elderly folks living in their home, etc, and those people end up taking extra precautions.",10/2/21
23634,27443,"The migrant worker might have got everyone sick in the restaurant, and likely everyone sick in their household, but those secondary infections are less likely to infect the old people this disease likes to kill.",10/2/21
23635,27444,"Other confounding factors might include migrant workers having fewer older relatives in the household, which limits their infections to younger people, and stuff like that.",10/2/21
23636,27445,Edit: it’s not clear that the contract tracing is causative and not just highly correlative... but it obviously doesn’t hurt.,10/2/21
23637,27446,"it didnt make sense to me initially either, but its because of the causal implication from the language used in the title.",10/2/21
23638,27447,The contact tracing and high level of testing didnt lead to a reduce severity of covid.,10/2/21
23639,27448,it led to a higher rate of identification of covid+ in mild/asymptomatic patients relative to other countries.,10/2/21
23640,27449,The title here is also inaccurate in stating that isolation contributed to this outcome.,10/2/21
23641,27450,">I think they ignored far more likely factors, such as the fact that migrant workers in Singapore will tend to be young, and also the fact that most people in SE Asia are thin.",11/2/21

23655,27464,Covid19 in Singapore is basically restricted to healthy young migrants.,11/2/21
23656,27465,"Certainly contact tracing helped keep those people from infecting the general population, but the low death rate is entirely due to who got sick.",11/2/21
23657,27466,Increased testing would also increase the number of detected asymptomatic cases.,11/2/21
23658,27467,"The true ratio of infections to severe cases in Singapore and the US is likely just about the same, but increased detection of cases in Singapore drives that ratio way up",11/2/21
23659,27468,"Yeah some of the other aspects don't make direct sense either; isolation reduces infections, not deaths, which were already high.",11/2/21
23660,27469,"However perhaps it *did* reduce transmissions to at-risk people like the elderly, after a crazy number of younger lower risk people were infected.",11/2/21
23661,27470,"They're not a nation of chain smoking, binge drinking, obese wrecks.",11/2/21
23662,27471,That's the truth.,11/2/21
23663,27472,Viral load was indicative of young healthy healthcare workers getting sick and even dying early on.,10/2/21
23664,27473,I would posture that isolation will keep viral load much lower than non isolation.,10/2/21
23665,27474,The Singapore government is super pragmatic and super averse to fear-mongering and panic.,10/2/21
23666,27475," Multiple studies have been done that show, at least in the US, there are likely 6x to up to 20x more infected people than we know about, making the real mortality rate of covid-19 far lower than reported.",11/2/21
23667,27476,"This is the case for OP's article, if they are able to test a larger percent of the population, you'll get a more accurate account of the real mortality rate.",11/2/21
23668,27477,"And in their case, it's very low.",11/2/21
23669,27478,"If we were as good at testing in the US as they are in Singapore, we'd find our real mortality rate is far far lower.",11/2/21
23670,27479,"Exactly, probably also ignoring the fact the migrant workers aren’t obese.",11/2/21
23671,27480,Probably the exact opposite if I had to guess.,11/2/21
23672,27481,"Yeah, this seems to be a poorly written advocacy paper that doesn't really make an attempt to reconcile the reason for the death rate despite the large case number.",11/2/21
23673,27482,"Contact tracing etc gets you data, it's not a functional intervention.",11/2/21
23674,27483,"Like all science on this sub, it's overreaching and probably ignoring other critical factors that don't support the theory",11/2/21
23675,27484,I think they're just pushing tracking.,11/2/21
23676,27485,Pretty sure every govt wants all civilians easily tracked.,11/2/21
23677,27486,This is just an attempt to normalize it.,11/2/21
23678,27487,Imagine you are told that you have been exposed before you start showing symptoms... so you call your doctor and get advice and medication early.,10/2/21
23679,27488,And you adjust your behavior to avoid going to an elderly family member's house or to work.,10/2/21
23680,27489,"In short, contact tracing helps with early intervention and behavior change.",10/2/21
23681,27490,"If you have 100 people in a room and 10 have the flu, but only 1 shows symptoms and you only test that person, you get a 1% infection rate.",10/2/21
23682,27491,The other 9 are allowed to mingle with the healthy people.,10/2/21
23683,27492,If you test 90 people your chances of testing all 10 sick people rise dramatically.,10/2/21
23684,27493,Those 9 people who dont get as sick count as cases.,10/2/21
23685,27494,So with Covid you can catch it and not even know.,10/2/21
23686,27495,"So you count as a case even though you are perfectly healthy, but can pass it on.",10/2/21
23687,27496,"So they found a bunch of asymptomatic people, told them ""stay home for a few weeks"" and the people did just that.",10/2/21
23688,27497,Bingo.,11/2/21
23689,27498,Your analysis is correct.,11/2/21
23690,27499,Thanks for your insights.,11/2/21
23691,27500,Don’t discount the fact that migrant workers have been in prolonged detention for almost a year now.,11/2/21
23692,27501,Much easier to effectively contract trace when you’ve walled off your hot spots and restricted movement of that sub pop.,11/2/21
23693,27502,"When you remove the migrant worker sub pop, and cases identified at borders, from the overall community spread numbers (as Singapore did) the picture overall gets quite rosy.",11/2/21
23694,27503,But wouldnt contact tracing only be effective if they work quickly enough before more people are added to the contact list thus almost exponentially spreading it.,11/2/21
23695,27504,"My thought process on that, and correct me if I'm wrong.",11/2/21
23696,27505,"But if they are not able to inform the person quickly enough, they potentially have the entire time before they are notified to spread the virus.",11/2/21
23697,27506,And of course as it spreads more the contact list gets larger and larger and makes the response time even slower.,11/2/21
23698,27507,I definitely think it is a great idea.,11/2/21
23699,27508,But I'm not so sure it is as effective as we initially thought.,11/2/21
23700,27509,"(Of course something is better than nothing but still, something isnt the best and we should never stop striving to be the best we can be.",11/2/21
23701,27510,Not only for ourselves but for those around us.),11/2/21
23702,27511,I'm also aware that this isnt quite the topic OC is on.,11/2/21
23703,27512,"But I think it might be worth it to bring up, discussions often resolve in solutions.",11/2/21
23704,27513,So lets keep this civil please.,11/2/21
23705,27514,No matter your perspectives or believes on this subject.,11/2/21
23706,27515,I think it make sense if you look into the the people who are infected.,11/2/21
23707,27516,"The majority infected are the migrant workers who are young, healthy and mostly work in the construction and manual sector.",11/2/21
23708,27517,"This workers are able to withstand and survive the covid infection much better especially if the Singapore gov is doing very serious tracing and testing, hence any positive cases were isolated and are brought to immediate healthcare if necessary.",11/2/21
23709,27518,Local community cases are contained and few.,11/2/21
23710,27519,"If the high risks and weak arent exposed to covid infection, death rate and ICU cases will definitely tends to be much lower.",11/2/21
23711,27520,Yeah came to say this as well.,11/2/21
23712,27521,Do they think if you speak the true name of the virus then you can compel it to only cause a mild case?,11/2/21
23713,27522,"So what you're saying, is that Covid isn't dangerous if you're young and healthy?",11/2/21
23714,27523,"It might artificially reduce the rate of serious cases simply because you find more cases (while other countries may find less cases, so their rates are inflated because they underestimate the denominator).",11/2/21
23715,27525,The correlation between the number of cases and number of deaths doesn't make sense.,11/2/21
23716,27526,Regular testing wouldn't drop the fatalities just hopefully stop the spread.,11/2/21
23717,27527,"Which 100,000 cases is a small number so maybe it worked.",11/2/21
23718,27528,I would say population stats has a big effect.,11/2/21
23719,27529,But with only 1 death there could be a lot of hiding stats.,11/2/21
23720,27530,If a senior caught it they would be reported with underlying conditions for example,11/2/21
23721,27531,Confirmed cases is an estimate of the true cases.,11/2/21
23722,27532,Increasing testing will get confirmed cases to match to the true case numbers.,11/2/21
23723,27533,"If Singapore was indeed testing far more than other countries, then the difference between true cases versus confirmed cases will be a fraction of what other countries are seeing.",11/2/21
23724,27534,This in turn will make the hospitalization rates far smaller than other nations'.,11/2/21
23725,27535,Seroprevalence data has shown that many countries are getting anywhere from only 1 in 2 cases or as low as 1 in 20 cases out there.,11/2/21
23726,27536,"To be able to compare like for like here, you'll need to find data from countries with similar ratios of confirmed cases to true cases.",11/2/21
23727,27537,[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2818-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2818-3) there's also the Neanderthal gene risk factor that people of European descent have inherited,11/2/21
23728,27538,And vitamin d deficiencies are probably much less common.,11/2/21
23729,27539,Seems like COVID isn't a big deal right..,11/2/21
23730,27540,"Yes the workers are all fit young men who spend all day in the sun, high vitamin D = less sever Covid",11/2/21
23731,27541,"I think (didn’t read whole paper yet) is the idea the they have found lots of cases (positive PCR) through the CT effort, and all positives went to a heath facility with isolation and monitoring.",11/2/21
23732,27542,"Catching early, and proper care early, reduced the need for high skill care.",11/2/21
23733,27543,"So, yes, lots of cases.",11/2/21
23734,27544,"But lots of severe cases avoided with strong CT, testing, early care.",11/2/21
23735,27545,This should be top statement.,11/2/21
23736,27546,Contact tracing and isolation has nothing to do with disease severity.,11/2/21
23737,27547,I call BS.,11/2/21
23738,27548,Made up numbers,11/2/21
23739,27549,"Another possible explanation for the difference in severity is that when positive cases are identified very early through contact tracing, patients can be treated earlier and can get more rest.",11/2/21
23740,27550,"Also, fewer deaths because ICUs weren't overcrowded.",11/2/21
23741,27551,"Do they count migrant workers as part if the positive tested, but then let them use their own hospitals in Malaysia, etc.",11/2/21
23742,27552,if they get proper sick?,11/2/21
23743,27554,I think OP is getting confused.,11/2/21
23744,27555,In reality it’s probably a different correlation: there have a lot of confirmed infections despite a small amount of deaths BECAUSE of effective mass testing.,11/2/21
23745,27556,"More tests, more cases",11/2/21
23746,27557,"Or they only counted the deaths for which covid was the primary cause, instead of counting every death that occurs within 28 days of a diagnosis like we do in the west.",11/2/21
23747,27558,I wonder if SARS has anything to do with it?,11/2/21
23748,27559,There’s some evidence that people who had SARS have greater immunity to Covid and SARS was in Singapore I believe,11/2/21
23749,27560,"Yep, average age of deaths is very high.",11/2/21
23750,27561,This title is very misleading.,11/2/21
23751,27562,I thought it was going to talk about superior hospital care which wouldn't make sense either but at least it would follow basic logic.,11/2/21
23752,27563,"Agreed, the information presented is good but the title clearly shows a misinterpretation of illness severity versus infection rate.",11/2/21
23753,27564,"Good contact tracing means you catch all the positive cases, not just the ones that think they might have been exposed and then maybe go get a test.",11/2/21
23754,27565,It also means they are likely to catch it sooner.,11/2/21
23755,27566,exactly I came in here to say the same thing.,11/2/21
23756,27567,It is drawing correlations and  causal relationships where there is no evidence of one.,11/2/21
23757,27568,Maybe it is just a terrible translation?,11/2/21
23758,27569,"If you test everyone, you catch the asymptomatic cases, thus the lower death rate.",11/2/21
23759,27570,Maybe their multiple counting cases or all cases are in a particular group that is less susceptible.,11/2/21
23760,27571,There may also be *some* genetic factors at play.,11/2/21
23761,27572,Look at Thailand.,11/2/21
23762,27573,I don’t know enough about the migrant labor situation to say though.,11/2/21
23763,27574,We also know that efficient masking can reduce viral load exposure which we are pretty sure *does* reduce severity.,11/2/21
23764,27575,"It could be as simple as good cultural norms around wearing a mask everywhere, having it be a high quality mask, and *wearing it correctly*.",11/2/21
23765,27576,Efficient testing & contact tracing means they catch every case including all the asymptomatic mild ones.,11/2/21
23766,27577,So that does impact the “severity” averages of the dataset in question.,11/2/21
23767,27578,"Finally, if you’re giving everyone top level antivirals and antibody treatments the same day they first test positive, that really could impact the severity rate on a mass scale.",11/2/21
23768,27579,You’re right that the main issue is probably that migrant workers are typically younger and healthier than other populations.,11/2/21
23769,27580,But I’m guessing some of those other factors are at play.,11/2/21
23770,27581,You report it the best way you want to.,11/2/21
23771,27582,To look good.,11/2/21
23772,27583,Look at Florida they don’t have covid.,11/2/21
23773,27584,And North Korea.,11/2/21
23774,27585,China cleared all covid.,11/2/21
23775,27586,Look into their ventilator usage- or rather lack of - then look into how the ventilators in America are what caused most of the deaths.,11/2/21

23777,27588,"The ventilators killed most people, not the virus.",11/2/21
23778,27589,"Just like how during the Spanish flu, H2N2 1958/9 flu pandemic, and 1968 flu pandemic, it was bacterial pneumonia from nasal bacteria migrating to the lungs due to mask usage that killed most people.",11/2/21

23780,27591,Completely agree.,11/2/21
23781,27592,Even best case scenario these numbers look unrealistic.,11/2/21
23782,27593,"There's no way there was 100,000+ cases which only occurred in the young population and miraculously none of them ever went near vulnerable or older people.",11/2/21
23783,27594,Either really bad reporting or deliberate misinformation is the only way this is possible.,11/2/21
23784,27595,Quite correct.,11/2/21
23785,27596,"Considering how grossly overstated the mortality rate is and the age and health if the group in question, this makes perfect sense.",11/2/21
23786,27597,What makes no sense if the piss poor conclusion of this headline.,11/2/21
23787,27598,What if all of the solutions suggested help reduce the viral overload heavily?,11/2/21
23788,27599,"Thus reducing the severity of symptoms, if any, the person gets?",11/2/21
23789,27600,That's the only thing I can possibly think of because I completely agree with your comment.,11/2/21
23790,27601,Does that mean.. it's not really as deadly as people make out.,11/2/21
23791,27602,It's just that there are significantly unhealthy populations who can't withstand normal society?,11/2/21
23792,27603,That's not anyone else's fault.,11/2/21
23793,27604,"Couldnt proper contact tracing get people in for testing and treatment before having symptoms, thus not letting things get as bad before they start to improve?",11/2/21

23795,27606,That’s because it’s nonsense.,11/2/21

23797,27608,And probably get plenty of vitamin D since it's near the equator.,11/2/21

26533,30402,"Yes it is selfish to decline a swab, but public health responses also require considering human psychology.",17/1/21

26947,30836,"Just out of curiosity (with no animosity or hostility against you), how would you propose going about improving the conditions without reducing the numbers of workers in a dorm?",2/6/20
26948,30837,"I believe that this is the only realistic path seeing that reducing the number of people will reduce the strain on the common facilities (toilets, shower area etc etc), and reduce the amount of dirt being brought in from their work sites.",2/6/20
26949,30838,"There are also arguments that the reason that dorms are in their bad states is also partially due to their own habits and culture where what they consider as ""clean"" might not be ""clean"" to Singaporean standards.",2/6/20

26981,30870,It was rhetoric.,1/6/20
26982,30871,Sorry.,1/6/20

26985,30874,FW who are working in building maintenance and marine services most likely have their own apartments.,2/6/20
26986,30875,"There is no way Singaporeans would want to do the job that the FW who lives in dorms do (construction, grass cutting, road resurfacing 6 times a week etc etc)

For your second point, yes I believe that culture and mindset does play a part in the current condition of the dorms.",2/6/20

27106,30997,Wow our community cases have actually only been 20+ the past few days which is great.,18/4/20
27107,30998,"However the flip side is because of the CB measures it makes it harder to trace, hence like the report says it likely means there are still undetected cases in the community.",18/4/20

27113,31004,"> # 558 of 623 new coronavirus cases in Singapore are foreign workers from dormitories

> SINGAPORE - Foreign workers staying in dormitories make up 558 of the 623 new Covid-19 cases on Friday (April 16), the Ministry of Health said in its second update on infection numbers of the day.",18/4/20
27114,31005,> The other patients are 27 community cases and 37 work permit holders who did not stay in dormitories.,18/4/20
27115,31006,There is also one imported case.,18/4/20
27116,31007,"This brings Singapore's total count to 5,050 coronavirus cases.",18/4/20
27117,31008,> MOH announced four new virus clusters as well.,18/4/20
27118,31009,"> S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Singapore's largest cluster, added another 144 patients and is now linked to more than 1,000 cases.",18/4/20
27119,31010,> MOH said that it was also concerned that it is increasingly difficult to link the new cases and identify the source of infection.,18/4/20
27120,31011,"> The ministry said the number of unlinked cases in the community has increased slightly, from an average of 19 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 22 per day in the past week.",18/4/20
27121,31012,"> ""We have an ongoing surveillance programme, where a small sample of patients at our primary care facilities are tested for Covid-19 infections,"" said MOH.",18/4/20
27122,31013,"> ""We have picked up some cases through these tests, which is an indication of undetected cases in the community.""",18/4/20
27123,31014,"> Earlier in the day, MOH released preliminary figures ahead of its usual evening announcement.",18/4/20
27124,31015,"It is not clear why it decided to do so but there were messages circulating earlier that Singapore had logged the biggest single-day spike of 1,146 on some online platforms.",18/4/20
27125,31017,Numbers are high but Singapore can still recover a bit of the face back if they can fix their living issues and no more of the workers die,18/4/20
27126,31018,Apparently a lot of the foreign workers didn't come down with anything too bad as well.,18/4/20
27127,31019,Hopefully this is a sign of good things,18/4/20
27128,31020,"It's an average of the increase, not daily increase.",18/4/20
27129,31021,There is an average of +2 per day this week as compared to the previous.,18/4/20
27130,31022,WP holders (especially long term ones) likely live among locals so the distinction is strange.,18/4/20
27131,31023,"RIP to the uncle indeed, poor man.",18/4/20
27132,31024,">still undetected cases in the community

Yea...and if everyone do their part and stay at home, I rather have many isolate cases than many big clusters",18/4/20
27133,31025,"But sadly , the number of unlinked cases has gone up slightly from 19 to 22 avg per day.",18/4/20
27134,31026,"I wonder if local community numbers are low because a lot of the testing resources have been diverted to the dormitories for now, since the government wants to make sure they arrest the spread there first.",18/4/20
27135,31027,Work permit holders who don't stay in dormitories are basically community cases in all but name.,18/4/20
27136,31028,"If you don't stay in dorms, where do you stay?",18/4/20
27137,31029,That's 37.,18/4/20
27138,31030,I wouldn't really be this optimistic.,18/4/20
27139,31031,27 community cases and 37 work permits outside dorms.,18/4/20
27140,31032,Aren't the WP ones outside dorms community transmissions as well?,18/4/20
27141,31033,Wow we are so easy to be comforted by the way figures reported.,18/4/20
27142,31034,all about massaging the numbers,18/4/20
27143,31035,"So IBs can say it's not ""local"" spread.",18/4/20
27144,31036,"Yes, this part is super interesting especially as the Situation Report is now breaking the prevalence down by these groups too.",18/4/20
27145,31037,So as far as I can work out they are separating work permit holders out and then sub-dividing that into dorm / non-dorm.,18/4/20
27146,31038,Then others count in the community cases.,18/4/20
27147,31039,What they don't really explain is what these groups include.,18/4/20
27148,31040,"So lets take the Situation Report population at risk numbers, Dorms - 323,000 / Non-dorm 664,000 = total 987,000

That number nicely matches up with the June 2019 numbers here: https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers Work permit total = 981,000

The interesting thing though is that those numbers include FDW permits which would seem to be the definition of residents in the 'community'.",18/4/20
27149,31041,"So as far as I can work out community cases include citizens, PRs and Pass Holders (EP/SPass/PEP/Student Dependents Social etc)

Work Permits group contains 323,000 in dorms, 255,800 FDWs and then another block of 408,200 Work permit holders that do not live in dorms.",18/4/20
27150,31042,So the only thing that really ties this remaining group together is that according to work permit rules it's the employer that is responsible for providing housing for these workers (and in a way I guess that's technically the case with FDWs).,18/4/20
27151,31043,"So a theory for this is that there's a fairly fluid definition of what is and what isn't a Dormitory and sure enough the MOM helps us out again here: https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing

So maybe the missing piece of the puzzle here is the large block of construction workers who are allowed to be housed in temporary quarters and these are not being counted as 'dormitories' 

If this is the case (and the numbers seem to tally somewhat) then the only problem I can see is that the 255,000 FDWs being included in this group are reducing the prevalence in the non-dorm group.",18/4/20
27152,31044,So that numbers look lower.,18/4/20
27153,31045,27 and 37 vs. 64.,18/4/20
27154,31046,Psychological impact is less.,18/4/20
27155,31047,Imagine when it hits triple digits.,18/4/20
27156,31048,Nicer to say (for example) 48 and 68 vs. 136.,18/4/20
27157,31049,its a game called statistics,18/4/20
27158,31050,I suspect (could be so wrong) but a majority of these work pass cases could be the result of contact tracing from dorms.,18/4/20
27159,31051,"Community cases are from people being sick and then are tested, whereas work pass cases would be a combination of contact tracing and individuals being sick.",18/4/20

really, man?",18/4/20
27161,31053,u disgust me.,18/4/20

27166,31058,They might have had interactions with dorm workers when working or on off days.,18/4/20
27167,31059,Not much is known about the profile of this group.,18/4/20
27168,31060,"Hard to say, might make sense to categorize them separately for now for trending purposes.",18/4/20
27169,31061,"Trends for most landlords are they are absentee ones, with them living elsewhere with one locked rooms.",18/4/20
27170,31062,The ones actuslly living in the flat or house are likely WP holders too.,18/4/20
27171,31063,It's a mixed bag.,18/4/20
27172,31064,"Malaysians work permit holders and those in the ""services category"" (e.g.",18/4/20
27173,31065,PRC cooks and food court assistants) are allowed to rent HDBs.,18/4/20
27174,31066,But I suspect many of the non-dorm WP holders work in the same places (e.g.,18/4/20
