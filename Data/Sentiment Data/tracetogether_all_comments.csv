16828,23449,There have often been comments on how the spotlight and adulation are always focused on them.,30/12/20
16829,23450,Well it is fully justifiable.,30/12/20
16830,23451,"Even during pre-Covid 19 times, the doctors and nurses are overwhelmed with work and yet they are still dedicated, caring and professional towards their patients, sometimes working beyond their shift hours.",30/12/20

16837,23458,We must thank our government for the free vaccinations and grateful to the leaders and officials who worked hard to secure vaccines for our citizens.,30/12/20
16838,23459,PM Sir believe the challenge is even as free vaccines are progressively available for 🇸🇬 however as it's on voluntary basis hopefully many Singaporeans and eligible long term residents will go for vaccination.,30/12/20
16839,23460,No one is safe unless everyone is really safe.,30/12/20
16840,23461,Thank you sir for all the efforts in bringing in vaccines early here 🙏🏼,30/12/20

16862,23483,"Instead of a testing regime, government should urgently look into inoculations of the frontline workers who are exposed to foreigners or foreign entities - namely the aviation (air crews) and marine sectors (engineers who board foreign entities docked in Singapore etc); not just looking at vaccinating the frontline workers of the healthcare sectors.",31/12/20
16863,23484,"With the access to protective gears, adequate knowledge and experience, healthcare workers are less vulnerable than those workers of the aviation and marine sectors, who also will not know if they are in contact with infected persons or contanminated objects.",31/12/20
16864,23485,Please think out of the box.,31/12/20
16865,23486,Good to have vaccines for now but we must improve the strength of the vaccines thus more investment is needed.,1/1/21
16866,23487,Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are only 95% effective.,1/1/21
16867,23488,There is another 5% in which the virus might have a chance to mutate and form a even more deadly virus in future so we should not be celebrating yet.,1/1/21

20317,27233,"Looking at this as a non-Singaporean, everyone involved did exactly the right thing, which led to an unintended and unforseen ""problem"".",8/1/21
20318,27234,"There was an urgent need for the Trace Together token as there is an ongoing public health emergency, and  Minister Balakrishnan and the development team would have been laser focussed on creating it, and having it adopted as widely as possible.",8/1/21
20319,27235,"They opened up the source code for audit by privacy advocates/hackers etc., who were approving of what they saw.",8/1/21
20320,27236,The generaly high level of trust in your institutions and the privacy audit led to a pretty high voluntary adoption rate.,8/1/21
20321,27237,It's easy for me to see how they could have overlooked that the data could or would be accessed and used for purposes other than contact tracing given thier focus on the pandemic and getting the token out ASAP.,8/1/21
20322,27238,"Now, a police officer investigating a murder case realised that hey, that data might be useful in this case?",8/1/21
20323,27239,Is there anything legally preventing us from getting it?,8/1/21
20324,27241,"Well, let's get it!",8/1/21
20325,27242,This is great savvy and professionalism from law enforcement; anything else would really have been a dereliction of duty on their part.,8/1/21
20326,27243,"They did exactly as they should given their mandate, and narrow focus on bringing a criminal to justice.",8/1/21
20327,27244,"Now,  Minister Balakrishnan must have been peeved when he became aware of this, because this was genuinely not his intent, and was seen as the Government breaking their word, when it was really law enforcement acting independently (actually a positive).",8/1/21
20328,27245,"So at this point, how should it be settled?",8/1/21
20329,27246,Do you go the legislative route to ring fence the token data?,8/1/21
20330,27247,"Given that the pandemic is time limited, and that legislative process may take some time, as well as the genuine value for criminal investigations, my opinion is that it shouldn't.",8/1/21
20331,27248,"The compromise that the data will remain accessible, and only be used by LE for serious cases is the best solution in my opinion.",8/1/21

20343,27261,Is his ego so fucking big that he can't say that?,8/1/21
20344,27262,Looking at the historical evidence that the government is willing to eat their own words.,12/1/21

20351,27269,"This kind of strategy could work in the past without too many drawbacks, but personally, I think the issue is that the government is simply not keeping up with the development of global trends.",7/1/21
20352,27270,"They think that they can govern the country as they deem fit, totally independent and disregarding global trends but the fact is Singapore is one of the most interconnected countries in the world, all global trends affect us and we are not like China where most western media platforms have been blocked and censored.",7/1/21
20353,27271,Just take a look at some SG politician's response to Marijuana legalization in the west for example.,7/1/21
20354,27272,It just shows a total lack of understanding of global trends.,7/1/21
20355,27273,"Similarly in this TT case, they don't seem to understand the kind of seriousness and sensitivity that is being placed on privacy issues globally in 2021.",7/1/21

20359,27277,I am okay with that attitude actually.,7/1/21
20360,27278,"The problem was that in the past, the government really did know what they were doing, and were often more correct than not.",7/1/21
20361,27279,So people were content to let the government run things for them because the government really did know best.,7/1/21
20362,27280,"Today, the current ministers don’t exactly inspire confidence.",7/1/21
20363,27281,And I think that’s what rankles people - that they continue to adopt this “government knows best” mentality when they clearly don’t.,7/1/21

20365,27283,"The government does have more knowledge, resources and competence than the average citizen in relation to most affairs.",7/1/21
20366,27284,"They need to work on their communication, yes, but by and large the decisions they make are sound.",7/1/21
20367,27285,They just need to be a bit cleverer about how they go about spreading their message.,7/1/21
20368,27286,I am f-ing pissed because the alleged pros of having TT data to substantially aid in criminal investigations and prosecutions (if even tenable given that I can manipulate my “location” by leaving the token elsewhere) are FAR OUTWEIGHED by cons - which is the irreversible damage to the trust people have in the government.,8/1/21
20369,27287,This trust imo is invaluable.,8/1/21
20370,27288,Especially in the current turbulent times with a pandemic and shuttered global economy.,8/1/21
20371,27289,Just look at countries around the world where most people don’t have trust in the government to fulfil what they promise.,8/1/21
20372,27290,The govtech team and relevant agencies painstakingly built this trust over the later half of the year; only for it to be singlehandedly destroyed for the off chance that it might aid criminal investigations??,8/1/21
20373,27291,It’s such a profoundly costly and stupid trade-off.,8/1/21
20374,27292,No money or cash handouts can ever repair that trust deficit they created.,8/1/21
20375,27293,I can accept that Vivian might have omitted to consider the application of CPC at the first instance.,8/1/21
20376,27294,"But NO ONE in SPF, MHA, AGC brought it to his attention in the subsequent weeks?",8/1/21
20377,27295,"He also admitted as much that he found out about it but discussed with his colleagues and decided to proceed ahead nonetheless (btw his sob story about having sleepless nights, which I empathise cos I suffer from insomnia too lol, is wholly irrelevant and doesn’t play out well when you’re trying to seek the people’s forgiveness/understanding).",8/1/21
20378,27296,We don’t know when he first found out about it but we know that it likely ain’t just this year.,8/1/21
20379,27297,I am pissed because I (and many of us) trusted them to do the right thing and had spent much time and effort persuading family and friends to adopt TT to help our national effort to combat covid-19.,8/1/21
20380,27298,Plus the fact that the gov had spent months persuading us and addressing all concerns people posed (INCLUDING about using TT data for crim investigations).,8/1/21
20381,27299,"The cons are even greater because people are less inclined to use TT responsibly now, which undermines the whole purpose of contact tracing.",8/1/21
20382,27300,"To me, this is a matter of Principle and Trust, both of issues the PAP always prides themself on having.",8/1/21
20383,27301,It is regrettable and sad that certain leaders decided that this invaluable trust and the PAP’s self-perceived reputation of being principled are worth tearing down for the ostensible benefit that it might or might not bring to crim cases.,8/1/21
20384,27302,"Same logic as ""The government can always track you with cell towers anyway""

Then why do TT?",7/1/21
20385,27303,Just use the cell towers!,7/1/21
20386,27304,"TraceTogether is a two edged sword, it can incriminate you, but it can also provide an alibi - one can easily leave a token in a friend’s bag (friend need not even know).",7/1/21
20387,27305,So can TT stand up to court of law?,7/1/21
20388,27306,"You can’t go around saying that TT shows that you are at a crime scene but then turn around and says that even though TT provides an alibi, alibi is not effective as it can be planted.",7/1/21

20390,27308,Take when they need it for investigation?,7/1/21
20391,27309,They're just retaining the option to take it.,7/1/21
20392,27310,maybe cuz they made protesting illegal under the public order act,7/1/21
20393,27311,Just wait till they remove the safe entry feature from SingPass.,7/1/21
20394,27312,Didn't they already say that TT is going to be mandatory?,7/1/21
20395,27313,"Straight to the point , I like it",7/1/21
20396,27314,other countries systems have users' privacy in mind (a lot of them are based on Apple and Google's api).,7/1/21

20405,27323,To all 40 ppl they’ve vaccinated so far,7/1/21
20406,27324,"If it isn't free how many people would take it, honestly?",8/1/21
20407,27325,It is to the economy and hence the party's advantage to make it free.,8/1/21
20408,27326,Seems like what I'm gonna say is going to be unpopular opinion on this sub and I'm most likely gonna be downvoted but so be it.,8/1/21
20409,27327,"I would be more concerned if the government is passing laws just to ""keep up with global trends"".",8/1/21
20410,27328,"Just because some country passes a law because they think it is good, does not mean that we have to.",8/1/21
20411,27329,"If we had followed what other countries did in the past, Singapore would not be as prosperous as she is today.",8/1/21
20412,27330,"And honestly, though a lot of people don't want to admit, sometimes the government does know better.",8/1/21
20413,27331,The one issue that is becoming prevalent in today's society is that a lot of people think that they are smarter than they actually are.,8/1/21
20414,27332,"I'll admit that the ministers of today are not probably not as capable as the ones in the past, but neither are the general public.",8/1/21
20415,27333,I completely agree that they could have communicated the inclusion of the use of TT for serious criminal investigations and I understand why people would be upset.,8/1/21
20416,27334,But I would at least think that because of this pandemic people would at least understand that there is a bigger picture to look at first before publicly stating the the government is completely un-trustable now.,8/1/21
20417,27335,It also helps that the population has gotten more educated and knowledgable thanks to the entire education system and increased access to the internet.,7/1/21

20431,27350,"However, this form of governance also requires significant trust by the majority of the populace in the gov of the day.",9/1/21
20432,27351,"So when the gov destroys this fragile trust, it brings about a whole lot of issues that would only hinder the gov’s ability to retain popular support WHILE still implementing the right (not necessarily popular) decisions for the country’s overall benefit.",9/1/21
20433,27352,"If the gov had been transparent about the CPC earlier in the last few months, gave assurances that it is restricted to those 7 severe crimes (murder, rape, terrorism), I am confident that most of us would be willing to forgive and accept it as well.",9/1/21

20435,27354,It is reassuring that their proposed legislation restricts TT data in crim investigations to the list of 7 kinds of crime.,9/1/21

23880,30898,May I ask why do you say so?,29/10/20
23881,30899,Yup my grandma too!,28/10/20
23882,30900,Unfortunately its not available everywhere and every shop yet so still need do check in.,28/10/20
23883,30902,It’s just pinging against other tokens/apps.,28/10/20
23884,30903,And this info will only be downloaded if you’re contagious.,28/10/20
23885,30904,Dk why pple keep saying privacy issue.,28/10/20
23886,30905,There are so many everyday-use apps that track way WAY more info than a TT app.,28/10/20
23887,30906,"Not only apps, but browsers, websites...",28/10/20
23888,30907,Doesn’t mean I can’t have any concern about my privacy.,28/10/20
23889,30908,Because it says so on the news.,29/10/20
23890,30909,And i also happen to know how they think.,29/10/20
23891,30910,Of course you can be concerned about your privacy.,29/10/20

23903,30922,I find TT 100x more safe than safeentry for sure but i dont use it because of the battery depletion.,29/10/20
23904,30923,"On top of that, many phones have in built QR scanners so some also dont see a need for downloading an app for check in and out.",29/10/20
23905,30924,I personally use singpass for safeentry (as compared to QR scanner) bc of the check in/out function.,29/10/20
23906,30925,Safeentry was an easier option to many hence I didnt expect them to plan to remove safeentry (via singpass/qr scanner) in the first place.,29/10/20

We've really had too many instances of ""last leader say one, not I say one"" or ""Times are changing and we need to change with the times"" to believe the govt when they say they will (cross their heart) only use this data for this particular instance and never again.",9/9/20

23925,30945,Totally agree and I’m not using.,9/9/20
23926,30946,What a chance for the government to acquire almost population scale data.,10/9/20
23927,30947,Ease and convenience of contact tracing is just a mask for whatever is going on behind the scenes.. We will never know..,10/9/20

24604,31631,The ISA was enacted initially with a defined end point (communist threat).,10/9/20
24605,31632,"It morphed from ""It's imperative we have it to counter communist threats from MCP"" to ""It allows us to counter espionage and terrorism"" to ""safety and security of Singapore is paramount"" to continue to justify its existence even today, many decades after its initial end point was passed.",10/9/20

24635,31662,"Even if an effective vaccine is found today, rolling it out will take years so I hope a therapeutic is found instead.",10/9/20
24636,31663,Hence IMO getting back to normalcy will involve a trade-off of some privacy if safety is also considered.,10/9/20

24650,31678,Okay I can see that.,10/9/20
24651,31679,I guess what I meant was the type of privacy breach when a security leak occurs --- the data isn't in a central location so your location isn't leaked to the third party or the world.,10/9/20

24662,31690,They don’t choose not to invest in countries because of human rights or privacy concerns.,11/9/20
24663,31691,They choose not or invest because of the risk to their own business.,11/9/20

24665,31693,"My comment on heavy-handed comes because of the obvious discomfort a significant segment of the population have had regarding TT when it was first launched in June and the rolling out now, with the article saying it will soon the expanded to F&B, gyms, work places, etc (if not intended, then why say that and create unnecessary discomfort?).",10/9/20

24682,31710,"It's more like Safeentry as a system largely depends on a compliant population that agrees with the policy to work well (Using a mall as an example, unless they want to deploy officers at every unit within the mall, there's difficulty in ensuring that people use Safeentry on every location they visit).",10/9/20
24683,31711,A TraceTogether token removes this hurdle for the government since it does all the work once it is in your hands -> they'll only need to deploy someone at the door to ensure you have your token when you enter the mall and every activity you do in the mall can be logged.,10/9/20
24684,31712,Mandating SafeEntry in law is like criminalizing jaywalking.,10/9/20
24685,31713,"You could do it, but the enforcement is iffy.",10/9/20

24732,31761,"Again, not to say it's fine, but more trying to argue that the damage is already done.",10/9/20
24733,31762,I don't understand what you mean by SE exchange signal with TT on your phone.,10/9/20
24734,31763,"But I get that TT can leak your location: The device next to you knows where its location is, and it can identify the hashes from other TT devices, so those devices must be in that same location.",10/9/20
24735,31764,Identifying the devices from the hashes is the hard part.,10/9/20
24736,31765,The point is that so far the only arguments I've seen here are identical to the anti-lock down protesters.,10/9/20

24748,31777,"If it's at that bizarre point, I'm sure the ISA would be used to arrest people.",10/9/20
24749,31778,That one is because they’re concerned about China freezing their assets actually.,11/9/20
24750,31779,It’s not about data privacy concerns.,11/9/20
24751,31780,With BTO you start off with 99 year old lease if I’m correct?,10/9/20

24762,31791,It all boils down to the same root issue of whether governments will abuse the power they're given.,11/9/20

24764,31793,You will.,10/9/20
24765,31794,Who is going to pay a higher price for your 50 year old flat when they can BTO themselves?,10/9/20

24767,31796,You clearly don't understand economics.,10/9/20
24768,31797,Will you buy a 50 year old HDB for a high price instead of BTO a newer cheaper flat?,10/9/20
24769,31798,inflation alone over the 50 years time would push the price up.,10/9/20

24812,31842,"Sounds like OP is confusing the difference between hash and encryption, which should be a basic concept in the field of IT/Cybersecurity.",21/3/20

24814,31844,"Brute forcing the combination with a self-made list containing all the possible phone numbers isn't really that hard to do, and won't take up a lot of time, considering the computing and processing power that computers have these days.",21/3/20

24818,31848,"OP subsequently said the following in another of his replies:

>And do you think in this time of a pandemic that cybercriminals are roaming about with massive bluetooth hijacking setups in order to walk next to what is potentially another virus carrier?",21/3/20
24819,31849,You have to be within bluetooth range and you have to handshake with the right authentication or permission for bluetooth access.,21/3/20
24820,31850,"I would take my chances with that over the possible spread of COVID19, which is a clear, imminent danger and proven threat.",21/3/20
24821,31851,You'd be surprised.,21/3/20
24822,31852,"The value of the information may outweigh the risk of contracting of the virus to some, and some hackers would still take the risk of getting into a crowded idea just to hijack other devices.",21/3/20
24823,31853,"If they are that scared of the virus, they can easily minimise the risk by driving around in a car, carrying out a [wardriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving) bluetooth attack.",21/3/20
24824,31854,OP is also operating under the presumption that hackers won't want to go out and gather all that information/deliver malware during this period.,21/3/20

24830,31860,"I'm not here to discourage people from downloading the app, but I'm here to inform people of the potential risks that they're getting into by downloading this app/prolonging their use of bluetooth, and to point out OP's flaw in logic/misconception as well.",21/3/20
24831,31861,"At the end of the day, the code is not open-sourced, so we can only speculate for sure.",21/3/20
24832,31862,"Boy, do I have something you need to know: there's already a mesh of bluetooth trackers all over Singapore already, sending data to stores, adtech companies and more: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/14/opinion/bluetooth-wireless-tracking-privacy.html

All you need to track a specific individual is their bluetooth MAC and their phone number/name/NRIC.",21/3/20

24838,31868,You may be under the impression that since leaving GPS and Bluetooth on doesn't drain your battery much compared to when it's off.,21/3/20
24839,31869,I'll remind you that the radios actually consume power when they are in use.,21/3/20

24845,31875,I have a question about how a handshake token is generated using MOH's private key without the app requiring Internet connectivity to work.,21/3/20

24854,31884,"Wouldn't say the top 1%, but most likely top 15%.",21/3/20

24856,31886,"For this Bluetooth token you speak off, is it possible to provide info how long the handshake/ devices are within range?",21/3/20
24857,31887,One other criteria besides distance is also period of exposure to case,21/3/20
24858,31888,Actually I send this Reddit to a smart friend of mine who doesn't have Reddit at the moment and I forgot an important thing about hashing.,21/3/20

Firstly, if the hash can be broken with a password, and the hash property of being one way algorithm and has no key needed does not hold water.",21/3/20
24863,31895,This looks more like encryption.,21/3/20
24864,31896,Some people mix up hashing and encrypting often.,21/3/20
24865,31897,"Secondly, given the size and space of Singapore's phone number, digits size of 8, each from 0 to 9, it is rather quick to brute force to calculate all hashes, even if the hashing is implemented correctly indeed.",21/3/20

24878,31910,Bluetooth Low Energy was built for this.,22/3/20
24879,31911,I'm also heartened by the approach of storing the data as a local blob which never leaves your phone unless the user AND MOH both validate.,22/3/20

24886,31918,"If a user has already installed the app, at the cost of battery life, system resources and privacy, they've already committed at some level, threatening prosecution to secure permission they've already implied at point of install, comes at the cost of turning many potential users off with draconian enforcement.",22/3/20

25139,32190,">I also like to add while there are popular software that are open-sourced nowadays, I have never heard about the past govt-developed apps like SGSecure and Health 365 releasing their source code.",21/3/20

25141,32192,"Also, from my own experience as a computer engineering graduate, I do not think that it is possible to find open source program / codes for everything we use.",21/3/20
25142,32193,I think most of us just have to accept the fact that there are many programs that will remain proprietary software.,21/3/20

25147,32198,It's going to be open sourced apparently https://mothership.sg/2020/03/tracetogether-installed-open-source/,24/3/20

25183,32235,Maybe you are able to track a confirm case location movement if you throw in the resource and manpower .,21/3/20

25193,32246,"At least if ppl install it, they have a glimpse of potential IT risk vs helping faster contact tracing in this pandemic period.",21/3/20
25194,32247,"Well I don't doubt it, but we are forgetting we can turn off the app and delete it whenever we want, so if you really feel uneasy at any time you can remove it.",21/3/20
25195,32248,There exists a compromise between having to watch everyone completely and not watching at all.,21/3/20
25196,32249,"The analogy I will use is like if everyone had a little coin tin they carried around all the time, and everyone you met would deposit a token inside.",21/3/20

25200,32253,This special cipher is a very strong encryption.,21/3/20
25201,32254,"It is only feasible to break this encryption if you have the master key, which only the government possess.",21/3/20
25202,32255,"All your other concerns are valid, but very very unlikely to happen.",21/3/20
25203,32256,"All app/playstore applications must be approved, and they are also digitally signed.",21/3/20

25206,32259,It works and operates on well defined and understood cryptographic principles.,21/3/20
25207,32260,The only data that TraceTogether collect is your mobile number so that MOH can contact you more quickly if you were in close proximity to a COVID-19 case.,21/3/20

25212,32265,Lol I hope that doesn't happen.,21/3/20
25213,32266,"Ideally we educate and prove to everyone this is a good, safe app to use for contact tracing.",21/3/20
25214,32267,Nah!,21/3/20
25215,32268,It works even when the display is off!,21/3/20

25223,32276,"We can discuss the pros and cons, but only after we are completely educated about what this app is, and can do.",21/3/20
25224,32277,It's for contact tracing before declared confirm case la.,21/3/20
25225,32278,"In theory yes, what you describe is indeed feasible, because if we are to be placed under a quarantine order and our phone was detected outside of our homes, then that would raise questions of you breaking the law.",21/3/20
25226,32279,"However, I do not believe that is the intention of this app, even if this is incidentally one of its use cases.",21/3/20
25227,32280,"However, the cost of breaking quarantine here is one of life and death.",21/3/20
25228,32281,"We do not quarantine lightly, and I think that there ought to be punishment for those who break the rules.",21/3/20
25229,32282,"If in fact they had spread the disease willfully, even if there was no app, they would be caught and punished.",21/3/20
25230,32283,There are no shortage of CCTVs and patrols to help ensure compliance to the laws anyway.,21/3/20

25233,32286,I hope the network effect is sufficient to protect you.,21/3/20

25235,32288,Whether that is a good or bad thing it's up to you.,21/3/20
25236,32289,It works only when open on iPhone... rendering it useless to 70% of Singapore,21/3/20
25237,32290,"Yes, I would assume that would make sense.",21/3/20
25238,32291,"I think you could also tell them who you know you're exposed to as well, such as your family, so that factor isnt too worrying.",21/3/20

25253,32307,"Privacy-conscious people will want to stay away, regardless.",22/3/20
25254,32308,Someone asked on Govtech's Facebook page specifically for iOS users and they clarified that it'll work even if we keep the app open in the background.,21/3/20

25902,32986,In my opinion it’s far better to just tell people up front the worst possible case scenario (which in this case isn’t that bad) than to pussy foot around it.,21/3/20

25937,33021,No.... it is possible and what you're saying is wrong.,21/3/20
25938,33022,It quite literally says in the FAQ they do not know where you are.,21/3/20
25939,33023,"Unless you're saying that a stat board is making a false statement, in which case that is a very serious accusation.",21/3/20
25940,33024,I trust that the information is as correct and complete and made in good faith.,21/3/20
25941,33025,The FAQ says the app doesn’t track you.,21/3/20

25946,33031,It didn’t even trust the NSA for crying out loud - “trust me I’m the government” is a damn poor argument to use with a US corporation.,21/3/20

25960,33045,I am just an enthusiast.,21/3/20
25961,33046,My issue is the app will be less effective without iOS users on board.,21/3/20
25962,33047,And they can’t get on board without Apple getting on board.,21/3/20
25963,33048,And Apple will not get on board if these concerns are not addressed.,21/3/20
25964,33049,And they are not trivial concerns and require 100% trust in the state.,21/3/20
25965,33050,"I’m not sure how much usage data they will collect, since it’s not stated in the FAQ, but assuming they at least check if the app has been used “x” times a day and duration, it will give a clear picture on whether or not to rely on these users.",21/3/20
25966,33051,My experience with users will suggest that they’ll be super enthusiastic the first few days and then forget about it if it’s hard to use.,21/3/20

25974,33059,And stating that TT has 75% participation rate is almost laughable because it was made mandatory so of course people will participate.,5/1/21

26573,33668,For TraceTogether you can sniff the network tragfic and data store to verify what's being saved and sent.,7/6/20
26574,33669,You can't do that as easily on a piece of hardware.,7/6/20
26575,33670,This is a good point.,7/6/20
26576,33671,I think that many people are jumping the gun on the functions of the device too quickly.,7/6/20

29045,36232,This is why we need an Ombudsman.,5/1/21
29046,36233,I guess I'm okay with police using information via TT to solve a crime **but** what I'm not okay is they clearly stated TT will be used for contact tracing.,5/1/21
29047,36234,I was surprised when they mentioned the police can also access TT at the start of yesterday's parliament.,5/1/21
29048,36235,At least be honest from the start.,5/1/21

29707,36933,"If so, how exactly does the device record the data?",8/6/20
29708,36934,The difference is scale and speed.,8/6/20

30388,37662,The IRS requires you to submit SSN for your children to get children's tax deductions; this is because people were adding fictional children to get deductions.,28/10/20

30406,37681,Reading about insurgency and counter-insurgency warfare?,28/10/20

30415,37691,"Because of your poor comprehension skills, you misread.",29/10/20
30416,37692,So why do you think Singapore's government is not one of the best in the world?,29/10/20
30417,37693,There are several metrics used to measure the effectiveness of a government.,29/10/20
30418,37694,"Unemployment, healthcare, education, cleanliness of the streets, safety.",29/10/20
30419,37695,Singapore has done well in these.,29/10/20

30422,37698,You're being pedantic.,29/10/20
30423,37699,Will it suit you better if i edit to one of the best?,29/10/20
30424,37700,If it makes you feel better I will.,29/10/20
30425,37701,Your lack of logic and objectiveness is still showing through though,29/10/20
30426,37702,"No, you misread what I said.",29/10/20
30427,37703,One of the best and the best ever are 2 very different things.,29/10/20
30428,37704,"You can say that Fandi Ahmad is one of the best, but to say that he's the best ever is a point of contention.",29/10/20

30430,37707,"Since you are so thick, I've changed it to one of the best ever to help you get it.",29/10/20
30431,37708,Does it change the argument at all?,29/10/20
30432,37709,no.,29/10/20
30433,37712,I thought the burden of proof should be on the one making the statement?,29/10/20
30434,37713,Still trying to dodge the question?,29/10/20
30435,37714,I've already listed down my reasons.,29/10/20
30436,37715,All you do is to shift goalposts.,29/10/20
30437,37716,I've not seen a single argument that you made thus far.,29/10/20
30438,37717,Maybe you don't have any.,29/10/20
30439,37718,"So, are you going to dodge the question again?",29/10/20
30440,37719,Where are the goalposts?,29/10/20
30441,37720,You gotta set them first before I can shift them.,29/10/20
30442,37721,"Bring in the evidence to back up what you say, then we can talk.",29/10/20
30443,37722,"As I have mentioned for the 3rd/4th time, I said that Singapore's government is one of the best in the world.",29/10/20
30444,37723,"But you shifted the goalposts and tried to take my words as ""the best ever in the world"".",29/10/20
30445,37724,"What you just did was use the straw man argument, which is to attempt to prove an argument by over exaggerating the opponent's argument.",29/10/20
30446,37725,"After I called you out and embarrassed you, you went silent and tried to dodge all my questions so far.",29/10/20
30447,37726,"As for evidence, if you had bothered to read my previous comments, you would have seen that I said it's pretty much well known that Singapore has one of the best education, healthcare, safety and cleanliness in the world.",29/10/20
30448,37727,"International organisations like the world health organisation, economic intelligence unit, OECD has ranked Singapore highly in these areas.",29/10/20
30449,37728,You often find Singapore in the top ten in those rankings.,29/10/20
30450,37729,Now let me hear your arguments.,29/10/20
30451,37730,"Or are you still going to dodge the question, as you have been doing for the past few times?",29/10/20
30452,37731,It's quite obvious that you don't have any arguments to make.,29/10/20
30453,37732,Which is why you probably over exaggerated my claim in the first place to try to disprove it.,29/10/20
30454,37733,You even edited your comment after you got called out.,29/10/20
30455,37734,"I've already ""shifted the goalposts"" back to ""one of the best in the world"" to unbunch your panties.",29/10/20
30456,37735,Now go back and address it and not take the topic off tangent.,29/10/20
30457,37736,"As expected, once again, you dodge the question.",29/10/20
30458,37737,You're the one taking the topic off tangent.,29/10/20
30459,37738,So far you haven't even presented anything remotely close to an argument.,29/10/20
30460,37739,So far this discussion has been you trying all means to avoid having an actual discussion.,29/10/20
30461,37740,You are talking about yourself?,29/10/20
30462,37741,"I have already changed it to ""one of the best"" to make you happy.",29/10/20
30463,37742,Now start addressing those points and not dodge with meaningless words.,29/10/20
30464,37743,I have already presented my arguments with evidence.,29/10/20
30465,37744,Now your turn.,29/10/20
30466,37745,Why do you think Singapore's government isn't one of the best in the world?,29/10/20
30467,37746,You're the one dodging with meaningless words.,29/10/20
30468,37747,In fact you've dodged the question 10 times.,29/10/20
30469,37748,I'm asking for your evidence.,29/10/20
30470,37749,It's not going to be my turn until you provided your evidence that Singapore's government is one of the best in the world.,29/10/20
30471,37750,Did you even read my past comments?,29/10/20
30472,37752,"I have already provided my side of the argument, unlike you who is clearly dodging the question.",29/10/20
30473,37753,You are just going to insist you did while I'll continue to insist you didn't.,30/10/20
30474,37754,"Unless you can show the evidence which you should easily be able to do, it won't work out for you",30/10/20
30475,37755,"Because you have poor comprehension skills, I'll bring it up for you to see again


>As for evidence, if you had bothered to read my previous comments, you would have seen that I said it's pretty much well known that Singapore has one of the best education, healthcare, safety and cleanliness in the world.",30/10/20
30476,37758,So are you going to dodge the question again?,30/10/20
30477,37759,"Once again, that's not evidence, that's empty statements",31/10/20
30478,37760,"So you doubt the findings of OECD, WHO, PISA and other international organisations?",31/10/20
30479,37761,Well yes?,31/10/20
30480,37762,Who still believes the WHO Nowadays?,31/10/20
30481,37763,Looks like you have no arguments after all.,31/10/20
30482,37764,"If you are not willing to believe evidence, then how would you like to discuss the topic?",1/11/20
30483,37765,I would believe it if you actually provided some,2/11/20
30484,37766,What metrics do you judge the effectiveness of a government by?,2/11/20
30485,37767,"I think it's because many are concerned about ""what next"" even if this current one 'appears' to be non-intrusive.",9/6/20
30486,37768,"It may be okay now, but what happens if more features are added, or this device is replaced/upgraded/enforced by law the next time?",9/6/20
30487,37769,"Will the common public be so used to being tagged like that, and be accepting the next time?",9/6/20
30488,37770,Will the next app/device be open-source or transparent in its technology?,9/6/20
30489,37771,How secure is it really?,9/6/20
30490,37772,Remember when TraceTogether didn't require your NRIC number?,9/6/20
30491,37773,"It's these kinds of things that worry many, especially the more discerning out there, and rightfully so.",9/6/20
30492,37774,Not on board with this.,9/6/20
30493,37775,"There’s too many unknowns, and not enough safeguards, from both a technological and policy perspective.",9/6/20
30494,37776,There are manifold concerns that remain to be addressed - and rushed implementation of something this privacy intrusive needs much more thought and debate than this is being given.,9/6/20
30495,37777,"From a policy perspective, whilst the G has said that only a team of MOH officers will have access to the data and that’s its protected by OSA, that doesn’t mean that police and other investigative bodies can’t use their investigate powers to request for the data which has been provided to MOH.",9/6/20
30496,37778,"That’s particularly concerning given that criminal charges could potentially be built on this data - and in the absence of freedom of information legislation, we’d never know how this data is treated.",9/6/20
30497,37779,"If this is to go through, we need a strict system of binding rules - whether in legislation or not - to govern data access of if the G wants something as intrusive as this.",9/6/20
30498,37780,The public service recommendations are just not enough.,9/6/20
30499,37781,This is particularly given that the G’s track record on surveillance is already questionable.,9/6/20
30500,37782,"From a tech perspective, we don’t know how this works yet.",9/6/20
30501,37783,One example: the device doesn’t have a net connection - but will it pair with smartphones?,9/6/20
30502,37784,"If so, data could be transmitted from the device to your phone and then onwards from there.",9/6/20
30503,37785,"Also, just because the device doesn’t track location doesn’t mean that the G can’t cross reference the data it collects from the device with other data sets it has.",9/6/20
30504,37786,"An additional consideration is that the G’s cybersecurity record is pretty poor, and data with this level of sensitivity is always going to be a nice prize for people looking to get at it.",9/6/20
30505,37787,"Some folks are saying - I have a clear conscience, therefore I don’t mind using it.",9/6/20
30506,37788,"To me, it isn’t about that at all, but rather the potential for this to be the first step down a very dangerous path.",9/6/20
30507,37789,I bet some tech guy is gonna break the device down to component level.,9/6/20
30508,37790,I opened up my old bank token to casually see what was inside.,9/6/20
30509,37791,"I mean hey, the battery lasted over 2 years not like we use it a lot anyway.",9/6/20
30510,37792,But the fact that the bank could resync it somewhat intrigued me.,9/6/20
30511,37793,"Look, I agree with you that the government isn't there to track you (they have better means, trust me).",9/6/20
30512,37794,"I myself have been supportive of initiatives like TraceTogether, which has been shown and proven, by independent people (and I tried it myself too), to not save/transmit any personal/location info.",9/6/20
30513,37795,"iOS/Android acts as a check-and-balance, by telling me that the app is not accessing my location data.",9/6/20
30514,37796,"However, for this device we: don't know the capabilities of the device, unless we do a tear-down of EVERY SINGLE DEVICE.",9/6/20
30515,37797,"But what happens if we see a micro-controller that isn't a standard part (for example, not one I can pick up at Sim Lim Tower?)",9/6/20
30516,37798,and there's no datasheet?,9/6/20
30517,37799,"What if it just says ""CHINA"" on it with no part/bin number?",9/6/20
30518,37800,"I'd be more worried actually, maybe a foreign country would have put in a backdoor that activates it through a specific BLE signal?",9/6/20
30519,37801,"How would I know that this ""BLACK BOX"" does whatever you said?",9/6/20
30520,37802,"Yeah, I could technically ""scan"" the airwaves for signals, but then again, how the hell would I know what is stored inside it (especially if it is encrypted)?",9/6/20
30521,37803,I can go on and on.,9/6/20
30522,37804,"And x5,000,000, by the way, because maybe it's only 10k devices that are rigged by the supplier (e.g.",9/6/20
30523,37805,they knew that it would be distributed to PM/ministers or worthy targets).,9/6/20
30524,37806,It's the same as electronic voting.,9/6/20
30525,37807,How the hell do I know that the computer can be trusted?,9/6/20
30526,37808,"I am a software engineer, I can check that the code is safe and correct (if it's open source).",9/6/20
30527,37809,"However, I can't check the hardware and the code it is ACTUALLY running, unless ELD allows me to bring an oscilloscope to the polling booth and probe each machine.",9/6/20
30528,37810,"Time and time again has shown that many government around the world have failed in ensuring security of their technology, either due to laziness or incompetency.",9/6/20
30529,37811,"Heck, even US cannot secure their bloody nuclear silos properly, what more SG government and this small stupid, one-off project.",9/6/20
30530,37812,This could (I'm not saying will) be the one too.,9/6/20
30531,37813,The blame cannot be entirely on Singaporeans because there was an absence of information when the wearable was first mooted.,9/6/20
30532,37814,"With the absence of details, rampant speculations will occurred.",9/6/20
30533,37815,"The details doesn't have to be a full github code dump, but lay out the high level principles on (1) why we need this (2) how this device works (3) how is privacy protected.",9/6/20
30534,37816,Three things.,9/6/20
30535,37817,Probably half a press release.,9/6/20
30536,37818,"apart from what others have been saying, recent episodes also highlight the lack of checks and balances in place over the government.",9/6/20
30537,37819,"despite all the commentaries and petitions, in practice there is nothing stopping them from making any laws and changing the constitution as they wish",9/6/20
30538,37820,The resistance is understandable.,9/6/20
30539,37821,The fact is that the device is sharing data with other nearby devices in the background wirelessly with no input/authentication from the wearer.,9/6/20
30540,37822,"Not that it is workable for contact trancing, but for example If the device needs to touch a dedicated reader or press a button to register a contact share, it feels completely different.",9/6/20
30541,37823,"As much as I agree with your general sentiment,

>the device only has Bluetooth as the means of transmitting data.",9/6/20
30542,37824,Data is not transferred over any data network.,9/6/20
30543,37825,"I don't think this has been confirmed, has it?",9/6/20
30544,37826,"In the Tracetogether app, if you test positive, MOH sends you a code that allows you to upload your data to the server, presumably through data network or Wifi.",9/6/20
30545,37827,I would not be surprised if the device DOES have another means of transmitting data.,9/6/20
30546,37828,"The local implementation does not use the Google/Apple API, and I think it means that the connection between the device ID and your NRIC needs to be sent to the MOH server when you first register.",9/6/20
30547,37829,"ETA: Sorry, I did not read yesterday evening's update that clarifies it is indeed incapable of internet or mobile telephony access.",9/6/20

It reflects poorly on our country aswell",9/6/20
30550,37832,"What I think is that the idea of the device isn't fundamentally bad, but with many things, boils down to the issue of execution of said idea.",9/6/20
30551,37833,"Technology, of course, isn't going to be perfect, but it shouldn't be shunned altogether.",9/6/20
30552,37834,"As it is just a concept right now, I am perfectly fine with the idea.",9/6/20
30553,37835,"Theoretically, it does streamline the contact tracing process, and it solves the problem about iPhone users that cannot(?)",9/6/20
30554,37836,"use the TraceTogether app (forgive me, I'm an Android user myself).",9/6/20
30555,37837,The question has to be asked though: how secure does this entire system have to be in theory in order to convince the general population to accept this particular move?,9/6/20
30556,37838,Security is never going to be watertight; some hacker out there is bound to find a way in.,9/6/20

30560,37842,"If through the device, all the government wants is my location with respect to everyone else, it's something I can abide them with, but it has been made painfully clear that the government is going to have to be extremely transparent with what they are putting out.",9/6/20

30646,37932,What I’m trying to bring across is that with a better user experience.,3/6/20
30647,37933,Users would be more inclined to use the app.,3/6/20
30648,37934,By adopting Apple or Google’s API.,3/6/20
30649,37935,They would not need to reinvent the wheel of showing how many contacts you’ve came across or to add additional languages.,3/6/20
30650,37936,These are already available with the OS API itself.,3/6/20
30651,37937,"Bottom line is, if they don’t focus on user feedbacks, then well.",3/6/20
30652,37938,They’re not gotta get the user adoption rate they want.,3/6/20
30653,37939,What good does “how many people you’ve interact with” when the App stops working in 5 minutes because you forgot to place it in the foreground?,3/6/20
30654,37940,Or how does that metric even help if the battery depletes within a couple of hours of use because my iPhone is already 4 years old?,3/6/20
30655,37941,"Never mind, the drain seems to have lessened after restarting my phone.",3/6/20
30656,37942,Will observe it for a while to see if it's really gone away.,3/6/20
30657,37943,The Exposure Notification API doesn’t appear to have been implemented.,3/6/20
30658,37944,There are no additional entitlements and the app doesn’t ask for Exposure Notification permissions from the user.,3/6/20
30659,37945,So I guess it's still not worth the time for iPhone users then.,3/6/20
30660,37946,"The thing is that it's not an app for you to ""use"" per se.",3/6/20
30661,37947,I've installed the app since it was introduced way back in Mar and I've probably only opened it less than 5 times till now.,3/6/20
30662,37948,"The app works in the background, and there's hardly any info provided inside that's of particular interest to users.",3/6/20
30663,37949,In fact it's a little bit of an overkill even to have that NRIC barcode function.,3/6/20
30664,37950,"A typical user would only need to be onboarded, and  open it when they're contacted by MOH for contact tracing and that's pretty much the only point of contact the UI needs with its users.",3/6/20
30665,37951,I like the new onboarding process and I think it's a great improvement over the older versions.,3/6/20
30666,37952,I do agree it's odd that it's not using exposure notification.,3/6/20
30667,37953,"However, my impression is that the new update has fixed some of the issues with iOS, see [https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/360043735593-How-do-I-know-that-my-app-is-working-](https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/360043735593-How-do-I-know-that-my-app-is-working-) which specifically shows the app being left on in the background on an iphone.",3/6/20

30671,37957,"If you’re on iOS, without leaving the App in the foreground.",3/6/20
30672,37958,It’ll get nuked by the operating system within 5 minutes.,3/6/20
30673,37959,Hence the need for the use of the API provided by Apple.,3/6/20
30674,37960,My exposure counter increased by 2 with the App backgrounded.,3/6/20
30675,37961,However that could be because I’m setting it up at home together with my parent’s devices.,3/6/20
30676,37962,I’ll check back again in a few days time 🤔 to see if it is indeed working.,3/6/20
30677,37963,Edit: I suspect that TT is doing away with the low power mode because it’s cumbersome.,3/6/20
30678,37964,What is happening is probably Background App Refresh(BAR) kicking in.,3/6/20
30679,37965,"During this time, it collects the tokens given out by other TT users.",3/6/20
30680,37966,"However, imho this method isn’t reliable since BAR cannot be controlled, it’s either On or Off.",3/6/20
30681,37967,There’s no in between of how much you want the app to run when it’s in the background.,3/6/20
30682,37968,iOS will direct BAR to prioritise apps that are frequently used.,3/6/20
30683,37969,"Which explains why they added the SafeEntry feature, so that people would use the app more often and hence increasing the priority of the app being picked up by BAR.",3/6/20
30684,37970,"While this is a pretty smart way to game BAR, I think that adopting the API provided by Apple is still the way to go.",3/6/20
30685,37971,As it gives the developers a more fine grained control over the polling rates.,3/6/20
30686,37972,Aha ya I'm using Android so it works perfectly for me.,3/6/20
30687,37973,Too bad (or good?,3/6/20
30688,37974,From a privacy point of view) Apple had too much limitations to it's ecosystem and had to use a new API to implement this tracking.,3/6/20

31397,38743,In a way I'm okay but it's the dishonesty I don't like.,4/2/21
31398,38744,If they want to use it for other purposes besides contact tracing they should've been honest from the start.,4/2/21

31420,38766,Singapore also rejected the use of Apple/Google's contact tracing solution because it relies on the user to act and does not allow authorities to see who were potentially exposed to COVID.,4/1/21

31432,38778,Do you want people to use the app?,4/1/21

31440,38786,also don't take a smartphone with you when committing crimes.,4/1/21
31441,38787,"also, don't commit crimes.",4/1/21
31442,38788,"I don’t think the article is clear so for more info before people think the police can now just freely check on anyone like some all seeing eye, they are only able to request for this data when they bring you in for an investigation.",4/1/21
31443,38789,Your data is still stored on your local device only.,4/1/21

31446,38792,Who knows.,4/1/21
31447,38793,But the current use case is not unreasonable imo.,4/1/21
31448,38794,Contract tracing only on certain locations.,4/1/21
31449,38795,They can don't activate app or trace together device to do crimes.,4/1/21

31458,38804,"Clearly, Singapore's devs either didn't care, or thought it was a *feature*.",5/1/21
31459,38805,"I don’t know if I’d call it an abuse of power, if you live in Singapore you’re already familiar with their particular position on the scale of collective needs vs individual freedoms.",4/1/21
31460,38806,"Most importantly, they aren’t doing this without announcing it or trying to otherwise hide it from the people.",4/1/21
31461,38807,"The message is simple (and one that people in Singapore have heard all their lives): the government will use any tool at its disposal to protect society against threats, would-be criminals are warned.",4/1/21
31462,38808,"Singapore is a democracy, but it is a democracy that takes the position that a government of the people has a responsibility to be proactive in defending the collective interests of the people it is supposed to represent.",4/1/21
31463,38809,"From what I’ve seen of the world’s democracies who claim to respect privacy rights, the reality is that they also collect data on their citizens and the biggest difference is that they simply don’t bother to use that power to protect their citizens.",4/1/21

31472,38818,What should be used as a helpful public health measure is abused almost immediately for nefarious purposes.,5/1/21

31612,38962,But does the GDPR make evidence against you inadmissible like illegally obtained evidence in the US?,4/1/21
31613,38963,Or does it just let you sue the data collector for getting you convicted?,4/1/21
31614,38964,I’m genuinely interested in the answer.,4/1/21

31624,38974,This app started out with the sole intent of contact tracing and of course the government wants to alter it to their advantage,4/1/21

31640,38990,As far as I have understood GDPR government agencies can't use data in that way either.,4/1/21
31641,38991,If anything I'd guess government agencies have stricter rules and adherence to the GDPR than private entities.,4/1/21
31642,38992,"For example you can't use your security system (swiping key cards to enter building) for things that don't have to do with security, like tracking employee work hours.",4/1/21

31650,39000,Govtech is the Singapore governments technology branch.,4/1/21
31651,39001,They developed the app and refused apple and Google's contact tracing app.,4/1/21
31652,39002,So technically the Singapore police force can use the app any way they like.,4/1/21
31653,39003,And now the Minister of State for Home Affairs has confirmed this.,4/1/21
31654,39004,Well since Singapore is not a European country it doesn't have to adhere to GDPR.,4/1/21
31655,39005,It has its own rules called PDPA and as expected there are loopholes for the government to exploit,4/1/21

32337,39721,Life in singapore with cpc set up specifically to exclude TT will see not much changes.,6/1/21

32339,39723,I cannot think of any laws that get amended to exclude name of specific app.,6/1/21
32340,39724,But I do can think of a set of law that get set up in extremely short time to provide for action against a certain virus.,6/1/21
32341,39725,My point is our laws have always been as malleable as when it's (politically/operationally) convenient for them to be malleable.,6/1/21
32342,39726,The technical aspects are never much of issues.,6/1/21

32352,39737,Penal code forbid physical violence but excluded police if police use violence as part of duties.,6/1/21
32353,39738,If police use violence outside their duties this whole exemption is moot.,6/1/21

32356,39742,(Never mind that officially wee Kim wee is the first elected president cuz he exercised the power of elected president blah blah).,6/1/21

32359,39745,This place not America.,6/1/21
32360,39746,Even WP had been pushing for abolishment of elected presidency for the longest time.,6/1/21
32361,39747,So whats your point?,6/1/21
32362,39748,"My point is that if you disallow the police to gather evidence from this particular source for investigation, someone (maybe the government,  maybe a rougue civil servant) can abuse this and the police will be powerless to gather evidence on suspicious activity (like suspected GPS tracking and backdoor) from this source (TT app).",6/1/21

32365,39751,"My point is that if the legislative body interfere with executive powers to assuage the public on paper (populist move) over a specific app (unprecedented), it is an issue (a technical one too ).",6/1/21
32366,39752,"""Our president no executive power"": precisely why they got away with amending the definition of an elected president?",6/1/21
32367,39753,"I'm not the one bringing in America, comparing privacy with physical violence, and WP's policies and yet I'm the one zipping all over the place?",6/1/21
32368,39754,I might have misread your previous comment on 'separation of executive and legislation as an issue that is technical enough' as a reference to President/Cabinet.,6/1/21

32371,39758,Which led to my biggest point.,6/1/21
32372,39759,The purpose of the legislative is to represent constituents' will in the political arena (by being elected) and ensure the will is empowered through voting within the Parliament.,6/1/21
32373,39760,"Hence, the legislative by nature, antagonistic and interference to the executive, if the executive's action is not representing constituents will.",6/1/21
32374,39761,Whether the constituents are wishing for dumbshit is another different subject for debate.,6/1/21
32375,39762,"Due to the supermajority within Singapore and the party whip, the legislation is in line with the executive.",6/1/21
32376,39763,"Executive say something legislative will vote along with it, cuz party whip.",6/1/21
32377,39764,"And the executive has pushed for many laws when it is convenient, contorting them to fit the agenda.",6/1/21

32379,39766,"So, is it populistic for the public to ask for TT to be excluded from cpc?",6/1/21
32380,39767,We can agree to disagree.,6/1/21
32381,39768,"Is it justifiable for this to be done, in that it serves the greater good?",6/1/21
32382,39769,We can agree to disagree on what is the greater good/lesser good.,6/1/21

32409,39806,They either have to purchase from school vendor or use their personal devices.,4/2/21

32436,39841,Has to be a no from me.,12/1/21
32437,39842,I think the simple response is that the laws imposed are not appropriate.,12/1/21
32438,39843,TT is meant to be a temporary measure (yes yes we know that may turn out to be untrue).,12/1/21

32444,39849,"If not, then what’s the real value in using TT for evidence?",12/1/21
32445,39850,Arguably it would be problematic if a suspect can engineer a situation where they get someone else to carry their TT device in a different location right?,12/1/21
32446,39851,"If we apply some critical thinking to this, it surely raises more questions than the answers that have been provided thus far.",12/1/21
32447,39852,Even the way the law being rushed out and how it’s being lauded by the PAP (self-praise at its highest) runs contrary to the sob stories they were telling in Parliament.,12/1/21

32477,39882,"Though I would argue from the point where the Sultan's signature of the treaty which allowed the British as much free reign over the island as they did, eventually created the conditions such that they were able to eventually dispose of him.",12/1/21
32478,39883,"(rather than continuing to satisfy him with higher payment renegotiation) 

If the Sultan's agreement was shrewd enough to include immigration restrictions, thereby preventing the British utilisation of foreign convict labour, and hence forcing the British to depend on native labourers loyal to the Sultan.",12/1/21
32479,39884,Then perhaps things would have turned out differently.,12/1/21
32480,39885,Though also perhaps the way things did turn out was for the best.,12/1/21
32481,39886,"Similarly, the question should be asked.",12/1/21
32482,39887,Is the current design of TT's relationship to the law shrewd enough to prevent potentialities of citizen mistrust of gov initiatives?,12/1/21
32483,39888,Perhaps the hard-code way it is implemented interacts with the Police bureaucracy in such a way that it indeed a good safeguard and in time the citizens will see this and understand that they are in good hands.,12/1/21
32484,39889,"Perhaps it will happen in another way, either with the Police mishandling the data or with some flaw in PR causing the public to heavily doubt the policy, both cases leading to detrimental mistrust.",12/1/21
32485,39890,Only those with a keen understanding of the Police bureaucracy as well as the nature of gov-citizen media relations would be able to give a good estimate of the potentialities of the TT design as is.,12/1/21
32486,39891,That line of investigation would be useful to undergo both to affirm our confidence in this line of action as well as to introduce refinements if necessary.,12/1/21
32487,39892,Good enough based on current facts.,12/1/21
32488,39893,"But if you consider the long term potential implications, probably a good chance it might be bad.",12/1/21
32489,39894,"Hence overall as a government policy, maybe.",12/1/21
32490,39895,"Ultimately if people are refusing to help contact tracing out of spite and placing individual privacy rights over collective safety, the responsibility of any repurcussions falls on them.",12/1/21

32494,39899,You do know that the Malay states also relied on FTs just not in that big of a number,12/1/21
32495,39900,Or maybe people don't just take extreme positions where they only value either privacy rights or collective safety?,13/1/21
32496,39901,Maybe the majority of people are in the middle ground with thresholds of privacy they are willing to sacrifice for collective safety?,13/1/21
32497,39902,Maybe losing trust when the whole system is built upon trust in the first place is the reason people get 'spite'ful?,13/1/21
32498,39903,"Nope, guess we're all 'left'ist, time to move to America.",13/1/21
32499,39904,Two wrongs means the first guy is wrong in the first place.,13/1/21
32500,39905,Why no punishment for them and only for the second guy?,13/1/21
32501,39906,"People are concerned about their privacy rights and this is a global issue, not solely an American one.",13/1/21
32502,39907,Your lack of knowledge is glaringly obvious.,13/1/21
32503,39908,Oh i was refering exclusively to the Indian convict labour under the East Indian Company which Crawfurd utilised.,12/1/21
32504,39909,But this is also the first time I am hearing of FT usage by the Malay states of the time.,12/1/21
32505,39910,"My source did curiously mention how the original treaty delegated the management of the Chinese immigrants under jurisdiction of the Sultan, which was interesting for me why they decided to do that.",12/1/21
32506,39911,Mind dropping me a source for my further reading?,12/1/21
32507,39912,Well this is directed at those who are expressing those positions here...there are people who simply said they will quit using out of spite.,13/1/21
32508,39913,"Oh, it's you again.",13/1/21
32509,39915,"Idk, maybe because if enough second guys compromise tracing we may end up with more untraced cases and more clusters?",13/1/21
32510,39916,"You literally acknowledged it, ""Two wrongs"", which means both are wrong.",13/1/21
32511,39917,"Like I said, two wrongs do not make one right.",13/1/21
32512,39918,But I'm afraid that's too difficult a concept for you to understand.,13/1/21
32513,39919,I never even mentioned punishment for either party.,13/1/21
32514,39920,What on earth are you going on about?,13/1/21

32518,39924,"Other people who are financially crippled from covid have more important concerns than your individual liberties, or can you selfish people not see past your privilege?",13/1/21
32519,39925,Your lack of vision is glaringly obvious.,13/1/21
32520,39926,And do you really believe in privacy in this age?,13/1/21
32521,39927,"I suppose yes, if you don't own a phone.",13/1/21
32522,39928,Your information is just a statistic to them.,13/1/21

32535,39942,Because it will not happen.,13/1/21
32536,39943,PAP only clings onto power (other than their Gerrymandering) due to the promise of good economic performance.,13/1/21
32537,39944,Another lockdown means the shaking of trust in their ability as a government as it will send the economy into a nosedive.,13/1/21
32538,39945,"They know this, we know this.",13/1/21
32539,39946,Plus we are in the final legs of this pandemic with the vaccine rolling out.,13/1/21
32540,39947,You are imagining a binary world where it's either TT and no lockdown or no TT and another lockdown.,13/1/21
32541,39948,It's not realistic nor smart to make such an assumption in a tiny city state like SG.,13/1/21
32542,39949,"Our borders are not as pourous as other countries, we have good medical infrastructure and a largely educated population.",13/1/21

32544,39951,"Now more than ever, is the time to ask questions of the govt and their role in your life.",13/1/21
32545,39952,You said we have close to no privacy in SG.,13/1/21
32546,39953,"I will not refute that, but why have it reached this point?",13/1/21
32547,39954,"It is because we have accepted things as they are, apathy is what led us here.",13/1/21

32551,39958,"Not to say that it's okay, and you can't be mad, but it's a different question.",13/1/21
32552,39959,Why is TT a bigger problem than private companies' data harvesting?,13/1/21
32553,39960,"It is because TT gives data to the government, which has so much more influence over your actions and daily routines with little to no benefit that SafeEntry already provides (SafeEntry is another problem).",13/1/21
32554,39961,In exchange for this barely existing benefit you are allowing the government the expand it's powers to see who you meet and how long you meet them.,13/1/21
32555,39962,"If you follow PAP'S track record, they are not hesitant to persecute Singaporeans with a different set of political beliefs.",13/1/21
32556,39963,Are we going to allow a government to have that much power?,13/1/21

32564,39971,"So, what are you on about?",13/1/21
32565,39972,I'm not going to explain to you why privacy matters because that's a complex subject about a slippery slope.,13/1/21
32566,39973,There's plenty of material online if you care to read up.,13/1/21
32567,39974,Information is not just a statistic.,13/1/21
32568,39975,There's lots of things people can do with indoor location data and I'd rather not give out such information unless I know that it is only going to be used for it's intended purpose.,13/1/21
32569,39976,"As I said before, your lack of knowledge on the subject is glaringly obvious.",13/1/21

32576,39983,"I was talking about the attitudes of people who say they would be willing to let it happen to flip off the government, as if this did anything for them and for us.",13/1/21
32577,39984,I am criticizing the underlying attitude.,13/1/21
32578,39985,"Like I said, I was addressing the attitude of certain people towards a lockdown and not the likelihood of a lockdown.",13/1/21
32579,39986,"From their words, they were saying that even it were to cause another lockdown, they would still turn off their bluetooth just to spite the government, which would in their hypothetical scenario, be nothing but foolish and selfish.",13/1/21
32580,39987,"So, I am criticizing that attitude.",13/1/21
32581,39988,It is that attitude that I rightly criticize.,13/1/21
32582,39989,"I do have a general disdain for most of the consensus of this sub, given that most of the people engage in the same mudslinging ad hominem you speak of and only hop on the downvote bandwagon without sound arguments to show for it.",13/1/21
32583,39990,"I try to limit my arguments to the ideas alone, but some responses I get do tend to grind my gears.",13/1/21
32584,39991,Read what I wrote.,13/1/21
32585,39992,People know another lockdown won't happen because it will cause PAP to lose its claim to power.,13/1/21
32586,39993,Which is economic performance.,13/1/21
32587,39994,"They took too long to lock the country down at the start, that indicates alot",13/1/21
32588,39995,"Look, I understand where you're coming from, but you need to see where all of this is coming from if you want to be taken seriously.",13/1/21
32589,39996,Nobody likes being lied to.,13/1/21
32590,39998,The fact that a government which everyone trusted is doing it makes everyone feel betrayed.,13/1/21

32596,40004,"That's not the point, dude.",13/1/21
32597,40005,People know it won't happen but said that they would be willing to have it happen IF flipping off the govt would make it likely to happen.,13/1/21
32598,40006,So I am criticizing that selfish attitude.,13/1/21
32599,40007,"That was an edit-in, because it was pretty apparent to me that people don't want to have a reasonable discussion in the first place - not that I mind the downvotes, but if you wanted to be so closed to the discussion, why not make your own sub where all you hear is yourself and yourself #2 speak?",13/1/21
32600,40008,I personally think that people are kicking up a big fuss over something that can be reasonably discussed.,13/1/21

32605,40013,It's a form or literary device.,13/1/21

32610,40018,"If the majority disagree with you, that doesn't necessarily make it an echo chamber.",13/1/21
32611,40019,"It can also mean that you're wrong but of course, you'd rather assume the former than the latter.",13/1/21
32612,40020,"By the way, GDPR was first introduced by the EU and the Signal app is trending on AppStores of multiple countries.",13/1/21
32613,40021,"Does that make them all ""American leftists"" in echo chambers?",13/1/21
32614,40022,"I doubt it, quite sure the people here are serious.",13/1/21
32615,40023,"Then again I may be reading my disdain for the leftist nature of the sub majority into it, so have at thee.",13/1/21
32616,40024,"They were pretty rude about it though, especially the Imran dude.",13/1/21
32617,40025,Personally I think it's fearmongering since they also cite a slippery slope that they can't prove will happen either.,13/1/21
32618,40026,But I suppose you have different lines for privacy.,13/1/21
32619,40027,"I don't expect much because of social media and corporations and I only expect that the one or two situations in which I consider an intrusion (phone calls, texts, etc.)",13/1/21

32632,40040,Corporations can be regulated by the government but who regulates the government?,14/1/21
32633,40041,You're willing to give up information about yourself simply because some corporations happen to take it anyway.,14/1/21
32634,40042,That just gives credence to the slippery slope that everyone is talking about.,14/1/21

> SINGAPORE — Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore’s migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures “turned out to be insufficient”, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",12/6/20
34259,41724,"> During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.",12/6/20
34260,41725,"> In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date.",12/6/20
34261,41726,Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.,12/6/20
34262,41727,"> “On 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories.",12/6/20
34263,41728,"Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,” said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.",12/6/20
34264,41729,"> “However, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.”

> While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, “no two crises are the same”, Teo said.",12/6/20
34265,41730,"The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is “a major challenge”, he added.",12/6/20
34266,41731,"> On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.",12/6/20
34267,41732,"> “But they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines”, he noted.",12/6/20
34268,41733,"> The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH’s overall medical support plan.",12/6/20
34269,41734,> Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.,12/6/20
34270,41735,"> “The operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control.",12/6/20
34271,41736,But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak.,12/6/20
34272,41737,"About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,” he added.",12/6/20
34273,41738,"> Teo’s delivery is the third in a series of national speeches by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday.",12/6/20
34274,41739,Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing is scheduled next to deliver his speech on Sunday.,12/6/20
34275,41740,"> In his speech on “Resilience in a changing external environment”, Teo also spoke at length about Singapore’s efforts in providing community care facilities for patients who have mild or no symptoms.",12/6/20
34276,41741,> “We had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and had started to build them.,12/6/20
34277,41742,"We accelerated these plans and scaled them up, adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April,” he said.",12/6/20
34278,41743,"> At the peak on 12 May, some 20,000 patients were being cared for at community care and similar facilities, with as many as 1,000 are admitted daily, Teo said.",12/6/20
34279,41744,> “This is more than the total number of beds in all our public acute hospitals.,12/6/20
34280,41745,"We mobilised resources from across our public service, government-linked companies, and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities.",12/6/20
34281,41746,"Healthcare volunteers stepped forward to help man them,” he stressed.",12/6/20
34282,41747,"> “This is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our healthcare system and putting lives at risk.”

> The clear lesson learned during the COVID-19 outbreak is that Singapore needs to plan in peace-time “on facing the unknown, and build deep reserves of people and capabilities, so that when we face a crisis, we can act decisively, and respond flexibly and rapidly”.",12/6/20
34283,41748,> He referred to past challenges in Singapore’s history such as in 1967 when the British announced the withdrawal of their troops from the city-state.,12/6/20
34284,41749,"With the move, Singapore was poised to lose 20 per cent of its gross domestic product and 70,000 jobs at a time when the population was half of what it is today, Teo said.",12/6/20
34285,41750,"> “We are far more resilient today than in 1967, and better positioned to create new markets, businesses, and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.”

> Singapore also rode out the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Asian and global financial crises.",12/6/20
34286,41751,"“COVID-19 is an even bigger test,” he added.",12/6/20
34287,41752,> The outbreak is the first major crisis for many of the new generation of ministers and civil servants taking the lead in efforts to tackle the situation.,12/6/20
34288,41753,"> The ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of their older Cabinet colleagues as well as consulted widely within and outside the government, Teo said.",12/6/20
34289,41754,"> He added, “Over the past few months, I have worked very closely with them.",12/6/20
34290,41755,We speak daily and exchange views freely.,12/6/20
34291,41756,"They have stepped up to the task, worked together as a team, and led from the front.",12/6/20
34292,41757,"This is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore.”

35971,43512,The granularity of location data (for example) is not very high.,28/11/20
35972,43513,mobile devices are able to detect and send location from tower data alone but it again is not extremely accurate if you want to create a view of who is in contact with whom.,28/11/20
35973,43514,"That process is also very data compute intensive and can only be done in retrospective on offline infra, not the online infra (except law enforcement requests).",28/11/20
35974,43515,Today all data is getting captured in isolation in different buckets and it only gets stitched together into a view based on need.,28/11/20
35975,43516,However what TraceTogether presents is an opportunity to create an online way of running an efficient query on this data which is being aggregated online.,28/11/20
35976,43517,In my view if the aim was to only capture and Ensure that everyone was compliant then it would have been enough to run the TT app on a device and have a led indicating it was online.,28/11/20

35996,43538,They aggregate content which is approximate.,27/11/20
35997,43539,For example Google knows you by the advertising id or probably your device id and if you use two separate devices with separate id’s it’s tough for them to correlate the two as one individual.,27/11/20

35999,43541,"If for example the government wanted to do target advertising, they would know your device id (from TraceTogether), your identity, preferences etc and then they would create campaigns with specific curated audiences and instead of casting a large net, you could be targeted directly including through SMS etc.",27/11/20
36000,43542,You may not realise it’s a custom curated message.,27/11/20

36127,43672,This is the reality.,30/11/20
36128,43673,A government that serves its people should work on how these data are being protected and kept within our own nation.,30/11/20

36152,43697,There have been instances where ecommerce companies influence leading companies to kick out certain tenants who are not profitable for the ecommerce companies who want to optimise the delivery cost and remove that one outlier who isn’t using them.,28/11/20
36153,43698,The China isn’t directly relevant but just an example to show how far you can go with data.,28/11/20

36156,43701,The social score doesn’t even need to be published but used by the government for all its decisions related to individuals.Now hypothetically if the government has this  “contact tracing” data it can tell them accurately who all one has been in close contact with enough to establish a relation/influence.,28/11/20
36157,43702,Not tough to identify people with ideological bent towards the opposition or say certain religions.,28/11/20

36171,43716,I’m not sure about those agencies but what I do know for sure is that Govtech trains people to be then sent to the agencies to execute he role and this Grouo is quite well knit.,27/11/20
