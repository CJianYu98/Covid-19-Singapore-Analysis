2270,2481,"?Based on a true account a pro hunter did just that and lived to tell his tale in old age.In fact he happily retired in one piece despite suffering broken bones,ribs which was common in the life of a pro hunter .But none can claim to come close to him,two safaris twice charged by a different elephant.With different clients of course.The first was he and his tracker,client tracked the spoor of a few bulls and they crept slowly through the 10 ft tall grass unable to see 1 meter in front of them even if a lion was sleeping they could step on it.They could hear the cracking of branches when the elephants were feeding to crawling like a leopard they moved closer to 20 meters and could get a better view of four bulls one with massive tusks which was just the trophy his client was looking for.But its trunk raised up suspiciously before they could fire a shot the wind changing direction and the elephant got the human ordour and without warning charged towards them at 20 meters now you think you could outrun an angry elephant it could cover in 3 seconds no man could outrun not Usain Bolt.It came charging straight at Stan the hunter name crashing through the branches,bushes flattening everything in its path determined to get its prey at all cost.Stan aimed his .470 double rifle and let go but the beast continued its charge like nothing happened it snatched Stan hat which flew on the ground and stamping on it instead of him.He was sprinting for dear life never ran so fast all his life but he thought this was the last day of his life in the African bush if the elephant continued  charging which was 1 meter behind him thank goodness it lost interest and broke off  with a sigh of relief sweat dripping from head to shirt later around the campfire he told all around why the elephant did not finished him off when it could something he failed to understand well maybe his time on earth was not up to meet the Lord.The second charge was with a french client seeking a huge trophy of maybe 100  pounder.Stan was one of the best most experienced hunter of his day so looking for one was not a problem together with his trusted tracker they saw spoor of a huge bull so just like the first one they crept among the bushes unable to see due to the tall grass.But they could hear the elephant in front the ideal range to have a shot was 20 meter so they tried to get to within that range again the elephant got the human odour and before they could fire a shot it came crashing through the branches grasses like a train eyes bulging ears flapping trunk raised a sure sign of an angry elephant.The client fired but the elephant continued its charge like the bullet was nothing Stan too fired but before he could fire the second round the elephant was on him,trying to skewed him against the tree with its tusks and Stan was clinging onto its massive tusks for dear life knowing if he let go that was the end of it.The beast swing its target but Stan by all means must hold on his gunbearer got hold of Stan gun which had flung off his hands onto the dusty ground and at point blank range of 2 feet pointed at the brain of the beast and fired.The client too followed with 2 shots and the elephant fell down but with Stan holding onto its tusks though the elephant was now dead he went down with the elephant on top of him thats 9 tons of weight Stan suffered a dozen broken ribs and had to seek treatment for the next few years in and out of hospital before he could hunt again but he had to suffer the back pain for the rest of his life.Now twice charged by elephants twice survived how could that be possible?Someone told him your time to meet the Lord not due good luck see you around again when you recovered that exactly what happened,he continued bringing clients in their quest for a trophy not necessarily an elephant,any trophy a lion,buffalo,rhino leopard.So if your time is not due nothing can make you go home with the Lord a clear example",27/1/21,0.051587301587301584,0.43943452380952375,0.088,0.796,0.116,0.9547,fear
