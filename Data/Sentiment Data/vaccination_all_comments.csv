22470,26654,I want to vaccine but my company say no need.,29/1/21

22472,26656,"However all these vaccines are cleared for emergency use which is NOW, but it also means many unknowns or 'use at own risk'.",29/1/21
22473,26657,Hence SGGGOVT's advisory that getting vaccinated is not 'mandatory'.,29/1/21
22474,26658,That is very nice but it is unkind (and still being pushy) to warn that those who decide against it when offered may not (I read that as shall not) get the vaccine free of charge when they decide later to have it.,29/1/21
22475,26659,"For the over-70 Elderlies of which I am one, that is very nasty irresponsible and a demonstration of unfilial love (I wonder if they treat their own family elders in the same way) besides our worry that our golden years to enjoy our family and this country may be at risk.",29/1/21
22476,26660,The reason that the Elderlies should be given the vaccine early because they are a higher risk of COVID-19 infection group and this will give them protection.,29/1/21

22480,26664,So getting a vaccination is like becoming a volunteer in the vaccine testing programs of the vaccine manufacturers.,29/1/21
22481,26665,I suppose it's a bohpian when buying vaccines approved for emegency use.,29/1/21

The first man to have been confirmed to have the virus, in Singapore did probably get infected in Wuhan, but his son didn't show any symptoms until his dad was tested and after he was quarantined, which could mean that he got it from his dad after arriving in singapore(honestly this point doesn't matter).",24/1/20
27479,32180,What it means is the fact that there is a possibility people could get infected from him despite him staying inside the hotel this entire time(possibly the hotel staff or the cleaning staff who came in contact with their room.,24/1/20

27482,32183,But I doubt this will be an issue since they were isolated soon after.,24/1/20
27483,32184,"And the fact that the third case, a lady from Wuhan didn't show any symptoms till arriving in Singapore means that most who could have been possibly infected could show symptoms at a much later time from the time they were in contact with an infected person(in her case, probably a day or two since she left Wuhan).",24/1/20
27484,32185,This just means that there is a high possibility someone could have been infected during the time she was strolling around Singapore and wouldn't know about it till a week or so later when he/she start showing the symptoms.,24/1/20
27485,32186,The fact that Singapore has disclosed the whereabouts of all three cases since they had arrived in Singapore could also mean they haven't excluded the possibility of Singaporeans/travellers getting infected from these people at the places they have been to.,24/1/20

29458,34237,Pfizer phase 3 data was collected over 2 months.,13/1/21
29459,34238,Most other trials take at least years.,13/1/21
29460,34239,Not 2 months.,13/1/21
29461,34240,Emergency authorisation does not equal approval.,13/1/21
29462,34241,Medical professionals does not equal to virology experts or vaccine experts.,13/1/21
29463,34242,Doctors get their information from scientist and other experts.,13/1/21
29464,34243,The data is as sufficient as possible because they tested on a larger group of people.,13/1/21
29465,34244,The reason they cut short the testing is because it became a matter of ethics to let the control group not have the vaccine during this pandemic as the control group was slowly increasing with the amount of infected people.,13/1/21
29466,34245,Other type of vaccines has small pool of data hence they took longer.,13/1/21
29467,34246,Phase 1 of the vaccine was to prove that it is safe.,13/1/21
29468,34247,Phase 2 is to prove that it is effective in protecting against the virus.,13/1/21
29469,34248,Phase 3 is to see that the virus has no long term side effects.,13/1/21
29470,34249,As it is an emergency phase 3 cannot be completed.,13/1/21
29471,34250,But phase 1 proves that the vaccine is safe for use.,13/1/21
29472,34251,And even if the vaccine is bad for some people.,13/1/21
29473,34252,The rule of thumb for such things is the good of the many outweighs the good of one.,13/1/21
29474,34253,When the human raced eradicated smallpox it came at a price of some people having life-threatening reactions.,13/1/21
29475,34254,So would you rather have a disease that is guaranteed to kill someone  or would you rather have a vaccine that will  be an inconvenience to most people.,13/1/21
29476,34255,What is your point again?,13/1/21
29477,34256,And you don't quite understand where I was going with my reply to OP.,13/1/21
29478,34257,"Could doctors have reservations on vaccines, medications etc?",13/1/21
29479,34258,"Yes, absolutely.",13/1/21
29480,34259,But a doctor who goes out of their way to discourage a vaccine is at the very least irresponsible.,13/1/21
29481,34260,"Ultimately, in medicine it is a decision between benefit vs risk.",13/1/21
29482,34261,You counsel the patient of the potential benefit vs risk then you keep providing information to the patient until the patient makes a decision to whether this benefit out weigh the risk.,13/1/21
29483,34262,"Plus discrediting a vaccine has serious consequence in having faith in whatever new vaccines that might be developed in the future (newsflash new vaccines are created every year and the vaccine you take this year will definitely be different from the one I take next year), I find it really irresponsible that OPs relative ""doctor"" ADVISED them against it.",13/1/21
29484,34263,So when will you adopt it?,13/1/21
29485,34264,Millions of people already got theirs.,13/1/21
29486,34265,"If you don't vaccinate when you get the chance, you could get the disease and either cause harm to yourself or to others.",13/1/21
29487,34266,I am not saying jump out and get it now.,13/1/21
29488,34267,But the sentiment cannot be to just wait and see.,13/1/21
29489,34268,"Because if everyone waits and sees and no one does it, we are just sitting here waiting for the time bomb to explode.",13/1/21
29490,34269,I mean you’re kinda equating personal convenience to actual safety concerns.,13/1/21
29491,34270,People are allowed to value their safety over other things too.,13/1/21
29492,34271,The good news is that not everybody is going to skip the vaccine and you don't need the entire population to be vaccinated for the virus to slowly die off by itself.,13/1/21
29493,34272,The bad news is that the more contagious version of the virus will require a higher % of population to be vaccinated.,13/1/21
29494,34273,I think not wanting to be the early adopter is reasonable choice given that the number of covid cases here now is low.,13/1/21
29495,34274,I don't think it is ethical to force another person to take a vaccine with unknow long term effect to combat the virus.,13/1/21
29496,34275,People have to make their own decision.,13/1/21
29497,34276,"But the good news is, more people will take the vaccine as time goes by.",13/1/21
29498,34277,I mean eventually old people and high risk groups will be given the vaccines and after awhile when nobody died or get severe side effect then the chances of people deciding to taking the vaccine will increase when they realise they are such a pussy.,13/1/21
29499,34278,"Either that or a large cluster forms, and Singaporean kiasi mechanism will kick in.",13/1/21
29500,34279,The vaccines are out because the pandemic is an emergency.,13/1/21
29501,34280,That doesn’t mean it’s fully tested to safety.,13/1/21
29502,34281,There’s a reason why certain groups of people are recommended to not take the vaccine.,13/1/21
29503,34282,"The problem is that it’s easy to tell everyone to take the vaccine, but who is going to take responsibility when someone does invariably develop an allergic reaction to it?",13/1/21
29504,34283,Not really.,13/1/21
29505,34284,Let the people who need or want the vaccine to take first - not like there’s an oversupply to begin with.,13/1/21
29506,34285,"If in 6-12 months there arent major effects, most people will feel comfortable taking it I think",13/1/21

29508,34287,"There are clinical trials, scientists and mD say its safe full stop.",13/1/21

29511,34290,Yes right?,13/1/21

29533,34312,Not much study on that for now.,13/1/21

29698,34488,In fact they take cues from scientist and other experts.,13/1/21
29699,34489,They have a duty to not cause irrational fear or panic.,13/1/21
29700,34490,Even in real life situations they are always expected to inform the patients of all available options but never to push/force an option to them.,13/1/21
29701,34491,Before you come to a conclusion to this there are two burdens that we have to get past.,13/1/21
29702,34492,The first burden is to understand how does vaccines work and how long they take to work.,13/1/21
29703,34493,This portion is where I feel a lot of you 'wait and see' people don't really get.,13/1/21
29704,34494,Vaccines (even mRna) work by activating your body's immunity to fight against the virus.,13/1/21
29705,34495,3 outcomes can happen.,13/1/21
29706,34496,"1 is that your immunity don't get activated, 2 is that the vaccine activates your immunity and it kills the virus, 3 is that the vaccine activates but starts attacking the everything including your vital organs - that is what we call an autoimmune disease.",13/1/21
29707,34497,- the process and the timeline for this 3 scenario to happen is pretty short.,13/1/21
29708,34498,You don't need to wait for a long time for this 3 scenarios to happen.,13/1/21
29709,34499,Plus the Pfizer clinical trial has been past 3 months.,13/1/21
29710,34500,Where it gets tricky for the layman is that they confuse medication that causes long term effects with vaccines.,13/1/21
29711,34501,Even medicine that causes long term effects don't cause long term effects with 1-2 dose.,13/1/21
29712,34502,It causes damage with long term use.,13/1/21
29713,34503,The 2nd burden is to properly educate the public within these 3 months regarding the vaccines.,13/1/21
29714,34504,That is the proper channel to go through.,13/1/21
29715,34505,People with no understanding of how vaccine/medicine works should not comment and provide advice on how people should feel about them.,13/1/21
29716,34506,"Also note, when these expert talk about the wait and see, they are also trying to understand how long does this immunity last - because they have no idea.",13/1/21

29729,34519,The only problem is that it then generates much more additional concerns to be resolved.,13/1/21
29730,34520,What happens if they do get infected with the virus after rejecting the vaccine.,13/1/21
29731,34521,Who now has to bear those costs?,13/1/21
29732,34522,Probably the government will still bear it.,13/1/21
29733,34523,But is it fair since it was them who rejected the vaccine.,13/1/21
29734,34524,"And once it's determined to be safe, should we then allow the healthcare personnel to cut the queue since they are in the high risk sector?",13/1/21

29736,34526,"If we allow them to cut the queue, is this then fair to those who wants the vaccine but now have to wait longer?",13/1/21
29737,34527,What if someone among this group gets the virus because of the delay?,13/1/21
29738,34528,"What if as a result of being put at the back of the queue, the healthcare personnel gets infected?",13/1/21
29739,34529,then whose fault will it be.,13/1/21
29740,34530,Does any of the decisions above then applies if it is the next group the elderly?,13/1/21

29866,34658,The technology has been studied for decades but they have not pushed this to the markets.,13/1/21
29867,34659,The reason is that this technology is an expensive solution to the traditional solution (they ultimately do the same thing) but from a market perspective it is largely unproven.,13/1/21

29880,34672,It’s about long term ramifications.,13/1/21
29881,34673,It’s not about the immediate efficacy of the vaccine.,13/1/21
29882,34674,"It’s like what the article said, there may be unknown consequences to using these treatments.",13/1/21
29883,34675,That’s where their opinion typically arises and it’s not something that can be disproven because this has actually never been done before.,13/1/21

29885,34677,It's simple.,13/1/21

29896,34688,](https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205\(13\)00986-2/pdf) It's the first result.,13/1/21
29897,34689,Did you even read it?,13/1/21
29898,34690,It's a letter to the editor by Chinese doctors **APPEALING** to them to raise awareness of the corruption in the Chinese medical industry.,13/1/21
29899,34691,It's literally proving my point.,13/1/21
29900,34692,Congrats on clapping yourself.,13/1/21
29901,34693,What am I twisting?,13/1/21
29902,34694,You say there’s no data.,13/1/21

29904,34696,"A doctor says because there is no data, we don’t know the long term risks.",13/1/21
29905,34697,"So maybe don’t take immediately, wait and see.",13/1/21
29906,34698,And yet somehow the doctor who says this is wrong in your world view because he should keep that opinion to himself?,13/1/21
29907,34699,I mean all your responses have been saying that doctors shouldn’t be saying anything contrary about the vaccine even though they should be doing risk assessments.,13/1/21
29908,34700,"Risk assessment isn’t just about the immediacy of COVID, it’s also about the future.",13/1/21

29911,34703,"That’s why doctors have to explain the risks to their older patients because if they outlive the replacement, they then have to be on wheelchair or undergo another surgery which is highly risky at an even older age.",13/1/21
29912,34704,And couple that with the fact that Singapore has very low number of community cases now.,13/1/21
29913,34705,Why is there surprise people are a lot more cautious about putting something into their bodies?,13/1/21
29914,34707,Because your earlier example was how doctors need to remain as doctors outside of hospital and take the vaccine/ instill confidence etc even if they are not comfortable.,13/1/21

29919,34712,Nowhere did I say we should force them.,13/1/21

29926,34719,"you see, you have contradicted yourself.",13/1/21

29928,34721,"If you wanna keep living in 2014 and keep your head in the sand, then be my guest.",13/1/21

29934,34727,"Okay, you explain the risk of COVID long term vs the fear of autoimmune diseases.",13/1/21
29935,34728,- What is your point here again?,13/1/21
29936,34729,You explain risk on all areas without giving your opinion.,13/1/21

29938,34731,Did you not see that I said this is an unproven vaccine and there are fears that it will cause autoimmune diseases.,13/1/21
29939,34732,Do you know what those are?,13/1/21
29940,34733,>And couple that with the fact that Singapore has very low number of community cases now.,13/1/21
29941,34735,I have also never made an argument against this.,13/1/21
29942,34736,I read your comment history.,13/1/21

29946,34740,"If you decide not to take the vaccine, that is your choice.",13/1/21
29947,34741,Your body your choice.,13/1/21

29949,34743,"There is a difference, please see the difference.",13/1/21
29950,34744,"Yeah, if I was the one deciding, I'd give them priority to take the vaccine whenever they want to.",13/1/21

29952,34746,They've been the MVPs throughout this whole shit show.,13/1/21
29953,34747,But everyone wont follow suit?,13/1/21
29954,34748,That’s my point.,13/1/21
29955,34749,"Those who are at higher risk or less concerned about possible side effects, will take it first.",13/1/21
29956,34750,They’re aware of the arguments being made and will proceed anyway because for them the risk is outweighed by the benefit.,13/1/21
29957,34751,"As that group gets it and no effects are noted, the rest will eventually follow suit.",13/1/21
29958,34752,"The elderly in my family dead alr, and given the numbers nowadays it’s hardly much of a risk",13/1/21
29959,34753,But that’s what they are doing!,13/1/21
29960,34754,They are explaining to their friends and family the risk involved in taking the vaccine and as a result some don’t want to take it.,13/1/21
29961,34755,So how do you go from that to saying they should keep their opinions to themselves?,13/1/21
29962,34756,You seem to have a perception that they’re actively dissuading and breaching their duties as doctors when they are laying out the risks to us for us to decide.,13/1/21
29963,34757,I think you can reserve those high expectations for yourself and not the industry or you would get very jaded very fast.,13/1/21
29964,34758,Its not a bed of roses here.,13/1/21
29965,34759,That is the harsh truth.,13/1/21
29966,34761,also fine.,13/1/21
29967,34762,Now what happens if they get infected having rejected the chance to get the vaccine.,13/1/21
29968,34763,Who should bear the cost?,13/1/21
29969,34764,I made this comment in response to OP saying.,13/1/21
29970,34765,"He had relatives who are doctors who ""advised me not to take the vaccine at least till 2022"" Is that not specific enough?",13/1/21
29971,34766,And is that not pushing his opinions on someone who doesn't know better?,13/1/21
29972,34767,You are the one who thought to mean I meant everyone.,13/1/21
29973,34768,Well you don't seem like you exemplify those values and you already sound jaded.,13/1/21
29974,34769,What difference does it make?,13/1/21
29975,34770,Themselves?,13/1/21
29976,34771,"Insurance, to whatever extent the actuaries decide this is worth covering, otherwise they can pay for themselves.",13/1/21
29977,34772,That's in his personal capacity of a relative though so I still don't get it.,13/1/21
29978,34773,On the flip side if a doctor encouraged you to take vaccine you would be ok no?,13/1/21
29979,34774,Why the double standard,13/1/21
29980,34775,again fine.,13/1/21
29981,34776,I actually have no concerns if they do or do not take the vaccine.,13/1/21
29982,34777,But for every decision there is a cause and effect besides the risk-rewards analysis.,13/1/21

29987,34782,"And yes, this applies for everyone who skips their turn.",13/1/21
29988,34783,I know it's hard-hearted even though they are working on our behalf.,13/1/21
