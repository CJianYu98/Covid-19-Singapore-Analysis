4,gekrx1y,t3_k6f67r,"For those worrying about the safety, here's the Pfizer press-release,

>To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination.

And here's the Moderna one:

>The interim analysis included a concurrent review of the available Phase 3 COVE study safety data by the DSMB, which did not report any significant safety concerns. A review of solicited adverse events indicated that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Grade 3 (severe) events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first dose included injection site pain (2.7%), and after the second dose included fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), headache (4.5%), pain (4.1%) and erythema/redness at the injection site (2.0%). These solicited adverse events were generally short-lived. These data are subject to change based on ongoing analysis of further Phase 3 COVE study data and final analysis.

You usually expect any safety signals to manifest themselves with 7-21 days from the last dose received and from a safety perspective, they appear to be well tolerated.

The only thing time will tell is how long the efficacy lasts. The effectiveness of most vaccines wane over a period of time and that is where, in my opinion, data is lacking.",t3_k6f67r,2020-12-04 16:33:00,dawnfire999,18

7,gekksd7,t3_k6f67r,"I'm not a HCW, or working on the frontlines.

I am still on the fence because there are so many conflicting information that I am picking up all over.

Given that both Pfizer & Moderna are mRNA-based vaccines and their phase 3 results / data are released at about the same time with similar effectiveness, it gave me a bit more confidence initially.

However I am really a bit alarmed with how UK managed to approve the Pfizer one so quickly. Am interested to see how they roll it out starting from next week, if what they claim is true. And how they botched their response (have some colleagues in the UK) plus the errors with initial results and data from AstraZeneca undermines confidence in them recently.

I sure hope that other countries that do not have the virus under control are now not under pressure (especially looking at USA) to quickly approve vaccines without going through all the necessary processes.

Locally, virus situation considered calm (and I hope it remains that way for a long time), HSA will not be under pressure to confirm quickly. I do think the review will be done thoroughly and let's see what details are released finally.",t3_k6f67r,2020-12-04 14:44:15,puncel,17

Singapore has handled the situation well after initial blunders. Let the world show if the vaccine is effective and whether it's the silver bullet to solve the crisis.

I fail to see what benefits I get out of it unless I'm working in a healthcare front-line job.

I see people online (not specifically here) commenting about how desperate they are for the vaccine so they can travel. That kind of reasoning just irks me. Even once vaccine rolls out, it will take months to a year before we can assess if the virus is under control.

I'm sure Singaporeans can wait a bit longer and let the countries STRUGGLING to get the vaccine first. Our single digit cases does not warrant a rush for vaccines.",t3_k6f67r,2020-12-04 20:28:00,Book3pper,8
9,gekuhj0,t3_k6f67r,"Honestly I'll wait for a few months or so first, ok idk if I'll get flamed but I feel that as compared to the development of other vaccines I feel like this one is relatively more rushed hence if there were to be additional side effects, it may not be visible till say maybe a year later for example? I myself have a weaker immune system though I should be considered young and healthy for my age group, but because of this I'll wait and seek a doctor's opinion first. 
I know how vaccines are tested, manufactured and all and that there's volunteers who go to take the jab and they're fine, but with cases such as dengvaxia in Philippines for example, I guess this is why people are quite concerned about the potential effects hence they aren't willing to go for the jab. ( it's really not about anti vaxxers or what, everybody's body is made different and there are also health conditions that people may have which may induce even worse side effects hence they may have to rely on herd immunity) 
With that being said I acknowledge such incidences are like minority, most vaccines are quite safe and I would very much rather have people who are at higher risk of infection such as health-care workers and the elderly have the injection (of course, subjected to MOH's advisory too). In the meantime I just hope people keep it up with the proper hygiene thing, mask wearing, safe distancing and all, not everyone can be vaccinated and it can take quite some time for herd immunity to take effect too üôè",t3_k6f67r,2020-12-04 17:15:12,deadbutpink,12

Firstly, there is no such thing as a perfect vaccine or a perfect drug. There will always be side effects and people  that will be allergic to or not responsive to it. One of the worlds most common drug - Paracetamol (Panadol) has an efficacy rate of 97%. Are you going to stop taking it? The decision to take them are often weighed by side effects against benefits. The side effects at the moment seem to be pretty manageable.

Even if there is a ""perfect"" drug, no one in science will come out claim that it is because that is no such thing as 100% in science. Are you even in healthcare or pharm? Your claim of Pfizer marketing ploy 90%-95% also falls flat because of you don't understand the matric that determines the results. Numbers in this are tied heavily to the number of individual tested. When they released the 90% efficacy rates, testing was probably on-going because you cannot immediately determine the 43000 individuals results at the same time. Testing are probably done at staggered times. You can't expect results to flow in at a uniformed rate.

Thalidomide was a new drug a few decades ago and was recommended as a drug for hyperemesis gravidarium. Turns out it took them a few months to realise it actually caused birth defects. 

In recent history the dengue vaccine from Sanofi actually was associated with the deaths of over 600 phillippine children despite having been trialled extensively. It is believed that the mechanism was due to antibody dependent enhancement, or an overly exuberant immune reaction to the dengue virus if u will.

Mrna vaccines don't have that tried and tested safety record unlike inactivated virus vaccines.

There are concerns that the lipid nano particles used to encase the mrna can end up in unintended places and trigger off unhelpful inflammatory responses in certain organs.

240,ggs6zag,t1_ggrn311,"Mechanically speaking, mRNA vaccines seem very safe.

Ideally, they prefer specific immune cells, make virus proteins using the host cell machinery using a natural and quickly degraded information carrying molecule.

mRNA cannot integrate into the DNA, neither can it propagate itself. All it can do is tell your protein making machinary to make proteins based on the information encoded on it. The carriers of these mRNA are not viral particles, but rather bubbles of fat molecules, and I read some paper somewhere that says it can be designed to concentrate on the lymphatic system (important in generating immune response).

There‚Äôs no chance for the virus to reactivate itself, which is rare but not impossible for weakened virus vaccines, since there is no virus involved. There‚Äôs no risk of finding small amounts of intact virus like in inactivated vaccines with poor quality control, because there is no virus involved. Unlike a weakened virus vaccine, the mRNA fat bubbles aren‚Äôt going to go into the usual tissues or organs that the virus targets and risk provoking unwanted immune reactions there, since it contains no virus specfic proteins or receptors on the bubble, the proteins that help to direct the virus to its target, because once again, *no virus involved*.

It is synthetic. It‚Äôs not harvested using virus particles.

However, its not entirely without risk. One risk I came across was that apparently some COVID viral protein resembles the body‚Äôs own proteins, and in some severe covid cases, the body overreacted and was tricked into targeting friendly cells. If the mRNA vaccine manufacturer chose the right protein target, then this is unlikely. Also, if they unluckily chose that allegedly troublesome protein, you would have seen much more cases of severe effects as compared to placebo in trials. If they get it right, you won‚Äôt ever come across that unlucky protein. In comparison, you can‚Äôt guarantee that in vaccines using destroyed virus fragments or weakened versions of it, because one can be that unlucky.

Some drugs can cause long term side effects because you take it long term and it targets a certain important function in the body, which may be important in some way that wasn‚Äôt predicted. But the Pfizer one which we have right now does not do that. It doesn‚Äôt target any cellular function and it is unlikely to do so, and the most likely consequences are immune related ones. And as mentioned earlier, the mechanism of this type of vaccine would have made it more preferable than other traditional types of vaccine.

277,ggtd53u,t1_ggt3feb,"Long term side effects usually comes from long term use of a medication. It happens because the way modern medicine works. 

The body has lots of natural processes going on. Some of this processes, when out of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, can lead to disease. Drugs target aspects of such biological processes to bring it back to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, sometimes by blocking it, sometimes by enhancing it. 

Drugs are *small* molecules. The body doesn‚Äôt care about the atoms making up the molecule, the body cares about the *shape*. These specially designed drug molecules go into the protein (or other molecules) and do its ‚Äúmagic‚Äù, affecting the natural biological processes and bring it into balance.

One problem with this is that the body sometimes likes to reuse the same protein (or family of similar proteins) in different places to control different processes. A drug may unintentionally affect an otherwise unintended process(es) and cause long term unforseen problems.

Another problem is that a drug can target some completely unexpected target. As I said earlier, the shape is important. While a drug can be designed to fit a certain protein, there is chance that by coincidence, it can also hit some unrelated protein elsewhere and affect other processes and cause problems in the long term.

Also, ultimately, all drugs are poison and the only thing that differentiate medicine from poison is the dosage. Too much of an effect can be bad. There are drugs that can cause damage to organs at higher dosages, for example. 

Sometimes, the drug molecule itself can be chemically reactive, and can cause damage. Keep using it and you get long term damage. Rarely, if such chemically reactive drug damage the DNA enough over the years, people can even get cancer. Fortunately, people know some of the common reactive features and avoid those.

To complicate things, the body tends to do things to a drug molecule to make it easier to get rid of it. That thing can be inherently toxic (such as one of paracetamol/panadol‚Äôs metabolite), or it can have effects of its own.

There are a lot of ways for a drug to cause long term problems and side effects. However, does this mean mRNA vaccines can do so too? There are differences between mRNA and drug molecules and that makes things different.

Ultimately, mRNA is a naturally occuring information carrying molecule. You have it in your body and it comes in many different lengths. The mRNA in the vaccine is not going to be any more reactive than those you already have!

Compared to drug molecules, mRNA are huge. Things bind to sites on the mRNA, not really the other way around. It‚Äôs not very likely to trigger things you wouldn‚Äôt expect a normal mRNA to trigger.

Inherently, mRNA are not toxic, so that is one safe part.

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the viral product it encode for can target unwanted processes and cause effects, it isn‚Äôt something very likely. Given that mRNA is not very stable, it doesn‚Äôt stay for long and you are only exposed to the amounts injected. Even if the product is not harmless, it is transient and shouldn‚Äôt cause too much of an effect, and unlikely to cause a long-term one. Your body can take a bit of damage. You go out under the sun? Damage. Eat or touch stuff too hot? Damage. Etc etc.

It would be *far worse* to get the real deal, since the actual virus can replicate and make much much more potentially harmful viral proteins that a mRNA vaccine can cause your body to produce, on top of other problems associated with the actual covid virus.

To be honest, the most likely reactions are immune related ones and those most side effects are short term and not likely to be very harmful.

If you react very negatively to the mRNA in the vaccine and the protein it produces, I don‚Äôt think you would fare any better with the real virus.

It talks about the RNA world, which is about evolution of life before DNA existed, hypothetically many billions of years ago. An RNA world must no doubt contain specialised proteins/RNA-based molecules to copy and make more of the RNA, make proteins out of it, etc. However, those genes and their associated proteins/special RNA molecules would have long been gone, since it no longer has a use in the DNA world.

Without the machinery to do so, your body cannot turn mRNA in the vaccine to viable hereditary information carrying molecules. And the vaccine *will not* contain any instruction to do so either.

>	The cells of the RNA world would presumably have been much less complex and less efficient in reproducing themselves than even the simplest present-day cells, since catalysis by RNA molecules is less efficient than that by proteins. They would have consisted of little more than a simple membrane enclosing a set of self-replicating molecules and a few other components required to provide the materials and energy for their replication.

DNA and RNA can only direct the cell machinery to do what the information on it tells them to. Even if you put an ancient RNA genome in the body and somehow give it all the cellular machinery to get it working, all you are going to get is what‚Äôs on that genome, and as the source had said, its just some simple lifeform that‚Äôs nothing like a fucking human cell. It‚Äôs not even comparable to a bacteria, and bacteria can be considered less complex!

Furthermore, you aren‚Äôt putting that information into the mRNA vaccine. *No one placed the sequence of nucleotides for an ancient RNA lifeform into a vaccine.* It‚Äôs not even a full viral genome in it! People only put the sequence for one (or a few?) *covid virus protein(s)*.

Consider that this hypothetical RNA baby is even possible, *where the fuck are you even getting the genome from?*

You have *no* cellular machinery in your body capable of turning your entire DNA genome into a consistent hereditary RNA genome. You can‚Äôt get a human or some weird human mutant out of it using RNA.

No one placed the code for this completely hypothetical RNA baby into the vaccine. No one placed the code to give the body the ability to turn DNA into RNA.

Furthermore, RNA is inherently less stable than DNA, even in a similar double-helix form. It is fragile in single-stranded form. While possible to carry information in some RNA double-helix, its fragility meant that it requires upkeep and maintenance to repair it, just like DNA. *Unlike DNA*, you don‚Äôt have those specialised RNA repairing molecules lying around, because the vaccine doesn‚Äôt contain it and we don‚Äôt have it in our body because we don‚Äôt need it.

Regardless of whether it is even possible, there is no way that your far-fetched concerns would ever materialise. How is it even possible to get an RNA baby?

At this moment in Singapore, the benefits of inoculation don't exactly outweigh the risks. Covid-19 isn't ravaging our hospitals (unlike in the United States), so there isn't an urgent need to protect oneself with a vaccine. In addition, there are [valid concerns regarding long-term side effects](https://www.jpost.com/health-science/could-an-mrna-vaccine-be-dangerous-in-the-long-term-649253) of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Healthcare workers may perceive themselves to be guinea pigs, rather than beneficiaries, of this novel and untested mRNA technology.

Many things are also moving in parallel instead of one after another.

A valid concern are the long term side effects, which is impossible to know because all the vaccines have just been developed. And there is no way around this besides continued studies & observations.

However weighing the pros and cons, the long term effects of the virus are also unknown, and there are many reports of long Covid.

If both are also unknown, I would think the potential side effects are less serious (looking at the \~30m people who have gotten the vaccine, obviously it's short-term details we can get for now) than actually catching the virus.

Sometimes diseases and side effects can occur years down the line. 

Sure, I understand that. But I feel that these are risks we already take on a daily basis. It's simply not feasible to wait for years of testing before approving the usage of every single new technology. For every case of asbestos, how many other new technologies were rolled out to the public without years or testing and had no side-effects? Are you proposing that we conduct years of testing for every single new technology before implementation?

To be completely clear, I do understand the need to be cautious of new technology, especially those that are directly injected / consumed by humans. However I also do think that given the pandemic we're in, it makes sense to encourage vaccine adoption given that the phase 3 trial studies have concluded that it's safe for use.

The first burden is to understand how does vaccines work and how long they take to work. This portion is where I feel a lot of you 'wait and see' people don't really get. Vaccines (even mRna) work by activating your body's immunity to fight against the virus. 3 outcomes can happen. 1 is that your immunity don't get activated, 2 is that the vaccine activates your immunity and it kills the virus, 3 is that the vaccine activates but starts attacking the everything including your vital organs - that is what we call an autoimmune disease. - the process and the timeline for this 3 scenario to happen is pretty short. You don't need to wait for a long time for this 3 scenarios to happen. Plus the Pfizer clinical trial has been past 3 months.
Where it gets tricky for the layman is that they confuse medication that causes long term effects with vaccines. Even medicine that causes long term effects don't cause long term effects with 1-2 dose. It causes damage with long term use.

The 2nd burden is to properly educate the public within these 3 months regarding the vaccines. That is the proper channel to go through. People with no understanding of how vaccine/medicine works should not comment and provide advice on how people should feel about them. Also note, when these expert talk about the wait and see, they are also trying to understand how long does this immunity last - because they have no idea.",t3_kvvemw,2021-01-13 17:34:10,,1

What happens if they do get infected with the virus after rejecting the vaccine. Who now has to bear those costs? Probably the government will still bear it. But is it fair since it was them who rejected the vaccine. 

And once it's determined to be safe, should we then allow the healthcare personnel to cut the queue since they are in the high risk sector?

>You yourself have said it‚Äôs about risk assessment. A doctor can give their risk assessment of whether a vaccine should be taken based on their informed opinions. What you‚Äôre really asking for is that all doctors should push the vaccination, which then means there is no proper risk assessment done.

I am not a doctor yet but I'll give you an example of doing an unbiased risk assessment without giving my opinions. At the end of this test you will find that ultimately I have not influenced you in anyway.

With regards to the Pfizer Vaccine, it is a new technology. Unlike previous vaccines where they introduce a inactivated virus into your body which would activate your immunity system to fight against this Covid virus. Instead of inject a virus, they inject a protein into your body. It is supposedly safer because you are not injecting a virus into your body. There is a fear (not a risk) that this protein may cause some autoimmune issues, this is an opinion of some people there is no data of this happening. The technology has been studied for decades but they have not pushed this to the markets. The reason is that this technology is an expensive solution to the traditional solution (they ultimately do the same thing) but from a market perspective it is largely unproven. Whether it is safe or not, nobody has enough data to conclusively tell you whether it is safe to take or not. You have to decide on your own. Known side effects for the vaccines are also common there may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site. Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination. These normal vaccine reactions are usually mild and subside after a few days.

Ultimately, you should decide to take an unproven vaccine vs trying to return to a time where there is no fear of getting Covid.",t3_kvvemw,2021-01-13 11:47:50,,-2

Yes, but if you just barely reach the herd immunity threshold, R is just barely under 1 as well. Meaning it could take months before cases subside.
