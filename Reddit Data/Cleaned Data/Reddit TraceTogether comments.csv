This is false. According to [this](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-singapore-develops-smartphone-app-for-efficient-contact-tracing) straits times article,

> When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.

2,fl5lc6v,t3_fmhm2l,"As a committed privacy advocate, security geek, and cryptographer, it seems to me that this app is doing the best job it can to protect your privacy, which is admirable under the circumstances. No, it is not perfect, and no app ever will be.  

But in the time of a global pandemic, our individual concerns about privacy are irrelevant. Now is not the time to be concerned about ourselves as individuals - that is selfishness. We need to temporarily put aside our individual concerns until this crisis is resolved.

Even from a selfish point of view (and we all are selfish at heart), this makes sense. Selfishly, I don't want to get infected. If I do get infected, it is likely to be will be from a stranger. Anything that can reduce the likelihood of community transmission to me benefits me. Contact tracing seems to be the single most effective way of reducing that spread, and I wish they would implement it in my home country. His makes contact tracing faster and more effective. Ergo it is better for me if I implement.

3,fl55a8f,t3_fmhm2l,"The thing I've realized since my last post is that there are some people who will persist in posting misinformation or misrepresentations of what the app is, isn't and what your argument is and isn't. I would like to clear the air and make sure that the narrative here is one of constructive criticism rather than picking at useless minutiae of potential risk and 'principles' which are irrelevant to the topic at hand: To what extent should we be concerned about this app, and how beneficial can it be?

I AM NOT SPONSORED, OR A GOVERNMENT SHILL, as much as you'd love for that to be true. I am just excited that an app can potentially save thousands of lives, even millions, if we can prove it works and export this model abroad. I am convinced of its value and safety. 

They've claimed I am a shill/spy/whatever it is, they've claimed I don't know what I am talking about, they've claimed I am being defensive, etc, etc. I would like to take this moment to encourage everyone who is reading this and the post above to consider the following facts. 

This app was developed by a stat board. It is not made by the PAP, or indeed any political agency. They are staffed by people with very difficult-to-obtain degrees in IS, IT, and Comp-sci. If you fundamentally want to question their motives, that's fine. But the technology is sound and proven. 

**Safe anot?**

Encryption is a well understood topic. You use it daily for internet banking, logging in to reddit, surfing the web. Its nothing new to encrypt your information. It is very hard to steal information from your phone in ANY form, even so-called 'bluetooth snarfing'. The cost of attacking you is prohibitive in terms of time, exposure and potential reward gained. 99.999% of all people who will use this app have nothing valuable to steal from their phones. I agree there is a risk of such a thing happening, but in all likelihood? It will not happen. It is like being afraid of being struck by lightning. Can it happen? Yes. Will it happen? Extremely unlikely. 

**Why no open source?**

The government being the slow cumbersome beast it is are often staffed by people who know less than they should and yet are in higher levels of authority than other people who might have made better decisions. They may believe that not releasing the code is somehow more secure. There may also be proprietary/sensitive code involved in making this app. That is not to say that it is suspicious or is out to make money from you. It is just to indemnify themselves from potential risks. They have also stated that moving towards open source is something they want to do after this initial period. 

**Will it see if I go to geylang?**

No. It doesn't. Unless the Government pulls an MIB move with thousands of 'relay bluetooth stations' which is a fantastical idea at best, and absolute nonsense at worst. This was heavily upvoted in the other thread. I need to stress that while theoretically possible, if they actually do want to track everyone, there are less obvious and expensive ways to do so than that. This app specifically with regards to your movement does not enable the government to track you.

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360043224874-Can-TraceTogether-track-the-location-of-all-phones-installed-with-TraceTogether-

**I dont trust it, why should I install?**

This is more a philosophical debate than anything actually pertinent to the app, but allow me to default to a utilitarian argument: What number of infected cases would there need to be before you felt that this app was necessary? 100? 1000? 10000? What proportion of the population needs to be infected before you feel personally threatened enough to use the app for the sake, not only of yourself, but the old and those with pre-existing conditions around you? 5% of the population? 10%? 

I understand that before it becomes a problem you are wont to download this app and you'd rather have your privacy. Allow me to stress once again. It is safe, unless a state sponsored actor or billionaire playboy philanthropist comes in to try and track everyone. If you cannot understand the technology and have this fear, please read the FAQ below. I hope it can assure you of the good intentions and practices behind this app.

**Where can I read the declared intent and scope of the app and all relevant questions?**

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg

**Why are you so supportive of this app? You paid is it?**

I am actually very fearful personally of getting this virus, and I am fearful for loved ones getting the virus. Perhaps that is driving a deep sense of duty within me to control what I can. I have been sleeping much less for the last few days since the situation deteriorated  My insecurities are probably one of the things which are fuelling this enthusiasm for advocating for a solution. 

I have seen few other solutions to this virus which are as simple and effective as this one. Do not mistake my enthusiasm for malice. I truly believe that if this app works the way it should, then we have a solution to COVID19 spread which helps ensure life continues to go on, without any lock down, and that we can contain the spread.",t3_fmhm2l,2020-03-22 06:13:27,Lethaldart,14,GovTech: 9 geeky myth-busting facts you need to know about TraceTogether,t3_fmhm2l,22,fmhm2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fmhm2l/govtech_9_geeky_mythbusting_facts_you_need_to/,42,2020-03-22 00:28:52,0.64,"['thing', 'realiz', 'sinc', 'last', 'post', 'peopl', 'persist', 'post', 'misinform', 'misrepresent', 'app', 'argument', 'would', 'like', 'clear', 'air', 'make', 'sure', 'narr', 'one', 'construct', 'critic', 'rather', 'pick', 'useless', 'minutia', 'potenti', 'risk', 'irrelev', 'topic', 'hand', 'extent', 'concern', 'app', 'benefici', 'sponsor', 'govern', 'shill', 'much', 'love', 'true', 'excit', 'app', 'potenti', 'save', 'thousand', 'live', 'even', 'million', 'prove', 'work', 'export', 'model', 'abroad', 'convinc', 'valu', 'safeti', 'claim', 'claim', 'know', 'talk', 'claim', 'defens', 'etc', 'etc', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'moment', 'encourag', 'everyon', 'read', 'post', 'consid', 'follow', 'fact', 'app', 'develop', 'stat', 'board', 'made', 'pap', 'inde', 'polit', 'agenc', 'staf', 'peopl', 'degre', 'fundament', 'want', 'question', 'motiv', 'fine', 'technolog', 'sound', 'proven', 'safe', 'anot', 'encrypt', 'well', 'understood', 'topic', 'use', 'daili', 'internet', 'bank', 'log', 'reddit', 'surf', 'web', 'noth', 'new', 'encrypt', 'inform', 'hard', 'steal', 'inform', 'phone', 'form', 'even', 'snarf', 'cost', 'attack', 'prohibit', 'term', 'time', 'exposur', 'potenti', 'reward', 'gain', 'peopl', 'use', 'app', 'noth', 'valuabl', 'steal', 'phone', 'agre', 'risk', 'thing', 'happen', 'likelihood', 'happen', 'like', 'afraid', 'struck', 'lightn', 'happen', 'ye', 'happen', 'extrem', 'unlik', 'open', 'sourc', 'govern', 'slow', 'cumbersom', 'beast', 'often', 'staf', 'peopl', 'know', 'less', 'yet', 'higher', 'level', 'author', 'peopl', 'might', 'made', 'better', 'decis', 'may', 'believ', 'releas', 'code', 'somehow', 'secur', 'may', 'also', 'code', 'involv', 'make', 'app', 'say', 'suspici', 'make', 'money', 'indemnifi', 'potenti', 'risk', 'also', 'state', 'move', 'toward', 'open', 'sourc', 'someth', 'want', 'initi', 'period', 'see', 'go', 'geylang', 'unless', 'govern', 'pull', 'mib', 'move', 'thousand', 'bluetooth', 'station', 'fantast', 'idea', 'best', 'absolut', 'nonsens', 'worst', 'heavili', 'upvot', 'thread', 'need', 'stress', 'theoret', 'possibl', 'actual', 'want', 'track', 'everyon', 'less', 'obviou', 'expens', 'way', 'app', 'specif', 'regard', 'movement', 'enabl', 'govern', 'track', 'dont', 'trust', 'instal', 'philosoph', 'debat', 'anyth', 'actual', 'pertin', 'app', 'allow', 'default', 'utilitarian', 'argument', 'number', 'infect', 'case', 'would', 'need', 'felt', 'app', 'necessari', 'proport', 'popul', 'need', 'infect', 'feel', 'person', 'threaten', 'enough', 'use', 'app', 'sake', 'old', 'condit', 'around', 'popul', 'understand', 'becom', 'problem', 'wont', 'download', 'app', 'rather', 'privaci', 'allow', 'stress', 'safe', 'unless', 'state', 'sponsor', 'actor', 'billionair', 'playboy', 'philanthropist', 'come', 'tri', 'track', 'everyon', 'understand', 'technolog', 'fear', 'pleas', 'read', 'faq', 'hope', 'assur', 'good', 'intent', 'practic', 'behind', 'app', 'read', 'declar', 'intent', 'scope', 'app', 'relev', 'question', 'support', 'app', 'paid', 'actual', 'fear', 'person', 'get', 'viru', 'fear', 'love', 'one', 'get', 'viru', 'perhap', 'drive', 'deep', 'sens', 'duti', 'within', 'control', 'sleep', 'much', 'less', 'last', 'day', 'sinc', 'situat', 'deterior', 'insecur', 'probabl', 'one', 'thing', 'fuell', 'enthusiasm', 'advoc', 'solut', 'seen', 'solut', 'viru', 'simpl', 'effect', 'one', 'mistak', 'enthusiasm', 'malic', 'truli', 'believ', 'app', 'work', 'way', 'solut', 'spread', 'help', 'ensur', 'life', 'continu', 'go', 'without', 'lock', 'contain', 'spread']"

> SINGAPORE: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) can obtain TraceTogether data for criminal investigations, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan in Parliament on Monday (Jan 4).

> The SPF is empowered under the Criminal Procedure Code to obtain any data, and that includes the TraceTogether data, said Mr Tan.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""The Government is the custodian of the TT (TraceTogether) data submitted by the individuals and stringent measures are put in place to safeguard this personal data,"" added Mr Tan.

> ""Examples of these measures include only allowing authorised officers to access the data, using such data only for authorised purposes and storing the data on a secured data platform.""

> Mr Tan was responding to a question from Member of Parliament (MP) Christopher de Souza, who had asked if TraceTogether data will be used for criminal investigations and what the legal provisions and safeguards are for using such data.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Under the Public Sector (Governance) Act, public officers who recklessly or knowingly disclose the data without authorisation, or misuse the data, may be fined up to S$5,000 or jailed up to two years, or both, said Mr Tan.

> ""We do not preclude the use of TraceTogether data in circumstances where citizens' safety and security is or has been affected, and this applies to all other data as well,"" said Mr Tan, in response to a supplementary question from Workers' Party MP Gerald Giam who had asked if use of the data would violate the TraceTogether privacy statement.

> ""Authorised police officers may invoke then the Criminal Procedure Code ... powers to obtain this data for purpose of criminal investigation, and for the purpose of the safety and security of our citizens, but otherwise TraceTogether data is indeed to be used only for contact tracing and for the purpose of fighting the COVID situation.""

If people need to be treated this way, like **criminals**, then perhaps the issue isn't the electorate, but rather the people in power.

344,gi25b0n,t1_gi222cz,"Not an ELI5, but here is my 2 cents

First off, community data is valuable. Movement data alone can help to deduce your habits, routines and activities, e.g. where you would want to go for eating, who would you like to meet, which community would you engage in, etc. Nowadays technology is advanced enough to learn more about you than you do, given enough data from the mass.

Second is that those knowledge of you can not only be used for prediction, but for manipulation and restriction of your future habits and activities, and potentially your viewpoint and standards. The scandal with Cambridge Analytica is still hot til today, and they can influence US election scene with just daily data of Fb users. The data provided by TT is less informative, but it has been 4 years since then and who know how far technology has advanced?

Last is that I believe we need to have a legal statement from gov about their limits toward data collection and usage. Today they say it's for security purpose, but what if tomorrow they want to use it for researching community structure and social network? And what would they want to do with all those knowledge? Don't take me wrong here, I am not against the TT or SG gov, in fact I admire how SG adapts TT to prevent untraceable COVID cases, compared to other countries around us, but given how much they can do with those data, I am wary of potential misuse of those data, and potential future compromise of SG gov with external parties about data collection.

345,gi24xr2,t1_gi222cz,"I'm going to assume you are serious and not a troll.

Right now, in 2021, SPF is generally above board and competent. Same can be said for the government. But in 2026? 2031? 2036? Look at Hong Kong - in a few short years the police went from well respected to colluding with triads and suiciding people. Can you dare to say that this will never happen to Singapore? If you are considered law abiding now, that may not be true forever.

There's also the slippery slope that now police can use it, then who is next? How about other government agencies? If you are a civil servant, do you want them to use TT to clock in clock out at work? It's far fetched. But that's what people who thought ""TT will only be used for contact tracing"" thought - that the government will know when to stop on the slippery slope. Obviously they don't.

For something a bit more immediate - everyone makes mistakes and police are no exception. What if because of TT you get wrongly dragged into an investigation? What if police make a mistake, or want to close case and use it to pin the blame on you? I would rather turn off Bluetooth than risk that.

Hope you understand now. If you don't bother about the privacy issues, maybe you bother that this is going to reduce trust and usage of TT and hamper contact tracing efforts.

Most don't even know what CPC is. For months, the gov's website and Dr Vivian kept saying that TT will only be for contact tracing. Naturally this is what people were ""brainwashed"" to believe. Some of those that were hesitant to partake in TT due to privacy concerns, were probably willing to compromise for the sake of health and quicker eradication of the virus. They did not sign up for TT with the explicit knowledge that it can be used for police work.

On Jan 4 the gov came out and clarified that TT data is not exempted from CPC, like all our personal data. So many on reddit now thinks the gov backtracked on its promise for safeguarding TT users' privacy etc and never said properly on the website or in statements. Even Dr Balakrishnan said he didn't think about TT data being subjected to CPC laws until recently.

I understand you. I don't understand why the gov did not explicitly state that TT data will also be used for police investigation work from its launch in March 2020. Why are we only told of this now?

Is it up to us to infer that all our data can be used if empowered by law to do so?

If the above is the case, see CNA's article dated Jun 5th 2020 which had the following written, likely to reassure people of TT's sole purpose for contact tracing:

>Dr Balakrishnan reiterated that personal data is stored on the user's mobile phone and is **strictly used for contact tracing, only to be accessed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) when a user tests positive for COVID-19.**

This leads people to wonder, once the pandemic is eventually over, will TT still be necessary? Will it have then become a new, valuable tool for law enforcement in addition to current implements like CCTVs etc.?

I am not angry, but confused and curious. Yes, I recognise the efforts made to develop the system, and support all means of eradicating the virus as soon as possible. But transparency and communication is key during this difficult time.

Apart from just technological advancements, the CCP has built legal and logistical frameworks that allow them to... shall we say, *acquire* and *repurpose* people who they deem to be *inconvenient* to them. See, for example, the HK bookshop owners who dared distribute literature criticizing the Chinese government, or the Muslims in Xinjiang for daring to just exist. 

Before the CCP could attain such powerful means of controlling the populace, there were probably many Chinese voices like yours - all content to allow their government the leeway to implement infrastructure, legislation and practices that, on the surface, were meant to safeguard and protect them. 

But things like this can easily be - and of course has been - repurposed to prioritize the interests of the government over those of ordinary citizens. 

Yes we are in Singapore, not China. But we ought to be aware that there is no guarantee that our government of tomorrow will have the same moral and ethical scruples as the one we have today. As citizens all we can do is to resist when things are done that can potentially be used against us.

Each $1 spent on buying population surveillance above a certain amount (my estimate is 150ish million) also significantly increases the ROI, because this increases the accuracy of big data analytical algorithms that can be used to predict stuff like voting patterns, product consumption and other more sinister stuff. 

I know someone who has worked on a preliminary algorithm that predicts pregnancy probability. Pregnancy probability is not only whether or not you are currently pregnant, but also your probability of becoming pregnant over the next few years, with certain time periods marked as more or less likely with an exact probability percentage. The algorithm is based on demographical information as well as travel information (which buses do you take etc) at an accuracy rate of 63%, which is not very useful compared to modern data analytics from firms like Facebook or NTUC that can look at your history of consumption. 

However, if you know a person's location more accurately throughout a day, the accuracy of the algorithm improves to ~93 to 94%. Normally, this wouldn't be possible, but TraceTogether provides a lot of location data uptime for citizens, and will probably push the algorithm close to 87-88% accurate.

you're carrying around a specific government-issued token constantly, and you were told it's for safety during a pandemic. you're right, they could always track you, and they've always solved crimes without the use of TT. why do they need it now? are we going to carry it around long past the pandemic? what would they have lost by saying ""no, the police cannot use this specific infomation, go solve crimes some other way""? 

the issues of public health and crime HAVE to be kept separate in this instance. you want to maximise usage of the app/token so you can keep people safe from a virus, and that includes criminals. it's the same reason why SHN notices at hotels are ""free staycations"", why we didn't charge for testing and treatment, etc. you WANT people to show up if they're infected, not hide and spread in silence. 

and that's not even considering what the police powers are! what crimes are these used for? are terrorists carrying around TT tokens?

I seriously do not think they thought of this caveat at that point in time. I listened to that press release (cannot remember if it is the same one in Jun though), and I recall that a reporter asked if TT can be used as evidence for non-compliance of certain SMM or Covid-control measures. VB was a bit confused, and it was LW who replied.

How likely would it be at that press conference, that one of the ministers can actually say that when CPC circumstances were necessary that it will be the only (?) exception? There is no senior police officer or a MHA present then (I cannot remember if JT was there, but I don't think she would have picked it up even if she was present anyway).

In this case the SPF probably really did access TT data for a certain criminal case and it proved useful, and updated this detail to Desmond Tan when he approached them for information to answer the PQ filed. Hence, the TT FAQs were also updated because it actually happened.

It will be in very rare circumstances that such data be accessed for more serious criminal investigations under CPC.

This ""clarification"" only came because of a PQ filed by Christopher de Souza:

But now you have lied to a police officer about your location of the crime! Everything can and will be used against you in a court of law!!

Firstly, you are cognizant of the fact that if someone was to be abducted in an efficient manner, they would need to be tracked first? That's the point underpinning my comment - the means of suppressing freedom are always implemented gradually, step by minor step. 

We should be careful of safeguarding our freedom every single step of the way, not when (forgive my mixed metaphors) the dam is already at bursting point.

734,gi2s8qe,t1_gi2lgth,"Yes. The way the gov presented TT up until the announcement today was that it will make contact tracing quicker, more effective etc. No other uses.

Over time as the gov continued to advocate TT and its benefits, and repeatedly saying it is only for contact tracing over months, there are people that, despite having privacy concerns, were willing to compromise in the name of health.

Now, out of the blue on 4th Jan, TT is officially confirmed to also be used for criminal investigation purposes. Why didn't the gov state this very clearly and openly from the start when the system was launched in March last year?

In the TT website, this is the change log for 4th Jan:

>Clarified the Terms of Use of value-added features within the TraceTogether App and Token. **Clarified how the Criminal Procedure Code applies to all data under Singapore’s jurisdiction.**

This isn't something that needs to be clarified, it needs to be explicitly stated from the beginning.

On CNA's article dated Jun 5th 2020, this was written:

>Dr Balakrishnan reiterated that personal data is stored on the user's mobile phone and is **strictly used for contact tracing, only to be accessed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) when a user tests positive for COVID-19.**

Are you suggesting that there would somehow be away for a group of people to discreetly implement a reliable mass surveillance system in Singapore that somehow people would not be aware of? In a country as large as China, people are conscious of the presence of mata-mata despite the government's understandable attempts to be hush-hush about it and you are saying that in an area as densely populated and technologically aware as Singapore, 5.6 million people would not notice the work of a few personnel sworn into OSA? Keep in mind this work is supposed to provide data in quantities our police force \*who are already world class\* currently do not have? And Singaporeans would just let this happen without it being noticed despite our tiny land capacity and were it to be noticed for Singaporeans to just roll over and take it on the side?

The financial capital to implement + manpower resources required to affix and maintain + the amount of privacy intrusion it would bring in currently leaves a large section of our land area unmonitored because it is too much a waste of resources for the government + our citizens would be unhappy with the amount of surveillance and not support it?

&#x200B;

""by U.S. standards, Singapore's privacy laws are virtually nonexistent, and it's possible that the government collected private communications, financial data, public transportation records, and medical information without any court approval or private consent""

but there are ways to side-step all of this? Besides private communications, because it is the realm of ""technically they give this data up what"" that data is accessible. But this was done in the early 2000s during SARS.. in 2020 even your most basic web communication tool, Whatsapp has end-to-end encryption. They would need physical access to your phone to browse the contents. If it's one person by one person, sure they can go down take your phone and know your private communications but for the entire island's citizens data to be made accessible???

That's why a token that can transmit a signal without you being unaware of it AND is not used solely for contact tracing dangerously trespasses the boundaries of information most citizens are willing to share with the government? It's not as if this is some dark dystopian reality where, with a snap of the fingers suddenly there are unseen CCTV cameras waiting on the wall to track your movement and 5.6 million Singaporeans just sit quiet and let that happen?

&#x200B;

""It's the kind of clumsy solution some bureaucrat would dream up if they didn't know just what the government's real capabilities were.""

Just look at how swiftly it moves and with what elegance it navigates the rocky political landscape. A true sight to behold!

Scientists are still not certain how this tribe of Moving Goalposts got here in the first place, but they do seem to have a bright future ahead. With the POFMA Mountains towering the north and the Indian Ocean blocking the south, these Goalposts are unlikely to migrate elsewhere and face virtually no natural predators.

They are totally missing the point.

The Police, LTA, HDB, MoM, GongCha, Apple, IMDA, SPH can retrieve our data for all we care. But the fact that they didn't mention/include this from the start shows that they do not think we can handle the truth.

832,gi66gjf,t3_kquut9,"Not sure if it's a dumb question, but has there been some kind of divide between GovTech and the rest of the agencies helping to implement these systems? There's quite a number of discrepancies between what's in the [BlueTrace](https://bluetrace.io/) policy brief and white paper (which I'm taking to be what GovTech has recommended to the government), and what's been implemented so far:

- White paper says that ""The only personally-identifiableinformation collected is a phone number"", yet in current practice the TT app/token consumes a person's NRIC  

  Personally I'd be fine with the original spec, as phone numbers aren't as strong an identifier as an NRIC. If you're feeling paranoid you could always buy a prepaid card with cash. Hypothetically the contact tracing process could take place without having to identify yourself at all, were it not for having to register for treatment. On the other hand, you can't ever get another IC, and everyone in Singapore has one. 

- White paper lists one of the reasons of choosing Bluetooth over GPS to identify close contacts as ""Public wariness and possible alarmabout tracking location data ofindividuals could hamper adoption.""; in current practice the government is getting people to submit location data anyway, in the form of SafeEntry.

IMO taking these recommendations wouldn't entirely fix the privacy issues these systems have so far, but it'd definitely tone it down from having _a national registry of where everyone has been, strongly tied to a bunch of data about who was next to who_.

If they can go back on their word about TraceTogether's data usage, they can go back on just about anything and claim ""oh we overlooked it, soz lmao."" Perhaps misplaced faith but I do not think the PAP would be so insidious as to go back on their word on doing away with TraceTogether once the pandemic is over. Nevertheless, this stands as another example in a growing charge sheet of the PAP breaching the public's trust. This is vital in a budding democracy such as ours. Globally we have seen the deleterious effects of eroding public trust in government. Look at the protests in Germany over the lockdown and the sidelining of the CDC over demagogues and cable news pundits in the US. The social contract is built upon principles of reciprocity, it is easy to break and harder to fix with greater implications on the government-civilian relationship.

Right now the onus is on our Opposition politicians to ensure the responsible usage of TraceTogether data. This can include an oversight mechanisms or inquiry committees to ensure accountability.

852,gi8ee05,t3_kquut9,"some points to consider - 

**Perhaps TT app is yielding more data than Token?**

(a) what TT data is there that it is useful for such purposes? Handshake data alone cannot possibly be sufficient. If the crime happened in the unit next to mine and I was in handshake range 

(b) Is there a difference between TT data from app vs token? If token has no GPS functionality or any other data functionality then the only way more useful data can be extracted is from TT app. Our phones have GPS etc.

***To limit tracking, it's possible that uninstalling TT app and using the TT token would be best.***

Let's note the specific language Viv uses

""Dr Balakrishnan also said that once the Covid-19 pandemic is over and when TraceTogether is no longer needed, the Government will ""most happily and cheerfully"" stand down the programme.""

Combination of 2 very hard to foresee conditions. Pandemic over and combined with the very subjective ""no longer needed"".  

Is there any commitment to end the TT programme? No. In fact the term used is ""stand down"".  Where there is opportunity to use simple language - e.g. We will end the programme - but choose not to, worries me.

873,gi67lda,t3_kquut9,"Perhaps an unpopular opinion, but I do believe that Vivian did genuinely want the TT data to be confined to the purpose of contact tracing. I would even go as far as to say that had he been consulted about whether the police could have the rights to this data, he would likely have rejected this request. Politicians are not idiots - anyone could see the possible repercussions and the 'slippery slope' arguments that such an authorisation could trigger.

What it seems happened to me was that the information was accessed, then he was informed of it afterwards, which forced him to explore 'damage control' options. Unfortunately, his deliberations such as changing the law came to nothing, so we were left with a late confession, and many feeling there was a lack of transparency. On this issue of their breech of promise, I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt till this point.

The deeper and more pertinent issue here seems to be the state's view towards personal data as a whole, manifested strongly here in the CPC. It seems to me that the police were able to access the TT data as and when they liked, despite knowing full well the promises which were made to protect this data(if they did not, this is an even greater case for concern...). Was anyone consulted before they could access this data? No matter what the importance the investigation had into our national security, *was there any respect given for the confidentiality of the data*? These responses by the ministers do not give me confidence in accountability or transparency in future cases where a trade-off has to be made between security and privacy/confidentiality.

Valuing security above all may have worked for us in the past, but in a time where data is becoming more and more potent, there are certainly valid concerns about infringements of privacy and rights.

For TT, if some government tools are put to work to check people for compliance, wedge that TT between your butt cheeks then use a glove to pull it out and hand it uncomfortably close to that tool. You are still complying to the letter of the law, but you make sure to let the tool know that you are very unhappy and is willing to deal out of petty humiliation.

This one? By the way, MHA is not the one who charged, it was the AGC who has Prosecutorial discretion. It refers to the AGC's power to decide who to prosecute, when to prosecute and how to prosecute. This power comes from the Constitution, where Article 35(8) states: The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.""

In plain terms, this means that AGC decides who to charge and who not to charge.

It's a separation of powers thing. The Parliament and AGC are independent bodies. The AGC can only enforce laws/legislation according to the statutes. The 377A issue it's that it's still in the Penal Code, and it's up to the courts to prosecute, not the politician.

Police always have access to whatever available data there is, just that they haven't specifically made any carveouts for TT data saying explicitly that it cannot be used for any purposes other than for contact tracing.

>They don't have to go underground. We don't harass gays. The Government does not act as moral policeman. And we don't proactively enforce Section 377A on them.

You might be right that technically, yes the AGC charges, but pretty sure without police investigation with an intention to present evidence that will culminate in a charge under 377A, nothing will happen.

It's splitting hairs to say that oh, the Cabinet was not wrong and are innocent in that they were not the ones who enforced the charge; the AGC did. They own the instruments of law from the Penal Code all the way until the entrance of the courthouse, it's semantical to claim innocence on their end. As Min of Law and Min of HA Sham does have considerable sway on the conduct of the AGC; even if he was not privy to the decision to charge, the fact that a legal outcome contrary to the intentions of the government of the day occurred, should trigger a repeal, but we all know how that turned out. That's why I did mention that the AG ""clarified"" their position by saying that they retain the right to choose whether to charge, so either the AG was behaving contrary to the Government of the day's intentions, or the government lied and issued false promises while avoiding the moral quandry of a repeal.",t3_kquut9,2021-01-06 00:10:00,ridewiththerockers,8,"TraceTogether data use by police ‘restricted to very serious offences’, says Shanmugam",t3_kquut9,1083,kquut9,https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/tracetogether-data-use-police-restricted-very-serious-offences-says-shanmugam,408,2021-01-05 17:19:43,0.96,"['quot', 'pm', 'lee', 'speech', 'ad', 'verbatim', 'go', 'underground', 'harass', 'gay', 'govern', 'act', 'moral', 'policeman', 'proactiv', 'enforc', 'section', 'might', 'right', 'technic', 'ye', 'agc', 'charg', 'pretti', 'sure', 'without', 'polic', 'investig', 'intent', 'present', 'evid', 'culmin', 'charg', 'noth', 'happen', 'split', 'hair', 'say', 'oh', 'cabinet', 'wrong', 'innoc', 'one', 'enforc', 'charg', 'agc', 'instrument', 'law', 'penal', 'code', 'way', 'entranc', 'courthous', 'semant', 'claim', 'innoc', 'end', 'min', 'law', 'min', 'ha', 'sham', 'consider', 'sway', 'conduct', 'agc', 'even', 'privi', 'decis', 'charg', 'fact', 'legal', 'outcom', 'contrari', 'intent', 'govern', 'day', 'occur', 'trigger', 'repeal', 'know', 'turn', 'mention', 'ag', 'clarifi', 'posit', 'say', 'retain', 'right', 'choos', 'whether', 'charg', 'either', 'ag', 'behav', 'contrari', 'govern', 'day', 'intent', 'govern', 'lie', 'issu', 'fals', 'promis', 'avoid', 'moral', 'quandri', 'repeal']"

The outcome clearly does not match his official statement and public intention. Sure, you might say the AG did not actually need to twist or give any shit about PM's official statement since it's entirely within his right as an independent body, but that's purely semantical if we consider all the instruments of law before the decision reached the AGC.

I do know that the AGC decides what to charge a suspect with based on police evidence. But if the police follows the intention of the government and not investigate or present evidence that affirms an offence under 377A, would the AGC have any legs to stand on and make the charge happen? Now surely you can't say that the Police that operates under the auspices of MHA is independent and does not obey the intentions of our PM.

As AGC is the one who charges and makes this decision independently of the government of the day or the Cabinet (as it rightfully should be), then what right or authority did PM Lee have to claim there will be no active enforcement, whatever ""enforcement"" and by whom means? If he is aware of the separations of powers that might create an outcome that he guaranteed will not happen, shouldn't he initiate a bill to repeal and remove the agency from AGC after the fact?

We all know what happened after the fact. Promise was made, people were charged, 3 constitutional challenges were made, courts shrugged their shoulder and went ""letter of law says so, go ask the legislature to repeal if you're not happy"", Cabinet went ""moral courage silent majority something something"" and issue was forgotten again. 13 years in the making. And we still made no progress. 

TLDR; Cabinet wants to have their cake and eat it; play the good cop and say no enforcement, but acts blur when someone actually gets charged and do nothing to repeal. Stop defending them and letting them get away on technicalities and bureaucratic red tapes. Sham is both MinLaw and MinHA.

On top of that, many phones have in built QR scanners so some also dont see a need for downloading an app for check in and out. I personally use singpass for safeentry (as compared to QR scanner) bc of the check in/out function. 

Safeentry was an easier option to many hence I didnt expect them to plan to remove safeentry (via singpass/qr scanner) in the first place.

1258,g4sq5at,t3_iphgde,"I wrote [something](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gy58r9/serious_what_do_you_guys_think_of_the_wearable/ft98q2t/) about this a few months back, but now that that speculation is fast approaching reality, I feel like I should be more harsh.

If this becomes mandatory, as a government, it is basically the wet dream that facial recognition was meant to achieve, but which kept running into false positives and got outright destroyed by face masks becoming mandatory. The idea that with access to any public security camera, I can conclusively identify anyone's presence at a place. Only in this case, I don't even have to contend with any pesky error margins in identification - I *know* for a fact that token was assigned to you, and if you weren't carrying that token, that's a sure sign that something else fishy is afoot.

Now, we usually make all sorts of allusions as to how governments might abuse this system, but most people aren't moved by the phrase ""violation of privacy"". They think it's totally fine if their location is known at all times by the government. As long as there's no cost to their personal lives, they don't understand why privacy would be important. So I'm going to try to put myself in the position of a hyper-motivated career-centric sociopath hellbent on squeezing every drop of performance out of this system to shatter my KPIs.

First of all, consider an implementation of the ideal case of total tracking with this system. If you divide Singapore into a grid of twenty-meter squares and place an Internet-enabled sensor in the middle of each one, assuming that the overwhelming majority of individuals abide by the law and keep their tokens near them, the system will be able to track the current geographical location of everyone 24/7, to within 20 meters, as long as they reside within my borders.

Of course, the real implementation won't be remotely as dense, but it's to illustrate the general principle. In actuality, all I really have to do is put them within densely populated population centers and chokepoints, and I can extrapolate the rest of that information to a reasonable degree of accuracy.

So what can I do with something like that? Oh, a whole bunch of nice, nice things to *help* people. It offers me a level of probabilistically-accurate insight that has hitherto never been possible. I can know which parents pick up their kids from school, and which do not - that's going to be a factor in allocating parental subsidies. I can know how long those students spend at LAN shops after school - say goodbye to that scholarship, by the way, there's another student with your test scores who doesn't waste their time like that. I know you've been slacking off on your gym visits - you think that's not going to affect your neo-Medishield coverage? Now you don't have to push yourself to be a model citizen - we'll help you do it. If you don't put in the necessary amount of effort, there are people more deserving, you know? What? You feel like you're being forced to hit goals? Oh, no no no, you can do whatever you like. It's just that we believe in rewarding hardworking Singaporeans, you know. It's a wide range of programmes which leverage the system, applied equally to all. For people who fall through the cracks and get judged unfairly, well...we're working on other initiatives to stop that from happening, but no progress comes without pain, right? Of course, as long as you do what everyone else does and not stand out, you should be fine...

Realize - to manipulate behavior on a vast scale, you don't necessarily have to institute penalties. Sufficient incentives, or *the lack of them*, are enough.

Now you might say, oh, that's just fear-mongering, it's never going to happen, people won't stand for it, etc, etc. The problem is that once the tool has been built, the idea of your location being known at all times becomes normalized. The culture we will have then will be drastically different from what we have now, and I believe without a doubt that it will let *something* through, something that would previously be considered completely unthinkable today. No one seriously thought, when cellphones were invented, that they would inevitably bring about social expectations where you aren't allowed to read messages without responding, where you're expected to reply to email outside of work hours, where teleconferences at 3am would be taken in stride because it 'can't be helped' and you're still have to come into the office a few hours later. Today, certainly, you can ""choose"" not to do all that, if you enjoy watching your career coast gently to a dead end and your social circles drift away. And remember, all of that real impact comes from simple common social expectations arising from new capabilities of technology - not a law.

This degree of normalization of the tracking mindset also brings other 'benefits' to factions other than the government. For one, it makes for *great* employee time management. Mm, last week you came back from lunch break five minutes late, and you spent a total of a hour last week in the toilet, a whopping 25% more than other employees...That's going on the next performance review. And before you think that this is far-fetched, [Amazon is already doing this.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/technology/amazon-wristband-tracking-privacy.html)

The words ""slippery slope"" normally convey an impression of an unstoppable progression of policy implementation. But the true slippery slope is in the minds of the citizens, not the policy makers. When this technology is commonplace, we'll just accept things like this. Sure, we'll complain, but the system will be eventually seen as an inescapable fact of life. After all, it won't be all bad. You'll get to register for many shop memberships with your token ID, so you don't have to lug around a whole bunch of cards! You'll get points just for the amount of time you spend inside the store! It's all okay because only the government knows what NRIC is linked to the token ID, so it's totally private. See, privacy is important.

...Yeah, I'll admit to being a bit bitter. Even if the government somehow miraculously does everything right and scrapes the system after COVID (what, five years?) the acceptance of being tracked from the general populace is here to stay.",t3_iphgde,2020-09-11 13:33:54,surfaceintegral,6,[Discussion] The rollout & trials of the TraceTogether

I watched the entirety of the [MMTF press conference from 9 Sep 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNOcUieEFgU) and read the [press release about TT & SafeEntry](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/tracetogether-and-safeentry-to-be-enhanced-in-preparation-for-further-opening-of-the-economy). Below are my interpretations.

Based on what I understand from the press conference, it is not mandatory to use TT. The government's stance is still to encourage more people to get on board for TT, which main purpose is to shorten the time taken to contact trace as much as possible. There is no requirement to install the app or to collect the token.

For people concerned with privacy, isn't SafeEntry legit much worse than TT? Dr. Vivian B. did mention in the press con that if someone is confirmed to be infected, their identity is relayed to the contact tracing team. I suppose based on the patient details from the lab, they will already be able to get some information of the individual's family members, colleagues, *where he/she went based on SafeEntry information they already have on records*. Only if he/she is a user of TT and approves the uploading of data, then will TT play further part in contact tracing. [Link to press con portion](https://youtu.be/dNOcUieEFgU?t=3472)

The trial for usage of SafeEntry with TT seems to be in view of the relaxation of the MICE restrictions as borders open progressively.

Honestly when MOH first released their annex Cs every night with the places that confirmed cases had visited, I was wondering what good it does. Someone visited FairPrice Xtra from 1pm - 2.30pm. However it is a huge hypermarket, how useful is that information? This is where I can see how TT will help narrow down the area and people involved.",t3_iphgde,2020-09-10 04:37:56,puncel,41,[Discussion] The rollout & trials of the TraceTogether token,t3_iphgde,358,iphgde,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iphgde/discussion_the_rollout_trials_of_the/,250,2020-09-09 22:58:08,0.95,"['data', 'tt', 'store', 'local', 'app', 'token', 'day', 'access', 'individu', 'permiss', 'get', 'infect', 'token', 'tear', 'down', 'done', 'previous', 'noth', 'concern', 'found', 'peopl', 'concern', 'app', 'due', 'mobil', 'phone', 'capabl', 'transmit', 'token', 'actual', 'much', 'safer', 'link', 'link', 'link', 'link', 'watch', 'entireti', 'mmtf', 'press', 'confer', 'sep', 'read', 'press', 'releas', 'tt', 'safeentri', 'interpret', 'base', 'understand', 'press', 'confer', 'mandatori', 'use', 'tt', 'govern', 'stanc', 'still', 'encourag', 'peopl', 'get', 'board', 'tt', 'main', 'purpos', 'shorten', 'time', 'taken', 'contact', 'trace', 'much', 'possibl', 'requir', 'instal', 'app', 'collect', 'token', 'peopl', 'concern', 'privaci', 'safeentri', 'legit', 'much', 'wors', 'tt', 'vivian', 'mention', 'press', 'con', 'someon', 'confirm', 'infect', 'ident', 'relay', 'contact', 'trace', 'team', 'suppos', 'base', 'patient', 'detail', 'lab', 'alreadi', 'abl', 'get', 'inform', 'individu', 'famili', 'member', 'colleagu', 'went', 'base', 'safeentri', 'inform', 'alreadi', 'record', 'user', 'tt', 'approv', 'upload', 'data', 'tt', 'play', 'part', 'contact', 'trace', 'link', 'press', 'con', 'portion', 'trial', 'usag', 'safeentri', 'tt', 'seem', 'view', 'relax', 'mice', 'restrict', 'border', 'open', 'progress', 'honestli', 'moh', 'first', 'releas', 'annex', 'cs', 'everi', 'night', 'place', 'confirm', 'case', 'visit', 'wonder', 'good', 'someon', 'visit', 'fairpric', 'xtra', 'howev', 'huge', 'hypermarket', 'use', 'inform', 'see', 'tt', 'help', 'narrow', 'area', 'peopl', 'involv']"
1270,g4mdx6c,t3_iphgde,"My own experience but this is how it changed: 
When TraceTogether was first announced, there was a lot of backlash. Redditporeans upvoted the backlash comments.

There was clarification by the G and people became ok with it. I continued to raise privacy concerns and I was downvoted to oblivion. Some time went on.

Then there was the tokens announced. Reddit went crazy. The backlash was strong. It was compared to ankle bracelets. 

Similar pattern, Viv clarified, Singapore was satisfied, life went on. I commented something like “I’m not carrying this Orwellian shit around” and I was downvoted and scolded.

Now we can observe the same pattern. There is backlash, government will clarify. People will be satisfied, life goes on. 

This cycle will continue to happen. Something even worse will be announced, clarifications and concessions will be made, people will be lulled. It will repeat until we have the entirety of our balls handed over to the government. 

In all likelihood, the current government does this with good intentions. Future governments would think like this: But why should good intentions stop with a pandemic? Why shouldn’t this data acquisition and privacy breech extend further to other facets of society? Surely, Good Samaritans will be safe if we were to track everyone’s movements and bring crime to a complete stop. Why be worried if you don’t do anything wrong?

I don’t have an answer to those questions but what I can guarantee is that “good” is subjective and a future government, as well intentioned as they think they are, might not be “good”.

What can we do as citizens? Show them that their power is not to be taken for granted.

This is the current practice. We hear cases visiting here and there but no blanket SHNs are thrown. We certainly want to quarantine people at an adjacent table from where a case has his meal but not the entire restaurant - and this granularity is not possible with only SafeEntry.

> Now I have to enter my particulars into the app and have it saved there, ready for hacking? Ready for abuse by the government?

TraceTogether app data is not uploaded to the servers (you can request for code review), and will be deleted after 25 days.

In my current understanding of the design
- The government already knows when you enter a mall. You give them this information with SafeEntry. It seems that nobody disagrees with SafeEntry. 
- The token is more layman-auditable than the TraceTogether app. You can break apart the token to see that there is no Wifi capabilities.
- To track movement, the government will need to install beacons everywhere (i.e. something like another TraceTogether token).

1276,g4m1qhp,t3_iphgde,"> In practice? I don't buy it. The conservative course of action would be to quarantine everyone, to be safe. You mean to tell me that on the one hand, the govt is so concerned about inadequate contact tracing that they need to make this mandatory, but on the other hand, they are willing to risk people slipping through the cracks by not imposing quarantines on *everyone* at an affected location? The reasoning does not gel 

This is a real problem that I think the author does not fully appreciate. 

My perspectives come from the construction sector, and I believe this TraceTogether initiative draws lessons from the same place. 

The fact is that blanket, conservative quarantines are *ridiculously* disruptive to people's lives and businesses, and is a factor outside most people's circle of control.

I've had migrant worker colleagues issued quarantine orders on the basis of being allocated the same staircase as a confirm case. This kind of ""carpet bomb"" quarantine approach means large portions of workforce gets taken out of action seemingly randomly.

For an industry where mobilization costs are high and things need to be scheduled and coordinated in advance, I cannot overstate how disruptive this is. To make the measures more surgical and targeted would reap significant benefits. 

> *What is the problem you are trying to solve*? Low adoption? Mandate Trace Together downloads (not the registration or linking with NRIC). That, together with Safe Entry, should get you enough of the way there. Isn't Trace Together a supplement? Isn't this enough? I am not convinced with any of the messaging thus far.

TraceTogether is already mandated in the construction sector and is *checked daily* as a condition to work. Despite all this, adoption is low.

The token would reduce manpower demand for SafeEntry. Just show the token, may not need two people per entrance. Existing personnel could be redeployed to other closed entrances, reducing fire risks and improving footfall, or take up (tougher) jobs as SDA/digital ambassador. (Edit: this scenario is not in the cards for now as check in with the token will be facilitated with [the QR code at the back](https://support.safeentry.gov.sg/hc/en-us/articles/900002439963-How-to-check-in-with-TraceTogether-Token-). Only if businesses would be able to get some TraceTogether Bluetooth beacon could manpower decrease.)

A [growing consensus](https://ipvm.com/reports/temp-screening-effect) among Western health leaders of temperature screening being [ineffective security theatre](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/paging-dr-hamblin-temperature-checks-coronavirus/615190/) may mean an upcoming elimination of this requirement. This would cement the reduction in manpower for SafeEntry. 

We are currently not in the position of being pressured to increase mandatory SafeEntry to more stores or even public transport. Edit: SafeEntry is also ineffective for large venues where visitors spend extended durations, like malls, department stores, libraries, even some supermarkets. Asking everyone in the area during a certain time to track their symptoms for 14 results in a lot of anxiety in aggregate, especially in situations like the NTU failure. 

Fundamentally, TraceTogether information is accessed only if you ping long (and close?) enough to a confirmed case. If TraceTogether becomes mandatory for entry to facilities by private companies or law, minimising trips outside *which you are still supposed to do* would reduce the risk of you having your data accessed.  If you are forced to unnecessarily work in the office, report to MOM, if not your MP and the Manpower ministers email address.

The point though is that your data is being stored. The current approach may be a situation where the data is only uploaded on specific events occurring but what’s to stop that from changing? Also, no matter how people might try to suggest that the data isn’t an issue, the fact remains that this is a tracking device tied to your national identity number.

As for safety? Has anyone ever invented software that cannot be hacked? It’s a question of time and effort on the part of blackhats out there. Do you want everywhere you’ve been to be available if the database is somehow hacked?

Others have mentioned that it only tracks certain locations. The press release clearly indicates this is just the initial roll-out and it’s coverage will be expanded. But even beyond that, if receiving stations are placed in public locations without informing the public, you can now be traced everywhere.

Note the difference with the Australian approach which has unique IDs for the token/app that is changed every 14 days. Ours is tied to our NRIC. 

What’s the big deal ultimately? It’s an intrusion into our privacy. Most Singaporeans don’t care enough about this but this is the epitome of how a police state is formed.

regarding restaurants - SafeEntry already covers it, no? it already allows for contact tracing based on restaurants. rather than the government choosing to only isolate those at nearby tables, I'd feel much safer if everyone in the restaurant was isolated since to this date we don't really have a detailed idea of how it spreads in different conditions. I mean one of the reasons SafeEntry was introduced was precisely because memory based contact tracing is unreliable. if we are talking about other circumstances, like you're hanging out with your friends at a place that does not require checking in - surely you'd remember your friends.

the argument made that it's for older people/groups who are too poor to own smart phones doesn't even hold up since SafeEntry also accepts NRIC.

the only possible reason left to use this is the idea that people might lie - but they can just as easily not bring their token with them. so what then?

Appreciate your responses, I thought I would be the one getting downvotes for my perspective but I am glad that people are looking at both sides of the argument. All in the spirit of good discussions :)

The concern for privacy is definitely on the minds of a lot of people since there were plans to use digital tools for contact tracing. Obviously things can go south subsequently as with any other databases or measures (for all we know BT beacons may already be all around us?), but from their actions so far e.g. open sourcing Blue Trace and tearing down of TT token, IMO they are trying hard to demonstrate that there isn't really any intent to track us for other reasons.

With this pandemic slowly and maybe already turning endemic, unfortunately similar tracing systems may well be the necessary to save some industries from collapsing altogether. MICE is the first one that comes to mind and hence the trial they are trying to push. It remains to be seen what other functions they will continue to push the ""SafeEntry + TT"" coupling to, but I think it will be more for specialized large scale events like exhibitions + wedding banquets that involve large number of people eating and talking for extended periods of time.

To add on Blue Trace was open sourced in the hopes of other countries also using it, but unfortunately it did not take off. Presumably it is due to privacy concerns, the semi-uselessness on iOS (I thought it was improved but it seems TT still does not work well for iOS devices?) and the Apple & Google API in development then. Based on what I read & understand, this API helps but without intervention by authorities, the general population just do not care enough to actually do what the app recommends (e.g. suggest to go for a swab, but how many actually go?).",t3_iphgde,2020-09-10 11:59:27,puncel,4,[Discussion] The rollout & trials of the TraceTogether token,t3_iphgde,358,iphgde,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iphgde/discussion_the_rollout_trials_of_the/,250,2020-09-09 22:58:08,0.95,"['also', 'actual', 'type', 'quit', 'long', 'post', 'respons', 'stop', 'attend', 'urgent', 'meet', 'chrome', 'happili', 'refresh', 'tab', 'lol', 'let', 'tri', 'reconstruct', 'post', 'appreci', 'respons', 'thought', 'would', 'one', 'get', 'downvot', 'perspect', 'glad', 'peopl', 'look', 'side', 'argument', 'spirit', 'good', 'discuss', 'concern', 'privaci', 'definit', 'mind', 'lot', 'peopl', 'sinc', 'plan', 'use', 'digit', 'tool', 'contact', 'trace', 'obvious', 'thing', 'go', 'south', 'subsequ', 'databas', 'measur', 'know', 'bt', 'beacon', 'may', 'alreadi', 'around', 'us', 'action', 'far', 'open', 'sourc', 'blue', 'trace', 'tear', 'tt', 'token', 'imo', 'tri', 'hard', 'demonstr', 'realli', 'intent', 'track', 'us', 'reason', 'pandem', 'slowli', 'mayb', 'alreadi', 'turn', 'endem', 'unfortun', 'similar', 'trace', 'system', 'may', 'well', 'necessari', 'save', 'industri', 'collaps', 'altogeth', 'mice', 'first', 'one', 'come', 'mind', 'henc', 'trial', 'tri', 'push', 'remain', 'seen', 'function', 'continu', 'push', 'safeentri', 'tt', 'coupl', 'think', 'special', 'larg', 'scale', 'event', 'like', 'exhibit', 'wed', 'banquet', 'involv', 'larg', 'number', 'peopl', 'eat', 'talk', 'extend', 'period', 'time', 'add', 'blue', 'trace', 'open', 'sourc', 'hope', 'countri', 'also', 'use', 'unfortun', 'take', 'presum', 'due', 'privaci', 'concern', 'io', 'thought', 'improv', 'seem', 'tt', 'still', 'work', 'well', 'io', 'devic', 'appl', 'googl', 'api', 'develop', 'base', 'read', 'understand', 'api', 'help', 'without', 'intervent', 'author', 'gener', 'popul', 'care', 'enough', 'actual', 'app', 'recommend', 'suggest', 'go', 'swab', 'mani', 'actual', 'go']"

Yes, you'd remember your friends, and there's usually no reason to hide that.

It seems like they're intent on forcing this SE+TT combo into everything down the line.


The review by the opensource reviewers also leaves much to be desired since the one I read basically said that a large portion of what goes in was not available for review, and their conclusion was that it may be necessary due to time constraints but should be subject to further review and a potential hackathon and then we hear nothing about it since. They also reviewed a first gen TT device, who knows what changes it has undergone in the last 3 months? 


If anything, the data seems to suggest that the community cases are decreasing and that it is no longer a matter of utmost emergency to implement TT that we cannot waste any time to review it for privacy concerns before rolling it out.

On the flip side, if the government does what's being discussed who is going to arrest and try them? We're already seeing arguments in this very thread about part 2 (""You already give data with SE, what's wrong with TT?"") and you see comments everywhere (fb, here, news sites) where it's all about ""Govt knows best, just do what they tell you to do"" without further examination. 


Besides, we also have our vaunted ""track record"" to fall back on. The ISA was enacted initially with a defined end point (communist threat). It morphed from ""It's imperative we have it to counter communist threats from MCP"" to ""It allows us to counter espionage and terrorism"" to ""safety and security of Singapore is paramount"" to continue to justify its existence even today, many decades after its initial end point was passed.


The point is that once you consolidate all this huge amounts of data into the hands of the government, it's very hard to convince them to let it go. It'll start off innocuous enough (This big data will allow us to catch offenders), then move into a realm hard to argue against (TT allows us to contact all nearby people when a crime has been perpetuated, don't you want to help catch criminals?) to matters of convenience (This big data will allow us to plan transport routes more efficiently, don't you want efficiency and a shorter travel time?) and soon it'll be a given that such data *should* be provided to the government for urban planning or whatever reason.

The community cases are indeed under control now and per you mentioned, not an emergency. However further easing of measures in hopes to opening more of the economy will likely cause an increase in community spread as people interact more. This ""SafeEntry + TT"" is the plan that they are rolling out to counter the expected increase.

I actually do not feel that they are taking a heavy-handed approach this time round, in fact they are rolling this out ridiculously slow manner. Like they are fearing backlash ;). If they had wanted to, they really could have just pushed it out way quicker than what is happening now. I think Singaporeans are very clear on how efficient they can be if they really wanted to.

Personally I do not think this coupling will be implemented to everything down the line, but only in settings whereby it is necessary. For example, I don't see it necessary in a restaurant because safe distancing is already in place, unless they further ease up measures to pre-covid times, or allow buffets again.

I'm actually really concerned that many take the view that whatever is being rolled out shouldn't even be questioned or reviewed until afterwards. Taking an extreme example, if one day the press statement is that all COVID carriers should be taken out back and shot (because 100% chance if person is dead he's least likely to move around and infect other people), should we just go along with it until after the pandemic to decide if that's a good/bad idea?

It very well depends on what is ""normal"" to everyone.

For example I am lucky to say that on the basis of my own character and my present family members who I live with, I will not mind even if it is still CB now (not considering that it tanks the overall economy etc). I am still on CB mode and I don't go out much, maybe once every 3 -5 days? When I do go out I try to get everything I can ASAP and get back home quickly. I do this mainly because I want to protect my mum who has chronic diseases. Is it overkill? Maybe, but I don't want to take chances. Since I do not think it is too much to ask from myself, why not practice whatever safe measures that I can?

If the present is the new normal, and all current restrictions remain as they are now, frankly I do not mind.

However what about the others who are not so lucky? Those that have lost their jobs? Those that need to be out and about? I heard the people from MICE industries were not getting any assistance from the govt unlike the aviation industry - but they are also hit extremely hard.

1502,fl380c3,t3_fm41s6,"After reading the whole thread and OP's replies, I've found that OP has some skewed conceptions about the security aspects and concerns about this whole thing.

Firstly,

>A. Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. ""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.

Lmao. For someone who sounds so technologically informed, I was surprised when I realised what OP wrote when I read this for the second time. Sounds like OP is confusing the difference between hash and encryption, which should be a basic concept in the field of IT/Cybersecurity.

Furthermore, phone numbers in Singapore are 8 digits, and either starts with 8xxx xxxx or 9xxx xxxx. Brute forcing the combination with a self-made list containing all the possible phone numbers isn't really that hard to do, and won't take up a lot of time, considering the computing and processing power that computers have these days.

OP also replied to one of the comments by saying "" There isn't anything inherently scary about bluetooth"". Well, let me introduce you to [Bluejacking](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5045/bluejacking), [Bluebugging](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5044/bluebugging) & [Bluesnarfing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5046/bluesnarfing).

Building on what I've said earlier about Bluetooth, if some siaokia really wants to, he can build a malicious version of the app, and use it to extract the supposedly anonymous information, or modify the payload and send malware into other devices using Bluetooth.

OP subsequently said the following in another of his replies:

>And do you think in this time of a pandemic that cybercriminals are roaming about with massive bluetooth hijacking setups in order to walk next to what is potentially another virus carrier? You have to be within bluetooth range and you have to handshake with the right authentication or permission for bluetooth access. I would take my chances with that over the possible spread of COVID19, which is a clear, imminent danger and proven threat.

You'd be surprised. The value of the information may outweigh the risk of contracting of the virus to some, and some hackers would still take the risk of getting into a crowded idea just to hijack other devices. If they are that scared of the virus, they can easily minimise the risk by driving around in a car, carrying out a [wardriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving) bluetooth attack.

OP is also operating under the presumption that hackers won't want to go out and gather all that information/deliver malware during this period. That's like saying ""Oh I shouldn't leave my housedoor locked, it's too much of a hassle. It's COVID period now. who would want to break into my house, right?""

OP keeps insisting that he isn't some government employee, and that he isn't paid to do this. But with how much of a tryhard he is in this thread, I honestly doubt so.

I'm not here to discourage people from downloading the app, but I'm here to inform people of the potential risks that they're getting into by downloading this app/prolonging their use of bluetooth, and to point out OP's flaw in logic/misconception as well.

Firstly, if the hash can be broken with a password, and the hash property of being one way algorithm and has no key needed does not hold water. This looks more like encryption. Some people mix up hashing and encrypting often.

Contact tracing is best done without excessive interaction, and less reliance on faulty human memory. Bluetooth Low Energy was built for this.

I'm also heartened by the approach of storing the data as a local blob which never leaves your phone unless the user AND MOH both validate.

This is important to prevent false positives (DOS/spam attack vector) from pranksters by requiring MOH validation, and address concerns of Orwellian state sponsored surveillance by requiring user opt-in. If people have unaddressed security concerns, they won't install and we fail to get the critical mass needed for this to work.

In the Straits Times article
""When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.""

This stance just discourages people from installing, they can't be charged for not allowing release of information they don't have. 

Using this stick approach narrows the user acquisition funnel, for marginal enforcement gain at best. 
If a user has already installed the app, at the cost of battery life, system resources and privacy, they've already committed at some level, threatening prosecution to secure permission they've already implied at point of install, comes at the cost of turning many potential users off with draconian enforcement. 

That said, it's not stated on the CNA article, so that may not be the official policy stance. If that's the case, the Straits Times article should be corrected so it doesn't discourage installs due to fear of recrimination. 

In my opinion, it's better to set incentives by giving privileged access to critical and scarce services to people who use the app.
Eg: higher queue preference for testing and ICU given to people based on length of days running the app.

I understand these are in the plans (based on the lead's Facebook comments) , which would be great because the more eyes we have on the code, with adequate responsible disclosure, the global infosec community can help this improve, and reduce unforeseen bugs or exploits which leak or compromise user data and result in loss of confidence in the system.

Also, it allows other countries with less sophisticated contact tracing infrastructure & manpower to leverage on this work to secure their populations. Safer neighbours means less imported cases and helping them helps us eventually.

I've heard anecdotal feedback from friends that the resource and battery consumption are on the high side for a passively running app. Bad ux will cause uninstalls. My 4g and wifi performance suffered at night until i force quit it.

I'm sure this will improve over time. I urge people to trust this will be fixed eventually, but it would be useful for users to have a feedback channel to assure them that their concerns will be addressed.

The secret sauce is then what is the algorithm? It surely isn't some polymorphic cipher; because otherwise it's not reversible. What's stopping an adversary from decompiling the Android APK and identifying how the data is encoded and creating their own rogue TraceTogether?

What's more, there are glaring security concerns for leaving an essentially open beacon up on everyone's phone that's willing and accepting any information requests from any similar beacon - which is as good as leaving your level 1 window sill open. Well equipped adversaries can exploit this on unpatched devices to force feed data onto your phone.

4. For this one, for my pal's sake, I will just put it this way: Some details need to be ironed out before open-source is possible. Just think along the whole process of developing and publish the app and you'll see what is involved and needs to be discussed.

If you google bluetooth, you will realize it is also a short ranged signal which cannot allow the government to track you, unlike wifi.

I agree that this is lack of evidence on the official site. 

But from googling, I found research articles such as [Never Lose! Smart Phone based Personal Tracking via Bluetooth](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/73da/ddb1e43f985d318aef5ec89e88a3f9fe5374.pdf) .

Here is the info on [data collection](https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/sections/360007409134-Privacy-and-Data) .

""The only data that we collect is your mobile number, so that MOH can contact you more quickly if you were in close proximity to a COVID-19 case.

With your consent, TraceTogether exchanges Bluetooth proximity data with nearby phones running the same app. However, this data is anonymised and encrypted, and does not reveal your identity or the other person's identity. Also, this data is stored only on the user’s phone. Should MOH need the data for contact tracing, they will seek your consent to share it with them."" -  

&#x200B;

> It is one thing to trust the Govt, and another leap of faith to install a permanent app in the phone collecting data all the time. 

Here are details on [deletion of the app](https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360044789414-What-happens-if-I-delete-the-app-or-switch-phones-) and [removal of data from the app's server](https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360043735713-How-can-I-stop-sharing-my-data-).

"" When the app is deleted, all locally-stored data in the app will be deleted. A user will no longer be able to share the stored logs should they be contacted by a contact tracer. They need to re-install and set up the app again to participate in TraceTogether. If you've changed your phone and retained your original mobile number, no worries. You can download TraceTogether on your new phone and register with your mobile number. The TraceTogether data in your previous phone will not be ported over to your new phone. It will stay in your previous phone for 21 days, after which it'll be deleted. ""

"" You can revoke consent by emailing [support@tracetogether.gov.sg](mailto:support@tracetogether.gov.sg) with the mobile number you registered in the app.

We will then delete your mobile number and permanent ID from our server. This means that all data that your phone has exchanged with other phones will no longer be associated with you.""

In conclusion, as we have trusted our govt and their measures so far, so why not continue putting your trust in the govt that this app is done in our interest and with proper measures to protect our privacy.

(Edit to add-on: In reality you never get perfectly rated capacity, as some of you may have noticed. Same for powerbank too. This is due to losses of energy and conversions from rated voltage and circuitry. Read somewhere that your actual capacity is rated capacity * 3.7V/5V. (3.7 is your battery voltage, usually for Li-Ion, and 5V is input (rated? I am not from EE and I suck at electronics in A level physics) voltage of your charger)

In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods.

* Those unaware they were infected or in contact with those infected

When you go overseas (hopefully not any time soon), do you bother locking your luggage? It's really easy to defeat those locks, so there's no need for a lock. In fact your house door lock can be picked, why bother locking your door? 

Yes, the government has other ways to track you. But every additional bit of data can be aggregated to give an even better picture of people. Yes, good things can be done with it, and bad things can also be done with it.

There are pro/cons to every solution, and this app if used wisely, makes lot of sense targeting at this growing anomaly. I’m not sure why the radical terrorist / murderer / criminal / scammers would be silly enough to use the app. But if this app has a secondary purpose, it makes even more sense to me. Political purposes? This sounds like a desperate move, and the reputation risk is too high. Aside, I don’t think the sitting party is politically desperate - in fact, its probably otherwise but let’s not digress. 

Granted, there are probably a lot of real situations that will reveal itself overtime. But the app design logically makes sense right now, and respects user privacy. 

If you think carefully about i - This tracing is a granular trace that probably includes the parameters of both time & distance - eg they would eventually filter all the contacts you made via public transport. Each contact link data is stored locally & deleted after 21 days. It protects you as much as the other party using it. 

Now, this data is uploaded for analysis only when a user turns into a COVID-19 victim, with consent. If someone you came into contact with us COVID-19 positive, you can be contacted if both of you were using the app! Primary & secondary contact links can then be established using basic search algorithms. 

Privacy is used to protect you, but being overtly protective of privacy can also hurt you.

Look at our current contact tracing efforts. We've already been doing so well. What additional benefit does this bring?

3. Traditionally the govt prefers Security over Obscurity. (Starting from here is my opinion for this point 3): So cultural change may be needed to help promoting open-source it seems. Just as per another agency friend mentioned. BTW OP's comment checks out on this one.
4. For this one, for my pal's sake, I will just put it this way: Some details need to be ironed out before open-source is possible.

That's the contradiction I pointed out in my OP. If I sat next to an infected person, it is unlikely that they have the app and that they are aware that they are infected in the first place.

If they had the app, they are unlikely to leave their quarantined premises. Why?

Putting the idea of ""I will be caught leaving my house if I use this app"" aside, we need to keep in mind that this person downloaded this app with the reason to reduce the spread of the virus. Hence my assumption.

It doesn't make sense that someone would download this app *and* leave their quarantine zone. Otherwise, my question of ""Had there been many cases where someone was caught breaking quarantine? "" is still valid.

If ""time"" is your point here, there is a 14 day incubation period [or more](https://www.businessinsider.sg/wuhan-coronavirus-symptoms-24-days-after-infection-2020-2?op=1&r=US&IR=T) for someone to be infected without major symptoms. This doesn't help with time.

Other than that, it does make sense that this app is to reduce the time to locate those who were contacted by the infected.

1765,fl5q562,t1_fl52thb,"You missed the point of my argument. I'm not saying that TT data is definitely going to be used for political purposes (i said ""hypothetically"").

My point is that everything the government is doing, including this, is slowly but surely expanding the boundaries of what data they can collect on us, and how they can use it.

The hypothetical examples were meant to illustrate how much leeway the government has currently, and how the data can potentially be used. 

Straits Times has already said that if you are infected, the consent is taken away from you and you will be compelled to give it up.

Once you consent to the data being uploaded (or, in the case of contact tracing, the data is forcibly taken from you), you can no longer control how it is used. Private sector has laws on how data can be used, and it's enforced in the PDPA. Government is exempt from these laws, and not just for security purposes.

1790,fl3cvfu,t1_fl3cd5i,"> In addition, the statboards of MOH and Govtech have performed their own risk analysis and decided that the app is a good thing to release.

The government did its own analysis and decided to add a race qualification to the Presidency (even as they said the PM-ship should be race blind), disqualifying a slightly anti-establishment candidate.

The government did its own analysis and decided that they should have POFMA (which is admittedly useful for COVID, but that wasn't their thought process). They also decided some time back to limit the number of hospitals built so people won't go to the hospital that much (which was since reversed).

I could go on, but my point is that you have to exercise your own judgement, and while the government is generally quite rational they sometimes are blind to the consequences of their actions.",t3_fm41s6,2020-03-21 16:07:05,jigaopuaysi,12,"Why downloading TraceTogether not only makes sense, but is the right thing to do.",t3_fm41s6,466,fm41s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fm41s6/why_downloading_tracetogether_not_only_makes/,320,2020-03-21 06:24:04,0.85,"['addit', 'statboard', 'moh', 'govtech', 'perform', 'risk', 'analysi', 'decid', 'app', 'good', 'thing', 'releas', 'govern', 'analysi', 'decid', 'add', 'race', 'qualif', 'presid', 'even', 'said', 'race', 'blind', 'disqualifi', 'slightli', 'candid', 'govern', 'analysi', 'decid', 'pofma', 'admittedli', 'use', 'covid', 'thought', 'process', 'also', 'decid', 'time', 'back', 'limit', 'number', 'hospit', 'built', 'peopl', 'wo', 'go', 'hospit', 'much', 'sinc', 'revers', 'could', 'go', 'point', 'exercis', 'judgement', 'govern', 'gener', 'quit', 'ration', 'sometim', 'blind', 'consequ', 'action']"

I’m not sure how much usage data they will collect, since it’s not stated in the FAQ, but assuming they at least check if the app has been used “x” times a day and duration, it will give a clear picture on whether or not to rely on these users.

When TT was first rolled out, VB and his team indicated that TT data can ONLY be used for contact tracing. Not PRIMARILY. This has implications.

From hindsight, we can either deduce that (1) there was a legal carveout to protect TT data from CPC section 20 or (2) VB's team just simply overlooked it only to discover it later.

Case 1: Obviously, no. That didn't happen.

Case 2: Okay, so when VB and his team announced TT and indicated its ONLY INTENDED use, Shan and Desmond Tan just.... said nothing to correct VB and his team? I'm sure Shan and Desmond Tan know the existence of section 20 of the CPC does have all encompassing powers for data retrieval when it comes to criminal investigations, right? So the moment when VB discovers that section 20 of the CPC applies to TT data, he also... said nothing to the public? You gotta be serious.

I understand that having an investigative authority with broad powers is the price of admission to living in Singapore. However, pulling off this sleight of hand is just.... uncool.

I'm no lawmaker, but is it really that hard to pass some legislation specifying that the data used for contact tracing can only specifically be used for contact tracing and not for criminal prosecution?

To answer /u/DuePomegranate here, the mere fact that MOH collects data on the whereabouts of persons, means that it is fair game for the police under section 20 of the CPC - [as Shan points out](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/tracetogether-data-use-police-restricted-very-serious-offences-says-shanmugam), the same applies to banking data, phone history, cell towers if they have it. There is no legal mechanism AFAIK for MOH to refuse a police request.

As I have repeatedly said elsewhere, that means even only a Safeentry regime, or the Apple-Google model (assuming they can crack it and/or somehow obtain the IDs of targeted persons), would be subject to the same investigatory powers.

1974,gi6kun7,t1_gi68q9z,"Did some more research. It was present in the 2009 CPC bill already, as it gives the police the ""power to order document or other thing"" and enhanced in the Criminal Justice Reform Act 2018  to include ""data"" as defined in the Computer Misuse Act.

It's fairly essentially as it's the only law I can find that gives courts/police legal power to acquire documents for evidence. This was likely expanded as the definition of documents would not be sufficient to include digital data in order to keep up with the modern age (ala is a CCTV recording a document?). TraceTogether data is data there's no question there.

I reckon ""Section 40 Power to access decryption information"" should be of the essence here as it's gives the Public Prosecutor the ability to authorise police to exercise the power to obtain decrypted information (TraceTogether data is encrypted). At least this requires the case to go to court? The argument can be made here that this is too expansive but on the other hand if repealed it may be challenging to acquire evidence to prove guilt/innocence (i.e. the police have no right to ask for documents/data) and potentially lead to a breakdown of rule of law. 

Ultimately the question is, how much power should the courts/police have to gain access to information?

1986,ft98q2t,t3_gy58r9,"Many people like to say that all the necessary parts are already in place for us to be tracked, so how is this different? But in a crucial sense that has nothing to do with the technology involved; it is much more serious. Because it legitimizes it and makes future potentially unsavory uses of such a system extraordinarily difficult to rally against.

Accepting a tracker requires a level of participation that can no longer be defended by it being an unavoidable side-effect of a better reason; for example, to use a cell phone, the cell towers must necessarily know which cell you're in. To accept a tracker is to agree that there do exist valid reasons for the government to know the location of its people at all times, with no other upside. 

Once you agree with that, the only hurdle left is expanding the list of acceptable reasons. And this is a trivial matter - all that is required is to emphasize the benefits and put off the potential problems as unrelated or to be handled in the future. It is terribly difficult to defend abstract principles such as privacy when faced with seductive real-world applications and results like catching a murderer, radicals, or greatly streamlining the transport system. No doubt the implementation of such applications will also be well-charted out and assuredly satisfy their goals. 

""It would be a waste not to..."" is a phrase that will come up very often. At some point, there will be a benefit that will seem to be so trivial to implement, and yet so necessary as to be idiotic *not* to use the tracking system or its data. The scope of tracking then tightens to satisfy the reasons proposed, and again it is difficult to say no, because then opponents will be, directly or indirectly, opposing the good cause for which it is intended. Already today, if you tell people you aren't installing TraceTogether out of privacy concerns, some will tell you you're being selfish and its a trivial sacrifice to stop the pandemic. 

The same scenario will happen once the tracker is normalized. I cannot imagine any viable opposition that can stall enhancement to tracking capabilities for long once a compelling-enough reason is found, with no consideration for potential abuse. After all, the abuse is only ""potential"", but the benefit is imminent. If tracking capability is stalled by an opposing faction in the government, that faction achieves nothing except upholding of privacy, and likely has to burn bridges doing so, but a faction in the government which succeeds in implementing enhanced tracking measures has everything to gain, because the effects will be observable.

People always think that, ""Oh, as long as we keep the bad people from using it for bad purposes, there's no problem with having such data."" But even a completely benevolent government is still made out of tens of thousands of individuals and departments with different aims, priorities, abilities, and problems. No one thinks of themselves as evil, or having evil goals. Yet a large organization can still produce behavior that is recognizably, undeniably malevolent.

Already with the suggested capability, off the top of my head I can come up with several usages that could possibly be attractive enough to implement and acceptable to some people, while deeply uncomfortable to others. Let's say the tracker doesn't track location, but only other trackers near it, and timestamps. (Nevertheless, it would be trivial in such a case to place trackers at known public locations to serve as landmarks.)

>A student's tracker is observed to often disappear from the vicinity of his parents' trackers at night. Sometimes it re-emerges near those of a certain group of friends, and sometimes it is out of range of any other trackers for a long time. The monitoring system flags the student as engaging in potentially delinquent or dangerous activity, and recommends counselling.
 

>Tracing is expanded as a natural progression from pandemic tracing to general healthcare. This allows them to better identify unhealthy, at-risk individuals by profiling their frequent, excessive presence at places like nightclubs or bars. A health tax is proposed for these individuals to offset the costs of their supposed irresponsible behavior on society and incentivize them to reduce the frequency of their visits.


>A murder occurs in a park, but only the body's tracker is registered. Police recover the body's tracker and request every person whose tracker has been in the vicinity of the victim in the last hour to come in to provide eyewitness accounts. Suspicious individuals are detained for further questioning.",t3_gy58r9,2020-06-07 18:22:45,surfaceintegral,26,[Serious] What do you guys think of the wearable contact tracing device?,t3_gy58r9,55,gy58r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gy58r9/serious_what_do_you_guys_think_of_the_wearable/,114,2020-06-07 11:40:29,0.74,"['mani', 'peopl', 'like', 'say', 'necessari', 'part', 'alreadi', 'place', 'us', 'track', 'differ', 'crucial', 'sens', 'noth', 'technolog', 'involv', 'much', 'seriou', 'legitim', 'make', 'futur', 'potenti', 'unsavori', 'use', 'system', 'extraordinarili', 'difficult', 'ralli', 'accept', 'tracker', 'requir', 'level', 'particip', 'longer', 'defend', 'unavoid', 'better', 'reason', 'exampl', 'use', 'cell', 'phone', 'cell', 'tower', 'must', 'necessarili', 'know', 'cell', 'accept', 'tracker', 'agre', 'exist', 'valid', 'reason', 'govern', 'know', 'locat', 'peopl', 'time', 'upsid', 'agre', 'hurdl', 'left', 'expand', 'list', 'accept', 'reason', 'trivial', 'matter', 'requir', 'emphas', 'benefit', 'put', 'potenti', 'problem', 'unrel', 'handl', 'futur', 'terribl', 'difficult', 'defend', 'abstract', 'principl', 'privaci', 'face', 'seduct', 'applic', 'result', 'like', 'catch', 'murder', 'radic', 'greatli', 'streamlin', 'transport', 'system', 'doubt', 'implement', 'applic', 'also', 'assuredli', 'satisfi', 'goal', 'would', 'wast', 'phrase', 'come', 'often', 'point', 'benefit', 'seem', 'trivial', 'implement', 'yet', 'necessari', 'idiot', 'use', 'track', 'system', 'data', 'scope', 'track', 'tighten', 'satisfi', 'reason', 'propos', 'difficult', 'say', 'oppon', 'directli', 'indirectli', 'oppos', 'good', 'caus', 'intend', 'alreadi', 'today', 'tell', 'peopl', 'instal', 'tracetogeth', 'privaci', 'concern', 'tell', 'selfish', 'trivial', 'sacrific', 'stop', 'pandem', 'scenario', 'happen', 'tracker', 'normal', 'imagin', 'viabl', 'opposit', 'stall', 'enhanc', 'track', 'capabl', 'long', 'reason', 'found', 'consider', 'potenti', 'abus', 'abus', 'potenti', 'benefit', 'immin', 'track', 'capabl', 'stall', 'oppos', 'faction', 'govern', 'faction', 'achiev', 'noth', 'except', 'uphold', 'privaci', 'like', 'burn', 'bridg', 'faction', 'govern', 'succe', 'implement', 'enhanc', 'track', 'measur', 'everyth', 'gain', 'effect', 'observ', 'peopl', 'alway', 'think', 'oh', 'long', 'keep', 'bad', 'peopl', 'use', 'bad', 'purpos', 'problem', 'data', 'even', 'complet', 'benevol', 'govern', 'still', 'made', 'ten', 'thousand', 'individu', 'depart', 'differ', 'aim', 'prioriti', 'abil', 'problem', 'one', 'think', 'evil', 'evil', 'goal', 'yet', 'larg', 'organ', 'still', 'produc', 'behavior', 'recogniz', 'undeni', 'malevol', 'alreadi', 'suggest', 'capabl', 'top', 'head', 'come', 'sever', 'usag', 'could', 'possibl', 'attract', 'enough', 'implement', 'accept', 'peopl', 'deepli', 'uncomfort', 'other', 'let', 'say', 'tracker', 'track', 'locat', 'tracker', 'near', 'timestamp', 'nevertheless', 'would', 'trivial', 'case', 'place', 'tracker', 'known', 'public', 'locat', 'serv', 'landmark', 'student', 'tracker', 'observ', 'often', 'disappear', 'vicin', 'parent', 'tracker', 'night', 'sometim', 'near', 'certain', 'group', 'friend', 'sometim', 'rang', 'tracker', 'long', 'time', 'monitor', 'system', 'flag', 'student', 'engag', 'potenti', 'delinqu', 'danger', 'activ', 'recommend', 'counsel', 'trace', 'expand', 'natur', 'progress', 'pandem', 'trace', 'gener', 'healthcar', 'allow', 'better', 'identifi', 'unhealthi', 'individu', 'profil', 'frequent', 'excess', 'presenc', 'place', 'like', 'nightclub', 'bar', 'health', 'tax', 'propos', 'individu', 'offset', 'cost', 'suppos', 'irrespons', 'behavior', 'societi', 'incentiv', 'reduc', 'frequenc', 'visit', 'murder', 'occur', 'park', 'bodi', 'tracker', 'regist', 'polic', 'recov', 'bodi', 'tracker', 'request', 'everi', 'person', 'whose', 'tracker', 'vicin', 'victim', 'last', 'hour', 'come', 'provid', 'eyewit', 'account', 'suspici', 'individu', 'detain', 'question']"

1992,ft8ub9a,t3_gy58r9,"I used to wear a blood glucose meter/sensor patch which was stuck on my arm which monitored my blood sugar levels 24/7 (if you want to read up more about it , the device is called freestyle libre and it monitors your blood sugar level every single minute - you use your Iphone app to scan the reading). I made the mistake of signing some papers so that the data was shared with the nutritionist and she could see the data/results. Even though it was for ""health"" reasons that she could monitor the glucose level, every time it went above a certain range so would send me a text message or whatsapp to ask me why and give comments such as advising me on how best to eat and how to avoid glucose spikes etc.  I found it very invasive actually because everyone has to eat three meals a day, and here was someone tracking my glucose and sending me a message every time the reading went up whether I cared for her to do so or not. So why don't I put it this way, if the government wants to make a tracking device, I don't see why they won't want to at the same time try to make some money out of it. For example, make it into a sensor patch which has a computer chip inside to monitor where you go through gps signals - then you have to use your phone to scan it every day so that the data gets sent to the government database. This is not a science fiction story. We already have the technology to do something like that. Then the government deducts money from your bank account everytime the senor patch comes off and you don't scan it - kind of like a traffic fine. Good luck to us all! The Singaporean government loves tracking and the government also has no qualms to invade other people's privacy (NEA home visits to see if you have water in your home that breeds mosquitoes). Actually while we are at it, why don't we spend the money to test all 5.5 million Singaporeans for Covid-19 instead of creating a device that tracks people?? You want to track people huh? At first it was for cars, now it is physical movement of people. Good luck to us all!!!

1998,ftazb9m,t3_gy58r9,"Snowden has brought up very salient points with regards to concerns about heightened surveillance measures as a response to the coronavirus. (search for 'Shelter in Place with Shane Smith & Edward Snowden' on YouTube).

""When I think about the future, when any of us look at where this is heading, we need to think about where we've been, and sadly, these kind of emergency powers that are born out of crises have a perfect history of abuse. I mean, down the board, whenever you look at these things, the funniest part about it in a dark way is that the emergency never ends. It becomes normalised. 

When you talk about mass surveillance, the Bush-era warrantless wiretapping program, only part of it was shut down, and it's rolled over and it's rolled over and it's rolled over. And we've performed things at the edges, but the basic practices of what was supposed to be a stopgap emergency, which was in response to another stopgap emergency, was which was, of course, the legacy of 9/11 and the Patriot Act. And we are still today engaged in the same wars that we declared nearly 20 years ago that we have not managed to escape.

You know, we had, as a result of 9/11, the rise of the nuclear Iran because their counterbalance in Iraq was ruined. We saw authoritarianism begin to creep across Western societies, places we wouldn't expect, like Hungary and Poland. As authoritarianism spreads, as emergency laws proliferate, as we sacrifice our rights, we also sacrifice our capability to arrest this slide into a less liberal and less free world. 

Do you truly believe that when the first wave, the second wave, the 16th wave of the coronavirus is a long-forgotten memory, that these capabilities will not be kept, that these data sets will not be kept? Will those capabilities begin to be applied to small-time criminality? Will they begin to be applied to political analysis? Will they begin to be applied for doing things like performing a census? Will they be used for political polling? No matter how it is being used, what is being built is the architecture of oppression. 

And you might trust who is dealing with it, you might trust who runs it. You might go, ""You know, I don't care about Mark Zuckerberg."" But someone else will have this data eventually. Some other country will have this data eventually.

As much as TraceTogether is out there for people to help in the process of CT, some just don’t bother, like myself. I didn’t download it until I was required to by my employer. Likewise. For SafeEntry, people suck thumb need to check in but checkouts mostly aren’t enforced, leaving some sort of a gap when it comes to tracing contacts. 

I’m not involved in contact tracing processes nor am I agreeable on wearables due to privacy concerns, but I think it is for a necessary cause that we are assigned them. 

Hopefully more details are released ie. location data purely used for CT (but who knows), and a duration for when the wearables are compulsory. Say one day a vaccine is made or cases are real stable, the wearables can be returned or discarded.

A great many concerns with privacy also has nothing to do with the individual’s perceived worth to the authorities or the inclination towards crime. It has to do with informational inequality and contextual integrity.

Daniel Solove has expounded upon the issue; some key extracts as follows:

“The harms are bureaucratic ones – indifference, error, abuse, frustration, and lack of transparency and accountability. 

Many government national-security measures involve maintaining a huge database of information that individuals cannot access. Indeed, because they involve national security, the very existence of these programs is often kept secret. This kind of information processing, which blocks subjects' knowledge and involvement, is a kind of due-process problem. It is a structural problem, involving the way people are treated by government institutions and creating a power imbalance between people and the government. To what extent should government officials have such a significant power over citizens? This issue isn't about what information people want to hide but about the power and the structure of government.”

By not leveraging the Apple Google Exposure Notification API, the TT app on both Android and iOS is already not as efficient as it is needed to be effective. The protocol used in TT is also not reliable, especially on the iOS platform. The accuracy is poor and it can never be nowhere close to the seamless integration and effectiveness of what Apple and Google have came up with.

Just look at the series of complaints and issues that TT app has. Bluetooth interference with headsets, high CPU usage, high battery consumption, and some used it an entire day only to find 0 Bluetooth interactions at the end of the day.

Numerous Bluetooth exchanges would have gone missing or not captured due to this myriad of issues, and ultimately SafeEntry is still the safer bet to tracking.

What’s sad of course is the amount spent to produce these tokens (vs no cost for using the Apple Google API and yet already readily available in our devices) as well as the plastic waste generated.

2136,g7pe9qe,t1_g7o4sy1,"It's pretty much as he said.

SafeEntry puts you, individually identifiably, in a space when someone in that space later tests positive for COVID. It *does not* say who'd been close enough to you during your time there to have risked spreading it to you, or catching it from you; it just says that you and a positive person were in the same general space at the same time.

TraceTogether walks that positive person through their time there, allowing later recovery of (initially-)obscured identifiers of people who came close enough to that person to have a high risk for infection. Those identifiers can be traced from that point in time onward to see who *they* come close to, and so on. If your identifier (which IIUC is your Bluetooth device ID salted with some other bits) shows up in that tree strongly enough, then the personal identification associated with your identifier is requested and you get a ring or an SMS.

SafeEntry identifies you directly, but doesn't support building the contact tree needed to evaluate your risk level, and TraceTogether records _distance_ rather than _position_ (identifying you indirectly), so it can tell that you came close to Person X but not where you were at the time (which would require GPS data). The two of them together, however, get the job done. Also, the TraceTogether data shouldn't be needed (and *should* be securely destroyed, but I don't remember hearing about that) after the data is more than a couple-three months old and you haven't been flagged as being at risk by SafeEntry.

""Why not do it all in one app"", you may ask. A lot of countries do; Apple and Google developed a single app that seems to get the job done, but

a) Not Invented Here Syndrome is pandemic among policymakers here, and
b) those policymakers made a big show of committing GovTech to develop what turned into SafeEntry before any other SEA country had any real experience with the Google/Apple system.
