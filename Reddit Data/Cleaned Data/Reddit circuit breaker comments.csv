24,24,24,fs3ke15,t3_gn4e53,"Can't vent out on traditional social networks so I had only here to let out my frustrations.

Tried helping twice on the housework, get scowled for being ineffective.

I left the cooking chores to my sister, keeps sighing all over.

Every day conversations are about how they hated the PRCs for spreading the contagion, and how the ""infidels"" are all responsible for making the world a miserable place.

I need to concentrate on my work but I keep having second thoughts about the emotions of my sibling. When asked, she never responds.

I feel like I'm the asshole in this family. Never mind that my workplace requires me to be on my computer from 8 to 6 and sometimes spill over. Sometimes my work never gets done because I can't think of the solution in front of me due to insufficient skill set.

I don't sleep at times, trying to both relief myself from the boredom of work, and to escape the continuing scowling from my family members. Aged parent complained that I never talk to them, considering I'm being courteous by not saying anything contrarian.

I hold left liberal views, a despised position in my family. They say that kind of political thinking is akin to apostasy, and those who hold such beliefs mirror their asshole relatives: they kept hounded our family for many decades over their insistence to keep my dad as a guarantor for their ill-spent home loan; and the fact that my late mother was the primary target for putting house chores on top of her when she's pregnant with my sibling.

I feel like I am damned if I do, damned if I don't. I keep thinking negative thoughts because people are angry over my (in)actions. Many times I thought people want to see me go away and not be in their sights.

So I tried self-harm thrice in my lifetime. The last one got me into a psychiatric ward after prodding by my friend.

I feel like doing it again.

I don't like their continuous stream of racist, bigoted statements, but claimed they are ""humbler than many people"", I certainly don't like conservative thoughts because the outcomes became this. I certainly held a belief, naively, that people should be better versions of themselves, and I want to continue holding onto that belief.

Because otherwise, I might as well not marry.

There have been many hints that I will need to find a new home for myself. I have saved up considerably that I can probably pay off this Airbnb rent (until we get a temporary HDB home here some time in the near future), and to hush up ideas about my ""leeching off and not doing my part to the family."" Maybe me, living 300 kilometres away from my family to escape the dinner table conversations and miserable take on other human beings for the past decade, could have been good indicators that I can never gel well with this family of mine.

I can only say that I intend to move out from my sibling's HDB home and get myself a rent. Dad wants to keep the family intact, but I can't go out and find myself a date if I keep having thoughts that my choices will never be accepted by my family regardless.

I don't know if I should seek psychiatric treatment. The time for me to get a referral from my hospital in KL has long gone. I certainly don't want my family to know I need psychiatric help lest they cursed me for ""not believing enough"".

Honestly speaking, the vision of myself at the moment is only me being in this long, dark tunnel of misery, the walls are slimy with the degeneracy of people's thoughts, and an unseen, unknown terror behind me.

I kept silent about my thoughts from my family. My dad complains to my sibling that I don't talk enough to him. I just want to keep the peace, however untenable or uneasy this peace is.

At least the busking sessions, the random Spanish flamenco dance videos and Russian dramas on YouTube kept him entertained. Merdeka generation folk tend to harp about the simpler life in the past. I can't be empathetic about a past I don't know about.

Anyway, we're migrants from a shattered ideal of living in a place of lower costs of living. It turned out the people who run that country are as shitty as the country they came from.

My mind is definitely all over the place. Like I said, I need a place to rant and vent.

As for the 3% figure you cite, that has been superceded for a while already. If I recall right it was based on early Hubei figures.

Can't really blame them owing to the situation itself but there are a lot of inconsistencies in term of rules, measures, regulations. For example, classification of what is 'essential'. Apparently, they think haircuts is more important than renovation. You cannot don't have haircuts for 2-3 months but it's fine not to have your home renovated in 2-3 months. You can stay wherever you are now for all I care, despite incurring endless cost and inconvenience with no certainty when the end will be in sight.

You can crowd around in the trains, at transport hubs, bus stop with no 'safe distancing', heck, they even remove safe distancing decals in the trains. However, 3-4 workers renovating a flat with ample space between them is not allowed. Such inconsistency and ironically, these same renovation workers, who can't work, can freely go about their activities in the community such as buying food, haircuts, and for all we know, they may even taking up food delivery jobs and meeting many different people on daily basis. Just the other day, a property agent delivered food to me and shared that many in renovation and property lines have taken up food delivery jobs.

Now news are aplenty on closing of F&B restaurants. They simply can't sustain their business even with govt's help. Because no matter what, there is no revenue but fixed cost like overhead, rental, utilities still exist. Only a handful who can rely on delivery business can tough it out and even then, if the economy remain shut, they may not last long too.

In view of the low fatality rate, I think we can take greater risk and open the economy fast. Make wearing mask a habit everywhere we go. We should also do our part and download TraceTogether. Come on, the fatality rate is so low and only concentrate on certain vulnerable groups \[separate measures must be in place to protect them\], if unlucky to contract covid, as long as it is detected early, a normal patient should recover within 2-4 weeks. Meanwhile, if we have been playing our part by conforming to SafeEntry, TraceTogether etc, all the contacts can be traced easily and test for covid too and treat accordingly in positive.

333,333,333,ftnp6vv,t3_gux3wc,"The longer we stay at home, the harder it is to restart the economy when we finally deem it is safe to stay out of home. Even though a lot of work can be done at home, I think WFH model is more suitable to people engaged in gig economy such as self employed in areas such as social influencers, equity tradings, forex speculators, resellers who buy clothes/books/furnitures etc from suppliers and sell it to you etc. Those who are employed by companies in whatever capacity, it is best to have physical meetings, interactions and even a meal together with bosses, colleagues and subordinates alike.  

People who pro lockdown, I think, are those not affected too much by it. Usually these are rich people who have ways and means to access whatever money that is left circulating in the system. For example they may be able to gain some of the money released by Fed Res through trading the US equity markets. They may be civil servants whose job security is not a concern, relatively to those people employed by businesses. 

Nobody and certainly the economy cannot function in isolation. No economy activity is as good as no revenue for many businesses. No revenue mean zero activity to circulate the money for everyone, no pay, no rental, no fee, no purchases, no deliveries, no production, no sale, no orders. Simply put, if the lockdown continues, only certain activities can continue owing to the fact that these activities are supported by govt \[reserves\]. Such as civil servant jobs, essential services paid by govt and even such activities will come to a halt if economy remain closed. As it is, the govt is propping everyone up with the various schemes at the expense of our reserves. How long can this last? Do we really have bottomless reserves? Once our reserves are weaken, we are susceptible to currency attacks. I hope the govt did not forget AFC. I think we have come to a point to seriously consider whether the prolonged lockdown is the way going forward. It is a difficult call, whether we save live in the short term with blanket lockdown or target to help the vulnerable groups with some focus measures so that majority can move forward or risking everyone to suffer with the collapsing economy?",t3_gux3wc,2020-06-11 11:15:05,rental3421,10,1,1,r/Singapore Post-Circuit Breaker Phase I Edition,t3_gux3wc,83,gux3wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gux3wc/rsingapore_postcircuit_breaker_phase_i_edition/,295,2020-06-02 08:50:28,0.9,"['longer', 'stay', 'home', 'harder', 'restart', 'economi', 'final', 'deem', 'safe', 'stay', 'home', 'even', 'though', 'lot', 'work', 'done', 'home', 'think', 'wfh', 'model', 'suitabl', 'peopl', 'engag', 'gig', 'economi', 'self', 'employ', 'area', 'social', 'influenc', 'equiti', 'trade', 'forex', 'specul', 'resel', 'buy', 'etc', 'supplier', 'sell', 'etc', 'employ', 'compani', 'whatev', 'capac', 'best', 'physic', 'meet', 'interact', 'even', 'meal', 'togeth', 'boss', 'colleagu', 'subordin', 'alik', 'peopl', 'pro', 'lockdown', 'think', 'affect', 'much', 'usual', 'rich', 'peopl', 'way', 'mean', 'access', 'whatev', 'money', 'left', 'circul', 'system', 'exampl', 'may', 'abl', 'gain', 'money', 'releas', 'fed', 're', 'trade', 'us', 'equiti', 'market', 'may', 'civil', 'servant', 'whose', 'job', 'secur', 'concern', 'rel', 'peopl', 'employ', 'busi', 'nobodi', 'certainli', 'economi', 'function', 'isol', 'economi', 'activ', 'good', 'revenu', 'mani', 'busi', 'revenu', 'mean', 'zero', 'activ', 'circul', 'money', 'everyon', 'pay', 'rental', 'fee', 'purchas', 'deliveri', 'product', 'sale', 'order', 'simpli', 'put', 'lockdown', 'continu', 'certain', 'activ', 'continu', 'owe', 'fact', 'activ', 'support', 'govt', 'civil', 'servant', 'job', 'essenti', 'servic', 'paid', 'govt', 'even', 'activ', 'come', 'halt', 'economi', 'remain', 'close', 'govt', 'prop', 'everyon', 'variou', 'scheme', 'expens', 'reserv', 'long', 'last', 'realli', 'bottomless', 'reserv', 'reserv', 'weaken', 'suscept', 'currenc', 'attack', 'hope', 'govt', 'forget', 'afc', 'think', 'come', 'point', 'serious', 'consid', 'whether', 'prolong', 'lockdown', 'way', 'go', 'forward', 'difficult', 'call', 'whether', 'save', 'live', 'short', 'term', 'blanket', 'lockdown', 'target', 'help', 'vulner', 'group', 'focu', 'measur', 'major', 'move', 'forward', 'risk', 'everyon', 'suffer', 'collaps', 'economi']"

Prof. David Robertson, head of Viral Genomics and Bioinformatics at the Centre for Virus Research, was part of the team. MNT asked his views on the possibility of there being more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2.
“Until there is some evidence of a change in virus biology, we cannot say that there are new strains of the virus. It’s important to appreciate that mutations are a normal byproduct of virus replication and that most mutations we observe won’t have any impact on virus biology or function,” he said.

723,723,723,fmh5aq6,t3_fv83dd,"I think the government is placing too much faith in Singaporeans (myself included) to stay at home (except for essential errands) without strict enforcement or legal consequences. I feel like we didn't really cut our social interactions by much when it was DOSCON Orange (especially the later part, before Circuit Breaker was announced), and so even though we entered DOSCON CircuitBreaker I think there will still be people who don't feel the need to stay home and would go visit their friends instead when they get bored.

Given that the government doesn't seem to want to strictly enforce currently, a possible solution (indirect/soft approach) to deter non-essential transit could be to temporarily raise prices of public transport for those who are traveling a lot for non-essential reasons (reaching a certain number of trips in a week moves you to a higher price tier for that week), and have 2-3 tiers (normal unraised, slightly raised and greatly raised price), while giving concession passes or rebates to the essential workers etc. So for non-essential commuters, the first X trips in a week is at the lowest price tier, while the middle price tier will kick in when you travel more than X trips in that week, and then subsequently (if there are 3 tiers) after traveling more than Y trips in that week the highest price tier will kick in. However, this is only effective in the ideal scenario, where no one abuses the loophole of taking another family member's ezlink to bypass the raised prices. But since the loophole exists and is likely to be abused, the price tiers should start with the slightly raised price to begin with as the lowest tier, or the slightly raised price should kick in early maybe 2 trips in a week.

Also, the government should track the transit numbers and make a statement if number of transit trips are too numerous compared to the expected numbers, and are not following the spirit of the CircuitBreaker measures.

[12 Apr: Singapore’s first lady responds to Taiwan's mask donation with 'Errrr'](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/)

Back story: [Taiwan banned the export of masks in January 2020. ST Engineering had 2 mask producing lines in Taiwan. The masks ST Eng produced were banned from export. ST Eng moved their machinery back, which was allowed.](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx) (This is based on Google Translate of the article.)

It appears that the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban have not been requisitioned by the Taiwanese government but are not allowed to be exported i.e. the masks are stuck in Taiwan. No indication whether Taiwan is charging ST Eng storage fees for keeping their masks.

[Based on 2016-2017 statistics (would welcome more recent statistics), Taiwan appears to be the third largest mask producer worldwide.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/856804/share-of-global-sheet-face-masks-producers-by-leading-country/)

Taiwan announced this weekend that they are donating masks to Singapore. [These are surgical masks, which are lower quality from the N95 ones that ST Eng produced.](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/fn71x2f/) There does not appear to be an update on whether the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban can be exported to Singapore yet.

Ho Ching shared the news article on Facebook and said ""Errrr"", and causing 4 posts on r/singapore about one word. 

Comments: 

* I've read that the ban was to stop masks from being exported to China especially since there was a shortage of masks in Taiwan - it appears that as ST Eng ""[is not a domestic manufacturer and is not within the scope of the Ministry of Economics requisition](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx)"" - so foreign manufacturers already had different rules from the start. It's not clear why Taiwan didn't extend this to us.

* Should Ho Ching have said anything? She's wearing three hats in this scenario (1) wife of PM Lee (2) CEO of Temasek, who is the majority shareholder of ST Engineering (3) Singaporean ~aunty~ citizen. On one hand, this has brought up claims that Singapore is ungrateful ([though this might be](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn6uci8/) [sensationalised by Taiwanese media](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzot0k/singapore_to_shift_2_of_its_mask_production_line/fn5w0vc/)) and that she is unprofessional (or even the next [Elon Musk](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn688g2/)). On the other hand - this provides some counter-balance / depth to the backstory of what Taiwan has done: [if not for her post, would we even be aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn66406/)?

* I do wonder if Taiwan's actions influenced Singapore's mask policy in Feb - if we had stable supply lines, [would the government have suggested that everyone mask up earlier?](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn7963h/) The mask policy was only announced *after* we had reusable masks available.

[12 Apr: Singapore’s first lady responds to Taiwan's mask donation with 'Errrr'](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/)

Back story: [Taiwan banned the export of masks in January 2020. ST Engineering had 2 mask producing lines in Taiwan. The masks ST Eng produced were banned from export. ST Eng moved their machinery back, which was allowed.](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx) (This is based on Google Translate of the article.)

It appears that the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban have not been requisitioned by the Taiwanese government but are not allowed to be exported i.e. the masks are stuck in Taiwan. No indication whether Taiwan is charging ST Eng storage fees for keeping their masks.

[Based on 2016-2017 statistics (would welcome more recent statistics), Taiwan appears to be the third largest mask producer worldwide.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/856804/share-of-global-sheet-face-masks-producers-by-leading-country/)

Taiwan announced this weekend that they are donating masks to Singapore. [These are surgical masks, which are lower quality from the N95 ones that ST Eng produced.](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/fn71x2f/) (note: need to google for a fuller source.) There does not appear to be an update on whether the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban can be exported to Singapore yet.

Ho Ching shared the news article on Facebook and said ""Errrr"", and causing 4 posts on r/singapore about one word. 

Comments: 

* I've read that the ban was to stop masks from being exported to China especially since there was a shortage of masks in Taiwan - it appears that as ST Eng ""[is not a domestic manufacturer and is not within the scope of the Ministry of Economics requisition](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx)"" - so foreign manufacturers already had different rules from the start. It's not clear why Taiwan didn't extend this to us.

* Should Ho Ching have said anything? She's wearing three hats in this scenario (1) wife of PM Lee (2) CEO of Temasek, who is the majority shareholder of ST Engineering (3) Singaporean ~aunty~ citizen. On one hand, this has brought up claims that Singapore is ungrateful ([though this might be](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn6uci8/) [sensationalised by Taiwanese media](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzot0k/singapore_to_shift_2_of_its_mask_production_line/fn5w0vc/)) and that she is unprofessional (or even the next [Elon Musk](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn688g2/)). On the other hand - this provides some counter-balance / depth to the backstory of what Taiwan has done: [if not for her post, would we even be aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn66406/)?

* I do wonder if Taiwan's actions influenced Singapore's mask policy in Feb - if we had stable supply lines, [would the government have suggested that everyone mask up earlier?](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn7963h/) The mask policy was only announced *after* we had reusable masks available. 

* This reinforces that no one owes Singapore a living. Taiwan had no hesitation stopping ST Eng's masks from export when Taiwan needed to. (To be clear: it is for the reader to argue whether this is justified.)",t3_fv83dd,2020-04-13 11:09:47,sitsthewind,1,3,3,r/Singapore April COVID-19 and Circuit Breaker Discussion,t3_fv83dd,218,fv83dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fv83dd/rsingapore_april_covid19_and_circuit_breaker/,414,2020-04-05 12:46:55,0.96,"['want', 'consolid', 'variou', 'taiwan', 'mask', 'thread', 'time', 'capsul', 'manag', 'find', 'sourc', 'everyth', 'would', 'grate', 'anyon', 'els', 'input', 'lot', 'sourc', 'appear', 'chines', 'feb', 'ho', 'ching', 'talk', 'start', 'mask', 'product', 'line', 'feb', 'st', 'engin', 'shift', 'mask', 'back', 'apr', 'singapor', 'shift', 'mask', 'product', 'capac', 'taiwan', 'singapor', 'apr', 'ho', 'ching', 'fire', 'taiwanes', 'media', 'err', 'reaction', 'news', 'taiwan', 'mask', 'donat', 'sg', 'apr', 'taiwan', 'mask', 'saga', 'case', 'close', 'tw', 'mfa', 'polici', 'base', 'offici', 'statement', 'base', 'individu', 'statement', 'apr', 'singapor', 'first', 'ladi', 'respond', 'taiwan', 'mask', 'donat', 'back', 'stori', 'taiwan', 'ban', 'export', 'mask', 'januari', 'st', 'engin', 'mask', 'produc', 'line', 'taiwan', 'mask', 'st', 'eng', 'produc', 'ban', 'export', 'st', 'eng', 'move', 'machineri', 'back', 'allow', 'base', 'googl', 'translat', 'articl', 'appear', 'mask', 'produc', 'st', 'eng', 'ban', 'requisit', 'taiwanes', 'govern', 'allow', 'export', 'mask', 'stuck', 'taiwan', 'indic', 'whether', 'taiwan', 'charg', 'st', 'eng', 'storag', 'fee', 'keep', 'mask', 'base', 'statist', 'would', 'welcom', 'recent', 'statist', 'taiwan', 'appear', 'third', 'largest', 'mask', 'produc', 'worldwid', 'taiwan', 'announc', 'weekend', 'donat', 'mask', 'singapor', 'surgic', 'mask', 'lower', 'qualiti', 'one', 'st', 'eng', 'produc', 'note', 'need', 'googl', 'fuller', 'sourc', 'appear', 'updat', 'whether', 'mask', 'produc', 'st', 'eng', 'ban', 'export', 'singapor', 'yet', 'ho', 'ching', 'share', 'news', 'articl', 'facebook', 'said', 'errrr', 'caus', 'post', 'one', 'word', 'comment', 'read', 'ban', 'stop', 'mask', 'export', 'china', 'especi', 'sinc', 'shortag', 'mask', 'taiwan', 'appear', 'st', 'eng', 'domest', 'manufactur', 'within', 'scope', 'ministri', 'econom', 'requisit', 'foreign', 'manufactur', 'alreadi', 'differ', 'rule', 'start', 'clear', 'taiwan', 'extend', 'us', 'ho', 'ching', 'said', 'anyth', 'wear', 'three', 'hat', 'scenario', 'wife', 'pm', 'lee', 'ceo', 'temasek', 'major', 'sharehold', 'st', 'engin', 'singaporean', 'citizen', 'one', 'hand', 'brought', 'claim', 'singapor', 'ungrat', 'though', 'might', 'sensationalis', 'taiwanes', 'media', 'unprofession', 'even', 'next', 'elon', 'musk', 'hand', 'provid', 'depth', 'backstori', 'taiwan', 'done', 'post', 'would', 'even', 'awar', 'wonder', 'taiwan', 'action', 'influenc', 'singapor', 'mask', 'polici', 'feb', 'stabl', 'suppli', 'line', 'would', 'govern', 'suggest', 'everyon', 'mask', 'earlier', 'mask', 'polici', 'announc', 'reusabl', 'mask', 'avail', 'reinforc', 'one', 'owe', 'singapor', 'live', 'taiwan', 'hesit', 'stop', 'st', 'eng', 'mask', 'export', 'taiwan', 'need', 'clear', 'reader', 'argu', 'whether', 'justifi']"

These are very valid concerns and its a bit unusual that they're not extending the same safety measures to you just because they're worried about a laptop. My company allows our interns to work from home. We even have an intern who we've never seen in person working from home - we courier-ed a company laptop to her house for work.

As the other commenters said, it'll be best to wait for any announcements and just check with your supervisor one more time. In the meantime, there is no harm in letting your teacher or supervisor at Poly know early just to sound out that this is a potential issue. This will give them time to think about what they can do.

Your health is important, and your parents' too. Take care!

They will not abandon contact tracing unless it's no longer an effective strategy in containing the spread. It's not that when you stop contact tracing, that the situation goes to shit. It's that when the situation goes to shit (too many unlinked cases, which indicates widespread community transmission) that you stop contact tracing because too many potential undetected cases are amongst us that will continue the transmission faster than we can catch them.

A single day's numbers does not mean much without taking into context other factors:

1. **The persistence of the increase in numbers.**   
For example today we had 100+ cases right? If next 7 days we got 0-30 cases, then it's not widespread community transmission (WCT). The average numbers over a period of time is what they use to determine. If not then you declare WCT every day that you get 100+ cases, then when numbers drop then you take back your words?
2. **The number of truly unlinked cases** (ie. totally unlinked after endless amount of tracing. Not just looking at the initial reported number of unlinked cases for each day)   
If you have 100+ cases, but most if not all of them are shown to be from existing clusters **eventually** (for example all are foreign workers from dorms of existing clusters), then it's not WCT.

So the situation must fulfill the criteria, persistent (sustained over time) increase in numbers and especially in number of truly unlinked cases, to be considered widespread community transmission.

And I do agree with you that the numbers are worrying, no doubt. But it's not an apples to apples comparison to Italy, because our contact tracing efforts are way more intensive and started early and had success in containment (thanks to us being a small country), so 100+ detected cases in Italy could have been just among significantly more undetected cases compared to us.

I didn't follow Italy's news fully, but if their response measures were made much later than at the moment they had 100+ daily cases, then it's definitely different from our case, because we already have our measures decided and ready to go now as the govt predicted that this will happen. Therefore our measures will flatten the curve at an earlier stage/point of time compared to theirs",t3_fv83dd,2020-04-06 01:22:59,baxoga,12,3,3,r/Singapore April COVID-19 and Circuit Breaker Discussion,t3_fv83dd,218,fv83dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fv83dd/rsingapore_april_covid19_and_circuit_breaker/,414,2020-04-05 12:46:55,0.96,"['offici', 'explan', 'regard', 'dorscon', 'red', 'widespread', 'commun', 'transmiss', 'press', 'confer', 'report', 'question', 'came', 'abandon', 'contact', 'trace', 'unless', 'longer', 'effect', 'strategi', 'contain', 'spread', 'stop', 'contact', 'trace', 'situat', 'goe', 'shit', 'situat', 'goe', 'shit', 'mani', 'unlink', 'case', 'indic', 'widespread', 'commun', 'transmiss', 'stop', 'contact', 'trace', 'mani', 'potenti', 'undetect', 'case', 'amongst', 'us', 'continu', 'transmiss', 'faster', 'catch', 'singl', 'day', 'number', 'mean', 'much', 'without', 'take', 'context', 'factor', 'persist', 'increas', 'number', 'exampl', 'today', 'case', 'right', 'next', 'day', 'got', 'case', 'widespread', 'commun', 'transmiss', 'wct', 'averag', 'number', 'period', 'time', 'use', 'determin', 'declar', 'wct', 'everi', 'day', 'get', 'case', 'number', 'drop', 'take', 'back', 'word', 'number', 'truli', 'unlink', 'case', 'ie', 'total', 'unlink', 'endless', 'amount', 'trace', 'look', 'initi', 'report', 'number', 'unlink', 'case', 'day', 'case', 'shown', 'exist', 'cluster', 'eventu', 'exampl', 'foreign', 'worker', 'dorm', 'exist', 'cluster', 'wct', 'situat', 'must', 'fulfil', 'criteria', 'persist', 'sustain', 'time', 'increas', 'number', 'especi', 'number', 'truli', 'unlink', 'case', 'consid', 'widespread', 'commun', 'transmiss', 'agre', 'number', 'worri', 'doubt', 'appl', 'appl', 'comparison', 'itali', 'contact', 'trace', 'effort', 'way', 'intens', 'start', 'earli', 'success', 'contain', 'thank', 'us', 'small', 'countri', 'detect', 'case', 'itali', 'could', 'among', 'significantli', 'undetect', 'case', 'compar', 'us', 'follow', 'itali', 'news', 'fulli', 'respons', 'measur', 'made', 'much', 'later', 'moment', 'daili', 'case', 'definit', 'differ', 'case', 'alreadi', 'measur', 'decid', 'readi', 'go', 'govt', 'predict', 'happen', 'therefor', 'measur', 'flatten', 'curv', 'earlier', 'time', 'compar']"

These may additionally include those who do not have family, are isolated in their tiny flat- which they inch closer to not being able to afford the expenses of as each day of the control order (""Circuit Breaker"") goes by.

So these people deal with more stress and anxiety every passing day as we speak.

But my biggest concern regarding this control order is actually a specific group of people; those suffering from mental illnesses. 

A large number of these people may seem like they're simply experiencing ""cabin fever"" at first glance but the reality is that they simply cannot be left alone physically for such a period of time. Their condition may prevent them from being able to perform their daily/essential tasks without assistance, likely causing significant detriment to their well-being.

Yes, the act allows a few exceptions that could apply here; such as in the event of an emergency. But, is preventing mental detriment an emergency? Or do we have to wait until they have a nervous breakdown (mental collapse) for their situation to be considered an emergency?
The act also allows visitation to care for the mentally disabled. Again, you now have to define who IS mentally disabled? Do you need a cognitive disorder? Does severe depression causing the above symptoms count as disabled?

Who can answer this? MOH. Will they? With the track record of Singapore and mental healthcare, especially with the removal of psychiatric services from the list of essential services, I doubt it. 

*An extension to the control order, especially one of significant length, would essentially be slowly killing these people.*",t3_g0c1dx,2020-04-21 07:37:23,Trynothingy,5,4,4,r/Singapore April COVID-19 and Circuit Breaker Discussion Vol II,t3_g0c1dx,113,g0c1dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g0c1dx/rsingapore_april_covid19_and_circuit_breaker/,299,2020-04-13 12:39:42,0.98,"['live', 'paychequ', 'paychequ', 'may', 'addit', 'includ', 'famili', 'isol', 'tini', 'inch', 'closer', 'abl', 'afford', 'expens', 'day', 'control', 'order', 'circuit', 'breaker', 'goe', 'peopl', 'deal', 'stress', 'anxieti', 'everi', 'pass', 'day', 'speak', 'biggest', 'concern', 'regard', 'control', 'order', 'actual', 'specif', 'group', 'peopl', 'suffer', 'mental', 'ill', 'larg', 'number', 'peopl', 'may', 'seem', 'like', 'simpli', 'experienc', 'cabin', 'fever', 'first', 'glanc', 'realiti', 'simpli', 'left', 'alon', 'physic', 'period', 'time', 'condit', 'may', 'prevent', 'abl', 'perform', 'task', 'without', 'assist', 'like', 'caus', 'signific', 'detriment', 'ye', 'act', 'allow', 'except', 'could', 'appli', 'event', 'emerg', 'prevent', 'mental', 'detriment', 'emerg', 'wait', 'nervou', 'breakdown', 'mental', 'collaps', 'situat', 'consid', 'emerg', 'act', 'also', 'allow', 'visit', 'care', 'mental', 'disabl', 'defin', 'mental', 'disabl', 'need', 'cognit', 'disord', 'sever', 'depress', 'caus', 'symptom', 'count', 'disabl', 'answer', 'moh', 'track', 'record', 'singapor', 'mental', 'healthcar', 'especi', 'remov', 'psychiatr', 'servic', 'list', 'essenti', 'servic', 'doubt', 'extens', 'control', 'order', 'especi', 'one', 'signific', 'length', 'would', 'essenti', 'slowli', 'kill', 'peopl']"

1448,1448,1448,fqtceb1,t3_ga9n0l,"\[Opinion\] Covid-19 exposes several problems/ weaknesses of every country. For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April. We converted places like [exhibition halls](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-more-than-18-000-bed-spaces-for-isolation-and-care-12683558) (Expo/ Changi Exhibition Centre) and army camps to cater to such needs.

Based on Covid-19's experience, we could expect new waves of it, or possibility of new diseases that might be equally or more contagious in the future (/slap wood). 

Thus, I was thinking that SG should consider building a fixed number of ""quarantine facilities"" in every town, like playgrounds/ parks etc in future towns (or added on to existing towns). It is similar to the idea of disaster shelters. Of course, in unused times, they could be used for other purposes, like those [shelters](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/home/civil-defence-shelter/types-of-shelter) in void decks.

Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

Been a bit sceptical about the decisions and statements by the joint ministerial committee - I don't agree with the partial lifting of controls when our numbers are still high, not convinced by the division of cases between FW-indorm , FW-outside dorm and Citizen/PR etc. But all these were opinions and I never had something objective to bring to the table. Until I came across this article about the testing rate in Singapore.

[Singapore has done over 143,000 Covid-19 tests](https://www.businessinsider.sg/singapore-has-done-over-143000-covid-19-tests-and-it-plans-to-increase-testing-capability-from-8000-to-40000-a-day), which reports:

>On Monday (May 4), Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong was reported by The Straits Times (ST) as saying that plans are underway to increase the nation’s testing capability from the current 8,000 a day to [40,000 a day](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/live-coverage-ministerial-statements-on-covid-19-situation-in-singapore) by late 2020.  
>  
>Singapore already has some of the highest testing rates in the world, he added.

I was able to find [some data](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) on testing rates around the world. err even if we account for incomplete data and anomalies like really small territories, Singapore ranks 37th out of 212 in tests per million as of today -0 less than Germany, Spain, Denmark, the UAE and Australia. But above HK, UK and US. (The data is apparently used by the Johns Hopkins CSSE and various govts so seems pretty trustworthy.)

Personally, I think Gan Kim Yong's statement makes it sound quite good when it's not that amazing. BUt I know I might be biased. Do you guys think 37th in the world, 8th in Asia can be considered ""some of the highest testing rates""?

I'm a bbt addict and super salty that they closed them as part of the CCB, they have been excluded in the last round of openings meant to reverse the CCB, AND they will still be excluded off the list of businesses allowed to open post 2nd June. 

If any of the ministers in the taskforce can provide an a posteri explanation how they arrived at their conclusion that all f&b takeaways are allowed except beverage stalls, I will quit drinking for good. What's the data behind the risk assessment that singled them out, beyond posing some annoyance to SDAs and making the news for a couple of isolated incidents? The business did not change fundamentally, so why are they still closed post CCB while a ""return to initial position"" has opened most businesses during that measure for closures?

Trivial and petty and salty I might be, but it bears worth to note that substitute bbt with any other business/service you care about, and you can see why while we should give credit where credit is due, we also shouldn't overlook some inconsistent and arbitrary aspects of the taskforce's decision making that deserves questioning.",t3_ga9n0l,2020-05-20 11:45:46,ridewiththerockers,2,5,5,r/Singapore April COVID-19 and Circuit Breaker Discussion Vol IV,t3_ga9n0l,57,ga9n0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ga9n0l/rsingapore_april_covid19_and_circuit_breaker/,116,2020-04-29 21:40:11,0.9,"['incid', 'lee', 'bee', 'hwa', 'hound', 'minist', 'taskforc', 'explan', 'tcm', 'shop', 'allow', 'reopen', 'clear', 'beyond', 'opaqu', 'decis', 'make', 'process', 'first', 'order', 'principl', 'guid', 'hand', 'part', 'decis', 'make', 'process', 'appear', 'complet', 'arbitrari', 'wo', 'abl', 'explain', 'beyond', 'reiter', 'vagu', 'principl', 'safe', 'distanc', 'commun', 'risk', 'bbt', 'addict', 'super', 'salti', 'close', 'part', 'ccb', 'exclud', 'last', 'round', 'open', 'meant', 'revers', 'ccb', 'still', 'exclud', 'list', 'busi', 'allow', 'open', 'post', 'june', 'minist', 'taskforc', 'provid', 'posteri', 'explan', 'arriv', 'conclus', 'f', 'b', 'takeaway', 'allow', 'except', 'beverag', 'stall', 'quit', 'drink', 'good', 'data', 'behind', 'risk', 'assess', 'singl', 'beyond', 'pose', 'annoy', 'sda', 'make', 'news', 'coupl', 'isol', 'incid', 'busi', 'chang', 'fundament', 'still', 'close', 'post', 'ccb', 'return', 'initi', 'posit', 'open', 'busi', 'measur', 'closur', 'trivial', 'petti', 'salti', 'might', 'bear', 'worth', 'note', 'substitut', 'bbt', 'care', 'see', 'give', 'credit', 'credit', 'due', 'also', 'overlook', 'inconsist', 'arbitrari', 'aspect', 'taskforc', 'decis', 'make', 'deserv', 'question']"

1498,1498,1498,fqwjr0m,t1_fqtceb1,"> For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April.

I think this is a global issue, not unique to Singapore, though I'd say it's a problem too. Wuhan had that two massive temporary hospitals. UK has NHS Nightingale (their equivalent of ""Expo hospital""). The world realised we are woefully unprepared/underprepared for a contagious pandemic.

> Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

The shelters thing might sound good, but even with a centralised location, we seem to have a manpower crunch in Expo (as seen by the article of a person who got sent there). What more if we start to decentralize quarantine facilities, you need to duplicate the manpower across Singapore and monitor more staff for unwanted spread (e.g. what if Kallang's quarantine center has an outbreak within their staff?). The more places you have, the more likely you could ""screw up"" the handling and accidentally spread it somewhere else.

I'd say that having Expo/Suntec/whatever equipped to be converted to quarantine facilities in a day/two should be our goal. Make it so that the fixed facilities/infrastructure (e.g. HVAC) is rated for quarantine use. I believe MOH has done this with things like the Community Quarantine Facilities (which is why quarantine was set up super fast).",t3_ga9n0l,2020-05-17 17:16:23,skatyboy,4,5,5,r/Singapore April COVID-19 and Circuit Breaker Discussion Vol IV,t3_ga9n0l,57,ga9n0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ga9n0l/rsingapore_april_covid19_and_circuit_breaker/,116,2020-04-29 21:40:11,0.9,"['singapor', 'one', 'lack', 'suffici', 'quarantin', 'facil', 'sudden', 'need', 'mani', 'peopl', 'quarantin', 'late', 'april', 'think', 'global', 'issu', 'uniqu', 'singapor', 'though', 'say', 'problem', 'wuhan', 'two', 'massiv', 'temporari', 'hospit', 'uk', 'nh', 'nightingal', 'equival', 'expo', 'hospit', 'world', 'realis', 'woefulli', 'contagi', 'pandem', 'decentr', 'shelter', 'might', 'also', 'help', 'case', 'unforeseen', 'circumst', 'put', 'egg', 'one', 'basket', 'might', 'easier', 'transit', 'plan', 'infect', 'control', 'region', 'peopl', 'hypothes', 'shelter', 'thing', 'might', 'sound', 'good', 'even', 'centralis', 'locat', 'seem', 'manpow', 'crunch', 'expo', 'seen', 'articl', 'person', 'got', 'sent', 'start', 'decentr', 'quarantin', 'facil', 'need', 'duplic', 'manpow', 'across', 'singapor', 'monitor', 'staff', 'unwant', 'spread', 'kallang', 'quarantin', 'center', 'outbreak', 'within', 'staff', 'place', 'like', 'could', 'screw', 'handl', 'accident', 'spread', 'somewher', 'els', 'say', 'equip', 'convert', 'quarantin', 'facil', 'goal', 'make', 'fix', 'hvac', 'rate', 'quarantin', 'use', 'believ', 'moh', 'done', 'thing', 'like', 'commun', 'quarantin', 'facil', 'quarantin', 'set', 'super', 'fast']"

One thing that I find is a silver lining in all these, is that the government has finally recognized the importance of mental health, and places the official hotlines and resources quite prominently in their messaging. I work in an industry where it's not civil service but on the periphery, and I can see that the government messaging is taken seriously and my managers are all imploring us to take wfh seriously but at the same time lightly, take care of our own needs, use available resources if we feel our mental health is suffering. 

I'm not sure how many of the isolated migrant workers have access to a counsellor or therapist, but I'd place that as quite a high priority to address after their lodging, food, healthcare and other basic logistics are settled. Anyone has any information if such resources are provided for them? They are particularly vulnerable if they can't speak english and thus tap onto official government resources so I think it's a valid concern. 

Beyond that, I feel that allowing interaction is super important, for people who don't live within the same household. Beyond the immediate family situation that is addressed by phase 1, one thing that could have helped is for dating couples to be allowed to visit each other. The risk is marginal; the spread will be within 2 households even if theres a positive contact, the contact is easily traced (tracetogether, or log the visit to a special portal etc). With data analytics it's not impossible to quickly capture the source/destination, spatial and time dimension and mitigate the risk of an untraceable outbreak because the virus spread between households like STDs in a college campus.",t3_ga9n0l,2020-05-20 11:57:46,ridewiththerockers,1,5,5,r/Singapore April COVID-19 and Circuit Breaker Discussion Vol IV,t3_ga9n0l,57,ga9n0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ga9n0l/rsingapore_april_covid19_and_circuit_breaker/,116,2020-04-29 21:40:11,0.9,"['beat', 'take', 'away', 'bubbl', 'tea', 'mcdonner', 'close', 'favourit', 'restaur', 'bar', 'deni', 'much', 'need', 'groom', 'person', 'health', 'servic', 'one', 'thing', 'find', 'silver', 'line', 'govern', 'final', 'recogn', 'import', 'mental', 'health', 'place', 'offici', 'hotlin', 'resourc', 'quit', 'promin', 'messag', 'work', 'industri', 'civil', 'servic', 'peripheri', 'see', 'govern', 'messag', 'taken', 'serious', 'manag', 'implor', 'us', 'take', 'wfh', 'serious', 'time', 'lightli', 'take', 'care', 'need', 'use', 'avail', 'resourc', 'feel', 'mental', 'health', 'suffer', 'sure', 'mani', 'isol', 'migrant', 'worker', 'access', 'counsellor', 'therapist', 'place', 'quit', 'high', 'prioriti', 'address', 'lodg', 'food', 'healthcar', 'basic', 'logist', 'settl', 'anyon', 'inform', 'resourc', 'provid', 'particularli', 'vulner', 'ca', 'speak', 'english', 'thu', 'tap', 'onto', 'offici', 'govern', 'resourc', 'think', 'valid', 'concern', 'beyond', 'feel', 'allow', 'interact', 'super', 'import', 'peopl', 'live', 'within', 'household', 'beyond', 'immedi', 'famili', 'situat', 'address', 'phase', 'one', 'thing', 'could', 'help', 'date', 'coupl', 'allow', 'visit', 'risk', 'margin', 'spread', 'within', 'household', 'even', 'there', 'posit', 'contact', 'contact', 'easili', 'trace', 'tracetogeth', 'log', 'visit', 'special', 'portal', 'etc', 'data', 'analyt', 'imposs', 'quickli', 'captur', 'spatial', 'time', 'dimens', 'mitig', 'risk', 'untrac', 'outbreak', 'viru', 'spread', 'household', 'like', 'std', 'colleg', 'campu']"

Hi all. Throwaway for personal reasons. Some back story is, I took leave of absence in 2019 for the entire year of 2020 (tldr: not doing well in school, want to switch fields so decided to take year off to work in another unrelated field) in order to work and get some experience while trying to improve my mental health.

So what happened was, managed to get several offers amongst several applications, but chose a reputable one because it will help my resume greatly. But the downside was said company needed me to 'intern' for a few months since I had no prior proper professional experience. So I said OK. It was supposed to be only till end of Feb. And then I will receive a more permanent contract.

Then covid happened. Some projects were halted, office decided to close and work from home. It became way more unstable. Boss told me he can't promise the offer anymore, but would like me to stay indefinitely and at first opportunity, I can and will be contracted. 

I stayed because I didn't have anywhere else to go, and I really liked the culture and the people there. They really treat me well over there. But alas, fast forward to today, he broke the news to me that I sadly have to go. It wasn't because of job performance, I wasn't the first to go, there were a few full time staff that were let go last month. Didn't expect myself to be asked to leave too, since just a week ago I was involved in a huge project. But it's out of my hands. 

My question is, given my circumstances, am I eligible to apply for the several government grants due to the loss of this internship? Im still on leave of absence from NTU to end of year. The allowance was already very low before being asked to leave. and I'm just in a funk right now. Uncertain about the future. I have also bills to pay and some liabilities on hand like my school tuition fees.

Would appreciate some word of advice from those who can relate or are going through the same thing.
