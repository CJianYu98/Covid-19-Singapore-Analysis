What a feast this Makan for 4 ($108) was! The 22-spiced kurobuta pork was really enjoyable while the Barramundi, which had been marinated for 2 days in a salted egg blend was crispy on the outside and so flaky inside.

The GG Garden Curry is like no curry I've ever eaten. It's a mish mash of freshly harvested greens from Gastrogig's garden, such as green papaya, tapioca leaves, eggplant, lady's finger. Refreshingly good!And as you know, fresh veggies from home grown gardens is something that’s close to my heart.

说是这么多蛋糕中 我做的最好吃😋
嗯哼....😑 他赞的原因是
因为这蛋糕的糖份量有100g (个人认为有点甜）
Vanilla Essence 放比較多 (剩不多就全倒完进去）
他嫌我之前做的蛋糕都减少糖份量 
味道不夠甜 这次照足食谱的糖份量 
夠甜对他的味蕾 所以才会大力赞 🙄 还跳起舞...
要求再做给他吃～去附近的超市买Cream Cheese...

So I baked some frozen fish fillets, cooked a packet of Korean Ramyun and fried them with the remaining Yakiudon sauce in the fridge. Then I recreated them into a curly hair cute Yaki Ramyun girl holding a fish fillet. I think this presentation looks cute especially with the ❤️ chilli sauce! 🥰 So it was a cute afternoon with a cute brunch. I’m also humbled by all the compliments received for the Squeaky painting!

May be an image of one or more people, hair and text that says 'IM NOT COMFORTABLE IN MY OWN BODY STORY TIME. ABOUT ME Read Caption Register now! #Nomorelater @healthyjourneynisa'.","Hey.. this is about me. 

Once upon a time, i used to give up on myself and be like ""ah whatever, gemok pun gemok lah, yang penting happy! Biar la apa orang nak kata"" 

I was in denial. I didnt see the bigger picture. I didnt see that everything has its cause and effect.

One day, i saw someone walking, and she looks so .. tired, carrying the weight of her own body. She was bigger than me and at that point of time i kept growing and growing. Becoming fatter each day.  That hit me, but, still ... i did not feel like i need to change. Still in denial. I tell myself ""its ok, im happy"" when deep down inside, IM NOT. 

I went shopping..  i will usually NOT browse thru clothing outside cause i know i cant fit in anything and i follow this online plus size shop to order clothe for raya, work and even ... SLEEPWEAR! 

I was so disappointed when at one point of time i realise i cant buy baju lawa2 and look nice in it. Sometimes the plus size baju pun doesnt fit me nicely. Stress? Yes ... that's where i decided to change. 

Im progressing. I really cant wait for the day i finally reach my ideal weight! 

So lets do this !!!

May be an image of one or more people and people standing.,"Earlier last month, we spoke about text neck as a painful result of additional stresses on the neck and upper back. 

What you may not know is that it will lead to your body adopting a permanent flat back posture, which may eventually lead to a higher chance of having a more serious medical condition such as whiplash.

To avoid the occurence of this from happening, remember to maintain a good body posture, taking eye breaks from your devices and doing simple stretches or head rotation to relieve your muscles.",Re:chiro Singapore,21,1

May be an image of food.","Attempted making Naan for the first time 😂 Need lots of improvement for sure and yes, it is better to use one that requires fermentation. This recipe is a quick naan that does not use yeast and requires only dough resting of 30 mins (Usual naan requires yeast and proofing of 2-3hours at least). The lucky thing is, thank god there’s air pockets. ❤️ @jimborange loves Butter Chicken a lot but I was not that confident enough to do it so I tested Tesco’s butter chicken instead. Taste wise not too bad but would be great if there’s more spices and less creamy. Probably will try making my own butter chicken next time 🍛 #whaticook #whatimade #homecook #homemade #homebaked #sghomebaker #naan #quicknaan #butterchicken #stayhome #circuitbreakersg #橘子麻麻的廚房 #自己做 #自己煮 #烘培 #印度烤餅 #印度奶油雞 #煮婦人生 #防疫 #隔離生活",,20,1

.
.
Nowadays, hubby has to go to office thrice a week only...hence a lot of time he spends with Samaira. I am happy that things are getting better here in #Singapore, not sure how this 3rd phase is going to function, but I am already feeling the heat.🤭 Honestly, even I am going to feel the separation anxiety...he being at home is such a help in so many ways. Absolutely love how he quickly squeeze in between breaks and grace our precious moments with his presence...the jokes, epic one- liners, or bringing Samaira from school or helping me with lunch...all that small little contributions he makes throughout the day counts for so much. I will surely be missing our time break cuddling moments during the day😊😊😊
.
.
When we casually told Samaira about this, she was all out there convincing her father that she won’t disturb him or bang the door as he takes his conference calls...she will be a “Darling Baby” and will daily give 100 kisses to Papa😊❤️. I was overwhelmed and got emotional at her innocent antics. 
.
.
Truly, the only silver lining we had during this #lockdown was being able to spend a lot of bonding time together as a family. Grateful as ever🙏🏻😊

What’s the scene at your place? How is it like husbands and wives being at home together 24*7?

Weekend vibes are always fun and relaxing. So relaxing that I tend to take my own sweet time in preparing my brunches and they ended up as tea break? 😅 Today I decided to pair some yummy Jenny’s cookies (from Hong Kong) with Philadelphia oreo cheesecake. Had wanted to recreate them into a cone ice cream but somehow along the way, it became a cute little bird? Pigeon?

——————————————————————
#SGGIGexclusivegiveaways

I love face masks that give instant results in just one use because they are especially useful for a last minute face pampering session if you have a photoshoot/event/gathering the very next day. This Tag Skin Eldelweiss Organic Extract Mask from Taiwan that is distributed by @_skinethics_ is one of those masks that provide results in 1 usage👍🏼

The patented Edelweiss (AKA the famous flower in Alps) has strong self-repairing and whitening ability. There is also an added non-invasive simulated botox factor, which are small molecules that are fast-absorbing and can penetrate into the skin and stimulate collagen and hyaluronic acid. This helps in firming and lifting, enhancing the elasticity of the skin, improving pimples condition and decreasing ageing wrinkles. The mask also provides long-lasting moisture and is anti-oxidation. On first application, there is a slight numbing/tingling sensation, which is normal due to the simulated botox factor. The end result is a radiant and plumped skin! 😍 
Btw, this mask is made of 95% natural ingredients and 10% organic ingredients. It is also SGS Certified!🌿 Want to try one for yourself?

I’ve used up more than half a bottle by now and it’s been pretty amazing at improving my skin’s tone and texture. 

I was just introducing this product to my friend the other day and she reacted when she heard the word “Acid”.

While it is an exfoliating toner, I personally feel that it is gentle to the skin and does not cause any break out to my skin. Also, with diligent and careful use, your skin will also built up its tolerance and you can eventually use it on a daily basis. 

I’ve also just looked up on @deciem website to find out that the formula also contacts an ingredient (Tasmanian Pepperberry) that helps to reduce irritation associated with acid use - an ideal “acid” toner for people who are new to exfoliating toners! 

I still really miss Krave’s Kale-Lalu-yAHA, but this is wayyyy more cost efficient😅

ageLOC LumiSpa is the first-of-its-kind, dual-action skin care system that gently--yet deeply--cleanses and revives skin appearance in just one treatment, making it feel softer and smoother. Invented by Nu Skin and dermatologist-tested, LumiSpa is inspired by studies on skin protein production. The ageLOC LumiSpa system has three key features:

1. The device — a rechargeable handheld device that simultaneously treats and cleanses the face, when used with the specially formulated cleansers.

Lumispa treatment heads (firm and normal) Non-abrasive silicone surfaces contain antimicrobial silver.

2. Treatment heads — choose between Normal and Firm treatment heads, which have non-abrasive silicone surfaces containing antimicrobial silver, making them more hygienic than most competitor products.

LumiSpa cleansers: Four treatment cleanser options, each designed for different skin types (sensitive, dry, normal, & oily).

3. Treatment cleansers — there are four treatment cleanser options for ageLOC LumiSpa, each designed for different skin types: dry, normal/combination, oily, and sensitive skin. This means that you can use the LumiSpa in whichever way works best for you and your skin.

LumiSpa is gentle enough for twice-daily use. For optimal results, use it for two minutes, as your cleansing step, both norning and night. Check out more ageLOC LumiSpa benefits by visiting the product information page.

Our beef garum is thoughtfully sourced, carefully served and has undergone 6 long weeks of fermentation under controlled humidity and temperature, after mixing with crumbled Koji rice, salt and water. A mind bending idea on food and definitely unconventional!

It certainly makes my day to know that my foodart brings a smile to you, especially during challenging times.

We are down to our last 6 operating days at Amoy Street Food Centre and having mixed feelings about the move. We will really miss being a hawker! The experience it brings is like none other.

On the other hand, we are super excited to announce that we have secured a food kiosk at Great World (yaaaas!🙌). We target to open in mid October 2020 and will be bringing new items to the menu. 

Of course, with the new location being in a shopping mall, we will unfortunately have to adjust the pricing accordingly. We'll try our best to keep the adjustment as little as we can manage as we are also enhancing our menu to bring you a wider variety of items. 

Thank you once again for your support during these 2.5yrs! We wouldn't have made it this far without you (YES YOU! 🥰). Hope to see you at Great World!

Fathi being Fathi, he also tried to reach out to more members after the call ended.

My thoughts: 
He and Hajjar are in the midst of raising their kid,
Sures is working hard towards building a family of his own,
Ridwan is well-known in the scene for his speed and technicality and me on the other hand ain’t no audio engineer/video editor.
None of us used proper mics for this recording but we still gathered (virtually) to do this out of fun. 
Very special indeed. 
Hope you can spend 4mins to give it a listen as you call it a night. Enjoy!

May be an image of fruit.","Fruits are good for our skin and hair, but the humble Orange is a phenomenal fruit as it’s full of ingredients that will help to boost your complexion!

Eating one orange a day or drinking a delicious tangy glass of fresh squeezed orange juice may aid weight loss, boost your immune system, and produce healthier skin. Oranges are rich in calcium, fibre and vitamin C and are low in calories, so they really are a wonderful start to your day.

Oranges are a vibrant and refreshing fruit rich in natural oils and vitamins. They have been used for years as ingredients in recipes, but recently they are being recognised for their beauty enhancing qualities. The benefits of orange for your skin are extensive, making it perfect to use in every aspect of our daily beauty regimes, as the natural properties may improve the look and feel of our skin. There is no need to throw away the orange peel either, it’s perfect for creating face masks and body scrubs, drawing out all the impurities leaving a beautiful healthy glow.

Most of us have dreamboard, vision board etc

And sometimes we ask : when will it happen?
Esp when the process is tough challenging even painful

Now
Change your question
Change your mindset
Transform your life

How?
The question : when will it happen
From future to present continuous tense
From a question to a statement

ITS ALL HAPPENING
MIRACLE IS HERE AND NOW
MAGIC IS A STATE OF BEING

YES
WE ARE ALL MAGICIAN
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW  IS
STUNNING N MAGICAL

REJOICE

I was living in a dark small room when I
Had a vision of living by the sea
Working hard everyday passing out flyers
Long hours doing what I learnt
Everyday nothing much happens
Sometimes nothing happens
I kept my vision belief
do my works with love and joy
trusting the process
Now All my vision and dreams are manifested

Yes my dear
Trust the process
Connect with your Abundant higher self
God is with you
Everything is possible💖

Although our fitness dropped since #circuitbreakersg, we didn't want to dissappoint our sponsors (@crumblyjas @zavteh @heymrsjchua @sundowner78 @de1p) who had so kindly donated to the cause for @sgchildrensoc. 

After much deliberation, my partner @tiffy_ng88 and I (together with @kelsomini & @katkattv) decided to do the online version of the challenge.

One of our key consideration, however, was safe distancing and we decided to do an online submission instead. 

On the 4th Oct, we will be performing the challenge at @fitnessbravo who has so kindly lent us a space and slot to contribute to this.

If you would still  like to sponsor Team Tiff-sie (Tipsy) please HMU!",,39,1

Today I decided to try my hand on another branded toast - Fendi Toast! It’s looks simple with just rows of F but actually it’s so challenging to keep them aligned with the right spacing and sizing. I also took in-progress shots just in case I lost concentration and jeopardized the pattern. Spent an awfully long time completing this and the end results is quite gratifying, despite a really late brunch and feeling quite drained. 🤪 I might start a new series of “branded toast” soon to make my brunch more atas. Looking forward to midweek soon! 🌻

Yes guys!!! It's the one that we all saw on The King: Eternal Monarch and it costs $2,600+.

This is the @cellreturn.asia LED Mask. It uses light therapy to help treat a whole array of skin problems.

*𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗿𝗲𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻?*

𝟭. 𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲

There are many LED masks out there but @cellreturn.asia Platinum LED mask has 1,026 LED lights, way more than other LED masks in the market. Having more lights means it offers more coverage (all the way to the sides of your face and your entire neck) and better overall performance. You really get what you pay for.

𝟮. 𝗜𝘁'𝘀 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗹𝘆 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲

There are not 1 but 4 usage modes:

1. Red Mode: Improves skin elasticity and collagen production, as well as brighten the skin while minimising blemishes. 

2. Blue Mode: Soothes aggravated/irritated skin, esp. if you are prone to acne.

3. Pink Mode: Calms down problematic skin and reduces the appearance of blemishes.

4. FAST Mode: Only 9 mins and gives you a great mix of modes 1 to 3 for a quick pampering session.

𝟯. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲

I use most of the red mode and it really makes my complexion visibly brighter and smoother. It just looks so glowly. It must have successfully stimulated collagen production. A lot of facial places use this as part of their treatment. Just imagine the benefits I get from doing it at home whenever I want!

If you are not familiar with buckwheat, it’s a type of grain that’s gluten free and has myriad of health benefits which include an impressive high protein and high mineral profile (magnesium, manganese, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, and calcium). Buckwheat also aids in anti inflammatory support, increases satiety, moderates blood sugar levels and helps digestive symptoms in those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity! 

It’s a super grain if you ask me, you just might need to get used to it’s nutty flavour profile! 🤗

I always have the “good things must share” mindset (which was why I started blogging anyways) & I just wanna shout out loud to the world that I’VE FOUND THE BEST TOILET/TISSUE PAPER ever 😝😍
I’ve converted to using Vinda Toilet/Tissue paper since #circuitbreakersg & got them from their official store on @Lazada_Sg 💙

It not only it saves me time by making my orders online, I also don’t have to be lugging toilet and tissue papers home from the supermarket AND AND AND the quality of the papers are just superb okay 😍😍
They are unlike those rough kinds that are so uncomfy to use 😳🚽 

Anyways, I’m giving away a gift/experience pack to 5 lucky winners respectively (swipe to see the “unboxing” video) to prove my point 😝 and all you have to do is :
1️⃣ Like this photo
2️⃣ Follow me @Aggylow
3️⃣ Follow Vinda’s Official Store on Lazada : https://s.lazada.sg/s.F4bW
4️⃣ Tag as many friends as you want to share about this - one comment per tag! (More entries = more chances of winning!)
*Contest closes in a week
**Only opens to those residing in SG

Good luck 💕

Listen for a beautiful sound, speak a kind word to some person, and do something nice for someone without their knowledge. 🍀 Life is beautiful with my favourite Tim Tams recreated into a Rubik’s Cube; listening to favourite Fm933, having a kind neighbour who made an effort to return my masks which were delivered to her, watching sweet live broadcast of my pretty cousin’s ROM, admiring the nice blue sky from my sofa and the list goes on and on. Shall find more stuff to indulge over the weekend. Happy Saturday folks! 🌈🌈🌈

It’s hard to stay motivated for long periods of time. Often anger, breakups and heartbreak are used to ignite change, but you need a long term internal motivator to make sure that you continue to stay healthy and strong and crest positive life habits.

May be an image of 3 people, hair and text that says 'THE NYONYA SISTERS Do You Know Your Skin Type?'.","The first step in creating a personalized skin care routine is knowing your skin type. Your skin type helps you select products that are tailored for what your skin needs. Here are some key indicators of each skin type:

Normal: Normal skin is generally balanced—not too dry or oily throughout the day.

Combination: Combination skin is described by having some areas of skin that are normal (or dry) and others that are oily (typically in the T-zone, which includes your nose and forehead).

Oily: Oily skin is generally characterized by shiny skin. Excess oil usually makes skin more prone to breakouts and blemishes.

Dry: Dry skin is easy to identify as it’s visibly noticeable. Dry skin can look flaky and generally feels tight and uncomfortable.

Sensitive: Sensitive skin is prone to dryness, itching, and redness. If you notice your skin is often irritated by skin care products or changes in weather, you may have sensitive skin.

It’s the case for everyone you’d say, but the fact is that I have since the beginning of the year kept my training blocks like if it was a normal season, which make the thing now quite hard mentally when I’m about to cross this week the 3,000 kilometres ran in 2020. Not speaking of the discipline required. With the cancellation of Valencia marathon, I’m now trying to figure out other options in Europe early December, and to be honest even though I’m try harding, I think it’s really fucked up for good. ☠️🔫

It turns out that there’s a lot to know about selecting and buying the best one. “Extra virgin” is the highest designation of quality given to olive oil.⁠
⁠
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is the juice obtained by crushing freshly picked olives during the first pressing of the fruit. This process must be 100% mechanically pressed or crushed, with no added heat or chemicals. This results in the purest, least acidic as well as the best-tasting oil. ⁠
⁠
Quality can still vary within the extra virgin category but it is a gauge of top purity and quality as compared to other olive oils. Look for those four words, and you've already sussed out the best olive oils in the market.⁠

Dedicating this post to my mother-in-law’s new found hobby!

J1 has been wearing all the masks handmade by my dear mother-in-law. She started making masks for J1 when she knew J1 is returning to school after #circuitbreakersg .

She tried many different designs in search of a comfortable one for her beloved grand daughter. And it soon turned into a hobby for her. She finally found a design that she finds most comfy and started making some for our relatives.

After receiving many positive feedbacks of her masks, my mother-in-law decided to start making some to sell.

It takes her about an hour to make each mask. That is because each layer of fabric is individually measured, meticulously cut and sewn together.

Her mask comes in 3 layers with a slot for filter, adjustable ear loops and removable nose strip.

Please show her some support @gransewlove ! ❤️❤️

Another throwback to Pastry Box V2 from @lematin.sg.

Besides the familiar kouign aman and canele, we were in for a real treat with the hay-smoked cruffin with lemon verbena meringue (top right), seaweed tartlava with pistachio frangipane, candied kombu and orange blossom (bottom left), and chocolate brioche stuffed with dulce de leche and lacto-fermented cherries (bottom right).

Imaginative. Delicious.

Yup, I’m guilty of camping out in front of my computer screen with my fingers ready to place the order for the pastry box drop at 4pm sharp one Sunday.

Clockwise from top left - smoked cruffin with eucalyptus meringue, lacto-plum galette, canele infused with vanilla, lemon and cardamom, kouign aman, and pistachio escargot with rose-scented cranberries.

Every pastry was perfection. Each mouthful was decadent.

It’s really challenging trying to paint and align the Gucci GG motif that I had to redo a second toast because... painting this GG pattern requires some strategized planning. 🤣Tried my best and I think the final product looks ok lah! At least I get to practice on painting patterns. 😉The day continued with not-so-good entertainment news (r.i.p Alien Huang😔) and multiple work challenges. Still, it’s considered an Ok day.

ACTIVITY 💡: C for Cockroach

Skip this post if you dislike these creatures 😅 This unit study was requested by the kids way before the #circuitbreakersg began, and I had procrastinated till now to post this 🤣 I decided to overcome my own phobia by creating a Madagascar hissing cockroach puzzle!

We learnt about cockroaches through:
🔄 its life cycle,
🧠 its anatomy with a printable by KidsKonnect,
🀄️ writing practice for the older boys,
📺 watching a read-aloud on YouTube: The Little Cockroach by Susie Violet
📖 reading a few library gems - 讨厌的居住者：有关蟑螂 is a hilarious read!

FUN FACTS
🟤 Cockroaches have been around for at least 300 million years, and can be found everywhere in the world except Antarctica.
🟤 Cockroaches have very small heads. What we see as heads are actually pronotums, the first segment of the thorax.
🟤 There are as many species of cockroaches as there are of mammals. About 30 out of the almost 5000 species of cockroaches are considered pests.

The Madagascar hissing cockroach is quite an intriguing cockroach, having spiracles at its sides to hiss during mate seeking and fights. The kids enjoyed the puzzle, and I enjoyed creating it. Win win ✌🏻

5/10 Dessertination 🖐🏾
Covid19 can’t stop me from traveling - 5th country in Key2krumbs dessert tour. 
.
.
Tiramisu is a coffee flavoured Italian no-bake dessert. It is made out of lady finger cookies dipped in espresso, layered with whipped mascarpone cheese 🧀 , eggs 🥚 , rum 🥃, sugar and cream mixture. 
.
.
As I didn’t have rum in hand, I just replaced it with Vanilla Essence to taste. #workwithwhatyougot 
.
.
This was my absolute favourite. I literally ate about 1/4th of the big tray swipe ➡️ and an individual jar. 😋 #momentonthelipsforeveronthehips 
This dessert came out really well, the consistency was not up to the mark but it held its shape when cut. It definitely will be my go to dessert for a party 🥳 🎉 🎈or gatherings.

May be an image of one or more people and text that says 'Advice ofthe Week How to open your heart to others'.,"Being vulnerable, opening your heart, being able to accept/give love - these are all important pillars of healthy platonic and romantic relationships. However, they are also incredibly difficult to achieve: the moment you open your heart to another individual, you are giving them the power to hurt you.

For most of us, this is a terrifying prospect. Whether we want to be in full control of ourselves or troubled by past relationships, giving someone that power makes us feel increasingly uncomfortable, to the point where we might even shy away from a relationship as it gets more serious. So what can we do to diminish this fear? 

It is important to understand that the moment we give up on pursuing a relationship, we give up on all the beautiful memories we could have made with that person. And yes, this would successfully avoid any hurt, but at a very costly expense. We do not intend to undermine emotional pain, but rather refocus our view towards the positive side of the story, that we often don’t get to see when we sever a relationship. 

At the end of the day, we cannot control what another person will do. We can instead decide what we will do with that experience. Here at Kopi Date, we advise you to transform emotional suffering into growth and wisdom, instead of giving it the power to further hinder your social life.",Singapore,18,1

May be an image of hot pot.","A perfect rainy day (and maybe every day) meal for the recent weather we’ve been having in SG! Nan Hwa Chong Restaurant is a popular fish steamboat hangout for the locals. Located at the corner of Jalan Sultan and North Bridge road, they offer airconditioned and non-airconditioned seating - expect a queue during peak hours on most days. 
Popular for a good reason, this restaurant is famous for its fish steamboat. With a selection of fish, we settled for the snapper. Depending on the size you order, there is a generous portion of fish, along with tang-oh, seaweed, yam, and the most important dried-salted fish among other steamboat essentials. The result is a super flavorful soup heated by traditional charcoal. 
The sides we ordered this round included stir-fried baby kai lan which had the ever sought-after “wok hei” taste. Also cooked well, were stuffed you tiaos as a crispy snack paired with mayo, and a slightly disappointing home-made tofu that though cooked well, tasted a bit like fried fishcake. A must order while you’re here though, is the crispy har cheong gai. The shrimp-paste flavor packs a good punch while the crunch and tenderness of the wings make a satisfying combination in your mouth. 
Though the service here can be a bit rough around the edges a la typical Chinese-shouty style, the staff here are efficient with orders, your needs for chili, and topping up the refillable soup! The ambience is pretty much a no-frills coffee shop. 
This is one of our go-to fish steamboat restaurants when we’re in the area, so we would recommend coming for their good quality food and reasonable prices. Refillable soup was such a perk for a rainy day! Do remember to add additional yam into your soup!

May be an image of food.","So good to meet these colleagues again for the first time since the start of #circuitbreakersg! 

Rather cathartic to discuss pressing issues and shared worries, the stresses of our office lives that can really only be understood by coworkers - the incompetence of some, the unsavouriness of others, the uncertainty as HR prepares for a third round of retrenchment, memories of our fellow-sufferer who committed suicide after a US concall last year, blaming the “toxic work culture” in his suicide note.

☠️ ☠️ ☠️ 

As 🐈 and I ended our studies on the #wisdomliterature of #Hosea, we were reminded that #sin isn’t merely a legal offence to God. Fundamentally, it is a relational offence against God.

Yeah, it’s somewhat about not obeying certain laws. But the underlying issue in such disobedience  is our refusal to trust that certain God who made those laws, a stubborn rejection of what He says of the reality He created.

Such temptation to sin isn’t just in times of feasting and drinking and dancing, but also in times of darkness and distress.

In our despair, we must not sin - neither by relying on ourselves, nor placing our hopes in other humans (however seemingly powerful) or political intrigue/alliances, nor in #idols of our own creation. 

Instead, we must turn to the only person in the entire universe who *can* do anything about the fallen state of the world (of which our distress is a small subset) and who is more than willing to do it - #ourFather (#Luke11) who created the universe and sustains it.

And so we #repent of such sin by instead giving #glorytoGod through our utter and complete dependence on Him.*

*for the avoidance of doubt, this doesn’t mean the fallacious attitude of #letgoandletgod, since God works in both normal cause-and-effect (eg, science) and abnormal miracles.

And the day goes by and by. We should all be smiling. Not stuck in an office filing. 🍀 Many of us are workaholics but it’s important to try and manage a work-life balance to prevent job burnout. Self-care is not selfish. 🥰 Had intended to go Coffee Bean Cafe today but the heavy rain kept me in. So, as usual, I try to create my home-cafe with oven-baked gardenia garlic bread, scrambled eggs (wanted to try Gordon Ramsay’s style but gave up) and Philadelphia oreo cheese cake. I’m not a super cheesecake fan but an occasional slice is 🤩. All paired with instant mocha Starbucks. Nice brunch. Nice weather. Gonna end the relaxing weather with some reading. 🥰 Enjoy your Sunday! 🌈🌈🌈

May be an image of chow mein and text that says 'SEAFODD SEAFOOD BEEHOON'.","•RECIPE•  A pot of beehoon is the easiest to prepare to feed the whole family. This is a very simple version yet very rich flavour pot of beehoon. The taste is similar to the white beehoon outside just that it is the drier version. The key to this is the beehoon ===============================================
INGREDIENTS:
• 1/2 pack beehoon (presoaked in  tap water for 30minutes)
• Clams
• Pork Lard (optional) 
• 6 prawns
• 1 squid, cut into rings
• 3 eggs
• 500ml chicken broth
• 1 tbsp sesame oil
• 1 tsp soy sauce
• 1 tsp minced garlic

METHOD:
1) Heat oil till it's smoky. Add in beehoon and pan fry till noodle is slightly charred and turn over. Remove from pan. It is OK if the noodles look a little dry. I purposely make it dry to soak up the broth later on. 
2) In the same pan, pan fry the seafood for 30s till about 70% cooked. Remove. 
3) Add in some oil. Add the eggs and scramble till about half cooked. Push it aside. 
4) Add in minced garlic and minced dried shrimps and fry till fragrant. 
5) Add in boiling water/ chicken broth and condiments. Heat over high heat and let it simmer for a few minutes. 
6) Add in the beehoon, clams and seafood. Cover and simmer over low heat.
7) Stir occasionally till noodle is dry. Serve hot with sambal chili. ============================================================ #oldschool #seafood #clans #noodles #30minutesrecipe #30minutemeals #instadinner #instafood #seafoodbeehoon #simple #sgig #sgrecipes #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodstep #instagfoodsg #singaporehomecooks #homecookedmeals #whati8today #instagfoodsg #家常便饭 #sgfoodlover #onepotmeal #comfortfoods #circuitbreakersg",,30,0

The journey to achieving great things is long but can be made sweeter and more bearable by admiring the little things along the way. 🌻 It’s TGIF again and it’s Macdonalds day! Now, I kinda look forward to Friday because of the pancake painting. 🥰Eversince the launch of minion toys, breakfast deliveries are taking a longer time. I heard the demand for the minion toys is huge so I decided to grab 1 too! 😬 Today’s pancake painting is also Minion! My nephew used to love minion when he was younger and yellow become one of his favourite colours. 🤣 ❤️❤️❤️ Now that I’m full, it’s time to head to office soon in my cute floral Hello Kitty mask!

By Audrey Chia & Marcus Ang
@publiclibrarysg Junior Lending ANG

Pre-Covid period, my kids have many hours of outdoor play. In 2019, we were even trying to hit 1000 outdoor hours. But come 2020, everything changed. During #circuitbreakersg we stayed at home totally with exception of getting a haircut before school reopen, a compulsory swab test before work resume and collection of masks for the family. I hope my kids' eyesight do not deterioriate further with this reduction of outdoor play. We will slowly resume normalcy. 

A good read especially if the kids are reluctant to return to outdoors after being 宅 for too long.

Just because my niece took a photo of the Japanese restaurant’s backdrop painting and exclaimed that she has found something for me to paint. And, she has been following up with me daily: have you painted the Samurai in the restaurant? So with her encouragement, I did it! Yeah! A short research revealed that the Menya Musashi Restaurant 麺屋武蔵 was named after a famous Samurai in Japan - Miyamoto Musashi 宮本武蔵。Miyamoto Musashi was renowned for his unique double-bladed swordsmanship and was considered a Kensei, a sword-saint of Japan.

Today, we are saddened to announce that despite the fighting through COVID-19, it has gotten the best of us. CBD is still quiet, our lunch crowd is barely around and we can no longer sustain. We have come to a decision to cease operations at Amoy Street Food Centre, with our last day being 30 Sep 2020. We would like to thank our regulars and supporters over the years - we would not have come so far without you guys. It was a plunge that we took to become a hawker back then and we have absolutely no regrets. We are truly blessed to have met amazing people along the way, especially our hawker neighbours. Never have we imagined making such good friends with them. It has been a valuable experience and it will not be wasted as we are not closing the brand for good, but rather moving to another location. We'll keep you updated when the time comes. Meanwhile, do find us at Amoy Street Food Centre 02-120 before 30 Sep!

After these pieces were done, I felt really sad. Now that I'm looking at this clip again, the mood hits. It's as if I got bright back to the few days before circuit breaker.
I didn't know how long the circuit breaker was going to last and I really enjoyed working with clay. The only activity that allows me to find peace will have to be put on hold for the next 2.5 months.
Truth be told, when I returned to practice, I found it difficult to even center the clay on the wheel. Thus, I spent 4 practice sessions, each 2 hours long just practicing centering and pulling cylinders. To me, it's not important I wasn't making any pieces to keep. What's more important was to get my fundamental skills right.

A new kind of pollution has been discovered and soon we could run the risk of having 'more masks than jellyfish' in our oceans says Lauren Lombard of Opération Mer Propre. ⁣⁠
⁣⁠
All these single-use PPE masks have already reached our ocean, showing us just how fast plastic can pollute our waters. ⁠

Switching your single-use mask to a re-usable, washable alternative can really make a difference to our planet, let's save our mother nature together!⁠

Gardening has been something that has really given me much joy. Even though many plants keel over or die a slow death, there are still enough gems to keep me going.
.
So far, I think I’m just about breaking even because I spend a lot on organic soil and compost, in addition to biodegradable pots, but I continue with this not just because of any potential savings, but because I love the idea that I’m making something out of “nothing”. 
.
So here’s a post finally on the permanent space. Check out my saved instastories highlights for all my gardening trials and triumphs.

Was kind of intimidated by the weight and the effort involved because up to that point in time, I eat mostly working with 0.5 kg of clay mostly. What you see here is after several attempts of throwing with 1 kg of clay and this is the most decent outcome. 
I kinda of like the colour combination of glazes for the end product. Again, I think the plant completes the look of the pot! 🤣🤣🤣

The journey was alot of “no, thank yous(this is a big challenge for me cause i usually say yes, oh wait no no no, i’ll usually just open my mouth when it comes haha) and well a handful of expected not-so-nice comments which for a softie like me, it sometimes hurts.(sis emosi but sis learn to control emosi 😂)
.
Also There’s a saying:
""Hunger is the first element of self-discipline. If you can control what you eat and drink, you can control everything else."" — Shaykh Dr. Umar Faruq Abd-Allah
.
YOUR MIND HAS THE ABILITY TO CONTROL! 
.
AND FIRST THINGS FIRST IF, YOU CAN USE IT TO CONTROL THE STOMACH....
.
YOU CAN CONTROL & BE DISCIPLINED TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING IN LIFE! 🤩

Thank you for reading hehe, sekali sekala nak buat refleksi 😆

Typically, you will only start paying attention to that pain in your back, core or even abdominal muscle starts becoming a bothersome issue, which tends to include stiffness and weakness.

Consider correcting your posture to alleviate muscle tension, even though it may feel awkward as your body is used to a certain posture. However, if this is not helping or your pain is becoming unbearable, speak to us as we have treatments available that will be specially customised to suit your needs.",Re:chiro Singapore,35,1

💟Heat 1litre of Milk, I used Full cream UHT Milk at room temperature, to 90degree Celsius on low heat. 
💟Stir gently, it took around 15 min (just ensure that the milk is not boiling vigorously)!! 
💟Turn off heat, leave the hot milk to cool till 40 to 49 degree Celsius approx 30min. (Warm to touch but not burning your hands)
💟Pour 125ml of the warm milk to a cup and add 60g of yogurt (best with live cultures, I used Greek style yogurt brand, honey flavour). Stir and mix till smooth.
💟 Pour mixture into the remaining warm milk and mix well.
💟 Place it in a thermal cooler for 4 hours and check if it has reached the consistency you want. The longer you let it set, it will be firmer consistency. Don’t let it go over 8 hours.

A treat to my fam and to celebrate me turning a year older + Mother’s Day.

Ordered the Singapore’s so-called most expensive and tastier Chicken Rice @ $30 per set. The restaurant also served vegetarian set menus. Honestly, my favourite chicken rice stall @ Chinatown that costs only $3 tasted way better and definitely authentic 😂

But the other side dishes such as MaPo Tofu and Abalone Noodles were yummy 😋

Made a French buttercream that uses all the yolks so no need to crack my brain what to do with the leftover yolks.

Have you heard of @veta.inc‘s Seegreen Fullerene Placenta Radiant Repair Mask? This mask is rich in a variety of peptides, haematococcus pluvialis, fullerene, hydrolyzed placental and other plants essence to help provide adequate water nutrition to the skin and balance the water and oil in the skin. This mask also helps relieve and repair the skin, and has anti-wrinkles properties! 😍 It is suitable for all skin types and esp useful for dry or combi skin.

After using it for 4 consecutive days, I noticed that there‘s a “tightening” feeling after using the mask (I believe it’s due to the lifting effect). At the same time, this mask does provide sufficient hydration to my skin. If you see my before-after pics (ignoring lighting differences — sorry 😅), you can see that certain parts of my face has smoothen with a glow. Btw, an interesting feature of this mask is the Spring Silky Effect of the Essence Liquid. Swipe to see 🔚

May be an image of 1 person and text that says 'HEY YOU GOT MAIL!'.","“@heyyougotmailsg is an initiative where we design and deliver handwritten cards to socially-isolated elderly in nursing homes. By purchasing a card for your loved one for $2, you support sending another to a senior which will be personalised with your messages.

I draw recreationally and this initiative started when I asked my friend Joanne to join me in doing some digital art commissions. We usually donate the profits to COVID-19 relief organisations.

But Joanne was thinking why not make our purpose more meaningful? Donating money is fine but why not target a specific group with intention?

There are so many COVID-19 relief organisations that offer monetary incentives; but, we decided to focus on the elderly because not many offer emotional and mental support, especially to those who are socially-isolated.

I myself was very moody during Phase 1 of the circuit breaker. The lack of social interaction made me even more ‘sian’. That got me thinking about those who may not be able to be with their family and loved ones during such times. It’s even tougher for them.

Occasionally we’d come across articles of seniors who are staying alone in old estates. Nobody’s visiting them during the circuit breaker but we didn’t have any connections so we didn’t know how to reach out to them.

We decided to start small and target those in nursing homes instead. Ever since visitations were not allowed, staff have to conduct their own activities in the absence of volunteers who usually fill up the residents’ free time.

But even nursing homes have their own limitations. Due to the lack of manpower and resources, they can’t always be conducting activities. As a result, the residents are more inactive and socially-isolated than ever.

I believe there are initiatives out there that do video calls for the elderly. That’s great; but, physical cards were our choice of reaching out to socially-isolated seniors. We do things old school for good reason...",Ling Kwang Home for Senior Citizens,51,6

Growing up in North India, it wasn't a part of my daily life. We binged on paranthas 😀
In fact my mum never made dosa at home. I learned the art of making a #dosa very recently (during the lockdown).

Luckily my MIL was here during the #circuitbreakersg period, and given that she lives in Chennai, #dosa is a staple for my husband's family. She taught me how to make a good crispy dosa and I can't thank her enough for that. 

But I've to be honest with you. While she was here, we used #homemade #dosabatter but I don't make it from the scratch. 
I buy @suvaifoods fresh dosa batter from the Indian grocery stores, and tbh you can't make the difference. It really makes restaurant style crispy dosas and it's one step lesser in the cooking process. 

So if you're a #dosalover and are getting overwhelmed by the cumbersome process involved in making a dosa batter, try making your first one with the store-bought mix, and you'll be surprised it tastes just nice. 

To persistence and to the rainy weekends that start with dosa chutney!

Titles include The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership and The 21 Indispensable Qualities of a Leader. His books have sold millions of copies, with some on the New York Times Best Seller List.

John Maxwell believes that the greatest lessons we learn in life are from our losses. Everyone experiences loss, but not everyone learns from it.

In Sometimes You Win--Sometimes You Learn, Dr. Maxwell explores the most common lessons we learn when we experience loss. He then explains how to turn a set-back into a step forward by examining the eleven elements that make up the DNA of Those Who Learn:
1. Humility - The Spirit of Learning
2. Reality - The Foundation of Learning
3. Responsibility - The First Step of Learning
4. Improvement - The Focus of Learning
5. Hope - The Motivation of Learning
6. Teachability - The Pathway of Learning
7. Adversity - The Catalyst of Learning
8. Problems - The Opportunities of Learning
9. Bad Experiences - The Perspective for Learning
10. Change - The Price of Learning
11. Maturity - The Value of Learning

Learning is not easy during down times, it takes discipline to do the right thing when everything is wrong. This book provides a roadmap to doing just that. As John Maxwell often points out--experience isn't the best teacher; evaluated experience is.

This is a high-recommended read!

Now, a few months later, we have finally managed to dine there again!

We loved one of their new(ish?) additions, the #mala chicken chunks, as it is just like #laziji but with juicier chicken 😋. But of course, the highlights are their crabs 🦀 with crispy #friedmantous. I went with the #blackpeppercrab as that's my all time favorite but if possible you should try a larger variety (I think they have a 4 for price of 3 promo now).

We also had their garlic prawns, #sambal fried rice and salted fish beansprouts. Surprisingly, we managed to finish everything, and even had room for dessert (last pic) — ripple ice cream with wafers, reminiscent of childhood 🇸🇬.

As such, I need to work like a Wonder Woman - which inspires the pancake art for today! Just like every Friday, I had a very tasty and fulfilling brunch with the returning Macdonalds scrambled egg burger with sausage, a slice of pancake, a hashbrown and a cup of instant Starbucks caramel latte. And I’m wearing my pretty dusty pink sakura themed mask @yvastudio , which perfectly matches my blouse! 🥰Let’s all have a productive Friday before we let loose for the weekend! 💪💪💪 ❤️❤️❤️ Also, Happy Teachers’ Day to all educators!

We had ordered from them during #circuitbreakersg due to recommendation by a neighbour, but had never actually been to the restaurant before.

This is a hotel restaurant so it's definitely not the usually ""cheap and good"" #thaifood (which also explains their generally lackluster reviews). But if you ignore the price point 😅 I would say the food and service is quite excellent.

Their #tomyumsoup has a real spicy kick, and I enjoyed their stuffed boneless wings 😋. I found their red curry with duck a tad too salty but it complemented the excellent clay pot olive rice, and the crabmeat #omelette was super crisp and addictive (I do have a weakness for all things eggs).

It was a Wednesday night and the restaurant was not full but decently occupied (it is a large space), so I guess they have their fan base!

On a more serious note, postnatal massage helped to remove so much of the residual water retention I had from the pregnancy and delivery.  @postnatalmassagesingapore ‘s customer service was excellent and very prompt in keeping me updated throughout the whole #circuitbreakersg episode when there was an abrupt halt to all non-essential activities, which natal massages are, unfortunately. Thankfully they have since resumed their services! They can also help to massage away blocked milk ducts or lumps to increase milk supply / flow and prevent mastitis. 😉

久没做Pizza~ 午餐就做了Veggie Pizza 
放了菠菜+小杏鲍菇+番茄醤+芝士～ 还不错 😋👍
But 用菠菜还是不要放番茄酱 比较好 
菠菜味道会被蓋去 只配芝士就好 更突显味道

之前种的Chinese Spinach 只有一个继续生长
今早终于長了另一片叶子 🍃 
再试种了另一批 用鸡蛋盒种植 竟然长这么多
希望会成功 但接下来要如何培养 还再找方案中～

A visual exploration of the pandemic ennui one encounters under lockdown. I created this series during the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker lockdown in Singapore with a pinhole lens. The method seemed fitting of the circumstances - seeing the light from the world outside filter through a tiny window into the dark confines of what is essentially a black box, rendering a bleak and muted image of the reality we now live in.

Tea with a friend. Deep and gentle sleep. 🌄 Today’s weather is strange. Sudden downpour. Sudden thunder. Sudden cloudy. Sudden sunny. 🤔 Anyway, today I’m eating my favourite Dayplus’s seasonal orange bun with chocolate chips! Really soft, moist and yummy! You can get it from 7-11 or Sheng Siong. I spent a long time thinking what foodart to create with this round bun. Then I decided to make it into a sun and tried to paint a sunrise scene with my chocolate syrup. Really happy to be able to paint decent looking clouds finally! However, my mother mistakenly thought I was trying to paint a big bright moon to signify 初十五 today. 🤣🤣🤣 So, I guess we can also titled this piece of foodart as Sunrise. Sunset. Oh I think today’s flower stencil coffee art is perfectly done too! 🥰Suddenly I feel there are so much that I wanted to do and improve on... like my bakes, my chocolate paintings etc. Wishing for more hours. 💪💪💪 Happy Mid Week! ❤️

Life is about taking chances. Some take more chances than others. I am a firm believer in betting on yourself then committing to it. When I decided to own my own gym, it was doing something that would mean travelling would stop (worked out well in 2020) and would have to take on responsibilities greater than myself. It has been my greatest challenge to date and is one where I have learned so much everyday; about relationships, business and the need for self care. 

What challenges have you undertaken or want to try?",Singapore,291,9

The year is whizzing by very differently from the past. Today is the first in many weeks that I woke up especially early to go for a walk. So I walked to the very bustling Chong Pang City. There are so many pop-up stalls now and they are all selling interesting stuff! I wished I had the time to slowly walk around. Am really happy to finally find some good quality chiffon cake pans from an old school kitchen accessories shop! 🤩So I think it’s a good start to the new month! Also bought Chai Tow Kway (fried carrot cake) for breakfast and recreated it into Hello Kitty face! You need to examine closely. 🤪The whiskers are missing though. So, it was a cute and yummy hawker brunch! 🥰 Happy Tuesday! 🌻

一轉眼就9月了、時間过得真快、對四季国家來说炎熱的夏季即將過去、秋意漸濃～ 而处在赤道上的新加坡🇸🇬继續炎熱地潮湿下去、至到年末的季風性季节、才迎來涼意！这几天一早气溫高也热的很、改傍晚才出门散步去～ 这樣的天氣 多吃水份多的蔬果、午餐的韓式炸醤面 搭配青瓜絲和番茄 最棒了！.

㊗️大家 周二愉快 平安健康 Stay Safe 💪🏻.
