### Description
Our team sought to work on COVID-19 related policies due to its contemporary and unprecedented nature. We believe that analysis of public opinion has great value in follow-up policymaking where tweaks can be made to better address citizensâ€™ concerns. 

Specifically, the analysis aims to explore how social media data analysis can be leveraged on to enhance government decision-making in designing and implementing COVID-19 related policies in the Singapore context. Our team performed sentiment analysis, topic modelling and time series analysis.

We have focused specifically on these seven policies: 
- Circuit Breaker (CB)
- TraceTogether
- Vaccination
- Social distancing
- Foreign worker dormitory
- Economic measures
- Mandatory mask-wearing
