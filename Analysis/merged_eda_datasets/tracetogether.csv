So opposition should oppose for the sake of opposing? What happened to Team Singapore?,2021-01-28 20:23:10
"Has it occurred to you that people who care about privacy also avoid social media?

On top of that, one is free to choose whether to be on social media or not. They may accept the trade-off that their data will be used for commercial purposes.

Governments and commercial entities have different motivations. One of the motivations for governments is power. This includes shaping your perception of it through propaganda and shutting down anything that threatens it's power. For example, arresting a lone protester. A government is also made up of individuals who have their own personal motivations. It's all good when the government's motivations are aligned with yours but we've seen many times, even in Singapore, what happens when the government or individuals in government decides otherwise.

It's not conspiratorial to be wary or to oppose something that has a very high potential to be used maliciously.",2021-01-29 18:21:41

Nothing with how good or bad it is. Or competing applications. I don't disagree that it's not a fantastic idea or it won't change the world. I don't even disagree with the fact that you can use MMS.

That's not really a good way to handle any project, or any team for that matter; You'd get better chances paying the $100 tariff to head into Marina Bay Sands and trying your hand at the craps tables for the project duration. 

Apps don't just ""fail"" because of poor developers. They can fail due to poor planning, poor risk management or targetting a problem that simply does not exist, or no longer exists because someone else got there first/did it better than j00.

Projects can also fail due to being too far ahead of their time, resulting in a solution that suddenly comes in handy - except it was deemed a failure months ago, with nobody left to maintain it, so it gets left by the wayside and we needlessly have to implement a new solution from scratch.

Projects can also fail because it succeeded for 100k users, but when all 5 million people in SG start to use it, the project chokes. 

Too bad for all the ""long term thinking"" many service companies profess, its all about the quick gains and the avoidance of long maintenance cycles that would prevent them from creating another revenue stream. No ""learning from failure"" or things like that; apparently its too costly in the so-called ""long term"".",2018-08-15 16:55:55

Seconded. That one is good. ,2018-08-15 16:34:09
">How do you even design a security application to let users keep it?

Maybe you can't. Not with the current way people are using applications on their phones.

If the government really wanted people to have the app remain on their phones just in case, they could conduct more education on the subject, so that people see the importance of having such an app. That isn't going to solve all problems, and you'll still have some people deleting it, but it's likely to increase retention.",2018-08-15 16:00:26
"> However, this is a case of the authorities who wants this app to be on everyone's phone instead. I really don't see the harm on this one really. 

This line. Usually a trojan and adware is the case of some organization, typically an advertisment company, wanting a direct line to the user's device, the purpose of which is to personalise the content that is pushed to a user - who, thanks to said trojan or adware cannot help but see the pushed content. 

The fact that such apps usually bypass system security itself means that the app owner is free to take any personal data from the device itself, all the better to build a profile of a user without the user's input. 

At worst, this allows the app owner access to important things he shouldn't have, like login information, authentication keys, etc. 

Even before the age of the mobile device, the purpose of such apps is professed to be for the benefit of anyone who installs them, but in reality they don't work very well or do nothing useful. Y'see, that's because the real purpose of the app is something else.

In fact, it isn't unusual for a trojan or adware app to pretend to be something else entirely, advertising a feature that is completely unrelated to its true purpose. 

So, when you claimed that the SG Secure app is in fact a case of authorities wanting an app to be on anyone's phone... you start ringing alarm bells. 

Edit: And just to pre-empt the argument that we can trust the Singapore Government because they are not an advertisement company and they are looking out for us, I would like you to google Windows Telemetry, as an example of a company you *have to implicitly trust* wanting an app or a feature on everyone's device for the purposes of data collection. I'm not saying that Microsoft means anyone harm, but there's controversy along this line for a good reason. ",2018-08-15 18:44:50

> Contrary to prior assurances that TraceTogether data would only be used for contact tracing, Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan clarified that the police are, in fact, legally empowered under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to access said data for criminal investigations. The TraceTogether website FAQ was then updated to reflect this, ostensibly in the interests of ‚Äòtransparency‚Äô. Cue the first social media uproar of 2021.

> Some shrugged, saying they had nothing to hide. Some responded with ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù. Still others were suspicious, if not livid, about the blatant U-turn.  And of course, many more turned to memes.

> Whichever camp you‚Äôre in, it‚Äôs clear that this revelation undermines the extensive efforts to win public support for TraceTogether, and feeds into earlier anxieties that it could be supposedly abused as a hidden tracking device. 

> To be honest, even with this latest development, it‚Äôs probably not worth getting worked up about location tracking. TraceTogether works by detecting proximity to other devices, not location. Expert teardowns of the token last year concluded that it did not have a GPS function and was ‚Äúunlikely to be a useful tracking device‚Äù (though this was at least partially based on assurances that only MOH‚Äôs contact tracers would ever see the data)

> And as Minister Tan‚Äôs comments revealed, the remit of the CPC means that law enforcement is already empowered to access far more useful data, such as SafeEntry records‚Äîwhich, by the way, were also meant to be ‚Äòfor Covid-19 purposes only‚Äô. 

> What the clarification does do is raise questions over how exactly the proximity data might become useful to the police, whether there is potential for it to be misused, and what sorts of offences are quote-unquote ‚Äòserious‚Äô enough to trigger the exception. 

> It invites incredulity as to how Minister Balakrishnan could have overlooked the CPC during his PR offensive for TraceTogether last year. And it encourages anxieties over the inconsistencies and back-pedalling in government communications.

> These are all serious issues, but not the real source of public ire; nor is there any evidence that this was a deliberate conspiracy to mislead the public. What this episode really invites us to consider is a question of trust: whether the government can be relied on to keep its word, with no catch involved.

> Optics-wise, it‚Äôs a terrible look: a communications blunder that could have been easily avoided, and a breach of public trust for no good reason.

> As far as rights concerns in Singapore go, data privacy and surveillance have seldom been a priority. Last year‚Äôs PDPA consultation went largely ignored by the public; many of us‚Äîmyself included‚Äîremain oblivious to the sensors, cameras, and GPS devices #disrupting and #innovating and #connecting our way into Smart Nationhood (like the time it was proposed to embed our lamp posts with facial recognition technology).  Meanwhile, legislation like the ISA casts a long, dark shadow over our willingness, historically, to make trade-offs between civil liberties and national security.

> By these standards, the hostility towards TraceTogether, even prior to this incident, was unusual. 

> Last year, the announcement of the token was greeted with a petition in protest, garnering over 50,000 signatures in a few days. Following months of will-they-won‚Äôt-they coyness‚ÄîMinister Vivian Balakrishnan had previously said that TraceTogether would be ‚Äúvoluntary for long as possible‚Äù, but stopped short of a definitive statement‚ÄîOctober‚Äôs announcement that TraceTogether would eventually be mandatory in certain circumstances raised enough eyebrows for MP He Ting Ru to bring it up in Parliament. And a Blackbox Research survey from last month showed that 32% of Singaporeans doubted that TraceTogether data would only be used for Covid-19 monitoring.

> TraceTogether, in other words, was always a hard sell. But had the government been upfront about the CPC caveat last year, chances are that the public, despite its unease, would have understood.

> Unfortunately, thanks to its own insistence that the data would be used for contact tracing and contact tracing only, people are not only uneasy, but outraged that the government has gone back on its word.

> The irony is all too keen, given how the successful implementation of TraceTogether relies on mutual trust between citizens and the state. Mass adoption of the technology‚Äîenough to trigger Phase 3‚Äîwas arguably earned, at least in part, on the expectation that the government would honour its promises. Nor is it reassuring that despite the lessons of last year‚Äôs GE, public goodwill appears to have been taken for granted.

> This debacle suggests that distrust might colour the way future data-collection practices are viewed. The fears around a slippery slope are not unjustified: is there a clear line that the government will not cross when it comes to using our personal data?

> Most of us understand there are trade-offs to be made in any policy decision, and realise that in some instances, the potential benefits to public health or national security may outweigh the costs. But an informed choice means those costs should be declared to begin with.

> More troubling is how episodes like this one encourage cynicism towards governance. 

> It behooves no-one to reach a point where we believe that the government is flying the plane and we‚Äôre all just strapped in for the ride. After all, if we suspect that back-doors and hidden T&Cs will always be introduced after the fact, why listen in the first place? 

> Data might be the commodity of this century, but public trust is just as valuable an asset. Since Monday‚Äôs revelation, Ministers Shanmugam and Balakrishnan have been in full-on damage control mode, giving more assurances that the TraceTogether data is only retained for 25 days and that law enforcement must exercise their powers with ‚Äòthe utmost restraint‚Äô, giving the example of how TraceTogether data was used to solve a murder case.

The sleepless nights could be due to guilt n splitting of personality <edit: Reiner>,2021-01-07 12:52:51
"Looking at this as a non-Singaporean, everyone involved did exactly the right thing, which led to an unintended and unforseen ""problem"".

There was an urgent need for the Trace Together token as there is an ongoing public health emergency, and  Minister Balakrishnan and the development team would have been laser focussed on creating it, and having it adopted as widely as possible. They opened up the source code for audit by privacy advocates/hackers etc., who were approving of what they saw. The generaly high level of trust in your institutions and the privacy audit led to a pretty high voluntary adoption rate. 

It's easy for me to see how they could have overlooked that the data could or would be accessed and used for purposes other than contact tracing given thier focus on the pandemic and getting the token out ASAP.

Now, a police officer investigating a murder case realised that hey, that data might be useful in this case? Is there anything legally preventing us from getting it? No? Well, let's get it!

This is great savvy and professionalism from law enforcement; anything else would really have been a dereliction of duty on their part. They did exactly as they should given their mandate, and narrow focus on bringing a criminal to justice.

Now,  Minister Balakrishnan must have been peeved when he became aware of this, because this was genuinely not his intent, and was seen as the Government breaking their word, when it was really law enforcement acting independently (actually a positive). 

So at this point, how should it be settled? Do you go the legislative route to ring fence the token data? Given that the pandemic is time limited, and that legislative process may take some time, as well as the genuine value for criminal investigations, my opinion is that it shouldn't.

The compromise that the data will remain accessible, and only be used by LE for serious cases is the best solution in my opinion. Given the high level of professionalism by Singaporean LE, and the high level of trust for public officials, it's workable. In another society with greater corruption etc., the calculus would be different.

So the whole thing was just a real world situation which happens without anyone being a villian or incompetent, or whatever. I found the Parlimentary debate, and some of the wider discussion, around the issue to be  quite edifying.",2021-01-08 08:16:10

"This kind of strategy could work in the past without too many drawbacks, but personally, I think the issue is that the government is simply not keeping up with the development of global trends.

They think that they can govern the country as they deem fit, totally independent and disregarding global trends but the fact is Singapore is one of the most interconnected countries in the world, all global trends affect us and we are not like China where most western media platforms have been blocked and censored.

Just take a look at some SG politician's response to Marijuana legalization in the west for example. It just shows a total lack of understanding of global trends. Similarly in this TT case, they don't seem to understand the kind of seriousness and sensitivity that is being placed on privacy issues globally in 2021. A breach of trust on privacy issue like this is just playing with fire.",2021-01-07 14:07:31

"I am okay with that attitude actually. 

The problem was that in the past, the government really did know what they were doing, and were often more correct than not. So people were content to let the government run things for them because the government really did know best. 

Today, the current ministers don‚Äôt exactly inspire confidence. And I think that‚Äôs what rankles people - that they continue to adopt this ‚Äúgovernment knows best‚Äù mentality when they clearly don‚Äôt.",2021-01-07 14:52:41
"And to be fair, sometimes that is the right thing to do. The government does have more knowledge, resources and competence than the average citizen in relation to most affairs. They need to work on their communication, yes, but by and large the decisions they make are sound. They just need to be a bit cleverer about how they go about spreading their message.",2021-01-07 14:08:10
"I am f-ing pissed because the alleged pros of having TT data to substantially aid in criminal investigations and prosecutions (if even tenable given that I can manipulate my ‚Äúlocation‚Äù by leaving the token elsewhere) are FAR OUTWEIGHED by cons - which is the irreversible damage to the trust people have in the government. This trust imo is invaluable. Especially in the current turbulent times with a pandemic and shuttered global economy. Just look at countries around the world where most people don‚Äôt have trust in the government to fulfil what they promise. The govtech team and relevant agencies painstakingly built this trust over the later half of the year; only for it to be singlehandedly destroyed for the off chance that it might aid criminal investigations?? It‚Äôs such a profoundly costly and stupid trade-off. No money or cash handouts can ever repair that trust deficit they created. 

I can accept that Vivian might have omitted to consider the application of CPC at the first instance. But NO ONE in SPF, MHA, AGC brought it to his attention in the subsequent weeks? He also admitted as much that he found out about it but discussed with his colleagues and decided to proceed ahead nonetheless (btw his sob story about having sleepless nights, which I empathise cos I suffer from insomnia too lol, is wholly irrelevant and doesn‚Äôt play out well when you‚Äôre trying to seek the people‚Äôs forgiveness/understanding). We don‚Äôt know when he first found out about it but we know that it likely ain‚Äôt just this year. I am pissed because I (and many of us) trusted them to do the right thing and had spent much time and effort persuading family and friends to adopt TT to help our national effort to combat covid-19. Plus the fact that the gov had spent months persuading us and addressing all concerns people posed (INCLUDING about using TT data for crim investigations). The cons are even greater because people are less inclined to use TT responsibly now, which undermines the whole purpose of contact tracing.

To me, this is a matter of Principle and Trust, both of issues the PAP always prides themself on having. It is regrettable and sad that certain leaders decided that this invaluable trust and the PAP‚Äôs self-perceived reputation of being principled are worth tearing down for the ostensible benefit that it might or might not bring to crim cases.",2021-01-08 23:57:29

"Seems like what I'm gonna say is going to be unpopular opinion on this sub and I'm most likely gonna be downvoted but so be it.

I would be more concerned if the government is passing laws just to ""keep up with global trends"". Just because some country passes a law because they think it is good, does not mean that we have to. If we had followed what other countries did in the past, Singapore would not be as prosperous as she is today. 

And honestly, though a lot of people don't want to admit, sometimes the government does know better. The one issue that is becoming prevalent in today's society is that a lot of people think that they are smarter than they actually are. I'll admit that the ministers of today are not probably not as capable as the ones in the past, but neither are the general public. 

I completely agree that they could have communicated the inclusion of the use of TT for serious criminal investigations and I understand why people would be upset. But I would at least think that because of this pandemic people would at least understand that there is a bigger picture to look at first before publicly stating the the government is completely un-trustable now.",2021-01-08 00:15:52

Heck, instead of using Mediacorp as your main way of producing content, spend some money on our local creators to produce content on more relevant media (YouTube, Instagram etc.) explaining different government policies. 

Look at all the science/education channels doing wonders on YouTube now with a lesser budget than a single department in a ministry. Does not matter how much good you are doing as a government if you are not conveying that to the public.

"I agree about the strengths of a technocratic government. That imo is one of the strengths of our government, which doesn‚Äôt have to be as preoccupied with politicking or succumbing populism as other forms of democracies. However, this form of governance also requires significant trust by the majority of the populace in the gov of the day. So when the gov destroys this fragile trust, it brings about a whole lot of issues that would only hinder the gov‚Äôs ability to retain popular support WHILE still implementing the right (not necessarily popular) decisions for the country‚Äôs overall benefit.

If the gov had been transparent about the CPC earlier in the last few months, gave assurances that it is restricted to those 7 severe crimes (murder, rape, terrorism), I am confident that most of us would be willing to forgive and accept it as well. Esp since everyone can agree that those crimes are perhaps the most morally repugnant of crimes. It is reassuring that their proposed legislation restricts TT data in crim investigations to the list of 7 kinds of crime. But I fear that this is too little too late. The damage is done when VB and the others decided to withhold info abt the CPC application after realising their mistake, and only addressing it now. The legislative amendments about the kinds of serious crimes also feels like a reactionary response to the public backlash; not something that they had ready to produce in Parliament on the day that they announced their mistake.",2021-01-09 00:26:12

Edit: Probably should provide a bit more explanation on my stance in here so that it's not confusing. My stance is that for this particular issue, there is a bigger picture here that benefits the general public, which is the fact TT would provide a faster way to identify suspect's movement which will hasten the investigation works. As such, I do not have much of an issue with this ruling but I still understand why some people are unhappy.

However, if there was no bigger picture like the presidential election which you mentioned, then I would be right next to you demanding an explanation from the government.

Ultimately ""retaining the option"" to use this data (which isn't even that great) comes at the cost of undermining trust in the TT program. Less trust, means less users, which means a less effective program.

As for the interpretation of 'use' legally, I think you are confused. You should be instead looking at precedent interpretation of ""use"" instead of one for one word matching in CPC. Interpretation of ""use"" legally is quite liberally ""enjoy benefits of"" and the act of checking for data tempering for the benefit of obtaining incriminating evidence for prosecution is a legal use of TT data.

I've already directly pointed out, that even if we accepted the entirety of your argument, Govtec using the data to find incriminating data and not disclosing the TT data to the police, is a vastly different situation from the reasons why people are angry at the government right now.

This was when you tried to re-raise your legal definition of ""use"", only to then say that the legal term is ""obtain"" (so I'm not sure why we have gone back to ""use"").

>is a legal use of TT data

You are just asserting this notion of ""legal use"", when you can't even provide a proper basis for your legal definition of ""use"". Or ""obtain"", or whatever you really think the proper legal term is.

As I mention above:

1) This entire point about ""legal use"" is misplaced. Vivian gave a *political* promise not to use the data for other purposes, not a *legal* promises (which he has no legal power to give anyway). 

2) It is not in dispute that the police has *legal* power to access the data all the time. However the Government is also free to make the promise that it will voluntarily not use the *legal* power. This was the promise made by Vivian. 

3) Given 1) and 2) above, the idea that there is a special legal meaning of ""use"", or ""obtain"" is missing the point, because the promise is not of a legal nature, and you should be considering Vivian's words in the general layman sense. Plus anyway, the relevant part of the CPC does not contain ""use"" or ""obtain"" so your legal argument is really just a confused misunderstanding of the law. 

4) Assuming that your entire example is even feasible, Govtech checking data, and then giving the incriminating data to the police, is different from the entire data being given to the police from the start. People will not have the same concerns as they now have.",2021-01-08 13:46:58
"

1) My argument was against people who say that ""if police got no use for TT data, why collect it at all"" in which I provided an example where the police might need to have that flexibility ""use"" against people who abuse an exclusion clause. 

2) Yes and like I said before I don't disagree about perceptions on broken promises. Don't change the subject.

3) Mostly a repeat of 1 and 2. I stand by my interpretion of legal use for my example. See point 1.

4) Again, we are back to simplistic arguments. Yes, A and B is different for many combinations of A and B. Will people not have the same concerns? Vastly different situation? How to tell? Isn't that your opinion? Like I also said, Govtech is not MOH which you gave consent to for the sole purpose of contact tracing. Govtech is also not qualified to make criminal investigations by themselves. It is not their purpose eithet. Will not have the same concerns? Yes. Is it less concerning? I'd say no.

I AM NOT SPONSORED, OR A GOVERNMENT SHILL, as much as you'd love for that to be true. I am just excited that an app can potentially save thousands of lives, even millions, if we can prove it works and export this model abroad. I am convinced of its value and safety. 

They've claimed I am a shill/spy/whatever it is, they've claimed I don't know what I am talking about, they've claimed I am being defensive, etc, etc. I would like to take this moment to encourage everyone who is reading this and the post above to consider the following facts. 

This app was developed by a stat board. It is not made by the PAP, or indeed any political agency. They are staffed by people with very difficult-to-obtain degrees in IS, IT, and Comp-sci. If you fundamentally want to question their motives, that's fine. But the technology is sound and proven. 

**Safe anot?**

Encryption is a well understood topic. You use it daily for internet banking, logging in to reddit, surfing the web. Its nothing new to encrypt your information. It is very hard to steal information from your phone in ANY form, even so-called 'bluetooth snarfing'. The cost of attacking you is prohibitive in terms of time, exposure and potential reward gained. 99.999% of all people who will use this app have nothing valuable to steal from their phones. I agree there is a risk of such a thing happening, but in all likelihood? It will not happen. It is like being afraid of being struck by lightning. Can it happen? Yes. Will it happen? Extremely unlikely. 

**Why no open source?**

The government being the slow cumbersome beast it is are often staffed by people who know less than they should and yet are in higher levels of authority than other people who might have made better decisions. They may believe that not releasing the code is somehow more secure. There may also be proprietary/sensitive code involved in making this app. That is not to say that it is suspicious or is out to make money from you. It is just to indemnify themselves from potential risks. They have also stated that moving towards open source is something they want to do after this initial period. 

**Will it see if I go to geylang?**

No. It doesn't. Unless the Government pulls an MIB move with thousands of 'relay bluetooth stations' which is a fantastical idea at best, and absolute nonsense at worst. This was heavily upvoted in the other thread. I need to stress that while theoretically possible, if they actually do want to track everyone, there are less obvious and expensive ways to do so than that. This app specifically with regards to your movement does not enable the government to track you.

**I dont trust it, why should I install?**

This is more a philosophical debate than anything actually pertinent to the app, but allow me to default to a utilitarian argument: What number of infected cases would there need to be before you felt that this app was necessary? 100? 1000? 10000? What proportion of the population needs to be infected before you feel personally threatened enough to use the app for the sake, not only of yourself, but the old and those with pre-existing conditions around you? 5% of the population? 10%? 

I understand that before it becomes a problem you are wont to download this app and you'd rather have your privacy. Allow me to stress once again. It is safe, unless a state sponsored actor or billionaire playboy philanthropist comes in to try and track everyone.

"> # Singapore Police Force can obtain TraceTogether data for criminal investigations: Desmond Tan

> SINGAPORE: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) can obtain TraceTogether data for criminal investigations, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan in Parliament on Monday (Jan 4).

> The SPF is empowered under the Criminal Procedure Code to obtain any data, and that includes the TraceTogether data, said Mr Tan.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""The Government is the custodian of the TT (TraceTogether) data submitted by the individuals and stringent measures are put in place to safeguard this personal data,"" added Mr Tan.

> ""Examples of these measures include only allowing authorised officers to access the data, using such data only for authorised purposes and storing the data on a secured data platform.""

> Mr Tan was responding to a question from Member of Parliament (MP) Christopher de Souza, who had asked if TraceTogether data will be used for criminal investigations and what the legal provisions and safeguards are for using such data.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Under the Public Sector (Governance) Act, public officers who recklessly or knowingly disclose the data without authorisation, or misuse the data, may be fined up to S$5,000 or jailed up to two years, or both, said Mr Tan.

> ""We do not preclude the use of TraceTogether data in circumstances where citizens' safety and security is or has been affected, and this applies to all other data as well,"" said Mr Tan, in response to a supplementary question from Workers' Party MP Gerald Giam who had asked if use of the data would violate the TraceTogether privacy statement.

> ""Authorised police officers may invoke then the Criminal Procedure Code ... powers to obtain this data for purpose of criminal investigation, and for the purpose of the safety and security of our citizens, but otherwise TraceTogether data is indeed to be used only for contact tracing and for the purpose of fighting the COVID situation.""

"And this is precisely why I‚Äôve been extremely vocally against TraceTogether from the day it was announced. It was fucking obvious right from the get-go that the government wanted to leave the option open for TT data to be used for more than just tackling COVID, because otherwise they‚Äôd have included legal safeguards to ensure that contact tracing data would be used for precisely just that: contact tracing.

I‚Äôve been saying time and time again that if you really wanted to belief the government then they should have set the example by making it law, and the fact that they didn‚Äôt told me everything I needed to know.

First off, community data is valuable. Movement data alone can help to deduce your habits, routines and activities, e.g. where you would want to go for eating, who would you like to meet, which community would you engage in, etc. Nowadays technology is advanced enough to learn more about you than you do, given enough data from the mass.

Second is that those knowledge of you can not only be used for prediction, but for manipulation and restriction of your future habits and activities, and potentially your viewpoint and standards. The scandal with Cambridge Analytica is still hot til today, and they can influence US election scene with just daily data of Fb users. The data provided by TT is less informative, but it has been 4 years since then and who know how far technology has advanced?

Last is that I believe we need to have a legal statement from gov about their limits toward data collection and usage. Today they say it's for security purpose, but what if tomorrow they want to use it for researching community structure and social network? And what would they want to do with all those knowledge? Don't take me wrong here, I am not against the TT or SG gov, in fact I admire how SG adapts TT to prevent untraceable COVID cases, compared to other countries around us, but given how much they can do with those data, I am wary of potential misuse of those data, and potential future compromise of SG gov with external parties about data collection.

Right now, in 2021, SPF is generally above board and competent. Same can be said for the government. But in 2026? 2031? 2036? Look at Hong Kong - in a few short years the police went from well respected to colluding with triads and suiciding people. Can you dare to say that this will never happen to Singapore? If you are considered law abiding now, that may not be true forever.

There's also the slippery slope that now police can use it, then who is next? How about other government agencies? If you are a civil servant, do you want them to use TT to clock in clock out at work? It's far fetched. But that's what people who thought ""TT will only be used for contact tracing"" thought - that the government will know when to stop on the slippery slope. Obviously they don't.

For something a bit more immediate - everyone makes mistakes and police are no exception. What if because of TT you get wrongly dragged into an investigation? What if police make a mistake, or want to close case and use it to pin the blame on you? I would rather turn off Bluetooth than risk that.

Most don't even know what CPC is. For months, the gov's website and Dr Vivian kept saying that TT will only be for contact tracing. Naturally this is what people were ""brainwashed"" to believe. Some of those that were hesitant to partake in TT due to privacy concerns, were probably willing to compromise for the sake of health and quicker eradication of the virus. They did not sign up for TT with the explicit knowledge that it can be used for police work.

On Jan 4 the gov came out and clarified that TT data is not exempted from CPC, like all our personal data. So many on reddit now thinks the gov backtracked on its promise for safeguarding TT users' privacy etc and never said properly on the website or in statements. Even Dr Balakrishnan said he didn't think about TT data being subjected to CPC laws until recently.

">Does this news change any of the above?

I understand you. I don't understand why the gov did not explicitly state that TT data will also be used for police investigation work from its launch in March 2020. Why are we only told of this now?

Is it up to us to infer that all our data can be used if empowered by law to do so?

If the above is the case, see CNA's article dated Jun 5th 2020 which had the following written, likely to reassure people of TT's sole purpose for contact tracing:

>Dr Balakrishnan reiterated that personal data is stored on the user's mobile phone and is **strictly used for contact tracing, only to be accessed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) when a user tests positive for COVID-19.**

This leads people to wonder, once the pandemic is eventually over, will TT still be necessary? Will it have then become a new, valuable tool for law enforcement in addition to current implements like CCTVs etc.?

I am not angry, but confused and curious. Yes, I recognise the efforts made to develop the system, and support all means of eradicating the virus as soon as possible. But transparency and communication is key during this difficult time.

"It's not about you. It's about what the government can potentially do with this data. What if tomorrow an important member of an opposition party is being tracked without their consent? What if the government decides to trace thousands of people because they ""think"" they've commited a crime? What if the government collects live location data of all residents in Singapore and uses that to predict our behavior? What if that data is sold to third party sources?

While some of these might seem paranoid, this is how it starts. We willingly give away information about ourselves under the blanket of security or convenience, not knowing how that data is being used and who exactly is accountable for it. This leads to a broken window theory and we give up more of our privacy rights because it doesn't directly affect us. At least, not yet. When it actually does affect you, it'll be too late.

I understand that multiple corporate entities are potentially already tracing you and that is not ok. The big difference is that corporate entities can be regulated by the government but who regulates the government? We need to be the ones to do that; all of us.

"Genuine question: how would you like to be subject to the same level of scrutiny as China's citizens as by their government? 

I ask this because China is several stages past where we are right now. Their CCTVs can track people almost 24/7, with facial recognition baked in. Apart from just technological advancements, the CCP has built legal and logistical frameworks that allow them to... shall we say, *acquire* and *repurpose* people who they deem to be *inconvenient* to them. See, for example, the HK bookshop owners who dared distribute literature criticizing the Chinese government, or the Muslims in Xinjiang for daring to just exist. 

Before the CCP could attain such powerful means of controlling the populace, there were probably many Chinese voices like yours - all content to allow their government the leeway to implement infrastructure, legislation and practices that, on the surface, were meant to safeguard and protect them. 

But things like this can easily be - and of course has been - repurposed to prioritize the interests of the government over those of ordinary citizens. 

Yes we are in Singapore, not China. But we ought to be aware that there is no guarantee that our government of tomorrow will have the same moral and ethical scruples as the one we have today. As citizens all we can do is to resist when things are done that can potentially be used against us.

"The Apple-Google Exposure Notification (GAEN) system makes it impossible for the data to be used for criminal investigation, because the unique identifiers broadcast by a device (rotating proximity identifier or RPI, as termed in the protocol), as well as the keys from which they are derived (temporary exposure key or TEK), are held on the device itself. So you can get the RPIs seen by a person's phone, but you have no idea who the RPIs represent.

This is unlike TraceTogether, where a central authority generates the unique identifiers (termed TempIDs in the BlueTrace whitepaper; this is equivalent to GAEN's RPI), and so once you retrieve the identifiers seen by a person's phone, you can then map it back to a contact through the central authority's database.",2021-01-04 19:44:25

"Mass surveillance with the advent of machine learning is pretty crazy compared to the old days too. Each $1 spent on buying population surveillance above a certain amount (my estimate is 150ish million) also significantly increases the ROI, because this increases the accuracy of big data analytical algorithms that can be used to predict stuff like voting patterns, product consumption and other more sinister stuff. 

I know someone who has worked on a preliminary algorithm that predicts pregnancy probability. Pregnancy probability is not only whether or not you are currently pregnant, but also your probability of becoming pregnant over the next few years, with certain time periods marked as more or less likely with an exact probability percentage. The algorithm is based on demographical information as well as travel information (which buses do you take etc) at an accuracy rate of 63%, which is not very useful compared to modern data analytics from firms like Facebook or NTUC that can look at your history of consumption. 

However, if you know a person's location more accurately throughout a day, the accuracy of the algorithm improves to ~93 to 94%. Normally, this wouldn't be possible, but TraceTogether provides a lot of location data uptime for citizens, and will probably push the algorithm close to 87-88% accurate.

you're carrying around a specific government-issued token constantly, and you were told it's for safety during a pandemic. you're right, they could always track you, and they've always solved crimes without the use of TT. why do they need it now? are we going to carry it around long past the pandemic? what would they have lost by saying ""no, the police cannot use this specific infomation, go solve crimes some other way""? 

the issues of public health and crime HAVE to be kept separate in this instance. you want to maximise usage of the app/token so you can keep people safe from a virus, and that includes criminals. it's the same reason why SHN notices at hotels are ""free staycations"", why we didn't charge for testing and treatment, etc. you WANT people to show up if they're infected, not hide and spread in silence. 

and that's not even considering what the police powers are! what crimes are these used for? are terrorists carrying around TT tokens?

I seriously do not think they thought of this caveat at that point in time. I listened to that press release (cannot remember if it is the same one in Jun though), and I recall that a reporter asked if TT can be used as evidence for non-compliance of certain SMM or Covid-control measures. VB was a bit confused, and it was LW who replied.

How likely would it be at that press conference, that one of the ministers can actually say that when CPC circumstances were necessary that it will be the only (?) exception? There is no senior police officer or a MHA present then (I cannot remember if JT was there, but I don't think she would have picked it up even if she was present anyway).

In this case the SPF probably really did access TT data for a certain criminal case and it proved useful, and updated this detail to Desmond Tan when he approached them for information to answer the PQ filed. Hence, the TT FAQs were also updated because it actually happened.

It will be in very rare circumstances that such data be accessed for more serious criminal investigations under CPC.

Let's not pretend as if there isn't a substantial proportion of crime like paint-splashing or littering in public spaces that is not caught or traced. The problem is that no rational citizen would want for there to be an absolute resource of their data that is able to be tapped on by people they do not trust and without their knowledge or consent.

The status quo right now is that citizens are content with current surveillance tools that do not yet cross the social boundaries of citizens but citizens are also okay with the minor crime that goes through (cigarette butts under park benches or jay-walking an empty street) due to the lack of total surveillance. We may never know whether public locations such as shopping malls or supermarkets remain or have ever been the only locations where TT tokens provide information on your whereabouts.

To introduce an avenue where you give up information more readily than you need to is something that will surely drop voluntary uptake of the token and were it to be made compulsory, would cause grievances beyond your regular controversial policies.",2021-01-04 19:56:29

When you tell people that TT is only used for 1 thing and 1 thing only in order to assuage such concerns then turn around and state in no uncertain terms that the statement isn‚Äôt true, it becomes the classic bait-and-switch. It‚Äôs basically being disingenuous especially because most people don‚Äôt actually know how wide the powers of the SPF are. It assumes that everyone understood and appreciated that the police could do this.

You can even see in the other discussion threads we had on this where the supporters of TT insisted such a thing couldn‚Äôt happen.",2021-01-04 18:42:48

Are you suggesting that there would somehow be away for a group of people to discreetly implement a reliable mass surveillance system in Singapore that somehow people would not be aware of? In a country as large as China, people are conscious of the presence of mata-mata despite the government's understandable attempts to be hush-hush about it and you are saying that in an area as densely populated and technologically aware as Singapore, 5.6 million people would not notice the work of a few personnel sworn into OSA? Keep in mind this work is supposed to provide data in quantities our police force \*who are already world class\* currently do not have? And Singaporeans would just let this happen without it being noticed despite our tiny land capacity and were it to be noticed for Singaporeans to just roll over and take it on the side?

&#x200B;

""your mere presence in a place can be used as information against you without needing you to trade in a token or something""

How? How will they notice my mere presence in a place??? Phone signal triangulation? Turn off the phone? CCTV cameras? The financial capital to implement + manpower resources required to affix and maintain + the amount of privacy intrusion it would bring in currently leaves a large section of our land area unmonitored because it is too much a waste of resources for the government + our citizens would be unhappy with the amount of surveillance and not support it?

&#x200B;

""by U.S. standards, Singapore's privacy laws are virtually nonexistent, and it's possible that the government collected private communications, financial data, public transportation records, and medical information without any court approval or private consent""

but there are ways to side-step all of this? Besides private communications, because it is the realm of ""technically they give this data up what"" that data is accessible. But this was done in the early 2000s during SARS.. in 2020 even your most basic web communication tool, Whatsapp has end-to-end encryption. They would need physical access to your phone to browse the contents. If it's one person by one person, sure they can go down take your phone and know your private communications but for the entire island's citizens data to be made accessible???

That's why a token that can transmit a signal without you being unaware of it AND is not used solely for contact tracing dangerously trespasses the boundaries of information most citizens are willing to share with the government? It's not as if this is some dark dystopian reality where, with a snap of the fingers suddenly there are unseen CCTV cameras waiting on the wall to track your movement and 5.6 million Singaporeans just sit quiet and let that happen?

Just look at how swiftly it moves and with what elegance it navigates the rocky political landscape. A true sight to behold!

Scientists are still not certain how this tribe of Moving Goalposts got here in the first place, but they do seem to have a bright future ahead. With the POFMA Mountains towering the north and the Indian Ocean blocking the south, these Goalposts are unlikely to migrate elsewhere and face virtually no natural predators.

"Not sure if it's a dumb question, but has there been some kind of divide between GovTech and the rest of the agencies helping to implement these systems? There's quite a number of discrepancies between what's in the [BlueTrace](https://bluetrace.io/) policy brief and white paper (which I'm taking to be what GovTech has recommended to the government), and what's been implemented so far:

- White paper says that ""The only personally-identifiableinformation collected is a phone number"", yet in current practice the TT app/token consumes a person's NRIC  

  Personally I'd be fine with the original spec, as phone numbers aren't as strong an identifier as an NRIC. If you're feeling paranoid you could always buy a prepaid card with cash. Hypothetically the contact tracing process could take place without having to identify yourself at all, were it not for having to register for treatment. On the other hand, you can't ever get another IC, and everyone in Singapore has one. 

- White paper lists one of the reasons of choosing Bluetooth over GPS to identify close contacts as ""Public wariness and possible alarmabout tracking location data ofindividuals could hamper adoption.""; in current practice the government is getting people to submit location data anyway, in the form of SafeEntry.

IMO taking these recommendations wouldn't entirely fix the privacy issues these systems have so far, but it'd definitely tone it down from having _a national registry of where everyone has been, strongly tied to a bunch of data about who was next to who_. So has the government been throwing out what GovTech has been recommending?",2021-01-05 19:44:52

"If Vivian Balakrishnan seriously had 'sleepless nights' as to the privacy breach he had overlooked (which is unbelievable considering how thorough over government claims to be whenever implementing policy, or maybe they are not?) why not table a provision to the CPC which prevents the access of data tracked on TraceTogether? Even if it were not passed, it stands as a fig leaf to the public for eroding our trust. If they can go back on their word about TraceTogether's data usage, they can go back on just about anything and claim ""oh we overlooked it, soz lmao."" Perhaps misplaced faith but I do not think the PAP would be so insidious as to go back on their word on doing away with TraceTogether once the pandemic is over. Nevertheless, this stands as another example in a growing charge sheet of the PAP breaching the public's trust. This is vital in a budding democracy such as ours. Globally we have seen the deleterious effects of eroding public trust in government. Look at the protests in Germany over the lockdown and the sidelining of the CDC over demagogues and cable news pundits in the US. The social contract is built upon principles of reciprocity, it is easy to break and harder to fix with greater implications on the government-civilian relationship.

Right now the onus is on our Opposition politicians to ensure the responsible usage of TraceTogether data. This can include an oversight mechanisms or inquiry committees to ensure accountability.

"some points to consider - 

**Perhaps TT app is yielding more data than Token?**

(a) what TT data is there that it is useful for such purposes? Handshake data alone cannot possibly be sufficient. If the crime happened in the unit next to mine and I was in handshake range 

(b) Is there a difference between TT data from app vs token? If token has no GPS functionality or any other data functionality then the only way more useful data can be extracted is from TT app. Our phones have GPS etc.

***To limit tracking, it's possible that uninstalling TT app and using the TT token would be best.***

Let's note the specific language Viv uses

""Dr Balakrishnan also said that once the Covid-19 pandemic is over and when TraceTogether is no longer needed, the Government will ""most happily and cheerfully"" stand down the programme.""

Combination of 2 very hard to foresee conditions. Pandemic over and combined with the very subjective ""no longer needed"".

"Perhaps an unpopular opinion, but I do believe that Vivian did genuinely want the TT data to be confined to the purpose of contact tracing. I would even go as far as to say that had he been consulted about whether the police could have the rights to this data, he would likely have rejected this request. Politicians are not idiots - anyone could see the possible repercussions and the 'slippery slope' arguments that such an authorisation could trigger.

What it seems happened to me was that the information was accessed, then he was informed of it afterwards, which forced him to explore 'damage control' options. Unfortunately, his deliberations such as changing the law came to nothing, so we were left with a late confession, and many feeling there was a lack of transparency. On this issue of their breech of promise, I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt till this point.

The deeper and more pertinent issue here seems to be the state's view towards personal data as a whole, manifested strongly here in the CPC. It seems to me that the police were able to access the TT data as and when they liked, despite knowing full well the promises which were made to protect this data(if they did not, this is an even greater case for concern...). Was anyone consulted before they could access this data? No matter what the importance the investigation had into our national security, *was there any respect given for the confidentiality of the data*? These responses by the ministers do not give me confidence in accountability or transparency in future cases where a trade-off has to be made between security and privacy/confidentiality.

Valuing security above all may have worked for us in the past, but in a time where data is becoming more and more potent, there are certainly valid concerns about infringements of privacy and rights.

This one? By the way, MHA is not the one who charged, it was the AGC who has Prosecutorial discretion. It refers to the AGC's power to decide who to prosecute, when to prosecute and how to prosecute. This power comes from the Constitution, where Article 35(8) states: The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.""

In plain terms, this means that AGC decides who to charge and who not to charge.

It's a separation of powers thing. The Parliament and AGC are independent bodies. The AGC can only enforce laws/legislation according to the statutes. The 377A issue it's that it's still in the Penal Code, and it's up to the courts to prosecute, not the politician. The AGC can't just ignore a statute willy-nilly (there goes the legal system) and it's up to parliament to repeal. not going to discuss 377a but the law is the law.",2021-01-05 23:30:54

But I'm surprised they dared to highlight it at all though. I think this was a pilot test because someone up there realised TT could be used for criminal investigation, and they wanted to see if it worked. Then the smart plan would be to bring up the possibility like they never actually tried it first, while knowing that it works, announce the plan, then when it works again -> hooray, this works.

"> It's a separation of powers thing. The Parliament and AGC are independent bodies.

Except in our Westminster-inspired system, parliament and the executive (especially with the PAP supermajority) are close to being one and the same.

If the Attorney-General answers to the Prime Minister, can their office really say no?",2021-01-06 00:33:00
"I quote PM Lee's speech in 2007 ad verbatim.

>They don't have to go underground. We don't harass gays. The Government does not act as moral policeman. And we don't proactively enforce Section 377A on them.

You might be right that technically, yes the AGC charges, but pretty sure without police investigation with an intention to present evidence that will culminate in a charge under 377A, nothing will happen.

It's splitting hairs to say that oh, the Cabinet was not wrong and are innocent in that they were not the ones who enforced the charge; the AGC did. They own the instruments of law from the Penal Code all the way until the entrance of the courthouse, it's semantical to claim innocence on their end. As Min of Law and Min of HA Sham does have considerable sway on the conduct of the AGC; even if he was not privy to the decision to charge, the fact that a legal outcome contrary to the intentions of the government of the day occurred, should trigger a repeal, but we all know how that turned out. That's why I did mention that the AG ""clarified"" their position by saying that they retain the right to choose whether to charge, so either the AG was behaving contrary to the Government of the day's intentions, or the government lied and issued false promises while avoiding the moral quandry of a repeal.",2021-01-06 00:10:00
"If the interpretation of PM's statement is not twisted then I don't know what is. PM makes that claim in Parliament in 2007, and in 2008 someone is charged with it. The outcome clearly does not match his official statement and public intention. Sure, you might say the AG did not actually need to twist or give any shit about PM's official statement since it's entirely within his right as an independent body, but that's purely semantical if we consider all the instruments of law before the decision reached the AGC.

I do know that the AGC decides what to charge a suspect with based on police evidence. But if the police follows the intention of the government and not investigate or present evidence that affirms an offence under 377A, would the AGC have any legs to stand on and make the charge happen? Now surely you can't say that the Police that operates under the auspices of MHA is independent and does not obey the intentions of our PM.

As AGC is the one who charges and makes this decision independently of the government of the day or the Cabinet (as it rightfully should be), then what right or authority did PM Lee have to claim there will be no active enforcement, whatever ""enforcement"" and by whom means? If he is aware of the separations of powers that might create an outcome that he guaranteed will not happen, shouldn't he initiate a bill to repeal and remove the agency from AGC after the fact?

We all know what happened after the fact. Promise was made, people were charged, 3 constitutional challenges were made, courts shrugged their shoulder and went ""letter of law says so, go ask the legislature to repeal if you're not happy"", Cabinet went ""moral courage silent majority something something"" and issue was forgotten again. 13 years in the making. And we still made no progress. 

TLDR; Cabinet wants to have their cake and eat it; play the good cop and say no enforcement, but acts blur when someone actually gets charged and do nothing to repeal. Stop defending them and letting them get away on technicalities and bureaucratic red tapes. Sham is both MinLaw and MinHA. They have all the powers to make the change they claim they want to see, but stop short of actually doing anything despite all the powers and instruments of law they wield.",2021-01-06 14:15:11

On top of that, many phones have in built QR scanners so some also dont see a need for downloading an app for check in and out. I personally use singpass for safeentry (as compared to QR scanner) bc of the check in/out function. 

Safeentry was an easier option to many hence I didnt expect them to plan to remove safeentry (via singpass/qr scanner) in the first place.

If this becomes mandatory, as a government, it is basically the wet dream that facial recognition was meant to achieve, but which kept running into false positives and got outright destroyed by face masks becoming mandatory. The idea that with access to any public security camera, I can conclusively identify anyone's presence at a place. Only in this case, I don't even have to contend with any pesky error margins in identification - I *know* for a fact that token was assigned to you, and if you weren't carrying that token, that's a sure sign that something else fishy is afoot.

Now, we usually make all sorts of allusions as to how governments might abuse this system, but most people aren't moved by the phrase ""violation of privacy"". They think it's totally fine if their location is known at all times by the government. As long as there's no cost to their personal lives, they don't understand why privacy would be important. So I'm going to try to put myself in the position of a hyper-motivated career-centric sociopath hellbent on squeezing every drop of performance out of this system to shatter my KPIs.

First of all, consider an implementation of the ideal case of total tracking with this system. If you divide Singapore into a grid of twenty-meter squares and place an Internet-enabled sensor in the middle of each one, assuming that the overwhelming majority of individuals abide by the law and keep their tokens near them, the system will be able to track the current geographical location of everyone 24/7, to within 20 meters, as long as they reside within my borders.

Of course, the real implementation won't be remotely as dense, but it's to illustrate the general principle. In actuality, all I really have to do is put them within densely populated population centers and chokepoints, and I can extrapolate the rest of that information to a reasonable degree of accuracy.

So what can I do with something like that? Oh, a whole bunch of nice, nice things to *help* people. It offers me a level of probabilistically-accurate insight that has hitherto never been possible. I can know which parents pick up their kids from school, and which do not - that's going to be a factor in allocating parental subsidies. I can know how long those students spend at LAN shops after school - say goodbye to that scholarship, by the way, there's another student with your test scores who doesn't waste their time like that. I know you've been slacking off on your gym visits - you think that's not going to affect your neo-Medishield coverage? Now you don't have to push yourself to be a model citizen - we'll help you do it. If you don't put in the necessary amount of effort, there are people more deserving, you know? What? You feel like you're being forced to hit goals? Oh, no no no, you can do whatever you like. It's just that we believe in rewarding hardworking Singaporeans, you know. It's a wide range of programmes which leverage the system, applied equally to all. For people who fall through the cracks and get judged unfairly, well...we're working on other initiatives to stop that from happening, but no progress comes without pain, right? Of course, as long as you do what everyone else does and not stand out, you should be fine...

Realize - to manipulate behavior on a vast scale, you don't necessarily have to institute penalties. Sufficient incentives, or *the lack of them*, are enough.

Now you might say, oh, that's just fear-mongering, it's never going to happen, people won't stand for it, etc, etc. The problem is that once the tool has been built, the idea of your location being known at all times becomes normalized. The culture we will have then will be drastically different from what we have now, and I believe without a doubt that it will let *something* through, something that would previously be considered completely unthinkable today. No one seriously thought, when cellphones were invented, that they would inevitably bring about social expectations where you aren't allowed to read messages without responding, where you're expected to reply to email outside of work hours, where teleconferences at 3am would be taken in stride because it 'can't be helped' and you're still have to come into the office a few hours later. Today, certainly, you can ""choose"" not to do all that, if you enjoy watching your career coast gently to a dead end and your social circles drift away. And remember, all of that real impact comes from simple common social expectations arising from new capabilities of technology - not a law.

This degree of normalization of the tracking mindset also brings other 'benefits' to factions other than the government. For one, it makes for *great* employee time management. Mm, last week you came back from lunch break five minutes late, and you spent a total of a hour last week in the toilet, a whopping 25% more than other employees...That's going on the next performance review. And before you think that this is far-fetched, [Amazon is already doing this.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/technology/amazon-wristband-tracking-privacy.html)

The words ""slippery slope"" normally convey an impression of an unstoppable progression of policy implementation. But the true slippery slope is in the minds of the citizens, not the policy makers. When this technology is commonplace, we'll just accept things like this. Sure, we'll complain, but the system will be eventually seen as an inescapable fact of life. After all, it won't be all bad. You'll get to register for many shop memberships with your token ID, so you don't have to lug around a whole bunch of cards! You'll get points just for the amount of time you spend inside the store! It's all okay because only the government knows what NRIC is linked to the token ID, so it's totally private. See, privacy is important.

I watched the entirety of the [MMTF press conference from 9 Sep 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNOcUieEFgU) and read the [press release about TT & SafeEntry](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/tracetogether-and-safeentry-to-be-enhanced-in-preparation-for-further-opening-of-the-economy). Below are my interpretations.

Based on what I understand from the press conference, it is not mandatory to use TT. The government's stance is still to encourage more people to get on board for TT, which main purpose is to shorten the time taken to contact trace as much as possible. There is no requirement to install the app or to collect the token.

For people concerned with privacy, isn't SafeEntry legit much worse than TT? Dr. Vivian B. did mention in the press con that if someone is confirmed to be infected, their identity is relayed to the contact tracing team. I suppose based on the patient details from the lab, they will already be able to get some information of the individual's family members, colleagues, *where he/she went based on SafeEntry information they already have on records*. Only if he/she is a user of TT and approves the uploading of data, then will TT play further part in contact tracing. [Link to press con portion](https://youtu.be/dNOcUieEFgU?t=3472)

The trial for usage of SafeEntry with TT seems to be in view of the relaxation of the MICE restrictions as borders open progressively.

Honestly when MOH first released their annex Cs every night with the places that confirmed cases had visited, I was wondering what good it does. Someone visited FairPrice Xtra from 1pm - 2.30pm. However it is a huge hypermarket, how useful is that information? This is where I can see how TT will help narrow down the area and people involved.",2020-09-10 04:37:56
"My own experience but this is how it changed: 
When TraceTogether was first announced, there was a lot of backlash. Redditporeans upvoted the backlash comments.

There was clarification by the G and people became ok with it. I continued to raise privacy concerns and I was downvoted to oblivion. Some time went on.

Then there was the tokens announced. Reddit went crazy. The backlash was strong. It was compared to ankle bracelets. 

Similar pattern, Viv clarified, Singapore was satisfied, life went on. I commented something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not carrying this Orwellian shit around‚Äù and I was downvoted and scolded.

Now we can observe the same pattern. There is backlash, government will clarify. People will be satisfied, life goes on. 

This cycle will continue to happen. Something even worse will be announced, clarifications and concessions will be made, people will be lulled. It will repeat until we have the entirety of our balls handed over to the government. 

In all likelihood, the current government does this with good intentions. Future governments would think like this: But why should good intentions stop with a pandemic? Why shouldn‚Äôt this data acquisition and privacy breech extend further to other facets of society? Surely, Good Samaritans will be safe if we were to track everyone‚Äôs movements and bring crime to a complete stop. Why be worried if you don‚Äôt do anything wrong?

I don‚Äôt have an answer to those questions but what I can guarantee is that ‚Äúgood‚Äù is subjective and a future government, as well intentioned as they think they are, might not be ‚Äúgood‚Äù.

What can we do as citizens? Show them that their power is not to be taken for granted. Our only voice is our vote every 4 years.",2020-09-10 11:55:32

"> they are willing to risk people slipping through the cracks by not imposing quarantines on everyone at an affected location

This is the current practice. We hear cases visiting here and there but no blanket SHNs are thrown. We certainly want to quarantine people at an adjacent table from where a case has his meal but not the entire restaurant - and this granularity is not possible with only SafeEntry.

> Now I have to enter my particulars into the app and have it saved there, ready for hacking? Ready for abuse by the government?

TraceTogether app data is not uploaded to the servers (you can request for code review), and will be deleted after 25 days.

In my current understanding of the design
- The government already knows when you enter a mall. You give them this information with SafeEntry. It seems that nobody disagrees with SafeEntry. 
- The token is more layman-auditable than the TraceTogether app. You can break apart the token to see that there is no Wifi capabilities.
- To track movement, the government will need to install beacons everywhere (i.e. something like another TraceTogether token). To track movement real time they would need stream the data through Internet.",2020-09-10 01:19:42

"> In practice? I don't buy it. The conservative course of action would be to quarantine everyone, to be safe. You mean to tell me that on the one hand, the govt is so concerned about inadequate contact tracing that they need to make this mandatory, but on the other hand, they are willing to risk people slipping through the cracks by not imposing quarantines on *everyone* at an affected location? The reasoning does not gel 

This is a real problem that I think the author does not fully appreciate. 

My perspectives come from the construction sector, and I believe this TraceTogether initiative draws lessons from the same place. 

The fact is that blanket, conservative quarantines are *ridiculously* disruptive to people's lives and businesses, and is a factor outside most people's circle of control.

I've had migrant worker colleagues issued quarantine orders on the basis of being allocated the same staircase as a confirm case. This kind of ""carpet bomb"" quarantine approach means large portions of workforce gets taken out of action seemingly randomly.

For an industry where mobilization costs are high and things need to be scheduled and coordinated in advance, I cannot overstate how disruptive this is. To make the measures more surgical and targeted would reap significant benefits. 

> *What is the problem you are trying to solve*? Low adoption? Mandate Trace Together downloads (not the registration or linking with NRIC). That, together with Safe Entry, should get you enough of the way there. Isn't Trace Together a supplement? Isn't this enough? I am not convinced with any of the messaging thus far.

TraceTogether is already mandated in the construction sector and is *checked daily* as a condition to work. Despite all this, adoption is low.

"Some purely positive outcomes:

The token would reduce manpower demand for SafeEntry. Just show the token, may not need two people per entrance. Existing personnel could be redeployed to other closed entrances, reducing fire risks and improving footfall, or take up (tougher) jobs as SDA/digital ambassador. (Edit: this scenario is not in the cards for now as check in with the token will be facilitated with [the QR code at the back](https://support.safeentry.gov.sg/hc/en-us/articles/900002439963-How-to-check-in-with-TraceTogether-Token-).

A [growing consensus](https://ipvm.com/reports/temp-screening-effect) among Western health leaders of temperature screening being [ineffective security theatre](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/paging-dr-hamblin-temperature-checks-coronavirus/615190/) may mean an upcoming elimination of this requirement. This would cement the reduction in manpower for SafeEntry. 

We are currently not in the position of being pressured to increase mandatory SafeEntry to more stores or even public transport. Edit: SafeEntry is also ineffective for large venues where visitors spend extended durations, like malls, department stores, libraries, even some supermarkets. Asking everyone in the area during a certain time to track their symptoms for 14 results in a lot of anxiety in aggregate, especially in situations like the NTU failure. 

Fundamentally, TraceTogether information is accessed only if you ping long (and close?) enough to a confirmed case. If TraceTogether becomes mandatory for entry to facilities by private companies or law, minimising trips outside *which you are still supposed to do* would reduce the risk of you having your data accessed.  If you are forced to unnecessarily work in the office, report to MOM, if not your MP and the Manpower ministers email address.

regarding restaurants - SafeEntry already covers it, no? it already allows for contact tracing based on restaurants. rather than the government choosing to only isolate those at nearby tables, I'd feel much safer if everyone in the restaurant was isolated since to this date we don't really have a detailed idea of how it spreads in different conditions. I mean one of the reasons SafeEntry was introduced was precisely because memory based contact tracing is unreliable. if we are talking about other circumstances, like you're hanging out with your friends at a place that does not require checking in - surely you'd remember your friends.

the argument made that it's for older people/groups who are too poor to own smart phones doesn't even hold up since SafeEntry also accepts NRIC.

Appreciate your responses, I thought I would be the one getting downvotes for my perspective but I am glad that people are looking at both sides of the argument. All in the spirit of good discussions :)

The concern for privacy is definitely on the minds of a lot of people since there were plans to use digital tools for contact tracing. Obviously things can go south subsequently as with any other databases or measures (for all we know BT beacons may already be all around us?), but from their actions so far e.g. open sourcing Blue Trace and tearing down of TT token, IMO they are trying hard to demonstrate that there isn't really any intent to track us for other reasons.

With this pandemic slowly and maybe already turning endemic, unfortunately similar tracing systems may well be the necessary to save some industries from collapsing altogether. MICE is the first one that comes to mind and hence the trial they are trying to push. It remains to be seen what other functions they will continue to push the ""SafeEntry + TT"" coupling to, but I think it will be more for specialized large scale events like exhibitions + wedding banquets that involve large number of people eating and talking for extended periods of time.

To add on Blue Trace was open sourced in the hopes of other countries also using it, but unfortunately it did not take off. Presumably it is due to privacy concerns, the semi-uselessness on iOS (I thought it was improved but it seems TT still does not work well for iOS devices?) and the Apple & Google API in development then. Based on what I read & understand, this API helps but without intervention by authorities, the general population just do not care enough to actually do what the app recommends (e.g. suggest to go for a swab, but how many actually go?).",2020-09-10 11:59:27

It seems like they're intent on forcing this SE+TT combo into everything down the line.


The review by the opensource reviewers also leaves much to be desired since the one I read basically said that a large portion of what goes in was not available for review, and their conclusion was that it may be necessary due to time constraints but should be subject to further review and a potential hackathon and then we hear nothing about it since. They also reviewed a first gen TT device, who knows what changes it has undergone in the last 3 months? 


If anything, the data seems to suggest that the community cases are decreasing and that it is no longer a matter of utmost emergency to implement TT that we cannot waste any time to review it for privacy concerns before rolling it out. 


As usual, the heavy handed implementation, together with the ""Trust us, we won't abuse the power"" just leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.",2020-09-10 14:12:36
"What I would say is that this device is open to abuse. It is a significant intrusion into our lives and by the time it becomes prevalent, it will be too late. Like I‚Äôve said in multiple places, all this constant citing of experts tearing down the device fails to acknowledge that they were only provided limited access to an initial version. There have been no follow ups since then even though one of the experts (not even sure whether really expert btw) said there was supposed to be a public hackathon. Doesn‚Äôt fill me with confidence.",2020-09-10 12:04:41

"The thing is that the efficacy of Safeentry by itself is still possible to be rolled back once everyone stops scanning the QR codes (or it stops being enforced strictly).

So this will breach privacy even more.",2020-09-10 14:05:53
"The difference being a balance of power. Can you reject SE and still go in? Can you reject mask mandate? Can you reject laws in your everyday life in Singapore? No, because you'd get arrested and tried in a court of law. 


On the flip side, if the government does what's being discussed who is going to arrest and try them? We're already seeing arguments in this very thread about part 2 (""You already give data with SE, what's wrong with TT?"") and you see comments everywhere (fb, here, news sites) where it's all about ""Govt knows best, just do what they tell you to do"" without further examination. 


Besides, we also have our vaunted ""track record"" to fall back on. The ISA was enacted initially with a defined end point (communist threat). It morphed from ""It's imperative we have it to counter communist threats from MCP"" to ""It allows us to counter espionage and terrorism"" to ""safety and security of Singapore is paramount"" to continue to justify its existence even today, many decades after its initial end point was passed.


The point is that once you consolidate all this huge amounts of data into the hands of the government, it's very hard to convince them to let it go. It'll start off innocuous enough (This big data will allow us to catch offenders), then move into a realm hard to argue against (TT allows us to contact all nearby people when a crime has been perpetuated, don't you want to help catch criminals?) to matters of convenience (This big data will allow us to plan transport routes more efficiently, don't you want efficiency and a shorter travel time?) and soon it'll be a given that such data *should* be provided to the government for urban planning or whatever reason.

"Hope that they do follow up for the further review too.

The community cases are indeed under control now and per you mentioned, not an emergency. However further easing of measures in hopes to opening more of the economy will likely cause an increase in community spread as people interact more. This ""SafeEntry + TT"" is the plan that they are rolling out to counter the expected increase.

I actually do not feel that they are taking a heavy-handed approach this time round, in fact they are rolling this out ridiculously slow manner. Like they are fearing backlash ;). If they had wanted to, they really could have just pushed it out way quicker than what is happening now. I think Singaporeans are very clear on how efficient they can be if they really wanted to.

Personally I do not think this coupling will be implemented to everything down the line, but only in settings whereby it is necessary. For example, I don't see it necessary in a restaurant because safe distancing is already in place, unless they further ease up measures to pre-covid times, or allow buffets again.

That said, government may decide if it works well enough to just implement across the board, which means your fears coming true.

Yeah! Because the pandemic is not over.

I'm not saying no country permanently lost rights, Soviet Russia didn't get their rights back, but I'm saying countries of all kinds can and do put rights on pause in crisis.    
And they do give the rights back.

Taking an extreme example, if one day the press statement is that all COVID carriers should be taken out back and shot (because 100% chance if person is dead he's least likely to move around and infect other people), should we just go along with it until after the pandemic to decide if that's a good/bad idea?

If the present is the new normal, and all current restrictions remain as they are now, frankly I do not mind.

However what about the others who are not so lucky? Those that have lost their jobs? Those that need to be out and about? I heard the people from MICE industries were not getting any assistance from the govt unlike the aviation industry - but they are also hit extremely hard.

"After reading the whole thread and OP's replies, I've found that OP has some skewed conceptions about the security aspects and concerns about this whole thing.

Firstly,

>A. Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. ""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.

Lmao. For someone who sounds so technologically informed, I was surprised when I realised what OP wrote when I read this for the second time. Sounds like OP is confusing the difference between hash and encryption, which should be a basic concept in the field of IT/Cybersecurity.

Furthermore, phone numbers in Singapore are 8 digits, and either starts with 8xxx xxxx or 9xxx xxxx. Brute forcing the combination with a self-made list containing all the possible phone numbers isn't really that hard to do, and won't take up a lot of time, considering the computing and processing power that computers have these days.

OP also replied to one of the comments by saying "" There isn't anything inherently scary about bluetooth"". Well, let me introduce you to [Bluejacking](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5045/bluejacking), [Bluebugging](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5044/bluebugging) & [Bluesnarfing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5046/bluesnarfing).

Building on what I've said earlier about Bluetooth, if some siaokia really wants to, he can build a malicious version of the app, and use it to extract the supposedly anonymous information, or modify the payload and send malware into other devices using Bluetooth.

OP subsequently said the following in another of his replies:

>And do you think in this time of a pandemic that cybercriminals are roaming about with massive bluetooth hijacking setups in order to walk next to what is potentially another virus carrier? You have to be within bluetooth range and you have to handshake with the right authentication or permission for bluetooth access. I would take my chances with that over the possible spread of COVID19, which is a clear, imminent danger and proven threat.

You'd be surprised. The value of the information may outweigh the risk of contracting of the virus to some, and some hackers would still take the risk of getting into a crowded idea just to hijack other devices. If they are that scared of the virus, they can easily minimise the risk by driving around in a car, carrying out a [wardriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving) bluetooth attack.

OP is also operating under the presumption that hackers won't want to go out and gather all that information/deliver malware during this period. That's like saying ""Oh I shouldn't leave my housedoor locked, it's too much of a hassle. It's COVID period now. who would want to break into my house, right?""

OP keeps insisting that he isn't some government employee, and that he isn't paid to do this. But with how much of a tryhard he is in this thread, I honestly doubt so.

I'm not here to discourage people from downloading the app, but I'm here to inform people of the potential risks that they're getting into by downloading this app/prolonging their use of bluetooth, and to point out OP's flaw in logic/misconception as well.

At the end of the day, the code is not open-sourced, so we can only speculate for sure.",2020-03-21 14:29:48

""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.""

My friend unfortunately LOL'd hard

Firstly, if the hash can be broken with a password, and the hash property of being one way algorithm and has no key needed does not hold water. This looks more like encryption. Some people mix up hashing and encrypting often.

Secondly, given the size and space of Singapore's phone number, digits size of 8, each from 0 to 9, it is rather quick to brute force to calculate all hashes, even if the hashing is implemented correctly indeed.",2020-03-21 13:02:19

"I like Trace Together as a concept very much and I think the team have done an excellent job.

Contact tracing is best done without excessive interaction, and less reliance on faulty human memory. Bluetooth Low Energy was built for this.

I'm also heartened by the approach of storing the data as a local blob which never leaves your phone unless the user AND MOH both validate.

This is important to prevent false positives (DOS/spam attack vector) from pranksters by requiring MOH validation, and address concerns of Orwellian state sponsored surveillance by requiring user opt-in. If people have unaddressed security concerns, they won't install and we fail to get the critical mass needed for this to work.

In the Straits Times article
""When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.""

This stance just discourages people from installing, they can't be charged for not allowing release of information they don't have. 

Using this stick approach narrows the user acquisition funnel, for marginal enforcement gain at best. 
If a user has already installed the app, at the cost of battery life, system resources and privacy, they've already committed at some level, threatening prosecution to secure permission they've already implied at point of install, comes at the cost of turning many potential users off with draconian enforcement. 

That said, it's not stated on the CNA article, so that may not be the official policy stance. If that's the case, the Straits Times article should be corrected so it doesn't discourage installs due to fear of recrimination. 

In my opinion, it's better to set incentives by giving privileged access to critical and scarce services to people who use the app.
Eg: higher queue preference for testing and ICU given to people based on length of days running the app.

I understand these are in the plans (based on the lead's Facebook comments) , which would be great because the more eyes we have on the code, with adequate responsible disclosure, the global infosec community can help this improve, and reduce unforeseen bugs or exploits which leak or compromise user data and result in loss of confidence in the system.

Also, it allows other countries with less sophisticated contact tracing infrastructure & manpower to leverage on this work to secure their populations. Safer neighbours means less imported cases and helping them helps us eventually.

2. That said, MOH having the key doesn't make me feel any safer. MOH has had numerous breaches over the last few years putting their security measures and vigilance into question.
3. Further, in a nanny-like state in Singapore, it is not unfathomable that some guy in the investigative services decide that hey let's try to use this to check if some suspect us associated with XYZ. 
4. As much as I hate using this word, big data is actually a thing. While the app may not call home, knowing the location of just a few users it will be able to create what is effectively the geolocation of your phone.

The secret sauce is then what is the algorithm? It surely isn't some polymorphic cipher; because otherwise it's not reversible. What's stopping an adversary from decompiling the Android APK and identifying how the data is encoded and creating their own rogue TraceTogether?

What's more, there are glaring security concerns for leaving an essentially open beacon up on everyone's phone that's willing and accepting any information requests from any similar beacon - which is as good as leaving your level 1 window sill open. Well equipped adversaries can exploit this on unpatched devices to force feed data onto your phone.

This token is some strange alphanumeric string, and the tin can slit is only big enough and shaped in a special way that only those specially shaped tokens can be put in. If the government finds someone ill with the virus, they will open up the tin with their special key, and then read the specially encoded alphanumeric string with their own special cipher. 

This special cipher is a very strong encryption. It is only feasible to break this encryption if you have the master key, which only the government possess. All your other concerns are valid, but very very unlikely to happen.

"**Salt (cryptography)**

In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods.

Going by this logic - 
When you go overseas (hopefully not any time soon), do you bother locking your luggage? It's really easy to defeat those locks, so there's no need for a lock. In fact your house door lock can be picked, why bother locking your door? 

Yes, the government has other ways to track you. But every additional bit of data can be aggregated to give an even better picture of people. Yes, good things can be done with it, and bad things can also be done with it.

Now say it wasn't a potential terrorist but a murderer. Would you?

Then what if it wasn't a murderer, but a loanshark?

There's a slippery slope here, and while we're nowhere near what most people define as ""unacceptable"", we're slowly heading down that path.

"This logic is taken out of context & misconstruing the wholesome purpose of the app. What OP just says is that there is no advantage for the govt to need this app to monitor you for illicit purposes, if they wanted. They have enough monitoring for that. 

There are pro/cons to every solution, and this app if used wisely, makes lot of sense targeting at this growing anomaly. I‚Äôm not sure why the radical terrorist / murderer / criminal / scammers would be silly enough to use the app. But if this app has a secondary purpose, it makes even more sense to me. Political purposes? This sounds like a desperate move, and the reputation risk is too high. Aside, I don‚Äôt think the sitting party is politically desperate - in fact, its probably otherwise but let‚Äôs not digress. 

Granted, there are probably a lot of real situations that will reveal itself overtime. But the app design logically makes sense right now, and respects user privacy. 

If you think carefully about i - This tracing is a granular trace that probably includes the parameters of both time & distance - eg they would eventually filter all the contacts you made via public transport. Each contact link data is stored locally & deleted after 21 days. It protects you as much as the other party using it. 

Now, this data is uploaded for analysis only when a user turns into a COVID-19 victim, with consent. If someone you came into contact with us COVID-19 positive, you can be contacted if both of you were using the app! Primary & secondary contact links can then be established using basic search algorithms. 

Privacy is used to protect you, but being overtly protective of privacy can also hurt you.

That's the contradiction I pointed out in my OP. If I sat next to an infected person, it is unlikely that they have the app and that they are aware that they are infected in the first place.

If they had the app, they are unlikely to leave their quarantined premises. Why?

Putting the idea of ""I will be caught leaving my house if I use this app"" aside, we need to keep in mind that this person downloaded this app with the reason to reduce the spread of the virus. Hence my assumption.

It doesn't make sense that someone would download this app *and* leave their quarantine zone. Otherwise, my question of ""Had there been many cases where someone was caught breaking quarantine? "" is still valid.

If ""time"" is your point here, there is a 14 day incubation period [or more](https://www.businessinsider.sg/wuhan-coronavirus-symptoms-24-days-after-infection-2020-2?op=1&r=US&IR=T) for someone to be infected without major symptoms. This doesn't help with time.

Other than that, it does make sense that this app is to reduce the time to locate those who were contacted by the infected.

My point is that everything the government is doing, including this, is slowly but surely expanding the boundaries of what data they can collect on us, and how they can use it.

The hypothetical examples were meant to illustrate how much leeway the government has currently, and how the data can potentially be used. 

Straits Times has already said that if you are infected, the consent is taken away from you and you will be compelled to give it up.

Once you consent to the data being uploaded (or, in the case of contact tracing, the data is forcibly taken from you), you can no longer control how it is used. Private sector has laws on how data can be used, and it's enforced in the PDPA. Government is exempt from these laws, and not just for security purposes.

So that's why we should not be downloading this app - we should not be allowing the government to continue to push the boundaries of what is acceptable without proper discussion, using the virus as an excuse. The benefit of this app is marginal at best - the Government has already said that transient contact is not dangerous, and hence contact tracing is only done for sustained contact (<2m for >30min?).

I‚Äôm not sure how much usage data they will collect, since it‚Äôs not stated in the FAQ, but assuming they at least check if the app has been used ‚Äúx‚Äù times a day and duration, it will give a clear picture on whether or not to rely on these users.

My experience with users will suggest that they‚Äôll be super enthusiastic the first few days and then forget about it if it‚Äôs hard to use.

They should've been upfront and honest. I wouldn't have got the token if I knew about this.

It also affects how much the government truly values consent and the respect of Singaporean citizen. Betraying their trust is just plain wrong, either by lying or by failing to communicate this point. If it weren't brought up yesterday in Parliament, they would have continued to use it for investigations behind our backs.

Contact tracing is good. This, at best, failure to communicate a **very key detail** of the data stored to citizens betrays any sense of agency an individual has.

"Okay, help me out here.

When TT was first rolled out, VB and his team indicated that TT data can ONLY be used for contact tracing. Not PRIMARILY. This has implications.

From hindsight, we can either deduce that (1) there was a legal carveout to protect TT data from CPC section 20 or (2) VB's team just simply overlooked it only to discover it later.

Case 1: Obviously, no. That didn't happen.

Case 2: Okay, so when VB and his team announced TT and indicated its ONLY INTENDED use, Shan and Desmond Tan just.... said nothing to correct VB and his team? I'm sure Shan and Desmond Tan know the existence of section 20 of the CPC does have all encompassing powers for data retrieval when it comes to criminal investigations, right? So the moment when VB discovers that section 20 of the CPC applies to TT data, he also... said nothing to the public? You gotta be serious.

I understand that having an investigative authority with broad powers is the price of admission to living in Singapore. However, pulling off this sleight of hand is just.... uncool. And of course, yes yes, pandemic rush, icantwaittogophase3, overworked civil servants, lack of time, national emergency yada yada...

The argument that ""you have nothing to be afraid of if you're not a criminal"" wouldn't convince me that it can't be abused.

edit to add: you can delete apps like facebook and google. you can use alternatives or extensions to block their tracking. you can turn off location on your phone. you cannot opt out of TT. it is not the same. you have 0 choice in this matter. when they make TT mandatory for entry into any location, your only option is to be shut out of society and blocked from entering any location or have the TT. there's also zero guarantee they won't change the law to make it illegal to not have TT.

There is no legal mechanism AFAIK for MOH to refuse a police request.

As I have repeatedly said elsewhere, that means even only a Safeentry regime, or the Apple-Google model (assuming they can crack it and/or somehow obtain the IDs of targeted persons), would be subject to the same investigatory powers.

"Did some more research. It was present in the 2009 CPC bill already, as it gives the police the ""power to order document or other thing"" and enhanced in the Criminal Justice Reform Act 2018  to include ""data"" as defined in the Computer Misuse Act.

It's fairly essentially as it's the only law I can find that gives courts/police legal power to acquire documents for evidence. This was likely expanded as the definition of documents would not be sufficient to include digital data in order to keep up with the modern age (ala is a CCTV recording a document?). TraceTogether data is data there's no question there.

I reckon ""Section 40 Power to access decryption information"" should be of the essence here as it's gives the Public Prosecutor the ability to authorise police to exercise the power to obtain decrypted information (TraceTogether data is encrypted). At least this requires the case to go to court? The argument can be made here that this is too expansive but on the other hand if repealed it may be challenging to acquire evidence to prove guilt/innocence (i.e. the police have no right to ask for documents/data) and potentially lead to a breakdown of rule of law. 

Ultimately the question is, how much power should the courts/police have to gain access to information?

"Many people like to say that all the necessary parts are already in place for us to be tracked, so how is this different? But in a crucial sense that has nothing to do with the technology involved; it is much more serious. Because it legitimizes it and makes future potentially unsavory uses of such a system extraordinarily difficult to rally against.

Accepting a tracker requires a level of participation that can no longer be defended by it being an unavoidable side-effect of a better reason; for example, to use a cell phone, the cell towers must necessarily know which cell you're in. To accept a tracker is to agree that there do exist valid reasons for the government to know the location of its people at all times, with no other upside. 

Once you agree with that, the only hurdle left is expanding the list of acceptable reasons. And this is a trivial matter - all that is required is to emphasize the benefits and put off the potential problems as unrelated or to be handled in the future. It is terribly difficult to defend abstract principles such as privacy when faced with seductive real-world applications and results like catching a murderer, radicals, or greatly streamlining the transport system. No doubt the implementation of such applications will also be well-charted out and assuredly satisfy their goals. 

""It would be a waste not to..."" is a phrase that will come up very often. At some point, there will be a benefit that will seem to be so trivial to implement, and yet so necessary as to be idiotic *not* to use the tracking system or its data. The scope of tracking then tightens to satisfy the reasons proposed, and again it is difficult to say no, because then opponents will be, directly or indirectly, opposing the good cause for which it is intended. Already today, if you tell people you aren't installing TraceTogether out of privacy concerns, some will tell you you're being selfish and its a trivial sacrifice to stop the pandemic. 

The same scenario will happen once the tracker is normalized. I cannot imagine any viable opposition that can stall enhancement to tracking capabilities for long once a compelling-enough reason is found, with no consideration for potential abuse. After all, the abuse is only ""potential"", but the benefit is imminent. If tracking capability is stalled by an opposing faction in the government, that faction achieves nothing except upholding of privacy, and likely has to burn bridges doing so, but a faction in the government which succeeds in implementing enhanced tracking measures has everything to gain, because the effects will be observable.

People always think that, ""Oh, as long as we keep the bad people from using it for bad purposes, there's no problem with having such data."" But even a completely benevolent government is still made out of tens of thousands of individuals and departments with different aims, priorities, abilities, and problems. No one thinks of themselves as evil, or having evil goals. Yet a large organization can still produce behavior that is recognizably, undeniably malevolent.

Already with the suggested capability, off the top of my head I can come up with several usages that could possibly be attractive enough to implement and acceptable to some people, while deeply uncomfortable to others. Let's say the tracker doesn't track location, but only other trackers near it, and timestamps. (Nevertheless, it would be trivial in such a case to place trackers at known public locations to serve as landmarks.)

>A student's tracker is observed to often disappear from the vicinity of his parents' trackers at night. Sometimes it re-emerges near those of a certain group of friends, and sometimes it is out of range of any other trackers for a long time. The monitoring system flags the student as engaging in potentially delinquent or dangerous activity, and recommends counselling.
 

>Tracing is expanded as a natural progression from pandemic tracing to general healthcare. This allows them to better identify unhealthy, at-risk individuals by profiling their frequent, excessive presence at places like nightclubs or bars. A health tax is proposed for these individuals to offset the costs of their supposed irresponsible behavior on society and incentivize them to reduce the frequency of their visits.

"I used to wear a blood glucose meter/sensor patch which was stuck on my arm which monitored my blood sugar levels 24/7 (if you want to read up more about it , the device is called freestyle libre and it monitors your blood sugar level every single minute - you use your Iphone app to scan the reading). I made the mistake of signing some papers so that the data was shared with the nutritionist and she could see the data/results. Even though it was for ""health"" reasons that she could monitor the glucose level, every time it went above a certain range so would send me a text message or whatsapp to ask me why and give comments such as advising me on how best to eat and how to avoid glucose spikes etc.  I found it very invasive actually because everyone has to eat three meals a day, and here was someone tracking my glucose and sending me a message every time the reading went up whether I cared for her to do so or not. So why don't I put it this way, if the government wants to make a tracking device, I don't see why they won't want to at the same time try to make some money out of it. For example, make it into a sensor patch which has a computer chip inside to monitor where you go through gps signals - then you have to use your phone to scan it every day so that the data gets sent to the government database. This is not a science fiction story. We already have the technology to do something like that. Then the government deducts money from your bank account everytime the senor patch comes off and you don't scan it - kind of like a traffic fine. Good luck to us all! The Singaporean government loves tracking and the government also has no qualms to invade other people's privacy (NEA home visits to see if you have water in your home that breeds mosquitoes).

"Snowden has brought up very salient points with regards to concerns about heightened surveillance measures as a response to the coronavirus. (search for 'Shelter in Place with Shane Smith & Edward Snowden' on YouTube).

""When I think about the future, when any of us look at where this is heading, we need to think about where we've been, and sadly, these kind of emergency powers that are born out of crises have a perfect history of abuse. I mean, down the board, whenever you look at these things, the funniest part about it in a dark way is that the emergency never ends. It becomes normalised. 

When you talk about mass surveillance, the Bush-era warrantless wiretapping program, only part of it was shut down, and it's rolled over and it's rolled over and it's rolled over. And we've performed things at the edges, but the basic practices of what was supposed to be a stopgap emergency, which was in response to another stopgap emergency, was which was, of course, the legacy of 9/11 and the Patriot Act. And we are still today engaged in the same wars that we declared nearly 20 years ago that we have not managed to escape.

You know, we had, as a result of 9/11, the rise of the nuclear Iran because their counterbalance in Iraq was ruined. We saw authoritarianism begin to creep across Western societies, places we wouldn't expect, like Hungary and Poland. As authoritarianism spreads, as emergency laws proliferate, as we sacrifice our rights, we also sacrifice our capability to arrest this slide into a less liberal and less free world. 

Do you truly believe that when the first wave, the second wave, the 16th wave of the coronavirus is a long-forgotten memory, that these capabilities will not be kept, that these data sets will not be kept? Will those capabilities begin to be applied to small-time criminality? Will they begin to be applied to political analysis? Will they begin to be applied for doing things like performing a census? Will they be used for political polling? No matter how it is being used, what is being built is the architecture of oppression. 

And you might trust who is dealing with it, you might trust who runs it. You might go, ""You know, I don't care about Mark Zuckerberg."" But someone else will have this data eventually.

However, if everyone has to wear the wearable, it will be quite annoying to some as you now have to charge an additional device and who knows how ugly it will look. If only iOS allow background Bluetooth tracking.

Tbh, for those who are scared of their location being tracked. I am sure that Google or Facebook is tracking your current location anyways. Google can even plot out on the Google Map where you have been etc.  Even if you were to turn off your GPS, Google and Facebook are still able to identify your location via your IP.

For me, there is nothing for me to be scared or worry about. I am not a big shot or someone that does illegal stuff. I see no problem for them knowing my location. After the pandemic is over I think people are free to return the device / delete the app.",2020-06-07 12:06:21

As much as TraceTogether is out there for people to help in the process of CT, some just don‚Äôt bother, like myself. I didn‚Äôt download it until I was required to by my employer. Likewise. For SafeEntry, people suck thumb need to check in but checkouts mostly aren‚Äôt enforced, leaving some sort of a gap when it comes to tracing contacts. 

I‚Äôm not involved in contact tracing processes nor am I agreeable on wearables due to privacy concerns, but I think it is for a necessary cause that we are assigned them. 

Hopefully more details are released ie. location data purely used for CT (but who knows), and a duration for when the wearables are compulsory. Say one day a vaccine is made or cases are real stable, the wearables can be returned or discarded.

"‚Ä¶ except that this oft-touted nothing-to-hide argument myopically views privacy only as a form of secrecy. A great many concerns with privacy also has nothing to do with the individual‚Äôs perceived worth to the authorities or the inclination towards crime. It has to do with informational inequality and contextual integrity.

Daniel Solove has expounded upon the issue; some key extracts as follows:

‚ÄúThe harms are bureaucratic ones ‚Äì indifference, error, abuse, frustration, and lack of transparency and accountability. 

Many government national-security measures involve maintaining a huge database of information that individuals cannot access. Indeed, because they involve national security, the very existence of these programs is often kept secret. This kind of information processing, which blocks subjects' knowledge and involvement, is a kind of due-process problem. It is a structural problem, involving the way people are treated by government institutions and creating a power imbalance between people and the government. To what extent should government officials have such a significant power over citizens? This issue isn't about what information people want to hide but about the power and the structure of government.‚Äù

Btw, Singapore was (and probably still is) a major player in all of this, and we were responsible for spying on Malaysia. This all began because of 9/11, and the US government passed the patriot act in an effort to ""protect"" Americans from foreign terrorists. It allowed law enforcement agencies to conduct warrantless wiretaps. Funny how instead of spying on foreign terrorists, the NSA is mostly spying on American citizens now.

Do you know how the nazis could round up all the Jews and force them into the ghettos, then eventually concentration camps? How did they even know who was a jew and who wasn't? Census data.

"SafeEntry will still be compulsory. It is after all still more accurate than TraceTogether (TT).

By not leveraging the Apple Google Exposure Notification API, the TT app on both Android and iOS is already not as efficient as it is needed to be effective. The protocol used in TT is also not reliable, especially on the iOS platform. The accuracy is poor and it can never be nowhere close to the seamless integration and effectiveness of what Apple and Google have came up with.

Just look at the series of complaints and issues that TT app has. Bluetooth interference with headsets, high CPU usage, high battery consumption, and some used it an entire day only to find 0 Bluetooth interactions at the end of the day.

Numerous Bluetooth exchanges would have gone missing or not captured due to this myriad of issues, and ultimately SafeEntry is still the safer bet to tracking.

What‚Äôs sad of course is the amount spent to produce these tokens (vs no cost for using the Apple Google API and yet already readily available in our devices) as well as the plastic waste generated.

Its unfortunate that we have taken a step backwards towards being a smart nation.",2020-10-04 20:56:32
"It's pretty much as he said.

SafeEntry puts you, individually identifiably, in a space when someone in that space later tests positive for COVID. It *does not* say who'd been close enough to you during your time there to have risked spreading it to you, or catching it from you; it just says that you and a positive person were in the same general space at the same time.

TraceTogether walks that positive person through their time there, allowing later recovery of (initially-)obscured identifiers of people who came close enough to that person to have a high risk for infection. Those identifiers can be traced from that point in time onward to see who *they* come close to, and so on. If your identifier (which IIUC is your Bluetooth device ID salted with some other bits) shows up in that tree strongly enough, then the personal identification associated with your identifier is requested and you get a ring or an SMS.

SafeEntry identifies you directly, but doesn't support building the contact tree needed to evaluate your risk level, and TraceTogether records _distance_ rather than _position_ (identifying you indirectly), so it can tell that you came close to Person X but not where you were at the time (which would require GPS data). The two of them together, however, get the job done. Also, the TraceTogether data shouldn't be needed (and *should* be securely destroyed, but I don't remember hearing about that) after the data is more than a couple-three months old and you haven't been flagged as being at risk by SafeEntry.

""Why not do it all in one app"", you may ask. A lot of countries do; Apple and Google developed a single app that seems to get the job done, but

a) Not Invented Here Syndrome is pandemic among policymakers here, and
b) those policymakers made a big show of committing GovTech to develop what turned into SafeEntry before any other SEA country had any real experience with the Google/Apple system.

----

TL;dr: The politicians and policymakers make it sound like a deep, dark technology problem, but it's really a deep, dark *policy* and *political culture* problem.

I can see the logic bah. Safe entry provides the vector while tracetogether identify high risk people.

"Vaccine *might* be real in a year's time, more likely 2-3. There's more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2; countries are wasting immense resources (including time and money) by not working together credibly; and new vaccines (as opposed to relatively minor variations on existing vaccines, like the annual flu jabs) often take a *lot* longer to prove both safety and effectiveness. It's little use if your new vaccine for a disease with a 5% mortality rate itself has a 25% risk of causing patient death; it's equally bad if your new multi-billion-dollar vaccine is no more effective than a placebo.

>And **he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads**:  And that **no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark,** or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is **Six hundred threescore and six**.


>Revelation 13:16‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨18 KJV

But whatever happens, NEVER take the mark of the Beast. Anyone who does will be cast into the eternal lake of fire.

>And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, **If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,  The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb**:  And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

When the second beast comes it will seem as if its something good but its not, Its a false light. Its going from evil to bad, so you think its a good thing and you are tricked into accepting the mark.

> Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, Vivian Balakrishnan, takes full responsibility for the ""consternation"" and ""anxiety"" caused by the revelation that TraceTogether data can be used for police investigations.

> Vivian said this in Parliament today (February 2), while giving his speech during the second reading of the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill.

> TraceTogether is privacy-protecting by design: Vivian

> Highlighting the importance of contact tracing, Vivian explained that TraceTogether is ""fundamentally privacy-protecting by design"".

> ""TraceTogether only collects proximity data, which is necessary to identify close contacts. TraceTogether does not collect GPS location nor movement data. Furthermore, the app and the token only keep a temporary record, in an encrypted form, locally on the device. The data is automatically purged after 25 days. The Government also intends to deactivate TraceTogether, along with other digital contact tracing programmes, once the pandemic is over.""

> On using TraceTogether data in the investigation of severe crimes, Vivian said that it would be ""unconscionable to inhibit the ability of the Police to act, when it comes to a serious offence that affects someone‚Äôs life or safety"".

> ""It would not be right ‚Äì in fact it would be untenable ‚Äì to adopt a purist ideological stance and deliberately refuse to check that data.""

> Some important points to note about TraceTogether data

> The rest of his speech touched on four key thrusts of the Amendment Bill, which you might want be apprised of:

> Firstly, the personal contact tracing data defined in the legislation covers entry or exit records, proximity information and other data collected using any digital contact tracing tools.

> Digital contract tracing tools here include TraceTogether, SafeEntry as well as BluePass (a private sector contact tracing system which can be interoperable with TraceTogether).

> Second, aside from contact tracing, the TraceTogether data can only be used for investigations or criminal proceedings of serious crimes. There are seven categories of serious crimes:

> Third, the Government cannot use the data for any purpose other than those mentioned above, regardless of any other written law requiring or allowing the disclosure of the data.

> ""This will give added assurance that there are no further scenarios where public agencies may use the data apart from the purposes stated in this Bill,"" said Vivian.

> Lastly, there is a clause in the BIll which allows the Minister to specify a date after which a digital contact tracing system is no longer required to prevent or control the spread of Covid-19. Personal contact tracing data must then be deleted.

So let‚Äôs say every year we have 1500 new people in computing. Let‚Äôs say 70% stay in software related roles (an optimistic number) so  about 1000 possible people. 

Now obviously Google doesn‚Äôt just take everyone but it takes very good people. Let‚Äôs say the top 10%. So of 1000, only 100 have what it takes to get into Google.

But then, Google is also fighting with other A names like Facebook, grab, etc. So let‚Äôs say FB also need 50, grab 50. So 150 jobs and only 100 candidates who will make the Cut. 

What do you do? Do you lower the bar for entry? Ok, this is possible, but it is unlikely you can force a company to hire someone they don‚Äôt want.  Plus, it‚Äôs not practical in the Long run. Do you ask your universities to churn out more grads? Ok, possible, but that takes time. 

Uncomfortable truth is at the bleeding edge of technology Singapore is too small to produce enough talent and big companies will want to look further afield for talent.

It also has 5% VAT and typically a 5% import duty on most goods. Some items such as alcohol and tobacco are up to 30% or even higher.

Total payroll typically is higher in say Dubai compared to Singapore and not because Singaporeans don't earn enough. Purely because you to pay to provide housing for all your foreign workers (typically 98% of your headcount). You only need 2% of locals if you're over 50 employees. It goes up to 4% in finance and 5% in insurance. They only represent 11% of the population, although this can swing wildly.

The benefit of doing business in the UAE is its close links to India. As an Indian friend of mine said, Dubai is a city built by Indians for Indians. It's basically what Singapore was for the Chinese years ago.

I stand by my point that the majority of your damn good people are going to come from people who had enough of an interest to actually study it in university. Sure, you might get a few self taught guys who are damn good but they aren‚Äôt going to add a huge number in the grand scheme of things.

The difference is that people who actually spend 4 years doing CS are more likely to have the interest and aptitude for it, and have much more exposure through school projects/internships/peer influence and consultation. How many boot camps do you think gives the equivalent? I doubt very many boot camps are that great anyway.

Bootcampers (the really top ones), bright kids from other related courses, masters/ Phds (CS or otherwise) grads, singaporeans returning from overseas  studies etc. I obviously don't have the exact numbers, but I would think these are non-trivial sources of potential talent.

Frankly, the proportion of truly great programmers out of undergrad is much lower than 10% ... probably closer to 3-4%.

The issue is that they aren't being forthcoming about rebutting what I think are valid concerns. Where is the commitment from the government, enshrined in law, that they can only use it in the manner they've stated? If mandatory TraceTogether is truly for now only, then where is the commitment to a time limit (that they can always extend anyway)? 

They're also holding Phase 3 hostage until 70% adoption. Not that I think we should rush to Phase 3, but have you looked around? People are tired, it's basically Phase 5 dorscon green + chinstraps already. Holding Phase 3 hostage comes off as a manipulation, an arm twist, to get the population to do what they want.

1. TraceTogether saves data locally on the phone and it doesn't send to some central server where ISD can tap into it

I wholeheartedly agree with this, but the ""opening up more"" they're currently talking about changes little too. Letting us have 8 rather than 5 people on a table - wowee! 

Things that would make me happier (and I'm aware this isn't remotely a factor they would consider, I'm just saying what would make it feel ""more normal"" for me):

* no mask unless inside a building/vehicle

* reduce limits on table sizes (I'm not sure what's sensible here, but permitting 10 people + doesn't seem that risky)

* reopening of bars with whatever level of safe distancing rules etc enforced

* remove the 10:30 shut off - move it back to midnight like Hong Kong

As you can see, most of my interests are around entertainment and bars, as that's one of the few enjoyments we're still able to have at the moment. I'd really love some green lanes to places like Vietnam or Thailand that are operable for a short break; travel has always been high on my list of priorities and I'm going a bit stir crazy going to the same places day-in-day-out.

Anyway, my list is largely irrelevant, the Gahmen will continue to plod on with their plans for reopening and we'll be forced to cart this token around whether I/we like it or not.

"> The linked article does not address whether it's possible for a malicious entity to somehow trigger or schedule an upload.

The linked article does mention all the online data transport the app engages in. So if the app was DESIGNED to send information out maliciously, this can be identified using a check of the underlying framework OpenTrace / BlueTrace (open sourced by the TT team) or network sniffing or reverse engineering of the apk. 

>What stood out to me immediately was the absence of backend host strings (e.g. api.myawesomeapp.com) or API calls, which is (almost) always the first thing to look out for when inspecting applications. Developers of applications with significant resources or risk typically harden their applications by packaging critical functionality such as encryption and data transport in low level libraries and calling them via JNI, effectively protecting critical functionality from inspection with basic tooling and script kiddies.
>However, that‚Äôs not the case with TraceTogether: all online functionality was pointing to Firebase SDK, from User Authentication via OTP (PhoneAuthProvider) to records uploading with Firebase Storage.



And that's not hard to do and in fact it's done for a lot of controversial apps like TikTok to find out what endpoints it's sending data to. 

https://www.cscjournals.org/manuscript/Journals/IJCSS/Volume14/Issue2/IJCSS-1552.pdf

If TraceTogether was DESIGNED to send this kind of data without the user's consent (i.e. other than an explicit manual action when a user is detected as a COVID patient), it can easily be found out. 

As far someone outside the development team maliciously gaining access and sending the device specific data - open sourcing of the apk code is NOT going to show you that. A third party maliciously gaining access and making sense of the data are also extremely unlikely and even if they do get access to that encrypted local storage data that stores nothing but temporary IDs associated with the phone exchanges rather than actual phone numbers, there's very little a third party hacker can do with that data unless they are able to decrypt it and gain access to the actual phone numbers behind ALL temporary IDs across all devices.

"Your first study, Chaabna et al (2020) was published in September 2020. It's from one month ago. Could the G time travel?

Your second study (Tang and Wong, 2004), of which I have some familiarity with, was looking at mask wearing as a dependent variable, not looking at the effectiveness of face masks as an independent variable predicting infection outcomes.

Your third study (MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2015) is a review paper that concluded that there is, and I quote, *""lack of research on facemasks and respirators is reflected in varied and sometimes conflicting policies and guidelines.""* So it reaffirms that there is a lack of evidence.

Your fourth study (Sim et al, 2014) is again a review paper that looks at face mask wearing as a dependent variable.

Looks like your 2-second Google search resulted in one study found in support of Covid-19 prevention through the wearing of face masks, and it was published in Sep 2020.

To your second point on remdesivir, there are absolutely side effects to the drugs, and it proves my point that advice will change. Initially people thought it was okay and effective based on early small non double-blinded trials, but more recent findings show it might not be effective. That is how science works.

"Oh come on. A meta-analysis IS a study which summarizes previous studies to provide some sort of idea on a particular directionality of effect. At the point in time where the first mask policy came into effect, these meta-analyses were not around yet. Was MOH supposed to come up with their own meta-analysis in a few days? These meta-analyses take some time to do.

Even in Chaabna et al (2020), they acknowledged that ""The randomized clinical trials (high-level evidence) assessing the effectiveness of medical facemask use to prevent transmission of respiratory infections in community settings were conducted in closed settings with high transmission risk of respiratory infections (e.g. households and university dormitories). No trial studied medical facemask use effectiveness to prevent transmission of respiratory infections in open areas.""

They further added: ""At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO did not recommend facemask use in community settings, on the basis that ‚Äòno evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons‚Äô (World Health Organization, 2020). However, on 5th June 2020, WHO issued updated guidance about medical and cloth facemask use in areas with ongoing widespread community transmission and where physical distancing is difficult to implement e.g. public transportation, shops, etc. They recommend that countries should encourage the general population to wear facemasks in the aforementioned settings (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020). Since medical facemasks are a critical resource for healthcare workers, the WHO clarifies that when medical facemasks are in shortage, these must be reserved for frontline workers and at-risk individuals.""

Following that, they wrote: ""Healthcare professionals are a population at a higher risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 as they can be more often in close contact with infected individuals. In addition to protecting the healthcare workforce itself, prioritizing the allocation of medical facemasks to HCWs might also be a strategy to reduce nosocomial transmission of the virus.""

So again, going back to the strategy by the G at that particular point in time, when balancing the evidence with potential shortage of masks for medical workers, it was a sound policy. And that was my argument, that it was SOUND policy AT THAT TIME. 

I ask the IV/DV question because the other studies you cited very obviously missed the point, and illustrates your lack of knowledge in the area. They are not scary terms. Basically, face mask use is the outcome being studied in those other studies you cited. They were not studies looking at the effectiveness of face mask use.

Desperately trying to save whatever face you have left, you still try to play the discount date argument, despite your original stance being totally obliterated.

The brackets should have been a clue for you, but I guess to are too thick for that either. 

Finally, when everything is exhausted, you try the lame old ""It was a sound policy because they were conserving masks for healthcare workers.""

A point was raised about what's stopping the police from going to TT at the very first available instance and that point wasn't addressed either.

Vivian also tried to play to the compassionate card to try to compel people's sensibilities to comply but honestly I don't have much confidence in his words either. He told everyone that TT would he voluntarily and would only be used for a very specific use case; both of which had since been proven wrong.

The government has its own take on how TT data should be available for investigations of 'serious crimes', but the fact that that term is not clearly defined in legislation really erodes public trust. I do not expect the government to relent on the stance they've taken, which is why I think we should suggest reasonable solutions to safeguard our privacy within that.

I believe that other than clearly defining 'serious crimes' in legislation, there is another compromise that they can easily achieve without too much work: **Publicly announce every time they requested for TT data for investigations** and WHAT crime it is, as well as explaining WHY it was necessary whether be it due to insufficient evidence or there being still some reasonable doubt of the suspect's guilt. If this can be done without failure, preferably as a legislated REQUIREMENT for accessing TT data for criminal investigations, I believe that transparency is at least a right step in ensuring that privacy isn't completely disregarded by the government",2021-01-05 22:05:59

He's speaking as if this is not a major concern that was addressed multiple times during the rollout of the system.

Giam was really spot-on here. Is the benefit of using TT in police investigations (even with full faith that that is all it would be used for) really significant enough to offset lowered adoption rates and loss of trust in the gov? Singaporeans are politically apathetic but they are not stupid, if they double down on this, TT adoption is going down.

"It's also funny how this event unfolded:

1. 4 Jan - Desmond Tan say TT may be used (can be doesn't mean will be, nor has been)
2. 5 Jan - Vivian said TT data has been used in a murder case 

So unless a murder happened between 4 Jan and 5 Jan, it seems like TT has already been used even before the parliamentary question was answered. How did this go about? SPF seize the TT token, asks GovTech to decode, but somehow despite only authorised officers being allowed to access it, somehow SPF is able to access it without triggering any signoff from DS/PS/ministers? 

To even get the data out and use it for non-COVID 19 contact tracing purposes, someone has to say yes for a use-case there is outside the norm for TT, who was it, and was it within his/her power to say yes? Who else was informed after he/she said yes? Why does it seem like Vivian only knows about the use today? 

The other scenario is that the data is simply not well-ringfenced enough. Somehow the keys are lying around and SPF could get it without sufficient oversight? This will go against the claims that the data can only be accessed by authorised officers.",2021-01-06 00:46:03

Things don't simply ""get forgotten"" by the elite level ministers - in accepting this version of events, we are also to believe that MHA, headed by Shanmugam did not deign to inform VB and GovTech since months back when the latter first made the statement to the public. If in accepting VB's quote ""(I) did not consider (the CPC)"" then such a lack of consideration could possibly be wilful in nature, **deliberately omitted** so as not to alarm the public + ensure take up rate of >70%.",2021-01-06 00:52:35

"> # Contact-tracing device will not track location; people can use TraceTogether if they prefer: Vivian Balakrishnan

> SINGAPORE - The wearable device for contact tracing in development by the Government to help curb the spread of Covid-19 will not track an individual's location, and those who prefer to use Singapore's contact-tracing app TraceTogether will still be able to do so.

> The device, which may be issued to everyone here, will be a small device that people can slip into their bag or pocket, said Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan.

> Dr Balakrishnan gave these updates on Sunday (June 7) in the comments thread of a post on his Facebook page, where he had shared a video of him talking in Parliament on June 5 about the device, which may be issued to everyone here.

> The announcement of this device comes after news that TraceTogether, which identifies people in close contact with a coronavirus patient via wireless Bluetooth technology, does not work well with Apple devices.

> The app is useful when those infected cannot recall whom they had been in proximity with for an extended period, but it has not been popular here.

> Dr Balakrishnan, who is also the Foreign Minister, earlier said that about 1.5 million users have downloaded the TraceTogether app since it was launched in March, which works out to only a quarter of Singapore's population.

> This falls short of the optimum number of users needed for the app to work well - which is about three-quarters of the population.

> Responding to concerns that Facebook user Justin Herson had about the device being developed, Dr Balakrishnan said it will not be a tracking device and will not track an individual's location.

> He said: ""It acts as a personal diary, uses Bluetooth proximity data to collate prolonged close contacts.""

> The data in the personal device is encrypted, automatically erased after 25 days and never leaves the device unless the person is infected.

> ""If and only if that happens, then the data is used by authorised contact tracers to find people who may have inadvertently been infected by you,"" Dr Balakrishnan added.

> In another reply, this time to Facebook user Sylvester Zhuo, Dr Balakrishnan said that the thinking behind the device is that there are still people here without a smartphone, or whose smartphone does not work well with the app.

> The device will be able to communicate with TraceTogether and allow the Government to include as many people as possible to maximise public health.

> Responding to requests from user Simon Sin to make the device multi-purpose or to be able to replace TransitLink transport cards, credits cards or company entry passes, Dr Balakrishnan said that he is reluctant to do so as the device's battery should last ""many months"".

> After his announcement of the device on June 5, a petition called ""Singapore says 'No' to wearable devices for Covid-19 contact tracing"" was started by Mr Wilson Low that day.

> In three days, the petition, which rejects the development of this contact-tracing device, has been signed by almost 30,000 people.

> When asked what spurred him to start the petition, the self-employed man said he noticed that many of his friends on social media had shared concerns about privacy and surveillance, and he wanted to give an avenue for them to have their voices heard.

> ""I had no idea that it would get so much attention in such a short time. I am surprised at the response it has received,"" said Mr Low, 37.

> On its Facebook page, opposition party Singapore People's Party on Sunday released a statement by assistant secretary-general Ariffin Sha to express its concerns about data that would be collected by these devices, and called for the Government to ""tread with utmost caution and regard for the privacy of Singaporeans"".

> Mr Bryan Tan, a lawyer from Pinsent Masons MPillay specialising in technology law and data protection, said the device will likely overcome the hardware issues currently associated with contact tracing and that the designers will be implementing privacy by design and take it into account even while putting it together, just like how they have done so with TraceTogether.

> The app also does not collect or use users' location data, but records only whom they might have been close to, and Mr Tan said the new device will likely function in the same way.

> ""I do not see a need to change the position of storing physical locations automatically. There could be an opportunity to build in more features, for instance, a SafeEntry link to allow users to enter locations even easier,"" said Mr Tan, referring to the Government's digital check-in system for contact-tracing purposes.

With no internet connection it is not realistic to perform location tracking unless permanent points are set up every several metres to ""capture"" the handshake of your device which I would argue, can already be achieved by security cameras all over Singapore.

What this means to me is that a user's movement pattern cannot be extracted unless every single device is collected, all of the data exported and analysed. The data remains encrypted and local to your device.

Network and GPS connected services such as Google Maps would have greater potential to track the movement of a user. The only thing keeping people assured about such services is that they are non-mandatory, and Google's promise of ""protecting your privacy""

People are right to be worried, but I also think that many of those reactions, in retrospect, now seem to be over the top and a little silly. But again, such knee jerk reactions are par for the course for most internet places and social media where majority of the people ""type first and think later""",2020-06-08 13:41:49

Secondly: And someone please correct me here if I‚Äôm wrong, so if my token is collecting data of everyone else‚Äôs nearby tokens and it‚Äôs possible for MOH to find out who I have been near by looking at the data in my token, what‚Äôs to stop the government from planting tokens at locations which have data fed live back to their servers thereby establishing who has passed by a given area.

Sure, this would require them to plant beacons in all areas of interests but that‚Äôs a bloody small cost compared to the sheer number of tokens they‚Äôre planning on giving to everyone anyway.

And if for example they REALLY want to know if you‚Äôve been near a person of interest, what‚Äôs to stop them from seizing the token from said person of interest and then checking if you‚Äôve been nearby?

To say ‚Äúit can‚Äôt track you‚Äù is nonsense because if it truly couldn‚Äôt track you then the device would be useless. It most certainly can track you, maybe not directly, but indirectly.

1. A private sector group proposed it.

""A number of entrepreneurs have been pitching ideas to the Government on what they think we should be doing. All options under consideration must respect people‚Äôs privacy and will be put through robust and appropriate testing before being used to ensure they keep data safe. Over the coming weeks we will be testing some applications and products. No final decisions have been made at this stage.""

"Not dismissing your point, just wanted to paint an alternate picture. I feel it is good to react early, even if it is an overreaction. If there is swift backlash or opposition, there is a possibility that changes will be made early. On the other hand, if we were to wait until its final stages where plans are confirmed, it may be too late to change anything due to inertia.

That's what I feel about many govt policies that people are not happy about, for e.g. POFMA or Reserved PE. When the opposition to such policies drum a loud enough support, it is pretty much too late and parliament is already passing it into law. If there were early debates, things may have changed",2020-06-08 15:33:40

Back to what you mean - I still disagree that we should liken politicians who are being reumnerated for their education, skills and their work to 'bad children'. One is a group that agreed to a set of laws and ethics to receive remuneration for their education, skills and work performed--and they too have the power to impact those laws. The choice to be irresponsible and deceitful was done actively and purposefully, often with the enablement of others, with the goal to empower themselves. The other group (children) is essentially powerless in the face of regulations, have way fewer cognitive, emotional and physical capabilities to understand the ramifications on themselves and others, and if we take the science into consideration, their bad behaviour is triggered by events and incidents.",2020-06-08 15:09:48

Singapore is the worst in south east asia, by a very significant margin, even compared to countries where testing is done properly. Go ahead and compare to vietnam, malaysia. Of course you are going to accuse them of faking numbers or undertesting with no evidence or proof, because thats all you know how to do.

Shall we then also discuss how we fare as compared to south korea? How about Japan? Taiwan? HK? Or are you going to accuse them of not testing enough either?

This is a typical fallacy called whataboutism I see from people trying to defend the indefensible. The only argument you have left is ""oh well its only limited to foreign workers, singaporeans are safe"" and believe me, you do not want to even attempt to pull that kind of BS argument on me

I'm not going to draw conclusions on which country is undertesting cos there isn't really a standard to compare to, but it is pretty obvious that SG has already done more tests per capita than some of the countries you have mentioned.

Now I'm not gonna deny that the govt did fuck up with regards to the situation in the dorms right now. Yes that was a problem we could have foresaw. Yes we did have a chance to do something about that before shit hit the fan. But without being in the shoes of the ministers, without the information that they had, who are we to judge that the decision they made then was not an informed one? Hindsight is always 20/20. I'm not even saying that the decision they made was a **right** one, just an *informed* one.",2020-05-01 14:49:20
"> Now I'm not gonna deny that the govt did fuck up with regards to the situation in the dorms right now. Yes that was a problem we could have foresaw. Yes we did have a chance to do something about that before shit hit the fan.

In other words, I was right. Singapore did not do great. Yes they did fuck up. The numbers are indisputably worse than even many third world countries. Case closed.

The rest of your post is nothing more than an inference that just because there were fewer tests PER CAPITA (NOT total tests) that that automatically means that Singapore MUST have less actual cases than those countries. You know that is not true.

The most likely reason the number of cases are so low in those countries is because THEY HAVE LOWER CASES. Period. This is basic statistical inference. That is why we can tell the result of elections from just a small subset of voter results. What matters is we have a statistically significant number of total tests carried out. This is valid for all earlier mentioned countries, including Singapore

If you have evidence that these countries are underreporting their actual cases. I would like to invite you provide actual direct evidence of that. You can win a prize for investigative journalism should you manage to do so. I eagerly await to read your findings

Your narrative of not being allowed to criticise them because ""oh they can't be perfect, look at how hard they are trying"" is completely disingenuous. They are the most highly paid government on earth. I expect them to perform the best. They are nowhere close and we need to find out why, and then decide if they deserve their job, or deserve their pay. Your whitewashing is undermining genuine efforts to do so",2020-05-01 15:20:44
">In other words, I was right. Singapore did not do great. Yes they did fuck up. The numbers are indisputably worse than even many third world countries. Case closed.

Agreed.

They are nowhere close and we need to find out why, and then decide if they deserve their job, or deserve their pay. Your whitewashing is undermining genuine efforts to do so

Moving on to finding out why they fucked up, which you agree to be what we need to find out. While I'm not gonna bother finding out if they are indeed paid the highest but I do concur that they are paid handsomely. And yes for that much remuneration it is definitely natural and justified to expect performance of a high calibre. 

Perhaps I did come off as defensive when I said that we are in no position to judge them when we aren't in their shoes. I'd like to clarify that what I meant was not that they cannot be judged but we have to take into account the asymmetry in our situation and theirs. Yes you can argue that given their pay they should be expected to make correct decisions and I do concur that point. All I'm trying to say is, at that point in time and under that pressure from the other parties in the picture, perhaps that decision they made was the one they believed to be the correct one. Then the issue becomes whether their calibre is worth their pay or not does it not? If that is the best they can do, should they still be paid the sums they are being paid? That is a question I don't think I'm qualified to answer.

Now I'd like to clarify that the purpose of me digging up all those numbers are only to back up the fact that SG is indeed doing active testing, more active than other countries. Nowhere in my previous comment did I try to compare case counts.

Moving on, I think we can both agree that if the number of confirmed cases is high, it's either due to two things: 1) there is just that many cases; and/or 2) we are picking up more cases due to more active testing (because let's face it no country is going to be able to pick out every single case). I am not denying that our high numbers are most probably due to that we have a large population of infected patients. Rather what I'm trying to highlight is our degree of active testing is indeed much more active than other nations.

Perhaps I came across as whitewashing, but all I'm trying to do with my previous comment is 1) highlight that SG is doing more active testing than other countries (something which I think we should recognise, just not too much) ; and 2) our ministers did fuck up but I don't think we are in a good place to be judging them for it (it's my personal belief so if the part about not being in a good place to judge others doesn't resonate with you then it's just a matter of personal beliefs).",2020-05-01 18:00:04

"It's a more nuanced thing than that. If tanks are so great, why do they still train NSmen with rifles and bayonets? Shouldn't the US military have been able to curb stomp the Taliban and Iraqi insurgents already? They couldn't in Vietnam, despite having jet fighters versus guys with AKs. Why did they need to send American GI joe with a rifle to go and root out a Taliban fighter with a rifle? Anytime anyone make your kind of argument, I can be sure they understand nothing about defence.

Not to mention, will the US military at that point still be loyal, and to whom? The Army, Marine, and Air Force person el are rotated through bases so they don't get attached to a locality too much but the National Guard, which has a nominally separate Chain of Command, just about the same number of divisions as the Army are stationed in the same state that the Guardsmen live in. They are, in other words, a lot more attached with the locals. Whose side will the National Guard be on? The National Guard has an Air Force, too; called the Air National Guard. It's highly possible that you will see the National Guards fighting back at the Federal troops.

The trick for national defence of a small country, like Finland, Israel, Vietnam is for every able-bodied adult to have received some military training and promise the invaders that yes, their tanks can go anywhere over the border, but the moment the crews turn of the engine and go to get dinner, take a shit, bath, or sleep, they will be killed. There is always a role for the light infantry; if you don't know why, well, it's a complex topic. The starting point is: you are fighting humans, who think and react. You go at them with a tank, they won't show up to get killed. They will only  show up to shoot if they think they can kill you.

"> It's a more nuanced thing than that. If tanks are so great, why do they still train NSmen with rifles and bayonets? Shouldn't the US military have been able to curb stomp the Taliban and Iraqi insurgents already? 

The infantry is important in military conflict because infanteers have extremely cost effective ways to kill armour and attack helicopters, via manpads and anti-material weapons like the matador. US civilians by and large do not. Because of this, tanks have to be supported by infantry in a conventional conflict. In the conflicts you mentioned, the US also facts major power-projection issues in mobilising large amounts of armour, both logistically and due to the political cost of mobilising that much. 

There is a role for light infantry. The thing is, light infantry is usually much more heavily armed than even the gun nuts of the US. Every platoon has a few matadors.

I'm literally saying that the loyalty of the military is what matters, so I have no idea why you're asking me that. I am categorically _not_ assuming that the military will stay loyal to the federal government in the event of civil war. 

The national guard will likely come into play, but it still has little to do with the arming of civilians and the second amendment. The second amendment does not enable the existence of the national guard. The national guard is the reserve Corp of the US army and air force.

Most small developed countries actually rely very heavily on equipment, and have more kitted out militaries than their larger counterparts. Singapore has ~180 MBTs. France, a much larger country, only has ~200. No, the doctrine for us is not for a small military to fight guerilla war, it's to win outright via force multipliers such as technology and of course to take advantage of the fact that most of the largest militaries in the world are far away and will run into force projection issues.

MBTs and fighters in the modern high-tech on high-tech environments, unless they are well camouflaged and hidden until just the moment the enemy comes into their range or attacking themselves, are nothing but parade ground toys waiting to be destroyed. The proliferation of cheap drones and masses precision directed munitions means any airfield, airstrips, surface ships, or poorly camouflaged objects are targets waiting to be destroyed.

"Not on board with this. There‚Äôs too many unknowns, and not enough safeguards, from both a technological and policy perspective. There are manifold concerns that remain to be addressed - and rushed implementation of something this privacy intrusive needs much more thought and debate than this is being given. 

From a policy perspective, whilst the G has said that only a team of MOH officers will have access to the data and that‚Äôs its protected by OSA, that doesn‚Äôt mean that police and other investigative bodies can‚Äôt use their investigate powers to request for the data which has been provided to MOH. That‚Äôs particularly concerning given that criminal charges could potentially be built on this data - and in the absence of freedom of information legislation, we‚Äôd never know how this data is treated. If this is to go through, we need a strict system of binding rules - whether in legislation or not - to govern data access of if the G wants something as intrusive as this. The public service recommendations are just not enough. This is particularly given that the G‚Äôs track record on surveillance is already questionable. 

From a tech perspective, we don‚Äôt know how this works yet. One example: the device doesn‚Äôt have a net connection - but will it pair with smartphones? If so, data could be transmitted from the device to your phone and then onwards from there. Also, just because the device doesn‚Äôt track location doesn‚Äôt mean that the G can‚Äôt cross reference the data it collects from the device with other data sets it has. 

An additional consideration is that the G‚Äôs cybersecurity record is pretty poor, and data with this level of sensitivity is always going to be a nice prize for people looking to get at it.

Some folks are saying - I have a clear conscience, therefore I don‚Äôt mind using it. To me, it isn‚Äôt about that at all, but rather the potential for this to be the first step down a very dangerous path.",2020-06-09 10:00:28

However, for this device we: don't know the capabilities of the device, unless we do a tear-down of EVERY SINGLE DEVICE. But what happens if we see a micro-controller that isn't a standard part (for example, not one I can pick up at Sim Lim Tower?) and there's no datasheet? What if it just says ""CHINA"" on it with no part/bin number? I'd be more worried actually, maybe a foreign country would have put in a backdoor that activates it through a specific BLE signal? How would I know that this ""BLACK BOX"" does whatever you said? Yeah, I could technically ""scan"" the airwaves for signals, but then again, how the hell would I know what is stored inside it (especially if it is encrypted)? I can go on and on.

"What I think is that the idea of the device isn't fundamentally bad, but with many things, boils down to the issue of execution of said idea. Technology, of course, isn't going to be perfect, but it shouldn't be shunned altogether. 

As it is just a concept right now, I am perfectly fine with the idea. Theoretically, it does streamline the contact tracing process, and it solves the problem about iPhone users that cannot(?) use the TraceTogether app (forgive me, I'm an Android user myself).

The question has to be asked though: how secure does this entire system have to be in theory in order to convince the general population to accept this particular move? Security is never going to be watertight; some hacker out there is bound to find a way in. Open-source code is dangerous since there are more ways for malicious software to work it's way in, while developing the software internally brings its legitimacy and security under question since no one has the chance to look at and analyse it.

As much as the government is under fire for being incompetent and blundering through this crisis, I cannot bring myself to blame them for toying with this idea. The TraceTogether concept in itself breaks up the contact tracing process into it's simplest form: Person A is infected, find out who else is at risk of being infected by Person A, isolate and test them all. If through the device, all the government wants is my location with respect to everyone else, it's something I can abide them with, but it has been made painfully clear that the government is going to have to be extremely transparent with what they are putting out.

What I don't get are those that just go ""oh shit, a tracker? I'm going to be monitored 24/7 by the gahmen! Not using it!"" with no argument other than ""it's my privacy where I go.""

That's just a convenient cover.

The real reason is that without your NRIC, when MOH finds out that your phone has been a close contact, they can only call your phone number. If you hang up on them or refuse to follow instructions, they can't do much. Maybe they can check Singpass databases or demand that the Telco gives up your NRIC number, but this takes time. People may transfer phones within the family too. Anyway, if they have your NRIC, they can send enforcement agents to your address. Basically, you should be issued SHN already, the govt doesn't want to allow you to dodge by not responding.

That's also why the govt doesn't want to adopt the Google/Apple API. The latter would not allow linking of device with NRIC. If you were exposed, you'd get a notification, which you can choose to ignore i.e. not acceptable to MOH.

""I think this statement is not worded correctly. While [tracetogether don't work in background on iOS (vs Android)](https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360043735573-How-do-I-set-up-TraceTogether-) , it works when it is run on the foreground.

Also, this ""limitation"" is due [Apple's system design](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52355028) which, unfortunately, the developers of tracetogether could not bypass.""

There was a [new contract tracing API](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing) developed by Apple and Google recently. ~~This is supposed to overcome the previous limitation to require the app to run on foreground on iOS. However, there's no info whether it has been implemented in the app from the patch notes.~~

These are already available with the OS API itself.

Bottom line is, if they don‚Äôt focus on user feedbacks, then well. They‚Äôre not gotta get the user adoption rate they want.

However, imho this method isn‚Äôt reliable since BAR cannot be controlled, it‚Äôs either On or Off. There‚Äôs no in between of how much you want the app to run when it‚Äôs in the background.

iOS will direct BAR to prioritise apps that are frequently used. Which explains why they added the SafeEntry feature, so that people would use the app more often and hence increasing the priority of the app being picked up by BAR.

Questions have to be answered in parliament. That's the point of parliament. The fact that there are no details means they are still in the discussion phase. It takes time to develop custom devices. They can't tell you details when they don't have details. 

The fact that they called it a contact tracing device and not a location tracking device is already a big clue, yet people with overactive imaginations managed to turn a contact tracing device into 24/7 location tracking device in their heads and write that in the petition.",2020-06-06 23:33:52
"Yup. I know there's no GPS location tracking for trace together.

My point is that the implications of tracetogether or this new wearables scheme, assuming it is mandatory, should be properly debated.

If the government believes that there's a justifiable tradeoff between privacy and security (or in this case public health safety), then it should be clearly and tactfully presented to the public, given to robust debate, with concerns properly aired and addressed, so that people themselves can be convinced that the tradeoff is acceptable.

Convince people to adopt, rather than use a blunt-force instrument and railroading it through with mandatory legislation.

The government does have some catching up to do in order to bridge the trust deficit in light of rather egregious events like the Singhealth breaches and blood donor data leak. Stuff like PM Lee's personal particulars and medically confidential data being leaked may seem like funny news to some, but the implications are far from funny.

Civil liberties and personal privacy, however trivial it is thought to be, should be jealously guarded and not lightly given up. Once surrendered, it's very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.

Falsely claiming, or spreading news of claims, that the tracing device is a location tracking device that tracks the wearer 24/7 is not raising awareness. It is factually wrong.

Yes, because there are no further details yet. The question was posed in parliament, so it has to be answered. The fact that there are no details means its still in discussion. Tech takes time to develop. And intelligent people realise that no details means no details, not add your own details and use them to fearmonger.

The article was written based on a question in Parliament regarding asking whether Tracetogether will be made compulsory. The minister has to answer the question, that is the point of parliament. 

The precedent set is that Tracetogether did not use location data, and was open source so people could inspect the code to check for themselves if they did not believe it, which addresses privacy concerns. There is no evidence they will do anything differently with the contact tracing device. Which again, is called a contract tracing device, not a location tracking device.",2020-06-06 23:26:58

Is it though? Its already in the name, ""tracing"", I don't know what your definition of tracing but it can be assumed that my location can be found from it.

The device hasn't even been developed yet. In my opinion, this petition is the blind leading the blind. Just by reading the justification of whoever started the petition, I can tell they have a very poor understanding of technology, yet they feel that they should come up with their own details to gain support for their cause.

How does making up details help anything? If you seek clarification by writing a ST forum letter or starting a petition demanding an explanation then yes, I can believe the motive is to seek clarification. 

If someone is starting a petition by making up details to get people to support it instead of seeking clarification, then that is telling of the true motives of the starter. It tells me the motive is not to seek clarification in any way, but instead inciting people to think that the made up details are true.

SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community.

Interpretation of their interpretation (after few hours of sleep), combined with the collective thought consciousness, and possibly my personal biases laced with flawed logic:

If one wants to contain and minimise the risk of widespread community transmission via contact tracing as opposed to more stringent measures such as public activity lock down all the way until quarantining everyone in their houses, the former being gentler on the economy, then current methods of contact tracing that utilise interviewing an infected person is insufficient for a variety of reasons such as weak memory, memory loss, bad memory, corrupted memory, unwillingness to divulge embarrassing or compromising details etc., and many potentially infected contacts cannot be traced in a timely manner, if at all.

"> # Coronavirus: Singapore develops smartphone app for efficient contact tracing

> SINGAPORE - A contact-tracing smartphone app has been launched to allow the local authorities to quickly track people who have been exposed to confirmed coronavirus cases.

> Dubbed TraceTogether, the app is able to identify people who have been in close proximity - within 2m for at least 30 minutes - to coronavirus patients using wireless Bluetooth technology, said its developers, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), on Friday (March 20).

> ""This is especially useful in cases where the infected persons do not know everyone whom they had been in close proximity with for an extended duration,"" said its developers.

> While use of the app is not compulsory, those who use it have to turn on the Bluetooth settings in their phones for tracing to be done. They also need to enable push notifications and location permissions in the app, which is available on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store.

> Should one of these users be infected, MOH will be able to quickly find out which other users they have been in close contact with, allowing for easier identification of potential cases and helping to curb the spread of the coronavirus here.

> On its website, TraceTogether's developers said the app is meant to complement current contact-tracing methods and allow for the identification of people who were in close proximity with an infected person more efficiently. There is currently no target for the number of users for the app.

> In a release on Friday, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) said users have to give explicit consent to participate in TraceTogether, and for their mobile number and data to be used for contact tracing.

> ""When requested by MOH, users can send their TraceTogether logs to facilitate the contact tracing process. Up to that point, the authorities, including MOH and GovTech, have no knowledge of the user's TraceTogether data,"" said SNDGO.

> Official contact tracers will provide a code that users can match with a corresponding verification code on their app. Once authenticated, users will be given a PIN that allows submission of logs when entered.

> Official contact tracers will also not ask for any personal financial details or request for the transfer of money over the phone.

> When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.

> Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world

> On its website, TraceTogether developers said that keeping the app running all the time will not drain a phone's battery significantly.

> The only data that is collected by the Government through this app is the user's mobile number, which is kept so that MOH can contact users quickly if they were in close proximity with an infected case.

> The app also does not collect or use users' location data, but only records who they might have been close to.

> Similar apps have been said to be successful in helping to turn the tide against the coronavirus in some countries.

> In highly-connected South Korea, for instance, people know quickly when a new coronavirus case is found in their neighbourhood through a government alert sent to their mobile phones. This alert includes details such as the new patient's age, gender and travel history.

> The World Health Organisation and experts said that the country's extensive tracing, testing and isolation measures have helped to significantly reduce the virus's spread.

> Over the past two weeks, the number of new cases being reported daily has dropped dramatically, from a peak of 909 cases announced on Feb 29 to 74 on March 16.

 **9. (C) Singapore boasts a highly competitive and  well-regarded primary and secondary education system, but the  number of Singaporeans completing a tertiary education is  relatively low.  Only 23 percent of Singaporean students  entering primary school complete a degree at a local  four-year university.  In other knowledge-economies such as  Japan's, around 50 percent of students complete a university  degree.  However, according to Cheryl Chan, Assistant  Director of the Planning Division at the Ministry of  Education (MOE), the government does not plan to encourage  more students to get a higher education.  The university  enrollment rate will continue to be maintained at 20-25  percent because the Singaporean labor market does not need  everyone to get a four-year degree, she asserted.**  

[https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07SINGAPORE394\_a.html](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07SINGAPORE394_a.html). 

This percentage has certainly increased but there is still a cap.

 **(C) Summary.  The youth wing of Singapore's ruling party,  Young PAP (YP), is pursuing closer ties with the Chinese  Communist Youth League, two YP executive committee members  told PolOffs on August 27.  Recent YP ""study visits"" to China  have focused on political education and recruitment.  In  contrast, YP's relations with fraternal parties in Indonesia,  Malaysia, and Taiwan are less active.  Though YP membership  has recently increased by about 150% to approximately 9,000,  it remains a relatively small organization even by Singapore  standards.  It has never fulfilled its intended role of  cultivating new leadership for the ruling People's Action  Party (PAP), with only one former member in a cabinet-level  position.  Instead of influencing policy, YP appears geared  toward creating a positive image of the PAP for young  Singaporeans, with the ultimate goal of encouraging them to  become PAP members.  End summary.    Young PAP Pursues Ties with Communist Youth League...**

Hehe and of course many more, i am surprised how short term Singaporeans are at these big issues.

 **1. (C) Summary:  Faced with a chronically low fertility rate  and high emigration, Singapore has used a selective but  relatively open immigration policy to increase its  population, fuel its normally strong economic growth, and  maintain a politically delicate balance among its Chinese,  Malay and Indian ethnic groups.  While the GOS keeps its  immigration numbers secret, it appears that a particularly  low birth rate among ethnic Chinese has allowed  Chinese-national immigrants to overwhelmingly benefit.  Many  Chinese immigrants use Singapore as a stepping stone and  depart for greater opportunities abroad once they have  obtained Permanent Resident status.  The integration of  culturally different mainland Chinese remains a challenge.  End Summary.**

EDIT - Adding my reply so my karma stays sane u/PathToDefeat:

I think you are missing the point here, what I said was that the purpose of TT is solely for contact tracing yes, but in the event of a criminal investigation, all cards are off the table in terms of privacy. The SPF and PAP are actually 2 separate entities, as difficult as it might be to believe, as the state cannot operate above the law. What you are insinuating (that the gov and the SPF conspire against the people) is possible but I mean why do it via TT when they already have such a tight grip over us? Also, the government can't really mandate what the SPF can or cannot do with the data, wouldn't the ability to control that be dangerous as well? I'm pretty sure the SPF can get whatever data they want regardless of what PAP says... 

"" The SPF is empowered under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to obtain any data, and that includes the TraceTogether data, said Mr Tan. ""

Remember, the SPF takes the data, don't misconstrue that with ""THE PAP GIVING MY DATA TO SPF! FKING LYNCH THEM""",2021-01-06 20:05:37

Imagine if EDB sent a representative to a foreign company, say Coca Cola, and enticed them with a 5% corporate tax rate, and after Coca Cola sets up their factories, workforce, etc, in Singapore, MAS comes out and says ‚Äúoh btw there is this law in SG that says the government can, at its own discretion, raise corporate tax rates as a response to fiscal uncertainties‚Äù.

Now, what do you think should be the right course of action? If tax rates have always been set by MAS, then technically EDB shouldn‚Äôt be able to offer such terms to the foreign party correct? However to the investor, MAS and EDB fall under the same government, and if one branch of the government can so easily overturn the commitments given by another branch, then what makes Singapore so different from say, the US tearing up the Paris and Iran agreements? Why should foreign investors deal with us? 

In short, the foreign investor will not be happy that he has to pay the cost for a failure in communication between different government branches. And if you can understand this point, you‚Äôd understand why Singaporeans are so upset.",2021-01-07 01:00:08

Bluetooth is only really good for location history, but real-time tracking not so much.

Of course, you can turn around and argue that TT's website can't be trusted, in that case, the rest of us don't really have much in the way of convincing you guys.

Also, what do you mean about the point on government and data? Isn't the issue here with giving the data to SPF instead? The SPF and the gov are 2 separate entities. If the SPF wants it they take it. The gov already has the data, what are you on about.

Your point on ad targeting and behavior prediction is ridiculous and here is why. If they inform us about giving the data out to SPF, they will inform us if they give the data to ad companies, otherwise why even inform us about the former in the first place? And you know the gov can't do the latter without huge consequences.

The way these responses are worded is very sneaky - they invoke dissent in common people and the easily swayed, but think about it for a moment and look at both sides of the situation instead of just how the government could potentially be an evil dictatorship.",2021-01-06 20:18:02

"Wouldn't want your karma to stay anything but sane. Here are my 2 cents to your first edit.

* If I give my consent to location tracking for contact tracing only and then find out that the data can be used for other purposes, it leads me to re-evaluate the trust that was freely given earlier. If you want to continue to put your blind trust in the government's claims, that's on you, and I have no interest in convincing you otherwise.
* It's ridiculous because you aren't looking at the big picture. The erosion of your privacy rights obviously won't happen overnight. The government has just revealed that they've abused your trust and you are willing to not only absolve them but convince others to do the same.
* I'm not saying that this particular government is an evil dictatorship. That's a nice strawman you've created there (sneaky!). Data is just data and it can be used for both good and evil. I'm saying that the misappropriation of location data sets a dangerous precedent for Singaporeans. Any future government or lobbyists can take advantage of that.",2021-01-07 01:25:02
"I want to correct your understanding of how location tracking occurs with Bluetooth devices. BLE can be used for indoor position tracking when it communicates with multiple Bluetooth beacons around. The TraceTogether app also asks for ""Location"" permission, and users can choose to give it. In tandem, these two sources of information can give the collection server a pretty good idea of where you are.

More importantly, the issue of privacy isn't as cut and dry as you think it to be. It's about what the government can potentially do with this data. What if tomorrow an important member of an opposition party is being tracked without their consent? What if the government decides to trace thousands of people because they ""think"" they've committed a crime? What if the government collects live location data of all Singapore residents and uses that to predict peoples' behavior? What if that data is sold to third party sources for more effective ad targeting?

While some of these might seem paranoid, this is how it starts. We willingly give away information about ourselves under the blanket of security or convenience, not knowing how that data is being used and who exactly is accountable for it. This leads to a broken window theory, and we give up more of our privacy rights because we don't really see the big picture.

I understand that multiple corporate entities are potentially already tracing you, and that is not ok. The big difference is that the government can regulate corporate entities but who regulates the government?",2021-01-06 23:35:17

The reason why foreign students gets hired is because they can adapt. They know how to work. If any singaporean can be as adaptable and willing to work hard for it and learn real working skills instead of just a degree. They can also work in FAANG. 

I used to collab with Google employees and met some hiring managers.

"I think you meant ""would"" instead of wouldn't, but anyway, let me explain no 1. again because you guys don't seem to get it. 

1: Did you read my quote on the CPC? No data is safe from the police when a criminal investigation is underway, and this is true for any country except, and ironically, countries under dictatorship. The government has no say on whether or not SPF has access to TT - it operates as a separate entity, and saying otherwise would insinuate that the gov is conspiring with the SPF against the people. You better have proof to back that up.

2: Indeed data is just data, and so far it has been used to contact trace for covid, and eventually aid in criminal investigations (this is beyond the gov control, again ANY data is available to SPF under CPC). Data can always be used for the bad, but we should look to find a common ground between the pros and the cons instead of outright rejecting this notion from the start. Too free and you end up with the American situation and too confined and you end up with North Korea.

> ‚ÄúWe have always been conscious of the need to protect personal privacy. And to this end we took great effort in the design of the system, the coding of the application, we even open-sourced the code for public scrutiny and to share with overseas jurisdictions,‚Äù he added.

> Dr Balakrishnan said that TraceTogether only collects Bluetooth proximity data ‚Äúon a temporary basis‚Äù.

> ‚ÄúIt does not collect - and I want to emphasise - it does not collect GPS location data nor movement data. So let me reiterate this - the TraceTogether app and the token were not designed to allow any government agency to track the user,‚Äù he added

> ‚ÄúThe app or the token only keeps a temporary record of who you have come into close contact with for a prolonged basis. Neither the app nor the token tracks a user‚Äôs location.‚Äù

> The data is then stored in an encrypted form locally on the device - a user‚Äôs phone or the token. The encrypted data is then ""automatically purged"" after 25 days, said Dr Balakrishnan.

> ‚ÄúSo you can see that we have taken efforts, maximum efforts, to protect privacy while enabling contact tracing to be facilitated through digital means.‚Äù

> 

> Adding that the Government does not ‚Äútake the trust of Singaporeans lightly‚Äù, Dr Balakrishnan said the country cannot prevail in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic if Singaporeans did not trust public health authorities and the Government.

> ‚ÄúWe are grateful that more than three-quarters of our residents have chosen to participate in their TraceTogether programme. It reflects not only their willingness to play a part in our collective fight against COVID-19 but also their confidence in the government commitment to protect the data so collected,‚Äù he continued.

> ‚ÄúI want to again assure Singaporeans that your confidence is not misplaced.We will protect your privacy, and I would add, that once the COVID-19 pandemic is over and there is no longer a need for contact tracing we would most happily and cheerfully stand the programme down.‚Äù

> USE OF TRACETOGETHER DATA LIMITED TO ""VERY SERIOUS OFFENCES"": SHANMUGAM

> Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh thanked Dr Balakrishnan for acknowledging that the CPC ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt really in his contemplation‚Äù when his original statements were made.

> He then asked Dr Balakrishnan and Minister for Law and Home Affairs K Shanmugam to explain under what circumstances the police would ‚Äújudiciously‚Äù use the information collected by the TraceTogether programme.

> Under Section 20 of the CPC, the police are authorised to recover or seek any information in the possession of a person ‚Äúas long as the seeking of such information is not excluded by some other written law‚Äù, said Mr Shanmugam, adding that there are some provisions that circumscribe the exercise of police powers.

> ‚ÄúSubject to that, the CPC gives the power to the police. And when such a power is given, police are obviously under a duty as well.‚Äù

> He gave the example of a hypothetical murder case in which relevant information was available through a TraceTogether token.

> ‚ÄúIf the police chose not to seek that information, you can imagine how the victim‚Äôs family and indeed the rest of Singapore might react to that situation,‚Äù he said.

> But given that the TraceTogether programme is of ‚Äúnational importance‚Äù and ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, the police's use of data collected by TraceTogether is restricted to ‚Äúvery serious offences‚Äù, said Mr Shanmugam.

> ‚ÄúWhile that requirement is not in the legislation, it will be carefully considered within the police and discretion will be exercised in seeking this information,‚Äù he added.

> Although relevant information collected by TraceTogether may be produced in court during a trial, data of ‚Äúno particular use‚Äù will be deleted at the end of a police investigation, said Mr Shanmugam in response to a question from Mr de Souza.

> 

> Progress Singapore Party Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai asked Dr Balakrishnan for the number of instances when the police have used TraceTogether data and thanked him for responding to the strong public reaction.

> ‚ÄúHowever I would also like the minister to clarify further - one, when did he discover that his statement that he made before is going to be affected by the CPC?"" said Mr Leong.

> ‚ÄúTwo, his message today. Is it he wants to apologise that the Government or the minister has made an oversight, or is his message telling us that in Singapore we should just take it that the Criminal Procedure Code will be able to access all the information that they have on us in Singapore?‚Äù

> In response, Dr Balakrishnan said instances of TraceTogether data being used by the police is an ‚Äúoperational question‚Äù.

> ‚ÄúAs far as I am aware, so far I think there has been only one in which involved a murder case. But I am not privy to operational details and I shouldn't be and therefore I am not in a position to comment further on the investigations,‚Äù he added.

> Dr Balakrishnan then reiterated that he made the statements when the CPC was ‚Äúnot in my mind‚Äù.

> ‚ÄúSubsequently, we‚Äôve been having discussions, especially over the last few weeks as to whether we should in fact change the law or whether we continue as we are now,‚Äù he said.

> Those involved decided that it is ‚Äúbetter to be upfront‚Äù and are ‚Äúvery glad‚Äù that the parliamentary question was asked and answered on Monday, he continued.

> Adding that he is ‚Äúobsessively concerned‚Äù with accuracy with an ‚Äúabsolute adherence to honesty‚Äù, Dr Balakrishnan said: ‚ÄúAnd that means over the years from time to time when I have misspoken I have said so. I have never shied away from saying so because it is far more important to maintain trust.

> ‚ÄúI might be right or I might be wrong or I might have mistaken something or overlooked something, but rest assured when I discover it, I will say so and to the best extent possible, we will find a solution together. That is my approach and I don‚Äôt see any need to change from that and I hope you understand.‚Äù

1. Exclusion of tt for use of criminal investigation does not include scenarios if it is explicitly part of the criminal acts. Penal code forbid physical violence but excluded police if police use violence as part of duties. If police use violence outside their duties this whole exemption is moot.

And in any case if govt wanna put GPS tracking in TT I'm sure instead of doing some backdoor shit a grand and convincing reason will be cooked up for people first.

2. Before ong teng cheong our presidents were  selected. (Never mind that officially wee Kim wee is the first elected president cuz he exercised the power of elected president blah blah). Our president no executive power. Executive powers come from the elected legislative body. This place not America. Even WP had been pushing for abolishment of elected presidency for the longest time. So whats your point?",2021-01-06 08:34:09
"My point is that if you disallow the police to gather evidence from this particular source for investigation, someone (maybe the government,  maybe a rougue civil servant) can abuse this and the police will be powerless to gather evidence on suspicious activity (like suspected GPS tracking and backdoor) from this source (TT app). Privacy violation aren't as explcit and provable as a police punching you in the face. Without direct evidence, how is an act ""explicitly"" part of a criminal act?

My point is that if the legislative body interfere with executive powers to assuage the public on paper (populist move) over a specific app (unprecedented), it is an issue (a technical one too ). ""Our president no executive power"": precisely why they got away with amending the definition of an elected president? 

I'm not the one bringing in America, comparing privacy with physical violence, and WP's policies and yet I'm the one zipping all over the place?",2021-01-06 09:07:43
"I might have misread your previous comment on 'separation of executive and legislation as an issue that is technical enough' as a reference to President/Cabinet. Apologies.


The law can be simply written to exclude TT as evidence for criminal investigations, except when TT (or usage/development) itself is the subject of criminal investigation. 

I dont know how this can be done without contradicting other laws, but I'm pretty sure the bright minds on MoL or AGC can pull it off.

Which led to my biggest point. The purpose of the legislative is to represent constituents' will in the political arena (by being elected) and ensure the will is empowered through voting within the Parliament. Hence, the legislative by nature, antagonistic and interference to the executive, if the executive's action is not representing constituents will. Whether the constituents are wishing for dumbshit is another different subject for debate.

Due to the supermajority within Singapore and the party whip, the legislation is in line with the executive. Executive say something legislative will vote along with it, cuz party whip.

And the executive has pushed for many laws when it is convenient, contorting them to fit the agenda. And when it comes to more uncomfortable subjects like 377a, laws for domestic violence etc, suddenly we need to think through nuances and grey areas yada yada . 

So, is it populistic for the public to ask for TT to be excluded from cpc? We can agree to disagree. Is it justifiable for this to be done, in that it serves the greater good? We can agree to disagree on what is the greater good/lesser good.


But Is it possible for the Parliament  to pull this off like insert notifications in phone? Absolutely, if they want to.

"> given the relatively low severe crime rate compared to the larger issue of increasing political apathy of the citizenry

It's not just that we have a low severe crime rate, but also the fact that it is really hard to imagine TT data being the difference-maker even in those cases of severe crime. Plenty of people have already pointed out the many, many reasons why TT data is probably not very helpful for crime, especially next to the long list of powerful surveillance tools the police already have. Maybe it is still better than nothing, but surely not by much. 

Is it really worth compromising 1) public trust in the government and 2) the effectiveness of your most important contact-tracing tool in a global pandemic, for this tiny tiny marginal benefit to security? Has to be a no from me.",2021-01-12 18:13:48
"I think the simple response is that the laws imposed are not appropriate. 

TT is meant to be a temporary measure (yes yes we know that may turn out to be untrue). If so, why are we becoming dependent on it as another avenue for evidence. It‚Äôs going to fall away, at least in theory, at some point. 

On top of that, the efficacy of TT in terms of actually stopping crime seems iffy. Like many have pointed out, do we expect criminals to actually carry their TT devices around when they commit crimes? Do we really believe that a drug syndicate would get their guys to carry traceable phones and their tokens? If not, then what‚Äôs the real value in using TT for evidence? Arguably it would be problematic if a suspect can engineer a situation where they get someone else to carry their TT device in a different location right? 

If we apply some critical thinking to this, it surely raises more questions than the answers that have been provided thus far. Even the way the law being rushed out and how it‚Äôs being lauded by the PAP (self-praise at its highest) runs contrary to the sob stories they were telling in Parliament. And what public consultation took place? Again it would appear as if the entire thing was engineered so that the 60% who are less able to think critically start to think the Govt is listening when, it would seem, the Govt has just taken more rights from us. Clap for them in all honesty that people have become engineered to support such actions.",2021-01-12 18:13:17
">However that is the facts **as they are.**  In my recent readings on the founding histories of Singapore, I think  it is worth noting that the original agreement between Raffles and  Sultan Husain regarding the allowances the British would have over  Singapore were also reasonable **as they are.**  Those facts being that the British shall only have the permission to  build factories and conduct trade, whilst sovereignty over the island  was to remain with the Sultan. If the Sultan could forsee the subsequent  actions of the British under Dr. Crawfurd which seized all soveriegnty  from the Sultan, I doubt he would have deemed the Treaty reasonable.

Ehh the reason why the Sultan agreed to sign the new treaty was because he was broke AF and gambled his money away. Power was no longer with him and the British could just own him by signing the treaty.

There are many such notable similar examples in other countries, especially in the USA. In fact, just a few decades ago, the police over there was not able to use any personal data for evidence besides actual tools/weapons used for a crime. Nowadays, they can pull all phone records, bank statements and whatnot. This was all introduced under a small law, without much knowledge of the consequences to the public. It is worrying, and they will misuse such laws. I for one, am not using that app or the token, until really necessary.

"That is true. Though I would argue from the point where the Sultan's signature of the treaty which allowed the British as much free reign over the island as they did, eventually created the conditions such that they were able to eventually dispose of him. (rather than continuing to satisfy him with higher payment renegotiation) 

If the Sultan's agreement was shrewd enough to include immigration restrictions, thereby preventing the British utilisation of foreign convict labour, and hence forcing the British to depend on native labourers loyal to the Sultan. Then perhaps things would have turned out differently. Though also perhaps the way things did turn out was for the best. 

Similarly, the question should be asked. Is the current design of TT's relationship to the law shrewd enough to prevent potentialities of citizen mistrust of gov initiatives? 

Perhaps the hard-code way it is implemented interacts with the Police bureaucracy in such a way that it indeed a good safeguard and in time the citizens will see this and understand that they are in good hands. 

Perhaps it will happen in another way, either with the Police mishandling the data or with some flaw in PR causing the public to heavily doubt the policy, both cases leading to detrimental mistrust. 

Only those with a keen understanding of the Police bureaucracy as well as the nature of gov-citizen media relations would be able to give a good estimate of the potentialities of the TT design as is. That line of investigation would be useful to undergo both to affirm our confidence in this line of action as well as to introduce refinements if necessary.",2021-01-12 18:00:07

"TT is not preventing a second lockdown, and this is not about being willing to let another lockdown hapoen. Because it will not happen. PAP only clings onto power (other than their Gerrymandering) due to the promise of good economic performance. Another lockdown means the shaking of trust in their ability as a government as it will send the economy into a nosedive. They know this, we know this. Plus we are in the final legs of this pandemic with the vaccine rolling out. You are imagining a binary world where it's either TT and no lockdown or no TT and another lockdown. It's not realistic nor smart to make such an assumption in a tiny city state like SG. Our borders are not as pourous as other countries, we have good medical infrastructure and a largely educated population. These are bigger factors to preventing a second lockdown rather than a over engineered system. 

Now more than ever, is the time to ask questions of the govt and their role in your life. You said we have close to no privacy in SG. I will not refute that, but why have it reached this point? It is because we have accepted things as they are, apathy is what led us here. You might argue that multinational corperations are harvesting your data and selling them. Firstly, private companies are held to a different standard than your elected government. Secondly, these companies provide services that are optional. Not to say that it's okay, and you can't be mad, but it's a different question. 

Why is TT a bigger problem than private companies' data harvesting? It is because TT gives data to the government, which has so much more influence over your actions and daily routines with little to no benefit that SafeEntry already provides (SafeEntry is another problem). In exchange for this barely existing benefit you are allowing the government the expand it's powers to see who you meet and how long you meet them. If you follow PAP'S track record, they are not hesitant to persecute Singaporeans with a different set of political beliefs. Are we going to allow a government to have that much power? 

Also TT data won't swing a trial one way or another lol. There's literally no benefit for SPF to get any TT data

Stop labeling people, especially if you don't know what the terms mean. ü§≠

Also on the point of what location data can be used for, believe me when I tell you that the data can be used to make people's lives easier and can also be used to oppress people even without any ill intent. People think and act differently when they know that they are being surveiled. History has proven time and time again that this data can and will be misused at some point down the road.

I'm sure a few folks may be quoting 1984 without ever having read it. I'll grant you that there's some hyperbole here since 1984 is a dystopian fiction novel. That being said, many see the book as a warning. The erosion of your privacy won't happen in a day. There won't be a spillover event. It'll happen over years of apathy and bad judgement calls. People being critical of TT are expressing their opinion just as you have a right to do yours. Everyone on this sub is not being hysterical.

However I think that this criticism is half-assed at best. Whether we're using EN or the TraceTogether App or the token, the onus is on the user to install the app and carry the token around.

"Can we trust the government though?

At the end of the day we can quibble over semantics day in and day out on why so and so will or will not work; what I am still not seeing is the government proactively taking steps to guarantee our privacy. If the government wants us to ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù while simultaneously trusting them then the government needs to do a lot more in guaranteeing that contact tracing data will only ever be used for contact tracing.

PDPA is as good as out of the window right now (and as far as I am aware the government is exempt from PDPA anyway), and I‚Äôm not convinced that the OSA is actually on our side. For example: is it considered contravening the OSA if an order comes from the top to utilise contract tracing data for anything other than contact tracing? Are we supposed to believe empty promises that it‚Äôll never happen?

If the government is really so adamant that they‚Äôre never going to abuse any contact tracing data, then make it law. Just like how last-minute legislations have been made to tackle COVID, there needs to be purpose-specific legislation to guarantee our privacy during these difficult times. Enact laws that explicitly state that contact tracing data may only be used for contact tracing. Enact laws prohibiting ANYONE ‚Äî even civil servants, the police, and ministers ‚Äî from using the data for any other purpose. Enact laws that guarantee harsh minimum penalties for anyone who misuses contact tracing data and anyone who authorities such misuse.

Until such laws are in place, it‚Äôs going to be very difficult swallowing any ministerial statement about how our privacy is in safe hands and the data will never be abused and so on. Show some accountability for once.",2020-06-15 20:16:18

"lol, this sub is erratic in the downvotes, pay them no mind. 

Let's pretend that Alice and Bob recently met up and Alice just found out that she has Covid-19.     
From what I understand the way TraceTogether works in centralised contact tracing. In this case, the govt would be able to pull your past contact logs - meaning govt will know that Alice has been in contact with Bob, and will be able to serve Bob a Quarantine Order. The govt knows that Alice infected Bob, but Bob would not know.
      
On the other side we have EN which works in decentralised contact tracing. Once Alice is infected, she'll send her info to the cloud - not her past contact logs, just her anonymised identifier. EN will gather all the identifiers of people who are recently infected and compile a list. Bob's app will then download the list and scan if there are anybody on the list that is within his recent contacts. Bob would then be notified that someone in his recent contacts has been infected and that he'd have to self-isolate. Since Alice didn't upload her past contacts, and Bob didn't upload his past contacts, there is no way that the govt would know that Alice infected Bob, in fact, the govt wouldn't know who Alice and Bob are in the first place.

Thank you for reflecting valid concerns.

The device has only Bluetooth proximity function, no GPS or no cellular connection.

Key advantage is battery life and privacy.

The battery will last many months before replacement is needed.

The data stays encrypted only with you. There are no complicatged cotnrols.

Just switch on once - that's it.

Gahmen being a silly goose. Lets hear what Lee Kuan Yew has to say first.,2020-06-07 20:55:20
"The reason why people are skeptical about government tracking is because 1. Lack of transparency and 2. Misuse of the data. 

For 1, not saying that Sg govt has done enough, but they are already relatively transparent and increasing transparency is possible, so it is not a unsolvable limitation to government tracking. 

2, also unlikely in Singapore given past policing - you may disagree with the criteria for action, but it is fair. 

Data leaks in this specific case is also unlikely if the device only collects proximity data which what was is planned for the device.

I also find the reaction quite the irrational overreaction when people can agree with giving up a significant degree of personal freedom by staying at home to keep the virus at bay or using a contact tracing app but not agree to a tracking device. Especially so when nation-wide tracking may allow people to move more freely since clusters can be tracked more easily. If the device needs to be used after the virus has been solved, that's when we need to get angry, not now when every measure can help reduce cases and eliminate a second wave.

That said, a fob design for carrying in your pocket may have gone down marginally better than a ""wearable"" device like a wristband. That at least adds a layer of distance from the tracking device and our bodies, which may be emotionally more comfortable.",2020-06-07 23:02:32
"Calm down folks. The device just stores the proximity data from other devices. Just like how the contact tracing app works. There is no location data. So if person X has Covid, they can just let all the devices that has been detected being near person X's for the minimum required time, to go get checked.",2020-06-07 22:59:03
Nobody knows any details about this device. It's possible its purely for elderly without smartphone access. Lets wait to hear more details before passing judgement.,2020-06-07 17:56:31
"I don't get why people are so upset by this....

Everyone is complaining that the MRT, the buses, the supermarkets are too crowded and they fear getting infected. So obviously you would want to be contacted if you were in close proximity to a confirmed case.

Now how should the government trace you. Cameras/CCTV are hard to monitor and time consuming to trace people as you have to either hope they look directly into a camera and hope you can match the face in a database or you need to trace them all the way home, find out who they are and then contact them. This is not only inefficient, but costly as well.

So the best choice is tracing through an app or through a wearable device. Firstly you can't really make an app obligatory. Even if it is highly unlikely, what about people who don't have a phone? Does the government buy you a phone then? It's also hard for enforcers to check if people have downloaded the app. Additionally, if you contact trace through an app it sets a precedent for the government to track you through your cellphone. People such as Edward Snowden have warned that apps such as contact tracing apps will be useful during crisis, but will remain a part of life even after the pandemic. That's when people privacy is really violated. For people who aren't tech savvy (all our aunty and uncles) who don't know much about allowing location data access and such, this will really breach their privacy. A wearable device is a good option because you know when they are tracking you, and after the crisis you can throw out the device or return it. There's no fear of the government still tracking you. Enforcers can also easily see if you are wearing your device without having to stop you and talk to you.

Overall I think the wearable device is a good option. Where are you going that you don't want the government to know? Your friends house? A party? If that's why you don't want to wear the device then you are the biggest problem we have right now. Wearing the device would be as much hassle as remembering to wear a mask when you leave the house. After coronavirus passes you can ditch the device and chuck it out or give it back. Simple.

Edit: I really like my privacy, but I don't care if the government knows where I'm going in these times. Wow, I go out for my daily jog and go out once a week to get groceries at the nearest supermarket. Even if the data was hacked it's not useful. Giving up this tiny bit of data is such a small thing compared to knowing if you've been in close proximity to a COVID-19 case. And like I said, after the crisis you can throw out the device, or stop wearing it. If it's an app then only tech savvy people will truly know if the app has been completely deleted or if it's still secretly tracking you.

Edit 2: If you guys think that somehow wearing this device is a huge step up from what the government is already doing to track you, then I have some bad news for you.",2020-06-08 07:09:10

"Great find. My interpretation of what Balakrishnan said is that he is blowing them (TraceStick) off politely, because govt has already been working on their own device for some time.

He says ""Believe me, we're going through the same issues...  Anyway, we'll follow up \[said awkwardly with stuttering\]. You know we're looking at devices, and we are looking at using Bluetooth because that makes it inter-operable with the current TraceTogether devices. So anyway, it's a... you're on the right track. **We'll be in touch**.""

""We'll be in touch"" is a standard blow-off phrase e.g. used when you didn't ace the job interview.

I don't think they were impressed with the bulky pager-like form factor and various other cons. Later he tells the TraceStick guy to ""go purchase the ESP32 and work off it directly, it will be a fraction of that \[the production cost\]. Good effort.""",2020-06-08 09:05:01

In my opinion, I think the SG Government saw how anonymous and private it was, then said no. Apple and Google designed it in such a way that not themselves, the government or users will know the identity of who they got in contact with.

If you look at the FAQ for the API, you get a notification if the app finds a match and thinks you've been exposed. You receive info about what you should do next. But it does not say that the govt will know who you are. If you choose to ignore the notification, MOH will never know.

I prefer TraceTogether to SafeEntry. SafeEntry DOES tell the govt where you've been to, and you have to manually press quite a few buttons to do it. It also doesn't have info about how close you were to the infected person, for how long. You could be on  another floor/wing of the shopping center. Whereas TraceTogether doesn't give location data away, and works seamlessly. And the data stays on your phone unless you test positive. With the Google API, your bluetooth ID changes randomly very 10-20 minutes, defeating the conspiracy theory of the govt putting up stationary Bluetooth receivers everywhere to track your movements.",2020-06-08 08:44:24

"Current apps use BLE to periodically send out a unique identifier, and detect other people's identifiers and use the signal strength to approximate how long and how close you have been to said person. Once a person is sick, the (anonymous) identifier is marked as infected, and published on a server. The app periodically checks published identifiers, and when it sees you have been in close contact with an infected identifier for more than X minutes, it prompts you to get tested.

Some countries (e.g. Belgium) have employed 3rd parties to audit apps and servers (to ensure privacy and/or security), although that doesn't necessarily mean they really are 100% secure, or anonymous. Keeping your BLE on might be not 100% secure, but IMO it's a thousand times more secure than constantly sending your GPS location to external servers...

If it does happen that the anonymous BLE identifiers can be de-anonymised, then the police would only be able to check who you've been in contact with in the last two weeks (assuming they have physical access to your phone and the app has no remote access, stores the list of seen identifiers only locally, and only identifiers seen in the last two weeks are stored).

On your device ‚Äúbob‚Äù, you report that you are infected. The server looks at all ‚Äúbob‚Äù uploads for the past two weeks, seeing all of the beacon pairs, and sends the ‚ÄúAlice‚Äù user a push notification saying the were exposed on the date/time the match was reported. 

I get the worry about someone injecting bad data in a beacon, although it is a short string and all garbage data is dropped.

"The app generates random numbers and broadcasts them via Bluetooth. At the same time it listens for broadcasts from other users within range, maintaining a list of every number it's seen in the last, say, 14 days.

Now, if a user tests positive they can then submit their broadcast numbers for the past 14 days (or whatever) to a central server that everyone polls periodically. If a number you retrieve from that server matches a number you've seen from broadcasts near you, that means you've been near an infected person and the app will warn you.

It's really very elegant and doesn't require location or identity data at all. In everyday use the only data that's exposed is a periodic poll request which reveals nothing other than that someone with your IP address is using the app. If you submit a positive result you may have to authenticate (to prevent abuse), but in that case your test result is already on record anyway. And there's no immediate way to derive location data from the numbers you upload.

It's not *perfect* from a privacy perspective, but it's a damn good compromise given the crisis. If two people submit positive results, correlating their respective lists would reveal if and how often they've been close to each other, so you could map out some vague and very limited social networks of infected people, but even that is kinda OK since it's valuable data to researchers and the circumstances are exceptional, after all.",2021-01-06 02:10:34

Basically, your phone tells everyone nearby a randomish code representing your phone (it is not for identifying you though). This code changes every 15 minutes, and it is cryptographically hard to take a code and figure out information about you. Phones keep a track of what codes are given to them by other phones for 14 days. 


If you get infected, you tell a centralised server those codes of yours. Those codes are then broadcast to everyone. If the broadcasted code matches something your app recorded, you must have been near that device. 


So the government never has to know where you were or anything. There are entirely open source programs (like Germany's) that implement this.

> Roughly how long maybe, but not the exact time, plus only up to a limited amount of days.

The only ""maybe"" is if the devices register each other at all. How exact the time granularity will be ultimately depends on how often the IDs are rotated. If you do it too seldom, you can trace people passively because it becomes much easier to tie IDs to individuals. Typically it's in 5-15 minute increments. The number of days you store contact logs is a matter of policy, not protocol.

> Massively different from shitty protocols that collect much more data in a centralized database.

No, not with respect to the policy in the article, which is what I said in my first response to you, so my goalposts remain steady in place. Don't blame me for your waxing on and on about the same refuted points over and over again.

> I don't think you understand how it works.

Then please explain your take to me so that I can correct you.

In my understanding, users generate ephemeral IDs that are broadcasted over BLE. The IDs are rotated at regular intervals so as to prevent the correlation between users and their used IDs, and only the user's device can derive the sequence of ephemeral IDs used. The devices record broadcasted ephemeral IDs and store them locally on the device. Tracing is enabled by voluntary submission of reports of the seeds used to generate the ephemeral IDs. These reports are then distributed to all users so that they can check whether and when they were in contact with the user by correlating them with their contact log containing ephemeral IDs they've encountered.

Naturally, if an adversary can retrieve both the seeds from which the ephemeral IDs were generated and the contact logs of two users, they can know whether and when the users were in contact.

I suggest reading the DP-3T whitepaper if you want to be able to say ""I don't think you understand how it works"" without talking out of your ass.

> Stupid pedantry.

Yeah, how about that goalpost moving, though? ""OK but not for a long time anyway!"". You're obviously not arguing in good faith by now. You don't know what you're talking about and you're so unwilling to admit it that you'd rather be wrong than appear wrong.",2021-01-06 22:31:51

"To keep track of who came into contact with confirmed covid cases, the govt has 2 systems:

1) safe entry: when entering malls and stalls, we must scan a QR code and enter our identity number

2) at first it was an app but then now given as a tictac-box sized token, tracetogether: it actively pings its presence to nearby phones/tokens. Each device is suppose to keep a log of the time and id of each recent device it got pinged. If one is confirmed with covid, their token gets checked to see the list of recently pinged devices that coincide during the duration of the infection. Then it gets checked against the registered database to see who owns that device id. Then the relevant persons get informed to come for a swab


-----

So you can see how the latter can get abused. Many were reluctant to install tracetogether on phone. Hence the tokens.

So recently police have been fiddling on using tracetogether data to locate criminal and/or confirm where suspects were (most probably by comparing with data saved in the device logs of known MOP in the vicinity at the time of the event, or maybe confirm alibi was with suspect)

Singapore is a totalitarian authoritarian conformist state *and* an actual perfect futuristic utopia, the first time both those things have come together.

The thing is that Harry was a ""Benevolent Dictator"" which enabled the government and people to cede all authority to this charismatic and effective leader and his position.

"> # Measures to tackle COVID-19 cases in dorms early on were 'insufficient': Teo Chee Hean

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore‚Äôs migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures ‚Äúturned out to be insufficient‚Äù, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

> During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.

> In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date. Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.

> ‚ÄúOn 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,‚Äù said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.

> ‚ÄúHowever, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.‚Äù

> While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, ‚Äúno two crises are the same‚Äù, Teo said. The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is ‚Äúa major challenge‚Äù, he added.

> On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.

> ‚ÄúBut they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines‚Äù, he noted.

> The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH‚Äôs overall medical support plan.

> Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.

> ‚ÄúThe operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak. About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,‚Äù he added.

> Teo‚Äôs delivery is the third in a¬†series of national speeches¬†by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister¬†Lee Hsien Loong¬†last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday. Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing is scheduled next to deliver his speech on Sunday.

> In his speech on ‚ÄúResilience in a changing external environment‚Äù,¬†Teo also spoke at length about Singapore‚Äôs efforts in providing community care facilities for patients who have mild or no symptoms.

> ‚ÄúWe had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and had started to build them. We accelerated these plans and scaled them up, adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April,‚Äù he said.

> At the peak on 12 May, some 20,000 patients were being cared for at community care and similar facilities, with as many as 1,000 are admitted daily, Teo said.

> ‚ÄúThis is more than the total number of beds in all our public acute hospitals. We mobilised resources from across our public service, government-linked companies, and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities. Healthcare volunteers stepped forward to help man them,‚Äù he stressed.

> ‚ÄúThis is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our healthcare system and putting lives at risk.‚Äù

> The clear lesson learned during the COVID-19 outbreak is that Singapore needs to plan in peace-time ‚Äúon facing the unknown, and build deep reserves of people and capabilities, so that when we face a crisis, we can act decisively, and respond flexibly and rapidly‚Äù.

> He referred to past challenges in Singapore‚Äôs history such as in 1967 when the British announced the withdrawal of their troops from the city-state. With the move, Singapore was poised to lose 20 per cent of its gross domestic product and 70,000 jobs at a time when the population was half of what it is today, Teo said.

> ‚ÄúWe are far more resilient today than in 1967, and better positioned to create new markets, businesses, and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.‚Äù

> Singapore also rode out the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Asian and global financial crises. ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is an even bigger test,‚Äù he added.

> The outbreak is the first major crisis for many of the new generation of ministers and civil servants taking the lead in efforts to tackle the situation.

> The ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of their older Cabinet colleagues as well as consulted widely within and outside the government, Teo said.

> He added, ‚ÄúOver the past few months, I have worked very closely with them. We speak daily and exchange views freely. They have stepped up to the task, worked together as a team, and led from the front. This is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore.‚Äù

Another unlikeable personality, IMO, is Ho Ching. It‚Äôs made even worse by the seeming lack of restraint she has over her words on social media - the lack of class and empathy from someone of such a high standing is, frankly, quite embarrassing.

"Truth be told, Covid-19 is quite different from SARS, and while I think the government learnt a lot from SARS, we didn't pivot fast enough this time. Covid-19 is a lot more infectious than SARS, which led to the large numbers of infections seen all over the world, as well as in Singapore. 

As for what Minister Jo Teo's did / said, I think the lapses under her ministry, while not directly responsible for Covid-19, did contribute to the rapid spread of the disease amongst our migrant worker population. Had she been more amiable, less arrogant, I think more people would have given her a pass (She seems to be trying for Minister Shanmugam's style, without having his charisma). Covid-19 has really wrecked havoc all over the world. Again, all of the above are my opinions. 

With regards to Ho Ching, I wholeheartedly agree with you. It's embarrassing to see the wife of our PM act in such a childish and classless manner. So far in this crisis, I see PM Lee only when he's giving speeches, but he has been reassuring, and his messages in different languages tailored to the audience. His speeches have been lauded, on reddit, on my facebook feed from my foreign friends, as well as on the news. So, to see Mdm Ho Ching act in such an infantile manner is really disappointing. But, she's not a politician, and free to act and say as she please. I just think the way she acts and speaks isn't befitting of my respect, at least on social media.

"The CB was supposed to end next week, then it was extended and measures further tightened to better fight and control the virus. What are the fluctuating numbers indicating? Are measures working? Will the CCB be further extended?",2020-05-01 15:49:36
I want to get off Mr. Bones' wild ride,2020-05-01 15:36:33
"Some thoughts - given the high level numbers and the disparity between cases in the various categories (dorms only, Singaporeans/PRs, work pass holders, work permit holders etc), I barely pay too much attention anymore to the preliminary high level number that comes out at \~3pm everyday. We have to wait for the detailed updates at night to get a better sense of how the situation is progressing.

In particular, I'm paying close attention to community cases and work permit holders not living in dorms (I'm conservatively assuming these people are still part of the community, but most should be serving 14 day SHNs). I reckon we need to see both community cases only (Singaporeans/PRs + work pass holders) AND community cases + work permit holders not in dorms stay low for at least 2 weeks before we start getting our hopes up. Dorm cases pretty straight forward there - given the tight living conditions and aggressive testing, i reckon we see high numbers for a while more before we start seeing the results of the distancing measures that were implemented about 2 weeks back for the dorms.  


Also - keeping brief track of unlinked cases is also somewhat important. In particular, both the absolute number of unlinked cases on a particular day AND following up the next day or couple to see if those unlinked cases have been linked (they do tend to take a while to link some cases because contact tracing etc is a VERY tough job). This is important because if they can link a specific case to an existing cluster and/or infected person, there is a lower possibility of there being existing further community spread that the authorities don't yet know about. Ideally would like to see those unlinked numbers stay low AND have the authorities constantly being able to link cases on a daily basis (which they have).

If you need any hard evidence and/or anecdotes that social distancing works, just look at the trend of community cases and work permit holders not in dorms over the past 2 weeks. So please. PLEASE STAY AT HOME AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.",2020-05-01 23:14:37

Lots of creative breakdown that alter the actual confirmed case numbers. It should just be cases in dorm vs the rest of the community. Govt needs to keep the community figure low and not just the SG/PR number. The other issue is the clusters and unlink which adds to uncertainty. So what if the confirmed cases in community are low? We don‚Äôt know who are the asymptomatic carriers walking around which explained so many new clusters. This is worrying if the clusters are being to be bigger in numbers.

"The IMH cluster was sized at 4, with 3 linked from contact tracing. 

If case numbers cannot be given, I hope that the date of diagnosis can be provided for non-dorm and construction sites for new linked cases, to allay fears of an increase coming from new cases when the numbers usually come earlier cases.

"> # Coronavirus: Cruise ships assessed for feasibility to temporarily house healthy foreign workers

> SINGAPORE - Cruise ships are being assessed for their feasibility as temporary housing for foreign workers who are recovered from Covid-19 and tested negative for the virus.

> SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius, mid-sized cruise ships operated by Genting Cruise Lines, will be checked for consideration by the Government for factors such as ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures.

> If deemed feasible, the two cruise ships may be used to complement other interim facilities such as Singapore Armed Forces military camps and vacant Housing Board blocks that have been refurbished to house healthy workers.

> By reducing numbers of workers in existing dormitories, health measures can be implemented more effectively, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in a media statement on Friday (April 17) morning.

> Cruise ships are being considered for use as temporary housing as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact, added STB.

> SuperStar Gemini, which arrived from Hong Kong on Friday, is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SuperStar Aquarius may be activated for assessment at a later date.

> If deemed suitable, the two ships may accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers in total.

> STB said that ""if activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times"".

> Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

> Related Story Coronavirus: 3 more foreign worker dormitories declared isolation areas

> Related Story Coronavirus: Floating facilities ready to house healthy foreign workers

> While the spread of the coronavirus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially.

> As of Friday morning, the total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689, which is about 60 per cent of all Singapore's cases.

> There are now a total of 12 dormitories declared as isolation areas where workers at these lodgings must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.

Where are the RCL and Costa ships that homeport in Singapore? Not starcruise again,2020-04-17 12:54:40
"Came here to say, this will not help and it‚Äôs such a terrible decision.  
  
I know our Frontlines in charge of Covid containment is overwhelmed with work but this has to be said:  

**Edit: ignore the first 3 points. Cruise for recovered FW.**  
1.They will do swap test first on those being relocated to these cruise- **but tests are known to have turn out negative initially** so they can still be infected.
   
2.These FW aren‚Äôt fully quarantined, **they are still going to work**.  
(Another concern, are we asking FW to continue wearing mask throughout work? again, if not then it‚Äôll obviously be more likely to spread Covid. Perhaps their work already requires them to wear a mask idk.. I‚Äôll just point this out so anyone in the know can work it out so no FW faints doing  labour work because of a suffocating mask whole day.)
   
3. Bad publicity worldwide. Once an outbreak occurs on this cruise(unless it‚Äôs contained very well, which is just betting ur luck.)
   
4. We should be applying lockdown for all FW living in crowded/shared dorm for at least 14days to make sure our healthcare doesn‚Äôt get strained more.
   
5. Imo, It makes no sense to let our FW continue work during this CB and Dormitory spike. We should solve the crowded dorm issues first, since we currently have community spread going on we shouldn‚Äôt react as if FW bringing Covid back to temporary dorm or causing further spread in community isn‚Äôt likely. 
   
My suggestion: I don‚Äôt know the capacity our country can do to house as many of them separately. But if surveillance is an issue, we can make mid shift shelters and get general public to help monitor via camera(we report to authorities if anyone try to sneak out) hopefully this will help slow the spread and we can get some breather for our frontlines.  
(For the sake of everyone, We will have to endure and work together if rubbish and cleaning or other essentials done by FW is disrupted.)
   
Before *you* start flaming aimlessly. Lockdown and surveillance means, **temporary** build a fenced shelter/tents for few weeks so the dormitory issues doesn‚Äôt turn tragic(we will only monitor the fences to make sure no one flout).

Edit: just realised it was for recovered FW, heard on TV and saw the comments hence I didn‚Äôt check the article first sorry. But some of my points can be considered.

This is confusing though: 
>The STB said: ""If activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times.""

>Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

If they are recovered why do you expect them to observe safe distancing?",2020-04-18 11:27:32

The dorm operators have been complying with all of the rules and regulations set by the authorities with regards to number of occupants, provision of facilities, etc. I think it is Singapore Government that needs to step up and mandate improvements by amending the prevailing law. 

A possible increase in the construction and maintenance cost (which will find its way to Singapore public in general) can be partially, or even completely offset from the current foreign worker levies that the government has been collecting. Majority of these levies amounted to 600-700 SGD/ workers, and a bigger portion of these levies should be used to improve workers welfare.",2020-04-14 07:23:26
"I agree with your opinion that companies should provide better accommodations for the workers,  but I notice in your text this feeling of "" they are not our people, why bother?"" . These companies already pay taxes, the workers already pay taxes , they live sometimes in Singapore right ? So they are contributing to your economy. I feel so much this undertone of : they are not from Singapore, they are less than us. These workers are one of the bases of your economy, when I see heavy duty workers on construction sites, I rarely see a Singaporean, I see hardworking people that are deemed less because they are not from a higher ""cast"" in the Singaporean society. Sure, make the companies act, but its  YOUR government that is enabling this, don't treat them as not your problem because they are, it's your government allowing this to exist, it's companies contributing to SINGAPOREAN economy that hire these workers. So don't treat as it's not Singapore's problems because it is.",2020-04-14 04:18:27
"I truly believe this is a cumulation of public infrastructure bidding practices, demand for lower cost projects by all parties, high land cost, and lack of innovation in the construction industry both in Singapore and as a whole.

The government is the biggest developer in singapore due to infrastructural contracts. They also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure. Some news reports here: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116)

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins. [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/govt-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/govt-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders)

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

FWIW, I've commented on this a few times:

"Nice opinion, but this is literally a slap on the wrist. For companies, these construction workers are expendable. They get injured in the workplace, they get shipped back to their home countries after patching them up. You think a fine + bills is a ""wake up call"". Nah, it's just a ""one-off expense"", ""we got caught fine"", basically a gamble for them. The calculations for them is such that they can mistreat them and still be in the green (cos you know, these events don't happen every year).

They will just gladly pay up and mistreat them again. And you know what? They won't follow, they will try to bend the rules further (like people who flout SHN/CB rules) and that will result in worse conditions for the workers. For instance, if a worker gets XYZ communicable disease (assuming it isn't hard to test like COVID-19), instead of reporting, they will just quickly ship that worker back to this hometown on the grounds of ""slacking off at work"". There, we mitigated the spread, absolutely nothing happened in our dorms! Bring in the next healthy batch of workers.

What we need isn't punitive punishment only (not saying that they shouldn't foot the bill). What we need is regulations and oversight. Which is why I feel, just like our HDBs, housing for them should be government run. That way, the government has control over it and we have indirect control over how the government treats them (e.g. making it a voter issue for pete's sake).",2020-04-14 00:46:43
"> When things were going well, they were swimming in profits.

I'd like a source on this if you have it.

"I'm with you in that, I really REALLY hope the companies running the dormitories get fined MASSIVELY after this is over. Their oversight, complacency and greed caused this, they should be penalized, more than the usual wrist-slapping over the last decade.

About taxpayers' money being spent to treat the foreign workers, I think it's still going to be much lesser than the subsequent social and economic costs if the government did NOT intervene.

The last few weeks have shown that, no amount of appeals to common good is working... people just don't give a shit. Those who've run the dorms have been doing this years, and there's very little chance of them changing their ways, and if at all they do, there's a question of whether they'll do it fast enough.

In a pandemic crisis where time is critical, government intervention is the only way, imho

Who foots the bill is a question best left for after the pandemic has run its course. And I really hope the government slaps a hefty penalty on the companies.",2020-04-14 01:12:50
No - private companies wuld actually aggravate the spread of the Wuflu but under-reporting and hiding cases if they were required to pay.  Now saying that there is definite issue around cleanliness and standards.,2020-04-14 09:12:59
"You also need to consider that checks were done by government agencies to clear these to be ""fit to live"" in.

Minister of State & Manpower stated 
> Mr Zaqy said conditions at the dormitory were found to be satisfactory when the last inspection was done on March 4.

So if ""shitty conditions"" can pass MOM inspection standards.

Question to be asked:

* Are amenities adequate for the workers to use?
* Is the inspection criteria stringent to ensure liveability? (Electrical, plumbing etc) Or the inspection was done half fuck?
* Problem of deplorable living conditions have already been around from initial -> current ""satisfactory"" conditions. Are the laws/ standards created to hit the bare minimum of the workers ""rights""? Social workers working with them have already mentioned these issues over many years.

[Source](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-conditions-at-punggol-dormitory-could-have-been-better-maintained-as-it-was-made)

Even if the workers fuck shit up in the dorms, isn't inspection meant to uncover these teething problems and reflect it to ministry & dormitory providers?

I see all these moves by the governing agency to move them out as a way to 

* Solve current ""satisfactory but deplorable"" conditions on paper
* Solve the now exploding increase of infection rate
* Sweep their crap way of handling treating of FW from the past till current under the rug (inspection criteria) 
* Acknowledge but don't apologize for past failings wrt. handling of the foreign workers situation

Ultimately, we as a society need to pay the price for the situation mentioned above. Prices of HDB have remained pretty cheap while cost of workers have increased over time. We as a society have also chosen to push them away from general population areas in fear of losing property value etc.

"Unpopular opinion: nothing will happen to the dorm owners and it is not their fault

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be. 

There are restrictions on how many beds you can put in a certain area, how many toilets per number of ppl, fire safety requirements, a sickbay separate from living qtrs must be planned, WiFi is compulsory, even entertainment is a must. These are all set out by big G not the dorm owners. Why will any dorm owner go beyond the basic requirement to make a loss? 

Most people will not believe it but the obscene environment is actually caused by the workers themselves. The best example is hanging clothes. By law, the dorm owner must specifically have an area just for hanging clothes because hanging clothes in your sleeping qtrs is asking for disease to spread but the workers would rather hang them in their own rooms for convenience. 

Many do not practice basic hygiene. My own employees said it was a living hell with bedbug infestations so we moved them out.

There's a limit to how much we can interfere with free market and more importantly, how nice should we treat the employees? Should the cost rise to 2-3k per employee?

"For a short term solution, yes you are right. However it would become another cycle hidden away from us in the future when the foreign workers and their living conditions becomes forgotten and the companies decide to start exploiting loopholes in the systems.

Collectively I still feel such situations could have been overall avoided if not for the fact that singaporeans have become an entitled nation. The hard truth is that no one would do their work for the meagre salary. Theres also the hard labour that is not enticing under the hot sun or stifled conditions within construction. We should have been learning from examples like Australia, where they pay their labour workers well and a huge bulk of the hard labour jobs consists of their own people. This also creates a sense of pride within our community.

Going back to the main point, if we as a nation has been in such a situation where we dont rely on foreign workforce, the housing situation might not have happened and any form of exploitation would have been greatly reduced which in turns lead up to the fact that when a pandemic occurs, which is does throughout history, such a scenario we see unfolding would not have occurred.

The foreign workers and their contributions have been immense to our nation building. However this is a flipside to think about as well.",2020-04-14 01:41:47

"Its kind of hard to just push the blame to dormitory operators (DO) though. It's easy to say that the company could've provided solution. But solution cost money and who's footing the bill.

DOs usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels. What are the demands? How do we balance between quality and cost. I believe that you wouldn't expect DOs to operate at a loss unless they're doing charity and expected to make some profit.

Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others. Do you think that I will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other, lousier dormitories are charging?

Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price? Would DOs that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive? Those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general.

Then you might say that, why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better. Then again who is paying for it? If it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories, how do we get people to do it? If the cost increases, are the workers suppose to pay for the increase? Or are the employers expected to absorb the fee? Or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers. And we have another recurring problem.

Then how are we going to ensure that cost of housing and maintenance does not increase if the cost is passed on the employers? How are we going to help those whos affected by this change?

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

We need to be careful with this as well, otherwise the costs for the better dorms will be passed to the workers. A majority of them won't want this - they just want to do their time, earn enough, and leave as soon as possible.",2020-04-14 10:13:57

"Foreign worker dormitory is basically BMT army dormitory. A couple if not more bunk beds in a room, depending on room size with shared living area.

They aren't living in inhuman conditions. I doubt they will be fined except for if safe distancing law applies to the dorm supervisors. The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well. HUGE FINES like people are hoping for probably won't happen.

If it all adds up it might be substantial, but nothing big enough to invoke waves of change. Stricter supervision will become a thing, but I doubt they will suddenly be living in better homes. While living conditions were not stellar, they were livable. There were no major issues prior to Covid. So the majority of this outrage is stemming from *distancing issues.*

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

If anyone of you can solve these issues, and compile the math and financial budget required for any minister to undertake this task, be my guest.

"Hey, thanks for the reply and I get your frustrations because that's what I have been trying to reply to comments here. 

I don't have issues with the size per room. I have stayed before. But I do with two things, the maintenance and the size of dorm.

The size is fixed by the MOM guidelines of certain sqft per pax. Not the most comfortable but they are just cheap accommodation. For the maintenance, I know and I've seen how sloppy it can get. On facilities and all. Yes, I think they should be subjected to fines for that.

Size of dorm, now this will fall under regulations which have to be changed to restrict mega dorms from happening again.",2020-04-14 07:50:16
"I agree with you. Singaporeans demand for a distinction between locals and foreigners. Otherwise, why have a citizenship? Also, these dorms are not the best, because these workers are meant to be transient. 

What is required is basic standards to be met. They are not living in inhuman/ cruel conditions. Their basic needs are met. Emphasis is on ""basic"" - nothing more. 

Seen the pictures of MOM approved dorms online. Yes, some dorms are a bit messy and look cluttered; but area wise, it is comparable to our NS dormitories. 

IF our SAF soldiers and NSFs can stay in such ""inhuman"" bunks, why can't our foreign workers? The complaint, rather should be - maybe we should be making the dorm operators enforce some level of discipline. Maybe more ""stand by area"" and ""area cleaning"". Or hire more cleaners.

Don't forgot that if you actually read the regulations, you will see that it is mandated by law for every dorm to have common areas for recreation; rooms to hang their clothes; sick bays and even wifi. So if they choose not to hang their clothes in the common area - that is in breach of regulations.",2020-04-14 12:56:57

Any business or government that cannot ensure humane conditions for all should fall. It's as simple as that. If it requires a period of a lowered standard of living which is still humane, then so be it.

"I don't think you're being creative enough with your solutions. 

1. Do we need that many foreign workers in the first place? We know that our construction companies are very low-tech when compared to developed nations because foreign labour here is still considered way too cheap. Why buy a bulldozer when I can hire 10 FWs to do the same job with hammers? Even the govt has been trying to persuade these companies to tech-up with no result. So there is still space to reduce the number of workers while still maintaining the same output. 
2. Do we really lack space? Some of the bosses of these dorms own a couple of landed properties for themselves both in and out of Sentosa. Maybe its time to consider a more utilitarian approach to the use of our land. If we are so land-scarce as you say, then why allow people to own more property than they need? 
3. Lastly, why must the solution fall on us? Govt sets the law and the market should be left with its own devices to come up with solutions. That is the beauty of capitalism. Maybe if we had more stringent regulations on FW housing then companies will finally trade in hiring worker en masse to buying technology.",2020-04-14 14:39:32

Literal tax paying citizens of Hong Kong lives in more inhumane conditions. Did you even read what I wrote? 

Living in a dormitory cluster is not inhumane. We are not throwing them into the slums where people have to literally live surrounded by their own waste with no readily available source of water or sanitary toilets. 

Just what kind of living conditions do you believe FW dorms to be?

They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers.

If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore. If you are saying people are dying because of the living condition, bring up evidence, because as far as I can tell, nothing has even come close to being negligent enough to cause death. 

Most if not all foreign worker death comes from workplace accidents.

Clearly that's not an accurate way to measure living conditions.

They live in humane conditions. Living in a bunk setting is far from inhumane. Amenities are provided to ensure they are living in humane condition.

"1) Bringing in 10 foreign workers using a hammer is just disingenuous to the work they are doing. Give some actual level of research if you want to make a proposal that upgrading tech will significantly reduce the need for foreign workers.

How many skilled workers are needed to operate the vehicle, what is the lump-sum cost of investment and what is the upkeep cost? How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce? How much training is necessary and how long will it take to implement?

""Just upgrade lah"" is something you hear too often from ignorant bosses and ignorant masses. It provides absolutely zero solution, and zero steps towards the solution. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.

2) I can agree with this. However, you talk about capitalism in your third point. Don't allow the successful to have landed property, lose the successful. This disgusting world you are living in is controlled by the 1%.

Then again, how much landed space do you really think that will clear up?  I don't think that shit will be the solution to this problem here.

Its the same with other forms of regulations we have. Take the example of internet banking that is happening right now. Govt sets the minimum requirements and the private sector competes with each other for the license and figures it out for themselves how to get it done. We dont have to go into detail to tell them how to do it. You want government to provide them with programmers and coders and customer support staff? No. You set the floor, and let the companies do the work. That's the point of capitalism.

And if it ends up making things harder for the FW, then we adjust and try again. Policy is always open-ended in that sense.

Edit: Speaking of economics, the pertinent problem here is that  these companies are causing a negative externality in the form of higher spread of disease.

Your entire argument boils down to this: prodding the market will fix it.

You are underestimating the shithole the market is.

You just tell them to have the market find alternative for you. Meanwhile the market is doing everything in their power to fund the notion that coal is a necessary evil through fudged bias studies, and that coal isn't that bad.

"Singaporean here. This incident is definitely mismanaged but somewhat inevitable (depending on your view of issue) by the government. During the latest parliament when they are asked about TraceTogether (TT), the contact tracing database this article is talking about, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, the team leader behind the tech behind TT admitted to it. Further discuss also brought suspicion that he and Minister of Home Affairs, K Shanmugam had some miscommunication behind the scenes for TT and was made somewhat a half scapegoat for it. 

That incident also sparked some debate among people. One side said that hiding it can help accelerate collection of TT tokens and app installations for contact tracing in order for quicker transition to phase 3 and a further partial lift of lockdown, and health comes above all else. Another thou believe that this incident further eroded the trust we had in government transparency and policies which is already shaky beforehand even before the pandemic and it should have been clarified beforehand before collection of TT token exercise started.

> One person who went to Canberra CC in the morning shot a video showing at least one hundred people in queue to collect the token.

> Token collection at the community club is from 10am to 6pm.

> Most of those seen in queue were senior citizens.

> Progressively increase number of collection centres

> Currently, TraceTogether token collection is restricted to residents' constituency community centres.

> Residents are no longer able to collect their tokens at community centres outside their own constituencies as demand has outstripped supply.

> The TraceTogether programme, which comprises both the app and the token, is aimed at improving Singapore's contract tracing efforts.

> TraceTogether tokens have been made available for collection in Singapore since Sep. 14, 2020, free of charge.

> Background

> It is not mandatory to collect the TraceTogether token, but it will be issued to anyone who wants one.

> However, in days to come, the TraceTogether token and app to do SafeEntry check-in at certain venues with large groups of people in Singapore will soon be compulsory.

> It was previously reported that each TraceTogether token costs S$20 to make.

I was manning one of eight counters in my CC, and even then the wait for each claim (some collect on behalf of household) was over an hour. Rather than just scan NRIC during the first few mask distributions, token redemption has more steps to connect NRIC to token and some additional time to ""brief"" the claimant and answer their queries.

For majority of the elderly who lined up during my shift, many (1) don't have access to a smartphone that can install the TraceTogether app and (2) still have to line up for over an hour despite leg pains and elderly fatigue.

It's not about showing unconditional respect for the elderly; it is about being a decent human being and letting people who need it more go first.

If kiasu people like you can put aside your self-importance for a week, more people can collect without unnecessary pain and wasted time.

"**Data Transfer out of TT Tokens**

I think it's definitely possible with the current architecture that base stations can be set up at choke points to sniff all the traffic from TraceTogether tokens. The base stations can broadcast a special message that triggers TraceTogether tokens to dump a list of its handshakes. The base stations will then be linked up to a central server to collate the wealth of data for data analysis. This possible ""leakage"" of data via bluetooth data exchange is never talked about in the media - they've always focused on the lack of any traditional forms of data transfer such as 3G/4G etc.

**Tuning of models from data aggregated from TT Tokens**

Data from TT Tokens can then be used to link up with other forms of data points that have lower confidence levels, such as EZ-Link cards, bank cards, CCTV footage to build up and calibrate models that will allow a central authority to predict people's movements with higher confidence levels even after TT has been removed. 

**Geo-location Data without GNSS (GPS/GLONASS/Beidou/Galileo/QZSS)**

Given that TT Tokens do handshakes with other tokens that are sending out messages, how can people be sure that there aren't also other base stations that have known locations actively beaming out handshakes? This will allow the central authority to be able to say: ""Ok so this guy got this specific token ID which we know to be at XXX location. This means that this guy went to XXX location at XXX time.""",2020-11-28 15:12:02

"Without going into details, I work for ICT myself and can confirm what u are saying is correct but there is a difference. In case of private/public companies they have strict rules to follow and the government doesn‚Äôt own the data. Instead they have to formally request for it. The granularity of location data (for example) is not very high. mobile devices are able to detect and send location from tower data alone but it again is not extremely accurate if you want to create a view of who is in contact with whom. That process is also very data compute intensive and can only be done in retrospective on offline infra, not the online infra (except law enforcement requests).
Today all data is getting captured in isolation in different buckets and it only gets stitched together into a view based on need. However what TraceTogether presents is an opportunity to create an online way of running an efficient query on this data which is being aggregated online.

In my view if the aim was to only capture and Ensure that everyone was compliant then it would have been enough to run the TT app on a device and have a led indicating it was online. There was no need to scan the trace together tokens at entrances. Similarly for mobiles, the app could show on screen that it‚Äôs compliant and let them enter. Why scan the QR code.

With TraceTogether the data is extremely granular and identifiable. If for example the government wanted to do target advertising, they would know your device id (from TraceTogether), your identity, preferences etc and then they would create campaigns with specific curated audiences and instead of casting a large net, you could be targeted directly including through SMS etc. You may not realise it‚Äôs a custom curated message.

That thought experiment is so far out. Do you think if Singapore faces an unemployment rate of 40%, it will be an overnight phenomenon instead of a gradual decline, and Singaporeans will mostly stay in Singapore to inevitably face the decline? Please name at least one developed nation which has faced 40% unemployment rate. Even the US in the great depression only faced 25% unemployment rate.

Say I entertain your thoughts. The unemployment rate has reached 40%, isn't it also possible that the Government uses a tracing system to make sure families get their fair ration at the food shelter and ensure no one abuses whatever welfare in place for this economical dystopian future?

Additionally, you must not be paying attention when you didn't think our Government isn't big. Singapore only arrived at where we are because our Government is big while being wildly pragmatic for a long period of time, lending to the credibility that we are the most geopolitical stable nation among our Asian brethren.  People are in fact screaming for our Government to be bigger, look at how left-leaning this sub has become. UBI has been picking up steam here. Yet people chose not to see that having UBI means surrendering individual economical power to government control, making the scenario you paint more likely than the current system.

Here's another thought experiment. Imagine that Indonesia is facing underemployment and a high unemployment rate. In order to find a scapegoat, they chose Singapore. Meanwhile, Singaporeans are divided from within due to people screaming how we are screwed and shaking the faith in the system while Indonesia capitalizes on that to run disinformation campaigns further putting seeds into the populace, somewhat like what is happening in the US. Indonesia successfully undermined our Government, ushering in a weak and incompetent populist Government, MNCs feel that the once corporate-friendly and stable geopolitical landscape in Singapore are no longer a certainty, and choose to instead to go to another cheaper neighbouring country since it's the same anyway. Then, would this be a scenario to lead to your scenario?

Whenever there is an economical calamity, what we see first is an exodus of the populace when it's possible. And armed uprising from civilians will first happen, leading to the government taking the chance to use martial law to suppress the populace.

To feed a military in a 40% unemployment rate scenario, what natural resources or illegal trade do you think Singapore can tap into to fund something like this? It's unreasonable to think that we have not exhausted all means in our financial resources to stop-gap an inevitable 40% unemployment rate scenario in Singapore. Or people are too stupid to see this is not viable and choose to stay in Singapore even as they already lost all reasons to stay here.

Quote: SINGAPORE - Close to nine in 10 eligible residents here have joined the Government's digital contact tracing programme, despite a recent public backlash over privacy and trust issues. About 4.7 million residents have the TraceTogether app or have collected the TraceTogether tokens, and this has allowed the authorities to shave days off the contact tracing process, said Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative Vivian Balakrishnan in Parliament on Friday (Feb 26). With both the TraceTogether and SafeEntry programmes, the authorities now take 1\xbd days or less to identify and quarantine close contacts of Covid-19 patients, down from the previous average of four days, said Dr Balakrishnan. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ther-programme",2021-02-27 22:20:00

"How is my data protected? 1 month ago Updated First, geolocation data is not collected, i.e. the information retrieved will not be able to identify where the user had been e.g. Sengkang or Sentosa. Second, the Bluetooth data collected is stored locally in the user\x92s App/Token in an encrypted form. The data is not accessible unless uploaded. Any data shared with the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be used for contact tracing persons possibly exposed to COVID-19. Only authorised public officers will be able to use the data. Third, user personal information, including their unique identification number and mobile number, is not revealed to other TraceTogether users. They are substituted by a random permanent ID. This information is stored in a secured server. As an added layer of protection, TraceTogether also creates temporary IDs that change regularly. Only these temporary IDs are exchanged between phones. These measures protect users from malicious actors who may seek to eavesdrop and track interactions over time. Lastly, once contact tracing ceases, we will prompt users to disable TraceTogether's functionality. Your privacy is important to us.

The QR scanner on the TT app is *very* quick and accurate. Don't have to place your phone right in front of the QR code to scan, like what I see many do. You can scan from behind and at angle and there is a good chance that it will also register. And if I have added the venue to my 'favourites' on the TT app, even better. I will check-in even before reaching the entrance to the shopping centre/restaurant /cinema/supermarket.

Carparks with security cameras can be cross referenced with all the street cameras.

Quote: The TraceTogether App does not collect or use physical location data (e.g. GPS, WiFi fingerprinting, cell ID). It only records proximity via Bluetooth. So if they have a bluetooth device installed at entrances recording the same way we collect data on the TT token and TT app, wont it be proximity data too via Bluetooth? Proximity to entrance so they can track your location. To pinpoint a person's location you just need 3 fixed bluetooth transponders to triangulate your exact location. Then you have it, how to get a person's location based on proximity data. Can be done anot?

They will tell whatever good stories about their proposal and ignore/skim over the cons. Or in any debate anyway. This is why we need a healthy balance in the government.

Some experts say it won't be over until 2024, some say it may never be over because the virus keeps mutating that is no vaccine that will work forever and people who recovered can get it again too. So how then? If the pandemic can never really end, will the government insist that TTT become part and parcel of our daily life? Then how will TTT evolved? That is what I'm more concerned about. Quote: So whatever activities you are afraid of beings tracked, lay low. Any its not like the police dun know it. They just dun think you are the big fish. I know they can track individuals already. The problem is how much work is involved. The TTT represent a potential to make it much easier if they feature creep on TTT and eventually equip it with sufficient functionality as I mentioned before, in the name of convenience such as combining EZlink, digital payment etc. How ""big"" a fish is, is often related to the cost/benefits of tracking him/her. Say if the government needs 10 man days to track/trace one person. They may only have resources to target 10 individuals at a time. However, if they are able to cut the cost down to 1 man hour. They can target more than 2000 individuals at a time.

So all the officer has to do is get near to you, press a button on a TT reader device to send a special BLE packet to the token to get a data dump whether we agree or not. This is a common and lame excuse. If there are vulnerabilities, friendlies can't help spot and suggest fixes. Hostile hackers who discover the vulnerabilities will be able to exploit it way before the government figure out it was compromised. No matter which country, the people should never trust the government fully. A healthy skepticism is what helps keep the government honest. A government who believes its citizenry will blindly trust and accept whatever decisions, will go astray to the detriment of its citizen and to the benefits of the politicians in control. Absolute power corrupts. I applaud your imagination. You work as a script writer? Much like election transparency, I really do not think the government will go that far. What kind of benefits? do they really think such an educated and open society like Singapore they can get away scott free for long? I am not saying I trust the governement 100% but we must think what are the benefits of doing so? does it out weigh the repercussions? We know what the repercussions are. Singaporeans are demanding and unforgiving. The data is still in the hands of the owner. You can dun surrender it. Yu can dun even carry it. But you cannot go around unchecked in the name of public health. the next best thing to this is a lockdown. The enemy here is the virus. not the government or the token. Nobody is currently talking about prevention. Its still mitigation. So if ppl here dun think their privacy is worth mitigating, then stay at home. Because many more others wants to carry on their activities safely. By the way ppl surrender their information to online  mobile games. Dun hear anyone complaining about it when you get that unsolicited call or sms.",2021-07-02 12:54:00
"Mystyque wrote: While I'm not really for the minimum wage policy, I wouldn't go so far as to call somebody a shithead for not telling the trade offs. In general, that is expected of politicians. They will tell whatever good stories about their proposal and ignore/skim over the cons. Or in any debate anyway. This is why we need a healthy balance in the government. PAP suggest something, Oppo try to shoot it down. Oppo suggests something, PAP try to shoot it down. Hopefully, the end result is an overall better plan and not a stalemate with nothing done. The problem is when will the pandemic be over? Some experts say it won't be over until 2024, some say it may never be over because the virus keeps mutating that is no vaccine that will work forever and people who recovered can get it again too. So how then? If the pandemic can never really end, will the government insist that TTT become part and parcel of our daily life? Then how will TTT evolved? That is what I'm more concerned about. I know they can track individuals already. The problem is how much work is involved. The TTT represent a potential to make it much easier if they feature creep on TTT and eventually equip it with sufficient functionality as I mentioned before, in the name of convenience such as combining EZlink, digital payment etc. How ""big"" a fish is, is often related to the cost/benefits of tracking him/her. Say if the government needs 10 man days to track/trace one person. They may only have resources to target 10 individuals at a time. However, if they are able to cut the cost down to 1 man hour. They can target more than 2000 individuals at a time. With excess capacity, it becomes easier to include smaller fishes that previously would had been too much effort to gun down. Perhaps my expectations of a politician is that if they are not saying the tradeoffs, thats lying. and thats not what I will vote for. I am not saying I need you to tell me what the tradeoffs are. We are educated and information is free. But you treat me like a fool. Thats where I draw the line. I am skeptical of what constitutes a healthy balance. At the end of the day its still a numbers game and a stalemate or a coalition government will be formed. When that happens can we say its best for the people? There will be populism and we all know what that leads too. Much like minimum wage, the vote goes to the highest bidder. How can the electorate ensure that it does not happen? the answer is we cant. We want the cake and eat it. But in reality there is no such thing. You rightly pointed out, tracking is already a possibility. the key is the intent. Why are ppl doubtful of the intent? I think the answer is fairly obvious. But judging by the performance of the ruling party, I will say the minority who reject that do it out of their own malicious intent.",2021-07-02 12:54:00

Very simple, the TT scheme and now with this TT token is to streamline the contact tracing process to make it more efficient.

I must admit that I'm not an expert on this particular chipset and I've not scrutinized the entire datahsheet yet. I'm also by no means an electrical engineer, but I can guarantee that the jammer mentioned in the medium article works especially since not every TT device has an output power of 20dBm. I doubt that TX power of these tokens go anywhere near 8dBm since all they need is a proximity of 10m. They're more likely to have a transmit power of 0dBm or less.

But as the old saying goes, it's better then nothing. For the token, the flaws are pretty layman knowledge and comes as no surprise. But the idea that Government can use it to track people's movement for no reason whatsoever is all conspiracy theories that have no credibility whatsoever. The idea of privacy is moot too. If government really want to track your movements for whatever reason they don't need this TT to do it. Nowadays cameras are everywhere, from HDB lift landings to MRT stations and lamp posts etc. If they want they can start tracking you the moment you step out of your house. The main point is that this TT token requires the public to corporate with goodwill. Anyone that seeks to undermine the functionality of the TT token could be deemed malicious and should be prosecuted. Anyway once it's made mandatory to be used in public spaces let's see how many people will really put the tokens in faraday pouches or whatever mods ""discussed"" here. Don't be surprised if the authorities have a way to check if your token is active or not. And lastly don't have to argue with the other fella lah.

A simple google search of the data sheet would bring it up lol.. Again I'm still waiting for someone to disprove me that the jammer doesn't work. I got this http://www.green-antenna.com/web/sit...3416BL02_S.pdf by looking at the label on the TT token as well. It's in the breakdown. As for the transmitter I've already stated my case earlier on Quote: Welp if you insist, I manage to dig up this datasheet by looking at a teardown and the chip label https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/bluenrg-2.pdf it has a max transmit power of 8dBm. I must admit that I'm not an expert on this particular chipset and I've not scrutinized the entire datahsheet yet. I'm also by no means an electrical engineer, but I can guarantee that the jammer mentioned in the medium article works especially since not every TT device has an output power of 20dBm. I doubt that TX power of these tokens go anywhere near 8dBm since all they need is a proximity of 10m. They're more likely to have a transmit power of 0dBm or less. I'm just here to discuss and provide the tools for people to protect their own privacy. I've not heard of anyone offering a good solution for mitigation against BLE replay attacks or BLE jamming yet.

Exactly, as I pointed out and rightly so. the current tracking system has it's limitations. That's where TT comes in. Just because police able to track 1-2 person or 100 person a day. Doesnt mean they have the capabilities to track 1 million at a go. So that's why I dont get the oh SPF can track us anyway ior our smartphone/laptop is already being tracked so we should let the government use TT to track us instead argument. I use those same arguments they offer back at them, since they claim government/companies already can track us, then use current solutions, no need TT then. Oh suddenly, the current solutions got limitations. Exactly lo, now you know why they need a more invasive programme to track us. And when I mean track us is not tha I'm claiming they track us for some dubious reason right off the bat. But let's be very honest here, nobody can promise we wont get there eventually. We have to look at the entire situation from a holistic point of view, it is not 1 person or 10 person's privacy being trodden. But an entire nation of 3 million+++ people.

"There is a line to be drawn on how far we go in doing anything, including stopping covid. I believe it is better to define that line now instead of giving in and letting them know that they can implement all sorts of draconian measures. Although you argue that SPF can already scrutinise CCTV footage and telephone lines, these are things which have a proper system in place to deter misuse. In fact, the SPF has to issue a warrant to obtain CCTV data on private premises. The resolution provided by cell phone towers isn't high either as cell phone towers need not be too close to a mobile phone user and a mobile phone is only connected to one cell tower at any point in time. That makes triangulation of the phone's exact location much harder through dead reckoning. There's still some degree of obfuscation here. TT provides a much greater resolution in pinpointing who you've interacted with and where you've been as gathers multiple data points among multiple users in the vicinity.",2021-07-02 12:54:00

You dunwan the token? You want to trace by word of mouth? Would you want your internet? Maybe not? Credit cards? Maybe no too? When we are improving to do things faster, you are not happy.

CCTV will be extremely painful to piece together as you'll have to obtain footage from different vendors (e.g. transitioning from condos to malls to public transport), contrary to many speculations, they're not actually connected. Safe entry and ezlink only provide temporary tracking as it leaves a timestamp on where you last tapped in, there is no periodic/ constant tracking here. Credit card and data at bank is an entirely different thing, they do not track location or are not supposed to, unless you're talking about ATMs in which case it is about as good as ezlink cards/ safeentry in offering location tracking. Another myth-busting fact is that cell towers can't track you with that degree of accuracy as well, especially since you do not have to be that close to a cell tower and any form of interference (from buildings or people walking) would cause significant changes to the signal strength. You also won't be connected to 2 let alone 3 cell towers concurrently or switch between them rapidly. Triangulation would be extremely painful. There's a reason why BLE was picked instead of using cell towers or CCTVs to track, BLE does have a higher degree of accuracy in location tracking. BLE can connect and disconnect with nearby devices in a matter of milliseconds while cell towers or WiFi are still negotiating handshakes. The lifetime of a BLE device is very very short, it does not remain connected to another device for long as all it needs is to send a ~30 bytes packet. Combine this with existing tech like CCTVs/ safe entry/ EZlink taps and many more, we get sensor fusion. They can technically narrow down the probability of your exact location and time. FYI: BLE is the primary protocol used for both the TT app and token. This is not a matter of arguing that TT was preferred instead of using cell tower tracking because not many people have phones.

Without the token, you cant even trace the 500 whats more the 5 infected and for not just weeks, they can roam about freely spreading the virus for months.

Mate, if you just glance through the website, what is the takeaway from it? Basically the TTs ability to protect us is streneous at best. But that is what the government is posting big big on the website. the protect they use is the very same protect that are using. it is clear as day, so stop claiming otherwise. so first the argument is that im claiming that TT protect us and nobody else is saying so, and when i post ss from TT website, suddenly its different kind of protect. knn so am i the only one claiming Tt is supposed to protect us anot. dun come bs here lei. even your argument is that tt protects us a lil as it contains the spread. Faster and efficient tracing only translate to minimal improvement in containment. based on moh track record, they are only able to track cases on avg weeks after onset of symptoms. there is no protection for anyone between getting the virus and before moh tracks them with tt, neither does it stop the infected from spreading during this duration. so lemme ask u what protection they talking about. and never mind hor, still say we should allow gov to intrude into everyones privacy for this sort of minimal protection. unbelievable.",2021-07-02 12:54:00

I believe if such measures were used on a day to day basis, their citizens would be against it too. Tracking IMEI is pretty pointless IMO, but I guess it's good deterrent against the general users. https://www.gadgetcouncil.com/free-a...umber-changer/ I would have no issues if they were tracking you while you have to stay home for SHN cause you'll know it'll just be for 14 days.",2021-07-02 12:54:00

Isn't that better than TT data that supposedly expires after a few weeks. A lot of people, if not all adults, are already aware that phones can be tracked. If even movie criminals know they need to turn off phone, remove battery or don't carry phone, obviously real criminals would know as much if not better. With TT, since they need to have it to enter buildings and other places, it offers another possible channel of tracking. So the persons would either need to have a shielded box to keep their TT when needed, or conduct their activity in isolated location. In which case other methods of tracking becomes more effective. Also of importance is the proximity information, reasonable case can be established that two persons were in close contact, i.e. X cannot say he was simply passing by Y if TT information showed they were within 1m proximity for more than a minute. Lastly, TT is likely more useful for unplanned crimes like a spur of the moment robbery or rape than pre-mediated crimes like drug trafficking.",2021-07-02 12:54:00

Already pointed out the potential for misuse from day 1 and till today you still cant concile with this fact even when government admitted they are doing so? And the underlying concern that has still not been addressed by you or anyone here is how effective is the TT programme, taking into consideration that an infected person is usually only detected 7-14 days after infection, by then, it would have spread, so how effective is contact tracing actually in curbing the spread? Nobody has come out with any figures showing it's effectiveness, community cases still continue to appear even with 78% of Singaporeans onboard. Really brings the purpose of TT into question doesnt it? Especially in light of how the government mismanages the data, quietly providing it to SPF for investigations(contrary to what they promised) and which was only informed to Singaporeans only when someone asked in parliament. And your dont use smart phone argument is moot. The smartphone and appmakers have access to the data, but the government cant access it one. They have to request for access and the companies can choose not to give to protect your data. Did MOH even make a sound when they hand your data to SPF? Why dont you try to think further for once. If government had access to all that data, why would they even need to bother with getting your TT data?",2021-07-02 12:54:00

"My concern - While TT does not collect location info, it basically works by registering when 2 users are in close proximity to each other at a given time (correct me if I am wrong). My worry is mainly to do with ""in the wrong place, at the wrong time"", especially considering that TT does not provide tangible/visible information that gives more straightforward evidence like CCTV or dashcam footage. It simply shows that you were near someone at a certain time. Using the Punggol murder as example, if I were waiting for a bus or walking past the bus stop at the time that the murder took place: 1. Wouldn't I then become one of the suspects because I was in the immediate vicinity of the victim at the time of the murder? 2. Besides the above point, might I not be forced by the law to give my statement as a witness, even if I want nothing to do with the matter as an unrelated passer-by? Considering that miscarriages of justice are not unheard of and a very real possibility, and serious crimes may be associated with violent criminals, gangs, or criminal syndicates, am I not being unfairly put at risk of a destroyed future or even loss of life and limb from possible retaliation since the criminals already expect I can be summoned up as a witness because of TT?

If I were to give any statement as a witness, it should be out of my own choice and goodwill, and not because I am forced to be involved in somebody else's problem. I do not have a duty of protection to that person at my own risk unless the person is related to me (friend, family, etc). That would be an outright intrusion of my right to reasonable self-preservation. By your reasoning I can also say I am ""sabo'ed"" by whoever is the culprit, or whoever may be ""wrongfully accused"", by their performing the crime or for being embroiled in the investigation while I was in the vicinity, because I am then put at risk or inconvenience for their benefit. Not forgetting that I can also become ""wrongfully accused"" in the process. ""For the greater good"" is irrelevant to one when one happens to be in the side that does not benefit from that ""good"" and even has something to lose. It is only relevant to those who stand to benefit from it.

"bright_84 wrote: Unless cctc catches you in the act, its use as evidence at best compelling. Like you said, ""CCTV catches you in the act"". TT doesn't. It merely shows you were near the victim/suspect. This then opens up plenty of speculative scenarios for the investigators, 99.9% of which are wrong (there can only be one factual truth). What if they follow a wrong one? Like someone above said earlier, you might walk past a hidden corpse and pick up some of the blood, etc from the nearby foliage on your shoes, clothes, etc. Not barring the absence of any other evidence to your innocence, say, if the culprit conceals his trail extremely well or was just lucky - boom, you're convicted based on circumstantial evidence. The Singapore law does not require direct or physical evidence to convict as far as I remember, i.e. convicting can be based on pure inference as long as the judge(s) feels it is reasonable. And obviously there is yet to be any precedent on whether the courts regard TT data to be valid to support circumstantial evidence beyond reasonable doubt, so it could end both ways.",2021-07-02 12:54:00
