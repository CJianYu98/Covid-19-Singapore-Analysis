"> # Coronavirus: Many of the current restrictions to continue even after circuit breaker ends, says Lawrence Wong

> SINGAPORE - Singapore should be fully prepared that many of the current restrictions and circuit breaker measures in place will continue for some time even after June 1, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.

> This is to keep people and their loved ones safe after the circuit breaker ends, he said in a Facebook post on Sunday (May 17).

> ""It won't simply be a return to life before the circuit breaker,"" he said, noting the Government will adopt a careful and calibrated approach as the country resumes normal activities at work, schools, and in social settings.

> The Government is preparing for the next phase and considering what activities can resume in a safe manner, said the minister, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the Covid-19 outbreak.

> ""A controlled and phased exit from the circuit breaker will require patience and discipline from all of us,"" he said.

> ""We must all do our part to control the spread of the virus and ensure that it does not flare up again. Otherwise all our efforts and sacrifices during this circuit breaker period would have been made in vain.""

> He cited the approach taken for the construction sector, which will restart on a few critical projects where very tight safeguards are required from June 2.

> The safeguards include requiring workers involved in a project to be housed together, instead of lodging at multiple dormitories, as well as periodic testing of workers at two-week intervals.

> The number of construction workers involved in projects will scale up over time as the industry gains confidence and experience with the measures, Mr Wong said.

> Related Story 682 new coronavirus cases, including 4 Singaporeans and PRs

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> Construction work has largely been suspended since Covid-19 circuit breaker measures kicked in on April 7, with only 5 per cent of the sector's workforce - about 20,000 workers - continuing to work on a small number of critical projects, and those that have had to continue for safety reasons.

> The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) expects another 5 per cent of the workforce to resume work gradually, meaning about one-tenth of the usual workforce will be active in June.

> During a press conference on Friday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong also called on Singapore residents to remain vigilant even after circuit breaker measures officially end on June 1.

> He highlighted the need for restrictive measures to continue to ensure that the number of coronavirus cases does not spike, and urged Singaporeans to continue to cooperate with the authorities and support safe distancing measures so the country can progressively open up with time.

But because now the crowd has formed due to people panicking and not listening. Eventually a cluster will form out of these hypermarts like Mustafa Centre, which then will force the Government to go even a step further and have to close or restrict these places too.

Now, here comes the funny problem.. when these full scale lockdowns finally happen, those people who went to panic buy or form the queues at these hypermarts will then tell you "" I TOLD U SO TO PANIC BUY AND STOCK UP MONTHS WORTH OF SUPPLIES..

"In defense of the covidiot Singaporeans: 

Most Singaporeans are not stupid. 

For the past 2-3 months, they made a personal assessment, looking at the headline local and global news, the low number of local cases, and the behaviour of their friends and family, and they decided that the risk of continuing their social activities is low. 

They could not see (even experts did not know) that they can spread the virus even if they are asymptomatic, or that they can indirectly affect the elderly/ immunocompromised even if they themselves may not suffer severely. 

As they visit the malls, or go to the hawker centres, they see everyone behaving normally, and this further enhances the fact that they can continue normally. 

As a comparison, if the SARS-COV2 was similar to SARS-COV1 in mortality (30%), and they read the news of lots of Singaporeans dying, every Singaporean will guai guai stay at home at all times (without the constant nagging). 

This is the crux of the problem: the fact that SARS-COV2 does not have the killing power of more severe diseases like SARS-COV1 or Ebola, for example. So in terms of messaging of health policy, it is extremely difficult to get people to understand and follow.

Not to nitpick here, but you are comparing the numbers of New York City five days ago vs. New York *State* now.

I am going to go out and say it; I think some of this is a bit alarmist. While, obviously, people interacting with other people raises the likelihood of cases vs. not interacting at all, comparing a couple dozen people standing in queues at supermarkets to thousands of people in a very close proximity at football matches and festivals is a bit absurd.

I guess it's great if people are scared off going outside by seeing 120 new cases, but it seemed to have been made very clear that many of those cases are tied to those in worker dormitories who live in close proximity.

we’ve yet to see a multiple clusters from students in schools, probably that these students have a fixed social circle. the phrase “schs are safer” has much truth in it. many working people have fixed social circles as well. the HBL and WFH initiatives will help this.

Locals take a look at other countries and see the streets literally devoid of people or traffic, then look at our own and see business as usual, and conclude that things are still going okay here.

This whole ""circuit breaker"" shit is a great representation of that. Even when it's lockdown, it's not really.

"I knew about all 3 of those when I watched Chris from Peak Prosperity talked about the virus back in late January.

- What R0 is and what is the estimate R0 of the virus and what does that look like. Even a conservative estimate R0 of 2.5 means it will ravage the whole world in 2 months time.

- The possibility of asymptomatic transmission. Chris said that makes it a lot worse than SARS because with SARS, you knew who had the virus and you can isolate them very easily. This factor alone makes it a lot more invisible than SARS and you cannot fight effectively against something you cannot see/perceive. This is why you will need to consider the possibility of a lockdown when reports of asymptomatic transmission are coming out.

- Chris also mentioned a lot that tackling this Pandemic is a juggling act. You want to limit the spread but measures to do that will hurt the economy. Keeping your economy afloat will let the virus spread and overwhelm/cripple your healthcare. But if you let your economy crash, you will get shortages of supplies everywhere, making your war against the virus a lot harder. So far I think many countries have leaned too heavily on the economy part at the expense of limiting the virus spread and overwhelming their Healthcare.

The only country that did well in this is Taiwan and China is gonna be pissed off with this statement. South Korea did pretty well through tremendous effort. I believe Taiwan is at where we are 1 month ago right now and may reach 1000 cases in the coming few months. They will be able get away with minimal damage and will be back to normalcy relatively quickly. That was my hope that that will be outcome with Singapore's management on the disease.

Anyway, 76 being long term pass holders is a direct quote from Straits Times.

> The local cases include 39 Singapore citizens or permanent residents and 76 long-term work pass holders.

"How will essential business run without supplies?

It depends on how you define the supplies. If marketing is required then yes. But gov may not approve because they agree with your logic. I agree as well.

But you also agree fabric to mask maker as a supply chain is essential.

OP didn't share what business it is.

Supply chains are indeed treated as essential.

Your initial reply is that all support companies have to close which isn't true.

To break down your reply clearly.

>Supply chain to essential business

>you supply fabric to mask maker u are essential

This 2 lines are the same except that 2nd line defines clearly what it is doing.

So line 1 is still valid.

You could also suggest that only essential supply chains to essential business can be exempted. 

So fabric is ok. Marketing isn't. 

But that's not how the policy is written. Which is why you have to apply for it.

Who knows, maybe certain business's supply chain which is marketing could be approved due to certain reasons.

So maybe marketing by itself may not be entirely non essential.

Only essential business / clients and their support chains have even a slim chance of staying open.

Some people use levain/sourdough to refer to the same thing but in the US the sourdough is really sour while the typical  French boules made with levain are only a little bit. Also IIRC regular baguettes are specifically not made with levain to have that neutral/sweetish flavor, unless it's specifically a sourdough baguette. 

Sorry to be pedantic but I'm a bit of a bread geek but I don't bake, just eat. I did think of making my own boules though at one point. I'm puzzled at why people are making levain/sourdough starter though because it seems like the market for such breads in sg doesn't even exist commercially so why would they make it at home?! 

Tbh the quality of French/European bread here is not great IMO. I lived in the US and the local European/French bakeries produced better boules/baguettes than anything I have had in sg. Maybe I just havent found the right places.

The risk increases the more people gather. It can be a queue, it can be a music concert, it can be school, or just about anything else. That is simple math. The queues we saw last weekend was packed with people, so I don't know if you are even in the same context as this thread. 


This context is important.


We are talking specifically about last few weeks where people senselessly went out before the lockdowns happened. The most recent examples being toys, IKEA and so on.

This whole thread is to call that behavior out. It is probably the OP's holier-then-thou approach that got people all defensive and bothered.

What I understood from this is, your business has to be essential. Doesn't matter who your clients are.

Derived from the words ""even if their clients are essential"".

>Eh I just realized, using your own arguments.

>What I wrote isn't fake news because it's implied that non essential companies are those left after they tried to appplied to stay open and failed. So it's true that those companies who failed to get permission to stay open must close :)

This explanation is very different from your first reply.

Now you trying to say if they apply and fail.

This is fairly backtracking and trying to change your words. Bad try though as it's fairly different the 2 statements.

But it is correct that if cannot get permission means must close.

>Also supply or support chains are a small part of what I wrote as non essential, supply chains are almost always considered essential. 🧸

Again not true.

If you are supply chain but not supplying to essential, you are not essential. 

Supply chain could be delivering things like pen and paper to popular.

However, you could be delivering paper to a hospital. Then the same supplier of paper becomes essential.

*  Social responsibility is critical in slowing the spread of COVID-19. We need all Singaporeans to do the right thing, if we are to beat the virus.

I put my daughter in infant care while both of us work. This circuit breaker was a little sudden to us but I had plans to buy those things anyway. I'm just bringing it forward because I have to spend this month with my daughter at home. And since at the infant care, they read books, do crafts and play with toys, I'm trying to replicate that same environment at home. For toddlers you have to establish a routine otherwise it's mayham.

"A few thoughts on this. That said, while I would be the first to agree that our dear GLC/Gahmen scholars are usually idiots, I want to step away from the scholar management bad circle jerk because this is a systemic problem that has sucked in not just SIA

I am not going to go in depth into SIA's accounting, so this is what thing look like very roughly. This estimate is may be off, but it wont' be off by enough that the arguments change. Fuel is typically 30% of an airlines' operating costs. SIA I would estimate SIA's operating costs in this 13  year period is roughly 14 or so billion so a year, or which about very roughly 4 billion a year is fuel. SIA hedging operation runs about 3-500 million dollars a year in average losses over the last 13 years.[https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/2020/09/17/shareholder-raises-concerns-about-sias-15-years-of-fuel-hedging-losses-to-prime-minister-lee-as-no-one-takes-accountability/](https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/2020/09/17/shareholder-raises-concerns-about-sias-15-years-of-fuel-hedging-losses-to-prime-minister-lee-as-no-one-takes-accountability/)

This suggests to me that SIA's hedging operation is large and has a long history of incurring costs/ losses that are pretty high in relation to the underlying costs whose fluctuations they are trying to smooth out. This is in itself, not a good place to be.

The purpose behind hedging is to ensure a predictable P/L ratio. But we must think critically about why we are doing this and what it means. We seek out a predictable P/L ratio in order to allow for easy/cheap borrowing and to ensure that black swan events in a major operating expense don't wipe the business out out.

Yet to achieve this, the problem with fuel hedging is that a hedging operation this large may often create its own type of existential risk for the company.--Like it is doing right now, where SIA is simultaneously facing both huge losses from Covid and huge losses from a hedging.  An airline is not well equipped to stress test their trading positions in accordance with their own unique risk profile where jet fuel and passenger revenues may be inter-related ( and worse still co-related) in all sorts of weird and difficult to forsee ways.

The thing with hedging is that Airlines are not trading houses. Even trading houses very rarely beat the market. More than a few major hedge funds and investment banks have been buried by bad trades. And even as we understand that, it is very likely that the level of accountability and corporate governance in airlines is far worse than in the banks.

Outside of Singapore, AA , United and Delta have opted to stop hedging their fuel costs concluding that in the long run, it does not work. Southwest, famous for saving billions of dollars in the post 9/11 era by hedging their fuel costs later cumulatively lost billions of dollars in the mid 00s doing the same. Cathay Pacific has been suffering catastrophic losses from Fuel hedges gone bad and SIA is now in the same boat.

I think that if we are going to accept that SIA is 'too big to fail' and are going to have to be bailed out using our reserves, they should stay away from fuel hedging. Trading commodities is not a core airline competency and creates a corporate governance problem. Trading commodities creates a vector for risks that are not likely to be well understood and well characterized by management. Trading commodities in a firm that has the implicit backing of our government, creates a conflict of interest where profits get privatised and catastrophic losses get socialised.",2020-09-28 16:34:52,reddit

>Even accounting smaller planes that can travel far, is it profitable with the amount of passengers?

If a route is able to fill a plane while operating flights to a specific location at the frequency the flight is operated at, then it's profitable. Granted, there's a point at which decreasing frequency stops making it easier to fill a plane, as passengers have a time frame in which they need to get their flight.

1. From my POV, SQ seem to be trying to play the long waiting game of cashing out during the good time. At least that explains the long 5 year hedging. However, it seem very unprofessional as SQ can accumulate large losses over the 5 years if the market does not go according to SQ's forecast.
2. Airlines hedge on brent crude because it the most liquid commodities as compared to jet fuel. Trading on jet fuel is very difficult.
3. It hard to say. Even seasoned oil trader themselves forecast are just guesses. The events in the market is just too unpredictable especially when covid 19 came in.

"That's not what hedging inherently is. It's a risk mitigation tool and the goal is not to make profit or losses. SIA was willing to lock in a fixed price for oil and that was the price of risk that they were willing to pay. Sure, you can argue that their VaR or Delta calculations were off, or that they shouldn't have made plays in the 5 year range, but SIA didn't inherently lose anything. 

Locking in a fixed price of oil to avoid price volatility that could impact their core business is very different from a rouge trader betting on Yen fluctuations.

When you hedge, you accept that you might lose some amount of money if price signals don't go your way, but that's not the point. The point of hedging is paying to avoid risk and price fluctuations, even if it may mean paying more than market prices.

If the price of oil skyrocketed, they wouldn't be impacted. There's a risk Vs reward analysis here. Would you say the same thing if Brent skyrocketed and SIA would be paying half the market price, and thus profiting?",2020-09-28 15:14:41,reddit

And you have not even understood the fundamental nature of hedging.

Do you even know how hedging works? A futures contract is in no way a commitment to actually deliver the good. You can box it out by buying an opposing contract. That is a very common practice. The fact that you don't know that speaks to your knowledge of the subject.

> Still have an expiry date. So all the the disadvantges with milk still applies

The expiry date of milk is measured in weeks. The expiry date of fuel is about a year. Clearly there is no difference between a week and a year.

> Except in this case you are clearly wrong as proven by COVID. 

What sort of stupid argument is that? Are you seriously saying that different risk events cannot have different impacts. The impact of swine flu is different from on the probability/impact table as COVID. How dumb are you to not even comprehend that?

> Sure because the options are a big home or homeless. You can't buy a smaller cheaper home.

The analogy I used was a HDB flat, not a big home. A house is an essential good, just like a plane and the fuel it consumes. Just because you want to resort to hyperbole doesn't mean you should.

A big house analogy also works. If you have a family of 50 people helping pay the mortgage, you have all reason to believe that in 5 years, you would have a family of 50 people helping pay the mortgage. If you're entire family was murdered overnight and you can't pay back the mortgage, would it be your fault? ""But you should have accounted for the complete decimation of your cash flow!"" you argue.

> Man, I really hate the bankers and finance types. They ruined the world economy with their housing bets, and now they want to do the same with aviation with the same excuses that they are not gambling.

> You were the one who brought in milk futures as an example, not me.

I cleary said to make advanced orders on milk, you are the one trying to obstufcate everything by bringing up milk OTCs as if it has to do with anything. Why can't you buy milk OTCs to hedge BTW? Why don't you just make a simple pre-order like SIA have done? 


 
> And how do you do that smartass? Do you have any experience with modelling future cash flows? Clearly SIA did try, but they failed. But as if you can develop a better model.

You don't have to look to me for a better model. You can look to like, every other fucking airline. They clearly can develop a better model.

It is you who don't know what hedging means. You literally make a hedge with a pre-order, or a bet, or many other ways.

> The expiry date of milk is measured in weeks. The expiry date of fuel is about a year. Clearly there is no difference between a week and a year.

It's still a fucking pre-order. Find your needs appropriately and order accordingly. If an expiry is such a stumbling block excuse for you, you can change it to another business that doesn't deal with perishable goods. HDB pre-building houses 5 years before selling them perhaps.


> What sort of stupid argument is that? Are you seriously saying that different risk events cannot have different impacts. The impact of swine flu is different from on the probability/impact table as COVID. How dumb are you to not even comprehend that?

So your stupid argument is ""If I am wrong, it's becuase no one can foresee my problems, but if I'm right, it's because I'm fucking smart to foresee problems nobody can see?""

I guess you will never think you are ever wrong then.


> The analogy I used was a HDB flat, not a big home. A house is an essential good, just like a plane and the fuel it consumes. Just because you want to resort to hyperbole doesn't mean you should.

""But you should have accounted for the complete decimation of your cash flow!"" you argue.

Yes? Why buy put yourself in a risk of having such an apartment when you know you can't afford the downside? Either you move out and live on your own, or buy mortgage insurance for each of the 50 people. My argument is sound here. 



> Man, I really hate ignorant people who think they know it all. They ruined the world with populism and their stupidity and now they want to do the same to common sense with the same stupidity, arrogance, ignorance, and general idiocy they employ in their daily lives.

"> # First SIA flights with crew fully vaccinated against Covid-19 depart Singapore

> SINGAPORE - The first Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight staffed by pilots and cabin crew vaccinated against the coronavirus left Changi Airport on Thursday (Feb 11), marking a significant milestone for the battered national carrier.

> Flight SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am carrying a crew of 12, and is the first of three departing SIA Group flights with crew who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

> Scoot flight TR606 to Bangkok also left Changi at 9.30am with a set of 11 vaccinated crew members, while SilkAir's first vaccinated flight MI608 will leave for Phnom Penh at 4.30pm with a crew of eight.

> The crew members are among more than 52,000 personnel in the transport sector who have received their first dose of the vaccine as at Feb 10.

> The Ministry of Transport said more than 39,000 workers in the aviation and maritime sectors have gotten their first jab - over 90 per cent of the 43,000 front-liners in both sectors.

> More than 14,000 land transport workers have also received the first dose of the vaccine, with the remaining 66,000 scheduled to get their jabs in the coming months.

> In a statement, SIA Group, which has suffered billions in losses because of the ongoing pandemic, said it is among the first airlines in the world to operate flights with fully vaccinated crews.

> Noting that the Government has prioritised the aviation sector in the national drive to vaccinate Singaporeans and other long-term residents, SIA said this reflected the sector's importance and the national carrier's crucial role in Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against Covid-19.

> SIA chief executive Goh Choon Phong said: ""Vaccinations will be key to the reopening of borders and to enhancing travel confidence, in tandem with robust testing regimes and the wide-ranging safe management measures that are in place on the ground and in the air.""

> He added: ""They offer greater protection for our people and provide an added layer of assurance to our customers.""

> Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, who spoke to crew members operating SQ956 on Thursday morning, said the vaccination drive has been ""proceeding like clockwork"".

> He told reporters he is confident that a substantial number of workers from the aviation and maritime sectors will be fully vaccinated by the end of the month.

> Singapore's biggest vulnerability is its border, he said, given that the virus is under control here with very few community cases.

> ""If the border staff that come into contact with the outside world are all vaccinated, I think we would have really taken a very big step in securing our border and keeping Singaporeans safe,"" he added.

> 

> 

> Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung speaking to SIA’s vaccinated crew members on Feb 11, 2021. ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG

> 

> Passenger traffic at Changi Airport, which has been decimated by Covid-19, fell by 82.8 per cent last year.

> Front-line workers in the aviation and maritime sectors started getting jabs on Jan 13 as part of an operational trial, before the mass exercise began in earnest on Jan 18.

> Bus and train workers started getting jabs from Jan 25.

> SIA said its operating crew members have responded very positively to the exercise, with more than 90 per cent of cabin crew and pilots signing up for the vaccine to date.

> Its milestone comes days after a 41-year-old cabin crew member on a turnaround flight to the United Arab Emirates tested positive for the coronavirus.

> The Singaporean woman was the fifth person on the flight to test positive, with preliminary test results showing that all five had contracted the more infectious B117 strain of the virus.

> The air stewardess had departed Singapore for Dubai on Jan 30 and returned on Jan 31 without disembarking from the aircraft.

> She then received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Feb 2. She lost her sense of smell two days later but did not seek medical attention.

> Her case was eventually picked up during routine testing as required by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.

> The Health Ministry reiterated on Tuesday that it takes a few weeks for individuals to build up immunity against Covid-19 after completing vaccination, and it is possible to get infected just before or after inoculation.

> Other airlines have also begun vaccinating their crew.

> Mr Ong said last month that SIA could be the first vaccinated international airline of the world.

> On Wednesday, Etihad Airways staked its claim as the first airline in the world to have inoculated all its operating pilots and cabin crew.

> The United Arab Emirates airline said in a statement that more than three-quarters of its workforce have already received at least one dose of the vaccine.

"Can't vent out on traditional social networks so I had only here to let out my frustrations.

Tried helping twice on the housework, get scowled for being ineffective.

I left the cooking chores to my sister, keeps sighing all over.

Every day conversations are about how they hated the PRCs for spreading the contagion, and how the ""infidels"" are all responsible for making the world a miserable place.

I need to concentrate on my work but I keep having second thoughts about the emotions of my sibling. When asked, she never responds.

I feel like I'm the asshole in this family. Never mind that my workplace requires me to be on my computer from 8 to 6 and sometimes spill over. Sometimes my work never gets done because I can't think of the solution in front of me due to insufficient skill set.

I don't sleep at times, trying to both relief myself from the boredom of work, and to escape the continuing scowling from my family members. Aged parent complained that I never talk to them, considering I'm being courteous by not saying anything contrarian.

I hold left liberal views, a despised position in my family. They say that kind of political thinking is akin to apostasy, and those who hold such beliefs mirror their asshole relatives: they kept hounded our family for many decades over their insistence to keep my dad as a guarantor for their ill-spent home loan; and the fact that my late mother was the primary target for putting house chores on top of her when she's pregnant with my sibling.

I feel like I am damned if I do, damned if I don't. I keep thinking negative thoughts because people are angry over my (in)actions. Many times I thought people want to see me go away and not be in their sights.

So I tried self-harm thrice in my lifetime. The last one got me into a psychiatric ward after prodding by my friend.

I feel like doing it again.

I don't like their continuous stream of racist, bigoted statements, but claimed they are ""humbler than many people"", I certainly don't like conservative thoughts because the outcomes became this. I certainly held a belief, naively, that people should be better versions of themselves, and I want to continue holding onto that belief.

Because otherwise, I might as well not marry.

There have been many hints that I will need to find a new home for myself. I have saved up considerably that I can probably pay off this Airbnb rent (until we get a temporary HDB home here some time in the near future), and to hush up ideas about my ""leeching off and not doing my part to the family."" Maybe me, living 300 kilometres away from my family to escape the dinner table conversations and miserable take on other human beings for the past decade, could have been good indicators that I can never gel well with this family of mine.

I can only say that I intend to move out from my sibling's HDB home and get myself a rent. Dad wants to keep the family intact, but I can't go out and find myself a date if I keep having thoughts that my choices will never be accepted by my family regardless.

I don't know if I should seek psychiatric treatment. The time for me to get a referral from my hospital in KL has long gone. I certainly don't want my family to know I need psychiatric help lest they cursed me for ""not believing enough"".

Honestly speaking, the vision of myself at the moment is only me being in this long, dark tunnel of misery, the walls are slimy with the degeneracy of people's thoughts, and an unseen, unknown terror behind me.

I kept silent about my thoughts from my family. My dad complains to my sibling that I don't talk enough to him. I just want to keep the peace, however untenable or uneasy this peace is.

At least the busking sessions, the random Spanish flamenco dance videos and Russian dramas on YouTube kept him entertained. Merdeka generation folk tend to harp about the simpler life in the past. I can't be empathetic about a past I don't know about.

Anyway, we're migrants from a shattered ideal of living in a place of lower costs of living. It turned out the people who run that country are as shitty as the country they came from.

Even the USA CDC is now citing a IFR of 0.4% (https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-35-percent-infected-asymptomatic-cdc-estimate-20200522-47sw3zujdjbene43wpevqof7cm-story.html for just one writeup).

"For flu? Like you say, flu has variants, and there are worse seasons. Right now, off the top of my head I've seen figures for some seasons nearly hitting 0.3%. I don't deny that a lot of this is statistical estimation, because no one bothers to keep track with flu. But it's definitely safe to say that for Singapore, our death rates are well within what's expected for the flu. If we believe our MOH, and I'm not cynical enough yet not to, there's definitely problems with the way other countries are keeping score.",2020-05-25 02:24:32,reddit

"I understand the authorities are trying to do their best, but it's a mess. Can't really blame them owing to the situation itself but there are a lot of inconsistencies in term of rules, measures, regulations. For example, classification of what is 'essential'. Apparently, they think haircuts is more important than renovation. You cannot don't have haircuts for 2-3 months but it's fine not to have your home renovated in 2-3 months. You can stay wherever you are now for all I care, despite incurring endless cost and inconvenience with no certainty when the end will be in sight.

You can crowd around in the trains, at transport hubs, bus stop with no 'safe distancing', heck, they even remove safe distancing decals in the trains. However, 3-4 workers renovating a flat with ample space between them is not allowed. Such inconsistency and ironically, these same renovation workers, who can't work, can freely go about their activities in the community such as buying food, haircuts, and for all we know, they may even taking up food delivery jobs and meeting many different people on daily basis. Just the other day, a property agent delivered food to me and shared that many in renovation and property lines have taken up food delivery jobs.

Now news are aplenty on closing of F&B restaurants. They simply can't sustain their business even with govt's help. Because no matter what, there is no revenue but fixed cost like overhead, rental, utilities still exist. Only a handful who can rely on delivery business can tough it out and even then, if the economy remain shut, they may not last long too.

In view of the low fatality rate, I think we can take greater risk and open the economy fast. Make wearing mask a habit everywhere we go. We should also do our part and download TraceTogether. Come on, the fatality rate is so low and only concentrate on certain vulnerable groups \[separate measures must be in place to protect them\], if unlucky to contract covid, as long as it is detected early, a normal patient should recover within 2-4 weeks. Meanwhile, if we have been playing our part by conforming to SafeEntry, TraceTogether etc, all the contacts can be traced easily and test for covid too and treat accordingly in positive.

"The longer we stay at home, the harder it is to restart the economy when we finally deem it is safe to stay out of home. Even though a lot of work can be done at home, I think WFH model is more suitable to people engaged in gig economy such as self employed in areas such as social influencers, equity tradings, forex speculators, resellers who buy clothes/books/furnitures etc from suppliers and sell it to you etc. Those who are employed by companies in whatever capacity, it is best to have physical meetings, interactions and even a meal together with bosses, colleagues and subordinates alike.  

People who pro lockdown, I think, are those not affected too much by it. Usually these are rich people who have ways and means to access whatever money that is left circulating in the system. For example they may be able to gain some of the money released by Fed Res through trading the US equity markets. They may be civil servants whose job security is not a concern, relatively to those people employed by businesses. 

Nobody and certainly the economy cannot function in isolation. No economy activity is as good as no revenue for many businesses. No revenue mean zero activity to circulate the money for everyone, no pay, no rental, no fee, no purchases, no deliveries, no production, no sale, no orders. Simply put, if the lockdown continues, only certain activities can continue owing to the fact that these activities are supported by govt \[reserves\]. Such as civil servant jobs, essential services paid by govt and even such activities will come to a halt if economy remain closed. As it is, the govt is propping everyone up with the various schemes at the expense of our reserves. How long can this last? Do we really have bottomless reserves? Once our reserves are weaken, we are susceptible to currency attacks. I hope the govt did not forget AFC. I think we have come to a point to seriously consider whether the prolonged lockdown is the way going forward. It is a difficult call, whether we save live in the short term with blanket lockdown or target to help the vulnerable groups with some focus measures so that majority can move forward or risking everyone to suffer with the collapsing economy?",2020-06-11 11:15:05,reddit

Certainly, there are some industries that cannot possibly work from home, like the customer-facing ones, or those that require the use of specialized machines, but the majority can be done from home.

Sure, there may be some productivity costs, but is that really too much to pay to have better work-life balance, and better mental health? Maybe we (as a country) place too much emphasis on profits and productivity, and not enough on mental health and sanity.

Prof. David Robertson, head of Viral Genomics and Bioinformatics at the Centre for Virus Research, was part of the team. MNT asked his views on the possibility of there being more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2.
“Until there is some evidence of a change in virus biology, we cannot say that there are new strains of the virus. It’s important to appreciate that mutations are a normal byproduct of virus replication and that most mutations we observe won’t have any impact on virus biology or function,” he said.

"I think the government is placing too much faith in Singaporeans (myself included) to stay at home (except for essential errands) without strict enforcement or legal consequences. I feel like we didn't really cut our social interactions by much when it was DOSCON Orange (especially the later part, before Circuit Breaker was announced), and so even though we entered DOSCON CircuitBreaker I think there will still be people who don't feel the need to stay home and would go visit their friends instead when they get bored.

Given that the government doesn't seem to want to strictly enforce currently, a possible solution (indirect/soft approach) to deter non-essential transit could be to temporarily raise prices of public transport for those who are traveling a lot for non-essential reasons (reaching a certain number of trips in a week moves you to a higher price tier for that week), and have 2-3 tiers (normal unraised, slightly raised and greatly raised price), while giving concession passes or rebates to the essential workers etc. So for non-essential commuters, the first X trips in a week is at the lowest price tier, while the middle price tier will kick in when you travel more than X trips in that week, and then subsequently (if there are 3 tiers) after traveling more than Y trips in that week the highest price tier will kick in. However, this is only effective in the ideal scenario, where no one abuses the loophole of taking another family member's ezlink to bypass the raised prices. But since the loophole exists and is likely to be abused, the price tiers should start with the slightly raised price to begin with as the lowest tier, or the slightly raised price should kick in early maybe 2 trips in a week.

Also, the government should track the transit numbers and make a statement if number of transit trips are too numerous compared to the expected numbers, and are not following the spirit of the CircuitBreaker measures.

[12 Apr: Singapore’s first lady responds to Taiwan's mask donation with 'Errrr'](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/)

Back story: [Taiwan banned the export of masks in January 2020. ST Engineering had 2 mask producing lines in Taiwan. The masks ST Eng produced were banned from export. ST Eng moved their machinery back, which was allowed.](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx) (This is based on Google Translate of the article.)

It appears that the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban have not been requisitioned by the Taiwanese government but are not allowed to be exported i.e. the masks are stuck in Taiwan. No indication whether Taiwan is charging ST Eng storage fees for keeping their masks.

[Based on 2016-2017 statistics (would welcome more recent statistics), Taiwan appears to be the third largest mask producer worldwide.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/856804/share-of-global-sheet-face-masks-producers-by-leading-country/)

Taiwan announced this weekend that they are donating masks to Singapore. [These are surgical masks, which are lower quality from the N95 ones that ST Eng produced.](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/fn71x2f/) There does not appear to be an update on whether the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban can be exported to Singapore yet.

Ho Ching shared the news article on Facebook and said ""Errrr"", and causing 4 posts on r/singapore about one word. 

Comments: 

* I've read that the ban was to stop masks from being exported to China especially since there was a shortage of masks in Taiwan - it appears that as ST Eng ""[is not a domestic manufacturer and is not within the scope of the Ministry of Economics requisition](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx)"" - so foreign manufacturers already had different rules from the start. It's not clear why Taiwan didn't extend this to us.

* Should Ho Ching have said anything? She's wearing three hats in this scenario (1) wife of PM Lee (2) CEO of Temasek, who is the majority shareholder of ST Engineering (3) Singaporean ~aunty~ citizen. On one hand, this has brought up claims that Singapore is ungrateful ([though this might be](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn6uci8/) [sensationalised by Taiwanese media](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzot0k/singapore_to_shift_2_of_its_mask_production_line/fn5w0vc/)) and that she is unprofessional (or even the next [Elon Musk](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn688g2/)). On the other hand - this provides some counter-balance / depth to the backstory of what Taiwan has done: [if not for her post, would we even be aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn66406/)?

* I do wonder if Taiwan's actions influenced Singapore's mask policy in Feb - if we had stable supply lines, [would the government have suggested that everyone mask up earlier?](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn7963h/) The mask policy was only announced *after* we had reusable masks available. 

* This reinforces that no one owes Singapore a living. Taiwan had no hesitation stopping ST Eng's masks from export when Taiwan needed to. (To be clear: not commenting on whether Taiwan's actions are justified.)",2020-04-13 12:09:39,reddit

[12 Apr: Singapore’s first lady responds to Taiwan's mask donation with 'Errrr'](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/)

Back story: [Taiwan banned the export of masks in January 2020. ST Engineering had 2 mask producing lines in Taiwan. The masks ST Eng produced were banned from export. ST Eng moved their machinery back, which was allowed.](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx) (This is based on Google Translate of the article.)

It appears that the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban have not been requisitioned by the Taiwanese government but are not allowed to be exported i.e. the masks are stuck in Taiwan. No indication whether Taiwan is charging ST Eng storage fees for keeping their masks.

[Based on 2016-2017 statistics (would welcome more recent statistics), Taiwan appears to be the third largest mask producer worldwide.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/856804/share-of-global-sheet-face-masks-producers-by-leading-country/)

Taiwan announced this weekend that they are donating masks to Singapore. [These are surgical masks, which are lower quality from the N95 ones that ST Eng produced.](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzun7h/singapores_first_lady_responds_to_taiwans_mask/fn71x2f/) (note: need to google for a fuller source.) There does not appear to be an update on whether the masks produced by ST Eng before the ban can be exported to Singapore yet.

Ho Ching shared the news article on Facebook and said ""Errrr"", and causing 4 posts on r/singapore about one word. 

Comments: 

* I've read that the ban was to stop masks from being exported to China especially since there was a shortage of masks in Taiwan - it appears that as ST Eng ""[is not a domestic manufacturer and is not within the scope of the Ministry of Economics requisition](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202002270147.aspx)"" - so foreign manufacturers already had different rules from the start. It's not clear why Taiwan didn't extend this to us.

* Should Ho Ching have said anything? She's wearing three hats in this scenario (1) wife of PM Lee (2) CEO of Temasek, who is the majority shareholder of ST Engineering (3) Singaporean ~aunty~ citizen. On one hand, this has brought up claims that Singapore is ungrateful ([though this might be](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn6uci8/) [sensationalised by Taiwanese media](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzot0k/singapore_to_shift_2_of_its_mask_production_line/fn5w0vc/)) and that she is unprofessional (or even the next [Elon Musk](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn688g2/)). On the other hand - this provides some counter-balance / depth to the backstory of what Taiwan has done: [if not for her post, would we even be aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn66406/)?

* I do wonder if Taiwan's actions influenced Singapore's mask policy in Feb - if we had stable supply lines, [would the government have suggested that everyone mask up earlier?](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fzsq0z/ho_ching_under_fire_in_taiwanese_media_for_her/fn7963h/) The mask policy was only announced *after* we had reusable masks available. 

* This reinforces that no one owes Singapore a living. Taiwan had no hesitation stopping ST Eng's masks from export when Taiwan needed to. (To be clear: it is for the reader to argue whether this is justified.)",2020-04-13 11:09:47,reddit

My personal smoker values are to not expose too many non-smokers to 2nd hand smoke so I try to smoke when and where it will affect the least amount of people and to not litter the area with cig butts so I will bring an ashtray whenever I lepak and clean up once I am done. 

I know it is the law to stay at home now and many people are advocating the stay-home stance. But I am just a lepak person who just want to lepak alone from time to time and not stay cooped up at home all day.

If you live separately then don’t shuttle back and forth between households potentially exposing both households to the virus. Either choose to move in entirely for the month or don’t see each other for the month.

Wuhan's draconian lockout lasted 2 months. Malaysia's looser MCO is likely to be extended again (beyond one month) since it's not flattening the Covid-19 curve enough. Our measures are more lenient than theirs, so it's unrealistic that we get to end early.

I read that Malaysia is exploring partial lifting of restrictions so as to save their economy. It makes sense that we do the same, say, after 6-8 weeks from now.

"Official explanation regarding DORSCON Red and widespread community transmission from press conference + reporter's questions that came before: [https://youtu.be/adA6\_PnIUuA?t=6129](https://youtu.be/adA6_PnIUuA?t=6129)

They will not abandon contact tracing unless it's no longer an effective strategy in containing the spread. It's not that when you stop contact tracing, that the situation goes to shit. It's that when the situation goes to shit (too many unlinked cases, which indicates widespread community transmission) that you stop contact tracing because too many potential undetected cases are amongst us that will continue the transmission faster than we can catch them.

A single day's numbers does not mean much without taking into context other factors:

1. **The persistence of the increase in numbers.**   
For example today we had 100+ cases right? If next 7 days we got 0-30 cases, then it's not widespread community transmission (WCT). The average numbers over a period of time is what they use to determine. If not then you declare WCT every day that you get 100+ cases, then when numbers drop then you take back your words?
2. **The number of truly unlinked cases** (ie. totally unlinked after endless amount of tracing. Not just looking at the initial reported number of unlinked cases for each day)   
If you have 100+ cases, but most if not all of them are shown to be from existing clusters **eventually** (for example all are foreign workers from dorms of existing clusters), then it's not WCT.

So the situation must fulfill the criteria, persistent (sustained over time) increase in numbers and especially in number of truly unlinked cases, to be considered widespread community transmission.

And I do agree with you that the numbers are worrying, no doubt. But it's not an apples to apples comparison to Italy, because our contact tracing efforts are way more intensive and started early and had success in containment (thanks to us being a small country), so 100+ detected cases in Italy could have been just among significantly more undetected cases compared to us.

I didn't follow Italy's news fully, but if their response measures were made much later than at the moment they had 100+ daily cases, then it's definitely different from our case, because we already have our measures decided and ready to go now as the govt predicted that this will happen. Therefore our measures will flatten the curve at an earlier stage/point of time compared to theirs",2020-04-06 01:22:59,reddit
"Would like a source on that if possible, never heard that one before and am genuinely curious about what's the context haha",2020-04-06 11:08:40,reddit
"I agree with your assessment that some people may not take it seriously, but not so much that it's because of the DORSCON level. For me it's because there is no strong message due to the lack of penalties being announced. Perhaps the gov didn't want panic, perhaps they really have faith in us following rules. Whatever the case is, I feel the lack of penalties being shoved in our faces will be interpreted by some that it's not that serious yet. That's why I'm suggesting other possible solutions that could deter people from moving around excessively (given that the gov is currently focused on using a less heavy-handed approach for now)

"Those living paycheque to paycheque? 
These may additionally include those who do not have family, are isolated in their tiny flat- which they inch closer to not being able to afford the expenses of as each day of the control order (""Circuit Breaker"") goes by.

So these people deal with more stress and anxiety every passing day as we speak.

But my biggest concern regarding this control order is actually a specific group of people; those suffering from mental illnesses. 

A large number of these people may seem like they're simply experiencing ""cabin fever"" at first glance but the reality is that they simply cannot be left alone physically for such a period of time. Their condition may prevent them from being able to perform their daily/essential tasks without assistance, likely causing significant detriment to their well-being.

Yes, the act allows a few exceptions that could apply here; such as in the event of an emergency. But, is preventing mental detriment an emergency? Or do we have to wait until they have a nervous breakdown (mental collapse) for their situation to be considered an emergency?
The act also allows visitation to care for the mentally disabled. Again, you now have to define who IS mentally disabled? Do you need a cognitive disorder? Does severe depression causing the above symptoms count as disabled?

Who can answer this? MOH. Will they? With the track record of Singapore and mental healthcare, especially with the removal of psychiatric services from the list of essential services, I doubt it.

"\[Opinion\] Covid-19 exposes several problems/ weaknesses of every country. For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April. We converted places like [exhibition halls](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-more-than-18-000-bed-spaces-for-isolation-and-care-12683558) (Expo/ Changi Exhibition Centre) and army camps to cater to such needs.

Based on Covid-19's experience, we could expect new waves of it, or possibility of new diseases that might be equally or more contagious in the future (/slap wood). 

Thus, I was thinking that SG should consider building a fixed number of ""quarantine facilities"" in every town, like playgrounds/ parks etc in future towns (or added on to existing towns). It is similar to the idea of disaster shelters. Of course, in unused times, they could be used for other purposes, like those [shelters](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/home/civil-defence-shelter/types-of-shelter) in void decks.

Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

Been a bit sceptical about the decisions and statements by the joint ministerial committee - I don't agree with the partial lifting of controls when our numbers are still high, not convinced by the division of cases between FW-indorm , FW-outside dorm and Citizen/PR etc. But all these were opinions and I never had something objective to bring to the table. Until I came across this article about the testing rate in Singapore.

[Singapore has done over 143,000 Covid-19 tests](https://www.businessinsider.sg/singapore-has-done-over-143000-covid-19-tests-and-it-plans-to-increase-testing-capability-from-8000-to-40000-a-day), which reports:

>On Monday (May 4), Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong was reported by The Straits Times (ST) as saying that plans are underway to increase the nation’s testing capability from the current 8,000 a day to [40,000 a day](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/live-coverage-ministerial-statements-on-covid-19-situation-in-singapore) by late 2020.  
>  
>Singapore already has some of the highest testing rates in the world, he added.

I was able to find [some data](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) on testing rates around the world. err even if we account for incomplete data and anomalies like really small territories, Singapore ranks 37th out of 212 in tests per million as of today -0 less than Germany, Spain, Denmark, the UAE and Australia. But above HK, UK and US. (The data is apparently used by the Johns Hopkins CSSE and various govts so seems pretty trustworthy.)

Personally, I think Gan Kim Yong's statement makes it sound quite good when it's not that amazing. BUt I know I might be biased. Do you guys think 37th in the world, 8th in Asia can be considered ""some of the highest testing rates""?

"After the incident where Lee Bee Hwa hounded the ministers on the taskforce for an explanation as to why TCM shops should not be allowed to reopened, it's clear that beyond the opaque decision making process where some first order principles guides their hand, parts of their decision making process appears completely arbitrary and they won't be able to explain it beyond reiterating the vague principles of safe distancing and community risk. 

I'm a bbt addict and super salty that they closed them as part of the CCB, they have been excluded in the last round of openings meant to reverse the CCB, AND they will still be excluded off the list of businesses allowed to open post 2nd June. 

If any of the ministers in the taskforce can provide an a posteri explanation how they arrived at their conclusion that all f&b takeaways are allowed except beverage stalls, I will quit drinking for good. What's the data behind the risk assessment that singled them out, beyond posing some annoyance to SDAs and making the news for a couple of isolated incidents? The business did not change fundamentally, so why are they still closed post CCB while a ""return to initial position"" has opened most businesses during that measure for closures?

Trivial and petty and salty I might be, but it bears worth to note that substitute bbt with any other business/service you care about, and you can see why while we should give credit where credit is due, we also shouldn't overlook some inconsistent and arbitrary aspects of the taskforce's decision making that deserves questioning.",2020-05-20 11:45:46,reddit

"> For Singapore, one of the problems/weaknesses we had, is the lack of sufficient quarantine facilities when there was a sudden need for many people to be quarantined in late March/early April.

I think this is a global issue, not unique to Singapore, though I'd say it's a problem too. Wuhan had that two massive temporary hospitals. UK has NHS Nightingale (their equivalent of ""Expo hospital""). The world realised we are woefully unprepared/underprepared for a contagious pandemic.

> Having decentralized shelters might also help in cases of any unforeseen circumstances, i.e don't put all eggs in one basket. It might be easier to transition to ""a plan for infection control by region which some people hypothesized"".

The shelters thing might sound good, but even with a centralised location, we seem to have a manpower crunch in Expo (as seen by the article of a person who got sent there). What more if we start to decentralize quarantine facilities, you need to duplicate the manpower across Singapore and monitor more staff for unwanted spread (e.g. what if Kallang's quarantine center has an outbreak within their staff?). The more places you have, the more likely you could ""screw up"" the handling and accidentally spread it somewhere else.

I'd say that having Expo/Suntec/whatever equipped to be converted to quarantine facilities in a day/two should be our goal. Make it so that the fixed facilities/infrastructure (e.g. HVAC) is rated for quarantine use. I believe MOH has done this with things like the Community Quarantine Facilities (which is why quarantine was set up super fast).",2020-05-17 17:16:23,reddit

"Beat them down further - take away their bubble tea, their mcdonner, close their favourite restaurant or bars, deny them of much needed grooming or personal health services. /s

One thing that I find is a silver lining in all these, is that the government has finally recognized the importance of mental health, and places the official hotlines and resources quite prominently in their messaging. I work in an industry where it's not civil service but on the periphery, and I can see that the government messaging is taken seriously and my managers are all imploring us to take wfh seriously but at the same time lightly, take care of our own needs, use available resources if we feel our mental health is suffering. 

I'm not sure how many of the isolated migrant workers have access to a counsellor or therapist, but I'd place that as quite a high priority to address after their lodging, food, healthcare and other basic logistics are settled. Anyone has any information if such resources are provided for them? They are particularly vulnerable if they can't speak english and thus tap onto official government resources so I think it's a valid concern. 

Beyond that, I feel that allowing interaction is super important, for people who don't live within the same household. Beyond the immediate family situation that is addressed by phase 1, one thing that could have helped is for dating couples to be allowed to visit each other. The risk is marginal; the spread will be within 2 households even if theres a positive contact, the contact is easily traced (tracetogether, or log the visit to a special portal etc). With data analytics it's not impossible to quickly capture the source/destination, spatial and time dimension and mitigate the risk of an untraceable outbreak because the virus spread between households like STDs in a college campus.",2020-05-20 11:57:46,reddit

"(posted in the daily thread, but posting here too in case I reach the right people)

Hi all. Throwaway for personal reasons. Some back story is, I took leave of absence in 2019 for the entire year of 2020 (tldr: not doing well in school, want to switch fields so decided to take year off to work in another unrelated field) in order to work and get some experience while trying to improve my mental health.

So what happened was, managed to get several offers amongst several applications, but chose a reputable one because it will help my resume greatly. But the downside was said company needed me to 'intern' for a few months since I had no prior proper professional experience. So I said OK. It was supposed to be only till end of Feb. And then I will receive a more permanent contract.

Then covid happened. Some projects were halted, office decided to close and work from home. It became way more unstable. Boss told me he can't promise the offer anymore, but would like me to stay indefinitely and at first opportunity, I can and will be contracted. 

I stayed because I didn't have anywhere else to go, and I really liked the culture and the people there. They really treat me well over there. But alas, fast forward to today, he broke the news to me that I sadly have to go. It wasn't because of job performance, I wasn't the first to go, there were a few full time staff that were let go last month. Didn't expect myself to be asked to leave too, since just a week ago I was involved in a huge project. But it's out of my hands. 

My question is, given my circumstances, am I eligible to apply for the several government grants due to the loss of this internship? Im still on leave of absence from NTU to end of year. The allowance was already very low before being asked to leave. and I'm just in a funk right now. Uncertain about the future. I have also bills to pay and some liabilities on hand like my school tuition fees.

Would appreciate some word of advice from those who can relate or are going through the same thing. I'm in my mid-20s.",2020-04-29 19:43:43,reddit

"> # Singapore to start gradual easing of circuit breaker measures as COVID-19 community cases decline

> SINGAPORE: With a falling number of community cases, Singapore is in a position to start the gradual easing of ""circuit breaker"" measures, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force announced on Saturday (May 2).

> Speaking at a virtual press conference, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong noted that with stricter circuit breaker measures in place for about two weeks, the number of new cases in the community has been on the decline.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He said that some businesses will resume operations from May 12, with a gradual resumption of selected activities and services over a few weeks.

> Home-based businesses, selected food retail outlets, and food manufacturing firms will be among those that will be able to resume operations from May 12, co-chair of the task force Minister Lawrence Wong said at the press conference.

> Mr Wong added the authorities will start to bring back students in small groups or face to face lessons in May, focusing on cohorts who are taking national exams and are graduating.

> “It’s a small group, and we will do it with safe-distancing measures,” he said.

> In the meantime, registered Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners will be able to resume their acupuncture services and retail services on May 5. This was based on a comprehensive review, Mr Gan said.

> However, Mr Gan cautioned that “we are not out of the woods yet"".

> “New clusters can form if we let our guards down. We must press on with our efforts, so that we continue to keep the numbers low,” he said.

> The rest of the circuit breaker measures continue to be crucial, and will remain in force till Jun 1, he added.

> The Government will be able to further roll back some of the circuit breaker measures if the situation is “clearly under control” till Jun 1, he added.

> “Even then, it will be a new normal we all have to adapt to,” he said.

> 

> Singapore's economy will open up ""step by step"" when the number of COVID-19 cases in the community falls, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Thursday in his May Day message.

> Singapore is into its fourth week of a ""circuit breaker"" period to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. Safe distancing measures have been tightened and the circuit breaker extended by another four weeks to Jun 1.

The imported cases are self explanatory. Those infected through family contacts are understandable and expected.

"> # 'No magic solution': Lawrence Wong on why Singapore is not locked down amid COVID-19 outbreak

> SINGAPORE: There is no “magic solution” to the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore, and a series of brakes are needed to handle the situation, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Mar 31).

> When asked at a press conference why Singapore has not been locked down, Mr Wong said: “There is a view, I think, that people sometimes say, ‘why don’t you just … don’t have to wait, just go for the drastic measures now, go for the so-called lockdown today, do it for two weeks then life can go back to normal’.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> “There is no such magic solution as (a) two-week lockdown and then we are free from the virus. It will not happen.”

> Several countries have heavily restricted people’s movement, including Malaysia and Indonesia, while parts of Europe have declared lockdowns.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Singapore could put in more “drastic measures” sooner, but the minister said that would not “eradicate the virus”.

> “It will still be with us, and we will still have to continue with this set of measures – like what we are today – for maybe months,” explained Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministerial task force looking at the COVID-19 situation.

> “We are in this for the long haul. We have to prepared that we have to deal with this situation for quite a long period of time.”

> Singapore will be “exposed continuously to recurring waves of infection from around the world” and local transmission within the country that will continue.

> “(It) is not just one month, two months, but potentially all the way until the end of the year and beyond,” Mr Wong said.

> 

> “So, we have to find measures that can control, slow down the virus and do so in a way that is sustainable – not just for two weeks, two months, but all the way through to the end of the year.”

> Singapore has announced several measures, including safe-distancing and stay-home notices for all travellers, among others.

> 

> On Tuesday, Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo said that regulations will be amended to ensure that employers are doing all they can to encourage workers to telecommute, rather than come into the office.

> Mr Wong said that “extra brakes” can be put in if the situation warranted it.

> 

> When asked if there was a ""trigger point"" for when a lockdown might be implemented, Mr Wong said the measures are a ""series of brakes which you can put in place"".

> ""Rather than use a phrase which means different things to different people - because people have different interpretations of what a lockdown means - we look at the measures specifically and what these measures imply,"" the minister added.

> The task force has set out baseline measures that will continue for sustained periods, and ""extra brakes"" on top of those measures.

However, please, no half-measures please, like e-scooters:

Like the banning of e-scooters on footpaths in Singapore, citing France has done it, when e-scooters are allowed on roads unlike Singapore.

>France on Friday (Oct 25) officially legalised the use of electric scooters and similar devices, but banned them from footpaths, highways and rural roads.

>They may normally only be used on cycle paths and city roads with a speed limit of 50kmh or less.

People are still allowed to go out (one person per vehicle) to do essential things, such as grocery shopping.

Lockdowns are a desperate move, but should help flatten the curve when a high percentage of people comply (as death rates rise I’m sure more people will be scared into compliance).

"The key is flatten the curve. I believe the approach the government is taking is not about completely eliminate covid from our shores - that is near impossible especially when you look at other countries and our depdency on them. But rather, to slow the rate of spread as much as possible such that our healthcare capacity does not become overwhelmed. Maybe a treatment or vaccine will even be established by next year. 

It is important to remember that we are in it for the long haul, as our ministers have said many times. Honestly, our rate of increase in local cases has been staying rather constant the past few days and that's a pretty good sign.

Most of the other countries that initiated a lockdown knew the situation was spiralling out of control and they had little choice but to sacrifice the economy to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. I think part of it is also because China's an authoritarian state so that was easy to mandate, and it worked for them, so other countries follow it too. Thankfully, we have not reached that point yet, and I hope we won't.

Why would you assume that? I'm pretty sure you're allowed to continue with your moving plans if you already made the arrangements. You would only interact with the movers and maybe a couple of minutes with a property agent or landlord. But I doubt you're allowed to go and enter into other people's homes to view them; that's so dangerous!

"""Delivering essential goods or services"" line is targeted towards those who do it as a job, ie Grabfood people etc. Govt has clearly stated that if you do not have a job in essential services, you should not leave your house except for essential services (takeaway food, buy grocery, medical services etc for yourself) or solitary (or with household member) exercise. This is from the perspective of strictly following the law and spirit of the circuit breaker measures.

If you really wanna exploit some grey areas, maybe you can sign up to be a deliveryman or something. Or if their family members still have the same address on their IC, this is also a potential exploitable loophole. Even if this is done, it is strongly recommended that contactless delivery is done, since he is given 5 day SHN/MC due to flu-like symptoms.

Why punish the people who legitimately are exercising or buying groceries or tapauing food because they can’t afford to have food delivered daily? Why threaten to take away privileges?

We are so used to this as Singaporeans, with schools and the army drilling in this notion that we need to punish everyone to get the few bad seeds to cooperate. In this CB situation, the bad seeds are likely far out of the influence of those abiding by the rules, unlike say a classmate in school or a bunkmate. I can’t very well scream at random kids or uncles gathering in the park can I? 

I say for situations like these you need to precisely catch and punish the few who do break the rules more harshly. Safe Distancing Ambassadors are in an unfortunate spot here, but it kinda IS their responsibility for now. I don’t envy them. But leave the obedient folks alone.

Is not an unpopular opinion is a fact,2020-04-10 18:51:17,reddit
"How is “we should stay at home” an unpopular opinion? It’s echoed worldwide, and is as common as it is sensible. You know what would be unpopular? The possibility that isolation and lockdowns turn out to be temporary solutions; that the virus flares up once restrictions are eased. When we come to that, some uncomfortable questions need to be asked. What is the nominal value of avoiding casualties? Its not actual cash, obviously, but an accounting measure that helps us weigh different things like our jobs, the economy, our values, the value of lives, etc.

A year-long lockdown/free-to-roam on/off cycle with consumers stuck at home half the time would obviously hurt GDP. But more than that it would’ve taken its toll on our mental health as we endure months upon months at home. Investments would be postponed further and innovation and productivity stall; the cranking of the economic engine to get back to normalcy would be more strenuous.

Yes, when a team of young footballers are stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand, the world comes together to demonstrate the strength of the human spirit, of our shared values, with no consideration of cost - as it should be, and that’s good. But during wartime or crises, tough questions have to be asked, and responsible leaders will have to find a way to weigh the costs against the benefits.

As much as I am loathe to say it - when the Orange Man in the US suggested that the “cure mustn’t be worse than the virus” - he does have a valid point, however unpopular it may be. And I say these having just recovered from bronchitis a year earlier - not sure if that qualifies as a pre-existing condition.

Point is, we may have to recognise that the costs of distancing might just outweigh the benefits. I’m just glad I’m a normie who doesn’t have to make that call - I’d hate to take the flak and be vilified for doing what’s economically necessary and pragmatic, but morally tough to swallow.",2020-04-11 01:15:15,reddit

Hence now it makes sense to have everyone wear because now we want to assume everyone is potentially a carrier and hence you should wear masks to protect OTHER PEOPLE AROUND YOU.

By enforcing the $300 fine, the Kiasi mentality kicks in and triumphs, and everyone just doesn't want to get fined, hence does the necessary donning of masks.

"Without CB and mask wearing, Singapore’s management of the coronavirus would ultimately depend on the individual’s self-initiated civic sensibility... and I would say that it’ll be less effective. 

The fact the crowds gather and queues form, showed that civilians comply with measures because they have to (and maybe agree with), but failed to grasp the overall principle of saying away from crowds (esp for frivolous reasons) and staying safe. 

“I wore my mask and I stayed at home during CB... how have I broken the law or rules by queuing up for bubble tea?” I guess we’re clever enough to identify loopholes and follow mandatory regulations, but less wise in practising the overall principle. 

If there was a strong cause for concern, civilians would have, by their own initiative, stayed away from crowds or unnecessary gatherings. And it’s all about whether the individual wants to do so. Case in point: when COVID first broke out in SG, people started to avoid entertainment outlets and Chinese hotpot restaurants- all by their own will, no rules enforced. These shows that fear is more of an effective crowd control than civic responsibility.",2020-12-21 09:34:35,reddit
"Initially I thought CB was not necessary as community cases were considered under control and at that time, the cases in the dorms have not exploded. Announcement was on 3 Apr, CB on 7 Apr, 229 dorm cases on 9 Apr ([Source - the ""Number of Cases"" tab](https://covidsitrep.moh.gov.sg/)). I would imagine if the CB had been implemented a few days later - I think there will be real fear.

With hindsight, we probably will end up like KR and JP now at best, as fatigue sets in.

I also did not fully appreciate the fact that the CB was really necessary to buy time for the authorities to ramp up hospital, community care, isolation, testing, contact tracing & basically everything else that has their supply chain messed up. I think the difference between Singapore and many other countries is that Singapore really took this very seriously and we now see that we are able to have all the necessary tools to deploy at request.

Another difference between Singapore CB and the lockdown in other countries is that we did it way before it went out of control & healthcare systems at the brink of collapse. So how we choose to exit it may be slow, but so far it seems to be effective. Those that hastily exited lockdowns have been burned e.g. IL & AU.

"Slight hijack: **How is life in Singapore during COVID? Curious how this would have compared to life in America?** 

I'm an American living in a major metro area. I've been watching mainly Vietnam during the pandemic, as well as other countries, to compare how it's going in my situation vs. elsewhere. It's pretty clear to me that enforcement of risk mitigation protocols is necessary, and at the population level it's impossible to expect everyone to cooperate and comply. There will always be people who break the rules. The only exception I know of is Japan, where COVID rules are just suggestions and there's no legal enforcement. They're the only society where this could work, as their culture is uniquely equipped to handle this. 

In my situation, and for the vast majority of Americans, COVID doesn't affect them directly. I am indirectly, negatively affected because I stay informed of the unfavorable statistics, death rate, hospitalizations, etc, as well as the socio and political friction that the pandemic has caused in my country and globally. 

Compare this to Singapore, where COVID statistics are much more favorable, but COVID rules are enforced, and lockdowns were mandatory and enforced. I wonder how it feels to be in Singapore during COVID compared to how it feels in America. Isn't life pretty much normal for you guys right now? Small social gatherings, mostly OK and fine? 

In America, if you don't pay attention to the news, and don't care about COVID statistics, don't have concern about the minority of people ( who are old/obese/other comorbidities) who are getting hospitalized, then I imagine life's pretty easy and peachy. There's no real restrictions on anything, and most businesses are open to some capacity. But it does seem like people are voluntarily isolating much more than before. And masks aren't exactly enforced, but the vast majority of places have a requirement, and people voluntarily wear them with pretty decent compliance. Obviously America is a very large place, so YMMV on this judgement. This is based on my major metropolitan area and friends who live in other large metropolitan areas.",2020-12-21 14:16:35,reddit

"Though I think beyond the government approaches that generally differed between Western and Asian countries, there's also the cultural differences that we look at.

I would think that the West tends to prioritise individualism and other related values, while the East appears to place more value in the community and society. Of course, this is just a generalisation and this isn't always true, especially with globalisation where cultures merge and shift. 

So an argument that Asian communities may have coped better with the coronavirus even without strong control measures may hold some water. Though seeing how Japan fared, such an argument's credibility may not be as strong.",2020-12-20 23:59:42,reddit

"Before I answer the question, I will say a few things.

First off, by asking people to consider a different statistic, there is a slight chance that you are implying that the American authorities, the American media and health experts in America are involved in a conspiracy to lie to the American public. Especially when the LA Times are tracking admitted and confirmed cases, suspected cases in hospitals, and even the health infrastructure of LA county. These numbers are pulled both from the LA County's Department of Public Health, which is a part of the wider monitoring network of California's Department of Public Health. Included in the graphs is this disclaimer:

> Number of daily cases will not match the number of newly reported Los Angeles County cases as episode date reflects date of underlying illness rather than date of report.

The implication of this is that the LA County's numbers will lag behind the LA Times' number.

Secondly, and most importantly, had you bothered to explain yourself as to why we should consider your statistic rather than seemingly dismiss the explanations outright, you'd be met with far less hostility and you'd come off as less of a douchebag. Especially when you start with

> Lol. Quick to press the downvote button I see.

rather than your explanation. So don't be surprised when someone tries to call you out on your bullshit.

It gets way, way worse when you accuse me of ""grasping at straws"".

Don't want to be treated like an ass? Stop acting like one.

And now, the answer is, **no, considering we couldn't even accurately test how many migrant workers had the disease.** And especially when you said. 

>You assume that the proportion of cases detected in tests is not far off from the actual cases in the population. This has repeatedly been said to be unlikely by the experts over there.

I'm a subscriber on the /r/pilates subreddit and when this covid thing first started breaking out internationally, there were people who made free videos to offer some form of guidance for the community that was suddenly cut off from regular classes. This marketed their expertise and allowed an audience that was no longer able to attend classes physically to seek out new ways to continue training.

"> # Singapore's Covid-19 circuit breaker ends on June 1; economy to reopen in three phases

> SINGAPORE - Singapore's circuit breaker will formally end on June 1, the Multi-Ministry Task Force on the Covid-19 outbreak announced on Tuesday (May 19), saying the economy would then be reopened gradually in three phases.

> At a virtual press conference, the task force outlined the broad plan to transition Singapore in phases out of its period of stringent measures eventually into a new normal that will be remain until an effective vaccine or treatment for Covid-19 is developed. But the ministers stressed that reopening plans were not a return to life before Covid-19.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong also noted that phases could be rolled back should the outbreak flare up again. He also said that a rise in number of cases is likely as Singapore reopens.

> ""As we being to resume more activities, we do expect to see a rise in daily cases... If we can continue to keep the situation under control then we can reopen progressively,"" he said.

> In the first phase, called ""safe reopening"", more people will be allowed to return to their workplaces, with priority given to critical sectors and businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks.

> But those who are working from home should continue to work from home, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing. Only those who require machinery or specialised terminals will be able to return to the office, as well as those who need to complete legal documentation.

> Schools will also gradually reopen by levels, with full resumption by June 10. For primary and secondary schools, those in graduating cohorts will attend school daily, while the rest will rotate weekly.

> Places of worship - closed during the circuit breaker - will be allowed to open next month, but only for private worship. Congregational services will not resume.

> Social gatherings will also still be prohibited, although an exception will be made for people visiting their parents or grandparents. Visits will be limited to one per day, with a maximum of two visitors a day. These visitors should be from the same household.

> This means that dropping off children for childcare will be allowed, although seniors themselves should not go out, Mr Gan said.

> In this first phase, the risk of a resurgence in community transmission is high, he added. This means that people should continue wearing masks when they leave the house, and only go out for essential services.

> The first phase is expected to last a few weeks and Singapore will move into the second phase if community transmission rates remain ""low and stable"" and the dormitory situation remains under control.

> In the second phase, called the ""safe transition"", people will gradually be able to resume more social activities. More businesses will be allowed to reopen, including tuition and enrichment centres, gyms and fitness studios. However, employers must implement safe distancing measures and ensure that those who can work from home continue to do so.

> In this phase, small social gatherings and dining in at food and beverage outlets could also be allowed.

> Mr Gan said the second phase comprises several steps and could last several months.

> Depending on the how the Covid-19 situation then develops, measures will continue to be eased further until reaches the third and final phase, called ""safe nation"".

> In the third phase, Singapore will move to a ""new normal"" until the vaccine is found. By this time, social, cultural, religious and business gatherings are expected to have resumed. However, limits will be put in place on gathering sizes.

> The same applies to services and activities that involve significant prolonged close contact, such as massages, or significant crowd management risk in an enclosed space, such as cinemas.

> On public transport, where it is difficult to maintain physical distancing, commuters will have to wear masks and refrain from talking.

> National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said that while some might be disappointed that they will not be able to go out freely and socialise after the end of the circuit breaker, the reopening needs to be done carefully.

> ""We have to do this in careful and calibrated manner as we don't want to risk a flaring up of virus. And importantly, we do not want to sacrifice the efforts all of us have put in controlling the outbreak,"" he said.

> He added that the government would continue to support businesses and workers that are unable to open on June 2. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat has announced that he will deliver a ministerial statement on the plans on May 26. It will be the fourth budget this year.

So if anywhere in that chain of customers, someone had the virus, it’s going to be a Long ass train of the hairdresser passing the virus on?

Versus meeting your SO? Even if you were gonna change SO every week, your exposure to your hairstylist is much greater.  

On TOP of that, we’re more upset at the fact that the gov’s measures are going against the very rationale that they keep emphasising.

I'm sick of this sub misusing the term strawman. It's like a go to thing to parrot to say ""I disagree""",2020-05-20 00:11:28,reddit
"Please explain how the argument I’ve presented is a strawman argument. 

Arguments you presented:
1. Partners are close contacts and not just transient ones. If gov allows ppl to meet their SOs, people can start meeting ppl from other families and we’ll thus be back to square one due to cross-contamination like food in diff compartments. 

2. People can change as many partners as they want and so it wouldn’t be just one partner that they’re visiting (for the next few months I Guess I my interpretation)


My arguments against the above points:
1. If the rationale behind the gov’s measures for SOs not being allowed to meet was truly as you speculate - that they want to prevent “cross-contamination” of different households - the gov allowing a hair salon providing close contact (non-transient) 3-6 hour services between 2 ppl from different households is going against that very rationale. 

2. Yes, people can change partners every week, but still it wouldn’t be as bad as the potential breeding ground that a hair salon could be (that the gov is allowing) due to the fact that they see high counts of people from different households daily.

Edit after reading your second reply to another user: Again, I did not say that you are for salons opening up. I’m using the example of our gov opening up salons for non-essential services to show that the gov is displaying clear hypocrisy that people who are related to each other cannot meet because they’re from different households, but a hairdresser can meet multiple people from multiple households, and those individual customers would have essentially have the same amount of exposure as the hairdresser they go to.",2020-05-20 00:26:00,reddit
Yeah I think that's the most likley explanation is that the confrence already happend but they broke some press embargo that was agreed upon by accident.,2020-05-19 19:53:27,reddit
"Your argument revolves around the assumption that I am ok with barbers being able to offer more than haircuts. I am not ok with that. 

I am arguing for my opinion that being able to meet grandparents is less risky in terms of community spread than being able to meet people from different families, such as your partner.

If your post above isn't a straw man argument then please enlighten me.

Now that I think we have cleared that up, I'll be happy to engage you on reasons why you think allowing families to meet their grandparents also means we should allow individuals to meet their partner(s), or that meeting partners takes priority over being able to visit grandparents.",2020-05-20 00:20:00,reddit
"For point 1, It's simple. I'm not arguing against that. I agree with you that 'cross-contamination' is going to exist as long as we can roam the streets. You are thinking that I don't agree with you here, that's the issue.

I don't agree that we should increase the risk of our elderly by letting families meet grandparents, but that's not my decision.

Now that that decision has been made by our gov, people now want to meet their partners too because 'hey I can meet my grandparents why cannot meet my future wife/husband?' This is what I am against. I also think that meeting your own family (including extended) poses less risk of community spread than meeting your partner but this is of course my opinion.

For point 2, I'm not saying partners can change every week although they very well can. I'm saying people will use this as an excuse to meet whoever they want, and when that happens, what's the point of a CB.

Edit: So to elaborate on why I think meeting grandparents is less risky than meeting partners, here's why.

Grandparents are generally less mobile and do not have to go to work. Sure, they may get infected from you but the buck could stop there. That's 1 event to get them infected. If your brother now visits your dad and gets infected, that's 2 events that have to happen. Now your brother goes to office and infects the people there that's 3. A total of 3 events have to happen before the virus reaches the community (disregarding yourself otherwise there's no point arguing as you just infect everyone).

On the other hand, meeting a partner when you are infected goes like this. You meet your partner, she goes to work. That's just 2 events that have to happen.",2020-05-20 00:35:26,reddit
"The world's 4.81M confirmed cases started with one. Not sure what you're trying to prove here. 

When it's time to relax the measures it will be, and soon too. Wanting normalcy again is normal but it's still a bit too soon, we can afford to  wait another month or so before meeting our partners than risk going into multiple CBs because cases have risen. 

If cases stay 0 for Singapore ex dorms I don't see how the gov wouldn't hasten to lift more restrictions.",2020-05-19 23:33:57,reddit
So what you’re saying is that meeting people from the same family is less risky than visiting people that are not? I dun get it.,2020-05-20 07:18:30,reddit
"Yes you summarised it quite well. But to go one step further I'm saying allowing the meeting of your family's elderly poses less of a risk than allowing the meeting of a partner. The risk being transmission of the virus to the general public and enforceability of people who may abuse this leeway given to us. 

I know that the elderly will have a higher fatality rate in the event of contracting covid19, in case anyone wants to use that as an argument. 

When given both choices of meeting elderly and a partner, you can choose not to meet your elderly parents to keep them safe but how many are going to not meet their partners? Meeting with partners also tend to go on for longer and more often.",2020-05-20 07:47:19,reddit

"yeah exactly i highly highly doubt we will ever have 0 cases for a extended period of time. So the question i had after reading the new measures for after june 2 was 'what exactly does the government want to get out of this CB?' 

do they want 0 community cases for 7 days? 14 days straight? because honestly i dont see that happening. And in my opinion, thats fine because to say we can eradicate this virus from our country is not realistic.. especially when we are a country so reliant on other countries (travel, trade etc). so if thats the case, the government basically has to just mitigate it as much as possible and right now with the measures we have i think they are doing a pretty good job.

I mean even in feb-early march when we were MUCH less prepared for this, we managed to control the spread rather well. (we didnt even have any CB or anything people were still going about their normal lives)


so now with all these social distancing and tracing etc i think that the government has a good chance of being able to control the spread well. 

so yeah they should definitely open up in stages but i PERSONALLY feel that this phase 1 is kind of half-baked and the government is too non-linear. they allow this and that in some areas despite them being clearly non essential (some hairdressing services etc) but then other areas they are still strict like how they are so afraid of letting any form of social interaction happen (even minimal in grps of no more than 2 arent allowed). 

So while they want to open in stages i personally cannot understand many of this phase 1 steps. i feel after CB the next step (alongside slowly opening workplaces and schools) is to also gradually allow people to interact as well (especially since they will definitely already interact in school/work). even if its just starting small with eg 2 people first then slowly increasing the no.",2020-05-20 02:21:28,reddit

"> # Singapore to exit circuit breaker on Jun 1, visiting of parents, places of worship allowed with restrictions

> SINGAPORE: Singapore will exit the circuit breaker as planned on Jun 1, with measures to be progressively lifted in three phases from the next day, the authorities announced on Tuesday (May 19).

> As the risk of a resurgence in community transmission remains high, the Government will first resume economic activities that do not pose a high risk of transmission in the first phase, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in a joint media statement.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Besides the essential businesses that are already operating, businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks will be allowed to open. These include manufacturing firms, subject to the issued guidelines set for the manufacturing sectors and most offices. Nevertheless, the authorities said that tele-commuting must be used the “maximum extent”.

> “Those who have been working from home so far should continue to do so, and employees should go to the office only where demonstrably necessary,” they said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Such circumstances might include employees who need to return to the office to access to specialised systems and equipment that cannot be accessed from home, or to fulfil legal requirements.

> The circuit breaker measures first took effect on Apr 7, and were further tightened after three weeks, with more workplaces closed, and social gatherings banned.

> In announcing the lifting of measures, the authorities emphasised that the country is likely to see a rise in new community cases.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, speaking at a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference, said that the task force’s decision to exit the circuit breaker is because of the low number of cases in the community, and the stabilised situation at the dormitories.

> As the nation resumes more activities, however, Singapore can expect to see a rise in daily new cases, he cautioned.

> “The key is to detect these cases and contain them quickly, so as to prevent a sharp rise in the number of cases, or the emergence of a large cluster,” he said.

> HAIRDRESSERS, BARBERS CAN OFFER ALL SERVICES

> Hairdressers and barbers will be allowed to resume all services, beyond just basic haircut services.

> All home-based businesses that operate using a delivery or collection model will also be allowed to resume.

> Businesses that can resume operations from Jun 2 will not need to apply for exemptions, but will have to submit their manpower details through the GoBusiness portal within two weeks of the date of resumption of operations, the authorities said.

> Other services that will be able to resume include motor vehicle servicing, aircon servicing, printing, basic pet services, school bookshops and retail shops selling school uniforms.

> Most retail outlets and other personal services will however not reopen in Phase One.

> Dining in at food and beverage outlets will continue to be disallowed. Sports and recreation facilities will also remain closed.

> “Everyone should continue to leave home only for essential activities, and should wear a mask when doing so. As seniors are a particularly vulnerable group, they should continue to stay at home as much as possible,” the authorities said.

> DROPPING OFF CHILDREN AT GRANDPARENTS, SOME VISITING ALLOWED

> The agencies said that while people should continue to limit contact with others outside of their household, some exemptions will be allowed.

> Each household will be allowed to visit their parents or grandparents, a move that will allow families to spend time and provide support to one another.

> “Each receiving household should limit such visits to only one per day, and to not more than two persons who must be from the same visiting household,” they said.

> As part of this policy, dropping off children at parents’ and grandparents’ homes for childcare will also be allowed, subject to the same limit of two visitors from the same visiting household per day, they added.

> Mr Gan stressed that while families can visit parents and grandparents, seniors should refrain from leaving their homes to visit their families.

> “Children or grandchildren can visit their parents or grandparents. Grandparents and parents, please stay at home. Don't go visiting your children, because we do want to keep you safe at home,” he said.

> Siblings will not be allowed to visit each other.

> IN-PERSON MARRIAGE SOLEMNISATION, PRIVATE WORSHIP ALLOWED

> The authorities added that they will allow marriage solemnisations to take place in-person again, involving up to 10 persons.

> Places of worship can also reopen for private worship, they added. This will be limited to a maximum of five members of the same household praying together at any one time.

> “Families can continue to gather for wakes and funerals, with no more than 10 persons at any one time,” the authorities added.

> “Other non-essential activities and social gatherings will remain prohibited, as these will invariably bring together more people living in different households, undermining our efforts to keep our families safe,” they added.

> PRE-SCHOOLS TO GRADUALLY REOPEN, GRADUATING STUDENTS TO ATTEND SCHOOL DAILY

> Pre-schools will gradually reopen from Jun 2, so that young children can be cared for safely while their parents return to work, the authorities said.

> This will begin first with children from the kindergarten levels, followed by those in nursery levels, and finally, those in infant care or playgroup on Jun 10.

> In Phase One, students from graduating cohorts in the primary and secondary levels will also be allowed to return to school on weekdays, while other cohorts will rotate weekly, alternating between home-based learning (HBL) and returning to school for lessons.

> Junior Colleges and Millennia Institute will arrange to have half of their students back in school at any one time. Students in the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) whose terms are in session will be able to return to campus for practical and lab-based sessions, with lectures remaining online.

> Studentcare centres will also fully reopen on Jun 2, along with the reopening of schools.

> Co-curricular activities, enrichment activities and tuition however will not resume as “they encourage mingling across classes and schools”, the authorities said.

> SOME HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO RESUME

> Healthcare services such as specialist outpatient services, medical procedures, allied health services, community-based services, and chronic disease management will resume, prioritised by healthcare providers based on medical necessity and available capacity, the authorities said.

> Examples include surgeries for advanced cataracts, joint surgeries for patients with severe impairment, cancer screening and surveillance services including scopes for high-risk groups, ongoing dental procedures with guidance to minimise aerosol-generation, and diabetic foot screening.

> Preventive health services, such as flu vaccinations, will also recommence. Complementary healthcare services will resume for one-to-one sessions and by appointment, and traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture will be allowed for all conditions, they said.

> Providers will have to maintain appropriate safe distancing and precautionary measures, they said.

> Senior activity centres will gradually resume some activities in a safe and controlled manner, to address the psychosocial well-being of seniors with little or no social support.

> Community-based centre services for persons with disabilities will also gradually reopen to serve those who need the services, with safe distancing measures in place, MOH and MTI said.

> Activities, where needed, will be held in smaller groups, and persons who have medical conditions are encouraged to remain at home to receive home-based support, the authorities said.

This whole comments thread is a joke. What happened to all the people clamouring for a longer lockdown at the start? Reactive instead of proactive? This is what being proactive and trying to completely halt transmission with a slow and measured reopening looks like.,2020-05-20 00:23:45,reddit
Allowing places of worship makes zero sense. It’s not a necessity or even important for daily living in any way,2020-05-27 23:06:51,reddit
"I read the comments and I'm quite... sad.

I can agree with some of the commenters that some services, like full service hairdressing, do seem a bit questionable given their seeming non-necessity. Reasonable people can also disagree about whether grandparents should be allowed to see their grandchildren.

But allowing friends to meet up? Even for just two or three people at a time? I cannot agree with that.

Let us imagine if we allowed that, and let's assume I have the virus. Assume a R0 of 2, to make the math easy. I meet my 3 friends for lunch, two of whom will carry the virus because of me. Both of them, having been cooped up at home for a long time, want to go meet their other friends for dinner. They, and two of their own friends, then go on to meet other friends for a few days. All this time, they are asymptomatic and unlikely to be traced until I display symptoms. By then, how many people would have been infected despite the restriction on the number of friends at a gathering?

The community cases now are low *because* such meetings are not allowed. The low number of cases are not an excuse to allow such gatherings. Remember the Shincheonji cluster in South Korea? It only took *one* person to cause the megacluster to form. Sure, it would take longer to happen in our context, because we're not talking about huge church gatherings here. But the point is that you only need one person to start a new cluster, and allowing friends to meet up will accelerate that process.

We cannot confuse cause with effect. The low numbers now are an effect of the circuit breaker. The low numbers should not in themselves result in excessive loosening of the circuit breaker measures.

The implications of allowing friends to meet up are too much of a risk even at this point in time. The whole point of the mitigating measures at workplace and schools is to try to slow down the inevitable spread of the virus, and to contain it to close contacts at most. Allowing friends to meet completely thwarts those mitigations, and allows the virus to spread beyond these close contacts.

I don't support all of the details of the government's ""ending"" of the circuit breaker. But on this issue of meeting friends, I am firmly in support.",2020-05-20 00:42:17,reddit

Check out other countries' versions of ""exit"".
When they say exit, it's really exit, such as retail opening up in 2 weeks time, gym opens 1 week after retail etc....

They're trying to avoid an uproar and backlash that's all. And to make it less obvious it's actually extended CB, they allow minor lifting of some restrictions but for the most part, nothing much changes.

Circuit Breaker became Tightened Circuit Breaker and now it's Continued Circuit Breaker.

It is not so much the length of time spent, than the potential amount of communicating that might be done. Same for grandparents - I suspect the value judgement made is that grandparents are unlikely to go out and spread the virus to others. Whereas for SO or friends, not so much. The key policy principle appears to be to mitigate the spread of the virus to within close contacts/associates only, and no further.

"Exactly lmao, all of us understand that no one wants this covid thing to worsen. But clearly the govt is making pretty irrational decisions! How is resuming school even if at different levels, any safer than just a pair of couple alone at home? If you decide people are allowed to sit at a hair salon for 3-6 hrs, how is it not okay for pet and vet services to resume??! (Only basic pet services can resume) How?! And as many people have clearly said, aren’t elderly more susceptible to the virus, so how is allowing visits to elderly any better than allowing SOs? I understand that the elderly needs to be taken care of, but if so, why only allow now? Did they not need help these 2 months that has past? I mean I’m not a politician but this is basic logic. When they banned famous bubble tea shops, they allowed hawker bubble tea to resume. What’s the rationale, you’re simply thronging the crowd to these hawkers. All I can say is, there is major political agenda at play. I assure all of you if Election has been announced cancelled, you wouldn’t see a lot of these decisions made, but rather more thought through and logical ones. I stand firm with my proposition.
Edit: And also, clearly the govt doesn’t want the economy to collapse, otherwise a lockdown would have happened 2 months ago and none of this would have happened. But clearly none of this is helping the economy. Economic growth goes beyond GDP but HDI (Human Development Index). Just because everyone is employed and unemployment increases, doesn’t equate to higher productivity. And clearly a 2 month confinement at home isn’t helping that. The govt made so many mistakes and they just aren’t willing to admit to them and assess these mistakes and make better judgement. Yeah cue the supporters of PAP: MPs are working hard and tirelessly to make things better! Yea but are things really getting better? Community cases are suppose to be 0 by the third week.

Isn't it unfair that you acknowledge this, while painting elderly visits as ""seeing grandchildren"" like it's something frivolous?

If my parents were staying alone, I know I'd be worried for their mental health moreso than my hypothetical live-alone brother. This enables adult children to visit and check on them.

"Mean isnt reducing the amount of interactions between peoples a proactive move instead of a reactive one? They are opening up interactions stage by stage to manage the flow, isnt that a proactive move? I will wager that they are allowing seniors to get visitations first because they are not good with tech and have lesser means of communicating with others compared to young people. Besides I bet people will kpkb again using the exact same reactive vs proactive phrase if PAP allowed such visitations and a cluster formed from there. Prob somewhere along the lines of ""PAPPIES putting GDP over lives again so desperate to reopen economy allow people anyhow go others house. Now see la got cluster again 2 mths of CB for fark? Stupid out of touch PAP Reactive vs proactive again!""
Funny enough the last time that exact phrase was used it was used to criticize the PAP for not full on being strict and locking down SG Wuhan style in Feb and yet now its used to criticize the PAP for being too strict in its lockdown.

"You didn't say it, yes. It just felt like a contrast brushing off their seeing grandchildren only to later emphasize on how bad it is for people in WFH alone. If you didn't mean the contrast, then I retract my moot point.

I get the apparent contradiction. I'm just saying I find it a superficial contradiction in the sense that, going by that logic, must we keep them locked away for the longest time (compared to other groups), to not contradict ""keeping them safe""? Aggressively trying to keep community transmission low is in itself a way to keep them safe. Relaxing measures is already the acceptance of increased risk. If an elderly is to catch covid with the relaxed measures, I think they would rather it be because they had family visiting (the cautious ones could always choose not to), than because seemingly healthy young individuals were lepaking with beer and ended up forming a cluster that then spread widely because of their mobility, and reached their isolated doors.

Ultimately my main point was still: we can be unhappy that the social restriction is still on the rest of us, but why complain that it's now legal to have people visiting aged parents? It doesn't take away anything from you, even if it's contradictory. We gain nothing if they decide to not allow visits to elderly after all.",2020-05-20 04:24:22,reddit

Maybe because the numbers are smaller? It could be that there are more people wanting to meet their spouses compared to people visting the seniors. Besides seniors have lesser ways of communicating with loved ones compared to young people since many of them are hopeless with tech making them more prone to loneliness. Not to mention that seniors are in greater need of care from others compared to young people too. So judging by a needs basis it does makes more sense from their boomer persepctive to allow seniors to receive vistations when compared to young people since old people requires more help both physically and mentally whereas young people have more ways to communicate anyway.  The toxic mentality of if I don have it no one should have it that we have here is really very petty. When the decision can be rationalized as being made from a needs basis more than anything.

"@lawrencewongst Mr Wong, I respect you the most out of all the ministers who make up the Covid taskforce, and am generally assured with you heading the team. However  the key question to ask here is - does it make sense to virtually lockdown the entire country for extended number of weeks, when we have seen clearly that the average number of community cases is only from single digits to the high teens for awhile now? Singaporeans and businesses alike have been on the receiving end of the strict measures put in place, through entirely no fault of theirs. While the foreign worker dormitories oversight is unfortunate, trying to overcompensate for an earlier mistake with excessively draconian measures is not the way to go. The risk and reward trade-offs here are clearly unbalanced.",2020-05-15 07:42:57+00:00,instagram

"Sir lawrence, you have always have my respect throughout this covid fight, and i and my family has been in this fight by doing all that is required of us dutifully in order not to weigh on our healthcare frontline. We are appreciative and grateful for all the great decisions so far. However, i am indeed shocked that in the last few days your team has said to protect the most vulnerable group in nursing homes as they will not be able to survive well if the virus hits them. Why then is MOH allowing covid patients to be housed in Renci community where there is so many levels of vulnerable residents and also patients who need to come for weekly kidney dialysis? These group has bodies that cannot take a second round of strike against them. Could you be kind and just and not remove this post and instead look into this matter, and give it serious considerations if its a right decision, and if this contradicts the stand to protect the most vulnerable ones among us? They have family who loves them till their last breath. This last breath is already a vulnerable last one and one wrong move will not be a just a number, it will be shattered family hearts. We sincerely hope you will look into this. We understand bed crunches issues, but please underdtand us, we the family of the vulnerable residents, need to seek ur help to protect the most vulnerable ones. A 1% outbreak might become their 99% death. To house covid newr healthy ones is acceptable, to house near critically vulnerable ones is a decision that is not wise at all.",2020-05-09 12:33:33+00:00,instagram

"Dear Minister Wong, it’s a logistics nightmare and we appreciate the hard work. An area you task team might wanna look at are the home based salons offering beauty related services - many are still openly touting April promotions on IG. (one of the earliest patients of covid 19 in Singapore was a home based hairdresser). Perhaps a hotline could be set up so citizens can report non-compliance behavior? Also regulate one per household to do grocery shopping (same person always). Still a common sight to see couple with young kids in tow or couple behaving like they are on a date at the supermarkets. If it’s just one person - shopping would be done in a jiffy for sure. Got to put a tighter rein on some F/Bs. eg. Bubble tea outlets (essential??) which tend to attract crowds just hanging around while waiting for their drinks.",2020-04-12 12:59:00+00:00,instagram

May I make  humble suggestion to let HDB rents out all their empty old HDB rental blocks islanwide to the construction companies to house foreign migrant workers after COVID19 is over...? (After all, all these HDB rental blocks were more than 40 years old and a lot of them are empty blocks like in Tanglin Halt, Beo Crescent, Boon Lay, Bedok & etc...) This is coz we knew very well all the dormitories are super crowded with 10-12 persons in one room (without toilet and kitchen inside the room) and likewise we knew very well most dormitories are super unhygienic in Singapore despite there are dormitories caretakers, management and securities to check on the dormitories...?",2020-04-14 08:12:58+00:00,instagram

"******IMPORTANT REMINDER*****: 14 Day Quarantine for 19800 Foreign  Workers Not Enough. Many infected have no/mild symptoms. Do Read this CNA news link https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-singapore-couple-uk-ncid-mild-symptoms-12606966 : (QUOTE)""“There was no fever, no flu, no anything,” she said. “He only had a cough … a kind of cough once in a couple of hours. For me, when I had my flu, I couldn’t smell and taste, so I thought that was normal for somebody who had just recovered from the flu.”While serving her Stay Home Notice after returning from the UK, what was perplexing for the wife was that her sense of taste and smell still had not returned.“It was frustrating because my body felt well, but I just couldn’t smell and taste,” she said. “At that point our bodies felt perfectly fine, but we didn’t know there was a virus inside of us.""(UNQUOTE) Our taskforce cannot be ""too complacent"". 19800 foreign workers quarantined in 2 dorms ? It is similar to those quarantined in cruise ships. Study those cruise ships cases.  If these 19800 workers are released into the public after 14 Days Quarantine, there may be many ""silent virus carriers"". This would be potentially catastropic. Singapore 1 month ""circuit breaker"" would then be fruitless. Learn from South Korea. They are doing a lot of testing. Think they tested more than 200,000 church members after the church ""widespread explosion"". So, do test these 19800 foreign workers and many more other dorms clusters . Your Approach should be : Take No Chances. Spare No Efforts. And dont be ""too cost calculative"" if say costs is your main concern to test more than 20000 workers. You saved $millions in costs but touchwood, if Singapore exploded like Italy because of ""these costs savings"", Singpore stand to lose $billons in the ""prolonged collapse of Singapore economy"". And Singaporeans and local residents lives and health are worth $trillions if you want to calculate that way. I hope The Elections is not our Govt 1st priorities right now.

"Dear Minister Wong, thank you and the team for your hard work. I’d like to add if I may - that is to make mask wearing mandatory when we are out. This is crucial especially in enclosed setting like buses, trains. It should not be a choice, left to the people to decide since the govt stand is - wear one if you can’t avoid crowds. There will always be  a group of people who don’t or refuses to wear one for their own reasons. Wearing one is protecting OTHERS  from one’s droplets from coughing, sneezing, talking. We should all and rightfully so, be concerned at the rise of local unlinked cases and the asymptomatic carriers lurking amongst us. We can’t afford to have a tiny chance that some of these people could be asymptomatic and unknowingly be spreading the virus. Now that every resident will get a reusable mask, there is no reason not to mask up when out. I hope people will change the selfish mindset - cloth mask ≠ ineffective (against virus) therefore I won’t wear.  When Malaysia ends her lockdown we will see an influx of people coming in. Temperature scanning can not longer be trusted as a gauge to weed out the infected ones. We need everyone to wear a mask, on top of social distancing measures to further boost containment. Anyone not wearing one should be refused entry to Singapore. This rule should also be applied to trains and buses and crowded places. The seniors, and the sick are the most vulnerable group of people - we must all do what we can as citizens to protect them and to safeguard our healthcare system.

"While the circuit breaker is in place, we should also implement universal testing (a local lab has devised a 5min rest with a 95% accuracy rate) and round up all Covid infected persons to maximise the effectiveness of cutting off viral transmission within the community... then once the month is up, we should legally mandate (and strictly enforce) all noses and mouths to be covered in public (once u step outta your house for no matter how long and for no matter what purpose)... this will enable us to embrace both defensive (semi-lockdown) and offensive (testing) measures in tandem to combat Covid so we can resume a greater semblance of domestic economic normalcy as soon as possible... the living conditions of our FWs also need urgent and significant improvement bcoz we're only as strong as our weakest link, and right now the FW dorms are looking pretty dodgy...",2020-04-08 00:44:20+00:00,instagram

"Dear Minister, I give my suggestion here as you are the Minister co-chair for the Covid-19 taskforce. It also shows I trust your capabilities (though I strongly diagree with your HDB policy which does not align with our great Lee Kuan Yew's promise to common Singaporeans that HDB will be our main appeciative asset. Fact is : it is most Singaporeans ""main asset"". Imho, your policy only benefits the upper class who holds private properties assets) Straight to the point. My suggestion : our Govt next move to tackle the Covid-19 crisis is to have better, stricter guidelines and checks on our food industries and imported food products (from Epi Centers such as Italy, China, Korea) and especially Malaysia. NEA should level up on this. NEA should deploy checks on big large scale central kitchens in Singapore to peridically check on the production staff. E.g. a central bakery employing hundreds of production workers doing cakes production if they are not highly regulated , guided, checked to be safe, any infected food production worker may become ""a super spreader"" through food distribution, sales, consumption. Imagine an infected worker coughed on a cake, cake is then eaten by a few. Would  that spread virus? It is NEA job to enhance food safety assurance. Thank you. *note : I care  that's why I spent time to feedback and to give some suggestions.

"Dear Minister, thank you for your hard work as an active member of the Ministerial Task Force for the Covid-19 crisis. Appreciate that. Understand our Govt are taking some measures to curb foreigners knowing/suspecting they have Covid-19 but still intentionally ""dumped themselves into Singapore"" putting many locals (especially those working in airlines, airport, transportation and etc) at high exposure risks. Previously their main motivation in doing so was ""free medical"" Now MOH had changed this to charge them wef 7 Mar. But these infected Indonesians  are still coming and dump themselves into Singapore. Their motivation now? Perhaps is Singapore perceived world class healthcare. Perhaps is Indonesia counterpart ""simply do not care as much"" attitude. So are the Indonesian authorities enouraging the infected indonesians to come to Singapore for Covid-19 treatment? If so, it is easy job for them isnt it? Shift their responsibility to Singapore. Just look at this new case. Case 212: indonesian had pneumonia on Mar 9. Came to Singapore on Mar 13.

"Dear Minister, good afternoon and thank you for the hard work in the tackling of the Covid-19 crisis. My feedback and suggestion : What Malaysia did was the correct move ~ the lockdown. This will help them to do containment to avoid becoming the next Italy. And Singapore ? Honestly, I am worried. If our Govt is to do things 'a bit here, a bit there"", Singapore may become the next Italy ? Will Singapore only act aggressively when that scenario happens ? Why I am worried ? Simple reason : Indonesia. Quote CNA news : ""Indonesians seek to get tested for COVID-19 as tally rises; govt says unnecessary to test everyone"" click the link for the full (""very scary"") story.  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-oronavirus-covid-19-tests-unnecessary-everyone-govt-12551074 1. Indonesia have a huge population 2. Indonesia is just next door neighbor. They can easily access to Singapore by ferry via Batam, Bintan and by plane. 3. But CNA news shows that Indonesia Govt ""had failed in many areas"" in their fight against Covid-19. Many Indonesians expressed disappointment in their Govt efforts. So when they have no confidence, where do they go to ? Singapore. They cannot go to Malaysia right now (lockdown). So Singapore. Even without Malaysia lockdown, their 1st choice would be ? Singapore.  What does that mean ? Singapore is in high risk and danger of becoming the next Italy. Now we know China aggressive, decisive, extreme measures : the lockdown in Jan were necessary and the correct move. We can compare situations now. Europe vs China. China is doing a better job in the containment efforts. As for Singapore, schools are going to reopen on 23 Mar. Singapore are still ""open doors"" for business. SIA  will manage to get that few $ business. Efficient ? If planes are not flying at full capacities ? Indonesians will try all their best to get into Singapore for their Covid-19 testings and treatments as their Govt seems to ""have disappointed them"". This is very worrisome. Singapore may very well become the next Italy. Do we only act aggressively like China, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia when that (the next Italy) really happens ? @leehsienloong @ongyekung @ng.chee.meng",2020-03-19 08:38:37+00:00,instagram

Read : JAKARTA: Mr Fachri Muchtar developed a cough and had difficulty breathing after staying in a packed lodging in Jakarta’s Old Town for an event in early March.He visited a referral hospital for COVID-19 in Jakarta on Sunday (Mar 15) and was immediately taken to the emergency ward for a blood test and X-ray. The 21-year-old university student was then led to a decontamination room with five other people, who were all coughing.By evening, his test results came back and he was told that he was a COVID-19 suspect patient.“I was placed in another room with five other people. There were only three beds, so I had to sit in a wheelchair for the entire night.“I was only given a bed the next morning,” he told CNA. Mr Muchtar waited until the afternoon before he was tested for COVID-19. “A cotton bud-like device was inserted into my nose to take a sample of my mucus,” he explained.He was told to go home and self-quarantine before returning to the hospital again on Tuesday afternoon for the second swab test.Mr Muchtar was among the 1,592 people who were tested for COVID-19 in Indonesia as of Wednesday, according to statistics on the Health Ministry’s website.National spokesperson for COVID-19 Achmad Yurianto said on Tuesday that the government is equipped with 10,000 test kits.The number of laboratories to test COVID-19 will also be increased to at least 12 nationwide next week from the existing four, he added Just two weeks ago - when Indonesia reported its first COVID-19 cases - only one laboratory in Jakarta was allowed to conduct such tests for the entire country.As the number of cases rose - the current tally stood at 277 with 19 deaths - worried Indonesians showed up at the referral hospitals, hoping to get tested for COVID-19.Most have their symptoms checked and were turned away without taking the swab tests, leading to confusion and complaints ...(to be continued)",2020-03-19 08:49:23+00:00,instagram
"@leehsienloong @gankimyong @ongyekung @ng.chee.meng ...continued....Most have their symptoms checked and were turned away without taking the swab tests, leading to confusion and complaints among those who need to be assured that they are not infected with the coronavirus. However, Mr Yurianto, the government spokesperson, explained on Tuesday that not everyone can get swabbed for COVID-19, and only doctors can recommend if a patient should be tested. Many patients have expressed frustration that they did not qualify for COVID-19 testing.Their worries were compounded by a perceived lack of transparency surrounding coronavirus cases in Indonesia.Ms Karoline Sinaga, 30, went to a hospital on Mar 3 when she developed a mild fever following her return from South Korea, one of the countries badly hit by the pandemic, in late February.She was offered a “COVID-19 package” consisting of a chest X-ray and a blood test, but not the COVID-19 swab.“I asked why I didn’t get the swab test and they replied saying that the COVID-19 package only has these tests,” she told CNA. A health expert from think tank ThinkWell Global said that it is reasonable for the government and hospitals to only conduct swab tests on potentially positive COVID-19 patients.Mr Hasbullah Thabrany told CNA that it is inefficient to test everyone.“The cost is expensive, and it may cause people who have a high chance of having the disease to not being able to get tested,” he said, adding that this is about managing limited resources.Mr Yurianto, the government’s spokesman for COVID-19, has urged people to self-isolate at home if they only display mild symptoms. (Unquote)Means ? Many Indonesians (suspecting or knowing they have Covid-19) will try ""all their means and ways"" to try to get into Singapore for tests and/or treaments. And we know anything ""is possible or do-able in Indonesia"" Are their health declarations ""100% fool-proof"" ? My guess is : most will go to Batam to get into Singapore by ferries. If Singapore could not contain infected Indonesians influx and movements into Singapore, Singapore will become the next Italy. Note: pls take this feedback constructively.

"Dear Minister, good afternoon. Feedback : Why are Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as Macau faring better than other cities in tackling against the Covid-19 Crisis ? My guess : M A S K S . That's right. Almost everyone is encouraged to wear masks. So what happens when they do that ? Those who are infected or unaware they are affected covered themselves with masks thus reducing the risks of transmission. And those not infected also wear masks makes it a "" double protection "". We cannot adopt a ""self-deceiving"" concept that asking everyone to wear masks will not help as much simply because we do not have enough masks or could not produce our own masks. Wearing masks does help. If not, why 1 minister said if we run out of masks, medical staff may not work? It simply means masks help the medical staff to protect themselves against the Covid-19. Or wearing masks is better than not wearing any. So after so much talk, main point ? Main Point : we study Macau Hong Kong Taiwan and we can gauge that encouraging everyong to wear masks help in the containment. Our Govt next task ? Quickly assemble a large scale production line that can produce our own masks at about 5 mil units per day rate. Any excess we can sell, export or donate to other countries who want them. By doing so, Singapore may also create some jobs for those who will work at the masks factory.

What would happen to them? So the thing is nobody wanted this virus to start, not you,not me. Yes I understand that none of us like that this virus is on going,that many lifes have been impacted indirectly or directly in a way. I understand that this (may) have caused negative changes but everyone makes mistakes. Think back to the time you did something you regretted,what did you want? You didn't want it to even happen in the first place,you wanted people to understand and forgive you.This is basically the same situation China is in so I hope everyone is able to understand may not be immediately but gradually!

You, Chinese Government, let your people continue to travel the world, knowingly that there was a very serious virus issue. You, the Chinese Communist Government is responsible for the deaths and the economic chaos that followed all around the world.

"Thank You Mr Heng and your Team for keeping Spore safe and extending help to keep jobs and businesses. Opening up of pre-schools, perhaps should be reconsidered seriously. Reasons: 1. These very young children do not have exam pressure, 2. At this young age, they cannot take care of themselves by wearing face masks properly or keeping hygienic. 3. The teachers do not have the time to look into taking care of each kid. 4. Many grand parents, parents or helpers will congregate to fetch them to and fro. 5.Those children without pte pick up need the school buses to fetch them. Usually buses need an optimum passenger load. Also frequent disinfecting of buses and school areas cannot be guaranteed. 6. Many such young children are prone to flu, cough and fever during normal times, hence covid-19 is even more critical to keep them safe from crowds.",2020-05-19 13:52:00+00:00,instagram

Pre-Schoolers can be under later phases instead of rushing them for the 1st phase. The older kids that have exam pressure are old enough to follow certain safety measures.

"Mr Heng, my questions: 1. What if the whole family stayd together? Does this mean that in order to protect the grandparents, the younger family members should move out? 2. What if the grand parents are not old and fragilecas assumed but lead an active and healthy life and are relatively young and have been looking after the grand children while the parents are working? 3.  If the healthy grandparents actually stay next door or across the block like 3 mins walk,the grand kids are also not allowed to be with the grand parents? 4. If childcare centres are so safe, why do the pre-schools, all schools need to close? Mr Heng, it is good to apply CB but in this case, I think some form of flexibility should be allowed. Reason is now most parents have to work from home and very young kids are a big distraction. They affect the parents work negatively. Also assuming that all grandparents are old, frail and unhealthy is not altogether correct. Hope that certain form of flexibility be allowed. Who can be approached in MOH or govt officers when the appeal has to be carried out?",2020-04-10 03:39:02+00:00,instagram

"Dear PM, you have to consider the 3 phases carefully. More and more people are getting angrier and angrier with this recommendation from MOH. Listen to the ground too. There are 1-2 cases a day and if MOH decides to over react and destroy many businesses with these 3 phases, there will be even more unhappy people. There is a delicate balance between too much restrictions on businesses opening and fear of a resurgence. Resurgence may or may not be a way of life going forward but when you force extreme restrictions in businesses down people’s throats, you will create anger in people with too much time because there is no work in their hands. Think carefully about phase 3 spas industry which if implemented will destroy that industry. MOH inconsistent policy which failed to control the second wave and now their extreme over reacted policy is very obvious and one which must be thought through carefully",2020-05-20 20:09:11+00:00,instagram

"Dear Prime Minister, as I do not have Mr Chan Chun Sing instagram account , I will just feedback to you. Refers to CNA 10 pm TV news today 6 May 2020. (About Mr Chan CS , our local masks factory). You will notice the factory workers who touch, sort , pack the production line masks DID NOT WEAR ANY GLOVES at all. This is totally unacceptable (and shocking!) in my most honest opinion. I thought we Singapore should have ""higher standards"" than say Vietnam ? (I watched Vietnam news their mask factories the workers do wear gloves). If our local mask factories workers are infected with Covid-19 and they do not wear gloves to touch/sort/pack the masks, the consequences can be disastrous. Trust your wisdom and do advise our local mask factories to instruct their workers to wear gloves. Thank you.

One more comment is please allow shops that sell household items like shampoo, detergents  bathing soap or toothpaste n other toiletries to open.

"Singapore should not ease the measures. Other countries made this mistake and are potentially paying the price for it again. There is no vaccine yet and the measures are the ones keeping the virus under control. Example, HK, after 23 days of 0 cases suddenly popped up 2 local cases somehow.",2020-05-14 00:05:08+00:00,instagram
"whatever cases it is, it all happens in Singapore so actually they shouldn’t be letting 1June to be the last day. You shouldn’t separate local and foreigners amount to think that it is in low number. It all happens in singapore then singapore should handle it not just only caring for local or your stupid economics or eduction to bring face to this country. May19 some students will be going back to school, and until now the numbers are still between 600-800. Just because local cases are small, doesn’t mean you can allow this to be on going. Virus is not joke, it takes at least 1-2 years to actually slowly get back to normal. There’s no point rushing economic in such situation. 1 week 6 days after some students get back to school is 1June. Adults going back to work. Others getting out of their home altogether.

You can't even study or consult your teachers. Furthermore, with all the extra time on your hands how many of you will really stay home 24/7? u're gonna go running about void decks and shopping malls mixing and increasing your risk.What if schools were to remain open? Yes there is a risk u'll get infected but we're 2 months into this shit, how many of our students are infected? not even a quarter of our confirmed cases are students, if you were to practice social distancing and personal hygiene, head home immediately after school and stay home at all times, the risk lowers by a lot, you are able to prevent getting infected even if schools were to remain open, i'm pretty sure u're allowed to wear masks in school as well, so cmon little boys and girls, stop complaining for once",2020-03-24 12:39:55+00:00,instagram

"In the first case of its kind, a man has been convicted of providing unlawful carpooling services during the circuit breaker last year. Ng Chiang Huat, 54, was caught after he picked up two ""passengers"" who turned out to be Land Transport Authority (LTA) officers. Singapore had imposed the circuit breaker between April 7 and June 1 last year to curb the growing number of Covid-19 cases then. Ng on Monday (Feb 15) pleaded guilty to one count each of using his car as a public service vehicle without a proper licence to do so, and an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Ti-Ting and LTA prosecutor Ng Jun Kai stated in court documents that at the time of the offences, Ng was a sales representative for a wholesale trading firm. The Singaporean was also a member of the ""Covid-19 Lockdown SGHitch"" chat group on messaging platform Telegram. On April 23 last year, he posted a message in the group stating: ""Driver looking for pax."" DPP Lee said: ""A prospective passenger by the name of 'Decha' responded to the accused's post, and at about 9.56am, the accused accepted the carpooling request to ferry the said passenger from Block 430 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4 to Plaza Singapura for a fare of $12."" A man and a woman later boarded Ng's car at around 10.20am. Ng was transporting the pair to their destination when an LTA enforcement officer stopped the vehicle along Handy Road near the shopping mall about 25 minutes later. When questioned, Ng lied to the man, claiming that the pair were his relatives. The DPP added: ""(The officer) asked the accused for the names of the passengers. ""As the accused was unable to provide the exact names of the passengers, the accused then admitted... that the two passengers in his vehicle were not his relatives, and that he was ferrying them in exchange for a fare."" On Monday, the prosecutors urged the court to sentence Ng to at least a week's jail, a fine of $1,800 and disqualify him from driving for a year. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ircuit-breaker",2021-02-15 23:29:00,hardwarezone

"The circuit breaker period last year gave Mr Cuthbert Yeo, 29, more time to look into his finances, and the engineer decided to better utilise his Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts. He voluntarily refunded the amount he had used from his Ordinary Account for his share of the down payment on his Housing Board flat, and transferred money from his Ordinary Account, which has a base interest rate of 2.5 per cent per year, to his Special Account, which has a base interest rate of 4 per cent per year. He had started moving cash to his Special Account from 2018, after reading a CPF Board annual report where a chart showed that many people in his age group had more in CPF savings than he did. At the time, Mr Yeo was two years into his first job, also in the engineering field. He then started topping up his CPF Special Account whenever he received a bonus from his employer. Since then, he has put in about $40,000 in both cash and transfers from his Ordinary Account. ""We should really build up a base of retirement savings while we're still young, especially now that the job market is not as stable with innovative disruption and it's not guaranteed that we can get a job we might want when we're older,"" he said. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...nary%20Account .",2021-08-02 15:06:00,hardwarezone

He had started moving cash to his Special Account from 2018, after reading a CPF Board annual report where a chart showed that many people in his age group had more in CPF savings than he did. At the time, Mr Yeo was two years into his first job, also in the engineering field. He then started topping up his CPF Special Account whenever he received a bonus from his employer. Since then, he has put in about $40,000 in both cash and transfers from his Ordinary Account.

"""First, science. With the virus being around for several months now, there is a body of scientific evidence showing that COVID-19 does not affect the young very much as compared to adults. Parents will be familiar with this concept, as this is the case for other diseases such as chicken pox. Neither is there evidence to show that the young are vectors or spreaders of the virus. The reverse appears to be the case, where the young get infected by adults at home. This is the advice of Prof Dale Fisher, Group Director of Medicine at NUHS and Chair of the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. Indeed, for the small handful of our students (including those from Institutes of Higher Learning) who were infected, every single one caught it outside of their schools. In this context, it may not be a bad idea for our children to spend the bulk of their day in school, where lessons and activities are arranged such that they mingle only with their classmates, who are less susceptible to the virus than adults. They will be quite a resilient group. If we close schools, many will not stay home, but may run around in the community and mingle with a lot more people, exposing themselves to more risk.
