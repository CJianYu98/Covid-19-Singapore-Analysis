"> # Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine authorised for use in Singapore, first shipment expected around March

> SINGAPORE: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has granted interim authorisation for Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine to be used in Singapore for people aged 18 years and above, it announced on Wednesday (Feb 3).

> The vaccination regime submitted by Moderna requires two doses of the vaccine to be administered 28 days apart.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""HSA’s review of the available clinical data found that the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the known risks,"" said the agency in a press release.

> ""The vaccine demonstrated a high vaccine efficacy of 94 per cent.""

> The first shipment is expected to arrive around March, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

> Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is the second vaccine to be granted interim authorisation under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> As a precautionary measure, anyone with a history of anaphylaxis or severe or multiple allergies to medicines or food should not receive the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, said HSA.

> 

> Pregnant woman, severely immunocompromised people and those under the age of 18 should also not receive the vaccine as the safety and efficacy data for these groups are not available yet.

> ""Persons who develop anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine also should not receive the second dose,"" said HSA.

> Advertisement

> The authorities said it will actively review the data submitted by Moderna to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the known risks.

> When sufficient data is available for full registration, Moderna will be required to file an application to transit the status of the product from PSAR interim authorisation to full registration, said HSA.

> It may also terminate PSAR authorisation at any time; for example, if new data suggest that the benefits no longer outweigh the risks.

"Moderna and Pfizer are very transparent about their data & risks involved. They are willing to provide data to relevant authorities for approval in a particular country.

Sinovac on the other hand, has not been helpful in providing accurate data to fight off COVID. One example can be seen when they confused people with their efficacy of their vaccines and gave reasons like different countries like Indonesia and Brazil gave different two-dose regime (Thus, low % of efficacy compared to China's data). This is the result of a vaccine being rushed into public hands e.g. Sinovac. Without having a plan to provide an ideal two dose regiment timeframe (21 days for Pfizer, 28 for Moderna) from their experts, they publish data that contradicts each other which in turn, loses public confidence and more appropriately, Singaporeans are more wary of taking the Sinovac vaccine, creating much more vaccine hesitancy.",2021-02-03 17:00:54

"That number is not statistically significant, because only 4.3% of the study population were Asian.

They can pay more, but is the marginally faster speed worth the money? Especially when the money can go to helping the economy and the workforce?

He added that Professor Leo Yee Sin, who heads NCID, was among the first to roll up her sleeve for the vaccine.

"> # PM Lee Hsien Loong receives first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine

> SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Friday (Jan 8), becoming the first member of Singapore's Cabinet to take the COVID-19 vaccine.

> 

> Mr Lee received the jab along with Singapore General Hospital (SGH) staff at the official launch of vaccinations for healthcare workers.

> Public healthcare institutions, including hospitals and polyclinics, will start vaccinations for their staff on Friday. SGH estimated about 90 of its employees will get vaccinated on the first day.

> 

> The official roll out comes after a small-scale test run at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, where 40 employees received their jabs on Dec 30.

> Speaking to reporters at SGH, Mr Lee said he was happy to see the start of inoculations for healthcare and frontline workers.

> ""So I took the opportunity to have my own jab this morning and now I'm done – 30 minutes waited, nothing happened,"" he said.

> ""I've got my card, and the appointment to come back in three weeks' time. It's painless, it's effective. And it's important.""

>

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said earlier that plans for the Cabinet to get vaccinated in batches were in the works.

> 

> The Health Ministry’s Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak, who is part of the multi-ministry task force on COVID-19, also received his first dose of the vaccine on Friday.

> “My Cabinet colleagues and I, including the older ones, will be getting ourselves vaccinated early. This is to show you, especially seniors like me, that we believe the vaccines are safe,” Mr Lee said in a televised national address last month.

> The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was approved by Singapore late last year and the first shipment arrived on Dec 21. The vaccine requires two doses taken 21 days apart, and it will take up to 14 more days after the second dose to achieve maximum protection against the virus.

> 

> Vaccinations for the elderly and those at greater risk of severe COVID-19 will start in February, beginning with seniors aged 70 and above. Vaccinations will be free for all Singaporeans as well as long-term residents in Singapore.

> 

> After he received his jab on Friday, Mr Lee urged people to get inoculated when they can. He said there are ""ample vaccines coming in"" as Singapore ordered the vaccines early.

> ""It will make us safer, and it will make you and your loved ones safer. So please take it when you can,"" he said.

Pzifer and Moderna can only manufacture 800k doses per day. Only 6 companies are racing to make vaccines for 2021 and let's say if the other companies manufacture at the same rate of 800k per day. That's 1490 days (4 years) to vaccinate 90% of the population. If there're more companies in 2022 onwards, realistically it'll be 1-2 years faster.

I will take the vaccine as well, but I don't want a random one just given to me.

The gov is already pushing the responsibility to us. The reason it's optional is because they want people to be responsible for themselves when taking the vaccine. Anything happen is not the gov problem since they didn't force it on us. The gov will assumed you have done your own research to undergo this vaccination. That's why it's important every individuals should equip themselves with knowledge about different types of vaccines. So we're able to weigh the risks, pros and cons by themselves. At the very least, we should equip ourselves the knowledge of the difference between mRNA and weakened-inactivated virus cells vaccines.

> Having dozens of different vaccines available and asking ordinary people to choose which one they want to receive is irresponsible and reckless.

This isn't inherently dangerous, as long as you trust the authorities to have properly evaluated the candidates. People can already get flu shots of their choice by choosing the GP/clinic.

It's also very problematic if ppl end up downloading QR Scanning Apps that's bloated with ads or virus. QR scanning never took off in Singapore anyway, so ""enforcing"" it now is just kinda... backwards?

I was focusing on the QR scanning which is the deployment of ""SafeEntry Digital Check-In"" while neglecting that the existing NRIC Scanning for Supermarket is also called ""SafeEntry"".

"> # COVID-19: SafeEntry digital check-in system deployed to more than 16,000 venues

> SINGAPORE: The SafeEntry digital check-in system, which logs employees' and visitors' entry into businesses to facilitate contact tracing, has been deployed to more than 16,000 venues to date, said the Ministry of Health and Smart Nation and Digital Government Office in a joint release on Saturday (May 9).

> Developed by the Government Technology Agency, SafeEntry requires visitors to scan their identification card so that the system can record their arrival and departure times. The system reduces the manual effort needed by businesses to track visitor movements and eases crowds at entry points, according to the SafeEntry website.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> On May 2, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said businesses allowed to operate from May 12 as part of the Government's easing of COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"" measures would be required to use the SafeEntry app.

> ""As a start, deployment will be made mandatory for places where individuals are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods or in enclosed spaces, or where there is higher traffic,"" said the Government in Saturday's joint release.

> ""To date, SafeEntry has been deployed at more than 16,000 premises,"" the authorities said, adding that a list of the facilities where SafeEntry must be deployed from May 12 can be found on the SafeEntry website and will be updated as more activities and services resume.

> Among these venues are workplaces including offices and factories, schools, healthcare facilities, community care facilities, hairdressers, supermarkets, popular wet markets, malls and hotels.

> SafeEntry will also be progressively rolled out to taxis from May 12 to better support contact tracing for street-hail trips.

> Retail outlets such as convenience stores and pharmacies, as well as take-out F&B outlets, are not required but encouraged to use SafeEntry.

> ""Employees and visitors should check in and check out of workplaces and other venues using SafeEntry to help our contact tracers establish cluster links and transmission chains.

> ""It is important that everyone plays their part and uses SafeEntry, so that we can collectively prevent new clusters from forming,"" the release added.

"All iPhones already come with QR scanning functionality built into iOS. I am sure it’s the same for android. 

The main issue I see is that people will scan to enter (because what other choice do they have) but not scan when leaving because it’s too troublesome. Imagine I am leaving a supermarket with bags of groceries and I still to fumble around with my phone for this?",2020-05-10 13:11:44
"There is, but this implementation for SafeEntry goes beyond the supermarket entry. I'm not sure why people are focusing only on the Supermarket part then applying the same understanding to every other sector. Also, its not mentioned whether SafeEntry will replace/work alongside existing NRIC scanning for supermarket. Nonetheless, my point is not solely focused on supermarket.

I keep using norovirus as an example of a virus that is not airborne and is not spread by droplets that can spread so quickly. Norovirus (common stomach bug) has had the ability to infect an entire cruise ship in days and cripple the thing. Its solely through vomit particles on surfaces, or fecal matter on surfaces. It can live for up to 2 weeks there, and even after a person is no longer showing symptoms, they excrete the live virus via fecal matter for up to 2 weeks. Thats how that one spreads so fast.

According to that glossary, you could say they're nearly the same.  The way I use them (I'm not a health professional) is different.  Bathroom spray is an aerosol.  It's a fine mist in the air that eventually falls out of suspension.  It's not going to travel out a window and down the street.

"I'm pretty sure you are wrong.

Aerosols start out as tiny water droplets, they will dry in air in under 1 second and leave behind a sub micron husk of solid material which virus can stick to. These tiny solids, being so light can float in air for hours and can be easily carried by air movement. Almost anything you do, including breathing will release aerosol, but aerosol is particularly heavily released when doing things like intubation.

Large droplets like a spray or what people release when they cough are much larger and will land on the ground in several seconds due to gravity, they do not travel nearly as far and is not really considered ""airborne""",2020-02-28 05:36:09

SARS-CoV-2 is definitely spread by respiratory droplets, those are the big droplets hence the 6 ft thing. However at the time that diagram was made it was not yet suspected that SARS-CoV-2 could spread via aerosol, this is now very strongly suspected, at least in an ICU environment with intubation. Outside of that setting though aerosol transmission is not likely to be a serious danger with SARS-CoV-2.

18.     He reported onset of symptoms on 7 February and had sought treatment at two GP clinics on 7 February, 10 February and 11 February. He was admitted to NCID on 11 February and was immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 12 February morning.

19.     Prior to hospital admission, other than going to work at DBS Asia Central at Marina Bay Financial Centre (12 Marina Boulevard), he had stayed at his home at Mei Hwan Drive, except to seek medical treatment.

No links to other clusters, no recent travel to China.

Edit to add he does have a link to one of the new cases—now—case #55

>>14.     Case 55 is a 30 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 13 February morning, and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. **He is a family member of Case 50**.

(Case 55 gets diagnosed one day after his family member—might have been no to low symptoms—because— they don’t report him seeking medical attention like the others.)",2020-02-13 19:27:31

"Short answer: No.

Less-short answer: 

1. Singapore refuses to shutdown non-essential travel to, well, basically all other countries.  Assuming infections continue to occur in other countries (especially at a growing rate), Singapore is gauranteed to import more infections.

2. Singapore refuses to shutdown its schools, which may likely result in several huge, possibly uncontainable clusters.

3. Singapore is still encouraging people to physically leave home and visit clinics if/when they are ill.  Even a short amount of travel will increase infection vectors both for that individual as well as others, and may result in further infections.  Anything short of long-term, strict isolation will be ineffective.",2020-02-21 22:05:51

I wish every country released as detailed posts as Singapore. I think they have been the most transport and forthcoming by far.,2020-02-08 23:35:27
That's a lot of cases with no travel to China....,2020-02-08 23:43:51
"Definitely. Their reports are really comprehensive and well-organised. I think they've also been one of the most proactive at dealing with this - one of the first to implement travel bans, government issuing free masks, live map of cases and where those cases have been, official government WhatsApp channel. It's sad, yet also quite concerning that they're getting hit quite hard right now.",2020-02-08 23:46:18

"It's a total of 4 cases right now with no link. 2 of the cases which they couldn't find a link for are actually linked to the same church (Life Church and Missions). And 2 of the cases with no link are the cabbie and the private hire driver from today's new cases. The 2 other cases with no link are the initial patient with no link (41, Male) and the Junior college teacher.

I'm pretty sure as new cases come out, it will be easier to trace down the clusters for those without links. The government has been very thorough with the contact tracing thus far. I'd say it's plausible that the two drivers had driven an infected tourist or one of the previous cases; they can and probably will trace back all the transactions made.",2020-02-08 23:58:16
"I’ve gotta say. Living in Korea I’ve seen a good response from the korean government as well. Free masks at subway offices and free handsanitizer too. Expansion of testing facilities and clear explanations of what to do if you have symptoms. I’m not sure who’s following whose example but Korea’s been putting out the same type of reports following cases and their whereabouts from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization. Can’t say the same so far of American media, maybe it’s the fact that both are relatively small countries but Korea’s been on top of tracking and reporting the information. 

On the other hand Korea’s still not yet blocked flights from China and there are some other complaints about giving foreign tourists money for quarantine compensation. Korean people are heavily criticizing the government but overall I feel like the response has been organized.

"I do agree about the expanded testing. I suspect a lot of cases in other countries are also similar, in that they have never been to China and have symptoms, but the reason why we're seeing more cases in Singapore is due to how extensively traced each individual is and the fact that the country has the resources to really go ham on the testing. For instance, some of the other countries like Thailand where Chinese travellers still are not yet banned, doesn't have that many reported cases, but that's probably just cos some of the cases are not even tested.",2020-02-09 00:25:29

> The remaining case is the SIA cabin crew member who had not disembarked from the aircraft at the overseas destination. She developed symptoms a few days after returning to Singapore, said MOH.

> No locally transmitted cases were reported in the community or in foreign worker dormitories.

> BGC Group, which manages the deployment of some taggers, ushers and administrators at Changi Airport, will increase the frequency of temperature taking and disinfecting counters after an employee tested positive for COVID-19.

> The case involved a 43-year-old Singaporean man who works at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3. He was the sole community case reported on Sunday.

> His job involved issuing electronic monitoring devices to people who will be serving stay-home notice outside dedicated facilities. He also helped them put on the devices.

> While on duty, he wears a surgical mask, face shield and gloves, MOH said.

> BGC Group told CNA on Monday that the infection was detected during a routine, bi-weekly swab, and that he had tested negative in the prior round of testing.

> “BGC Group will continue to closely monitor the health of 12 negatively tested employees who have been in contact with our affected employee,” said the firm.

> “We are treating this unfortunate first incident very seriously and BGC Group will be increasing the frequency of temperature taking to a three-hourly reporting. Our frequency of disinfecting our counters will also be strictly stepped up so to ensure an even safer environment for all employees under our care.”

> Since the man's positive test on Feb 5, BGC Group has reviewed its healthcare and safety standard operating procedures and found “no breaches”.

> The man’s identified close contacts, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period.

> As of Tuesday, Singapore has reported a total of 59,732 COVID-19 cases and 29 fatalities from the disease.

"Let me share what MOH requirements are for aircrew. When a crew member returns home from a layover at a high risk destination, he has to undergo 7 days of self isolation. So what's Self Isolation? It is not quarantine, it is not SHN. It is basically staying home as much as possible, limiting going out to only for essential reasons. Also, said crew member has to do a Covid test on arrival at Terminal 3. He also does a covid test on day 3 and day 7.

Whether he was out and about, perhaps. But that is allowed for reasons I just mentioned. Also, senior crew members are tasked to make random calls to other crew members every day.

"Yes and no. Our migrant workers (\*in the construction sector, i.e. those being isolated at the moment) make up \~5% of our entire population. Herd immunity is only possible once 70-90% of the population has been infected. With our healthcare capacity, that would mean many more deaths if we rush this. Do remember that we have migrant workers who have died due to non-covid19 reasons (even though they were diagnosed with it). The more our healthcare capacity is stretched, the more people will die or suffer. We can't just keep looking at the covid-19 related death toll.

If the foreign workers remain isolated, it's likely that they'll achieve herd immunity within that population. We can't tell, conclusively, if someone can get covid-19 more than once.

Here's a good article that explains herd immunity well  [https://www.healthline.com/health/herd-immunity#natural-immunity](https://www.healthline.com/health/herd-immunity#natural-immunity)

"There’s not really any evidence that keeping businesses open and allowing the virus to spread is better for the economy than keeping everything closed until the virus is brought under control.

E.g. Sweden’s economy might not do any better than those of neighboring countries taking stronger measures against the virus:

In the US state of Georgia, businesses have started to reopen, but no one want to show up; e.g. even people who would otherwise be throwing axes under the influence of alcohol still think it’s too dangerous to go out:

&#x200B;

Countries that do ultimately succeed in containing the virus will be attractive destinations for people and businesses to move to (e.g. I live in the US and am strongly considering relocating somewhere). The other “Asian Tigers” of Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan are all doing a pretty good job, so it’s going to look bad for Singapore if it does not.",2020-05-13 05:24:13
"Between a rock and a hard place. I believe a lot of us wants to open up sooner rather than later and equally the opposite is true.

Both sides have their own reasonings and logic. And they both makes sense honestly. 

But, given how things are right now, there's a lot of unknown given what the virus can cause. Organ damage, blood issues, lung issues etc. These maybe for long term for some or not. I don't think there's a decisive information about the issues/dangers, who does it affect badly etc. 

I don't think the gov can be too careful in this case.",2020-05-13 13:21:45

"Not Singaporean but I hope you don't mind me chiming in. The wellbeing of most people are tied to the economy. Would you say you wouldn't be stressed out and uncertain about the future if you lost your job today and have no idea when you'll get another job? Now add an entire family to the mix, with multiple people you need to feed. This is going to add to the mental tolls of a lot of people. 

Moreover, we're already seeing a reversal of close to 20 decades of progress wrt to economic development. 1B people who we got out of abject poverty are about to re-enter poverty (there are defined levels for poverty if you were wondering). Not to mention the 130mm++ people who are now projected to be food insecure as a result of the lockdowns. 

Looking at this in a Singaporean context, Singapore is not big enough to sustain itself. My dad works in the O&G industry, and it is currently getting absolutely ravaged by lockdowns across the world. The O&G industry makes about 20% of Singapore's GDP. Now you have to understand that most industries are interconnected. If one fails, it'll drag down other industries along with it. For example, my bank is projecting a fair number of job listing portals to go bankrupt soon. Why? Lack of job postings. If the airline industry fails, it'll drag the entire hotel industry, car rental industry, tourism industry etc etc along with it.

Moreover, supply chains being ravaged is definitely not going to bode well for a tiny island that exports most of its food. 

This entire situation is not quite as simple as lives vs economy. We're on the verge of destroying the QOL for a large segment of the world population real soon for the next decade if things don't change. There is no script for a massive depression in this interconnected world. It's going to be real bad. Plus you gotta understand the the one thing that has prevented multiple countries from imploding or going to way with one another was money. Take that away and we're facing even more death and suffering.

There are fates worse than death. The best course would be to tell the old and vulnerable to quarantine and let the rest get on with their lives (especially given that fatality rates for those below 70 is 0.08% according to a Danish study and even lower for even younger people). 

I've said this before but we're in a very classic trolley problem. People are going to die either way. But the economic toll and the pandora's box it is going to open kill far more than the virus ever will.",2020-05-13 04:32:34

"I think right now we have a couple options. Both are shit, but one is less shit.

We take the hurt now, it could be protracted for months, but it’s controlled. We do the best we can WFH and with essential services operating. Economically, it’s hurting, lots of workers are not getting paid. They need support. People need help with the stress and anxiety of not being allowed out.

We rip the bandaid off and resume as normal. It’s great for the economy. But the hurt has to come later, the hurt comes later when healthcare services are overworked, people panic buy, refuse to leave; straight up don’t go to their work because the choose is stay home away from everyone else. Business fail because a majority of their workforce are sick. People won’t go outside where it’s a bloody pandemic going on that people are dying from.

Opening up too soon to help the economy causes a much larger problem down the line imo, you think this is bad enough? Consider the alternatives.",2020-05-13 00:33:59

That's the issue here, overwhelming healthcare will cause the regular ailments of today that is suppose to be fixed easily be more of an issue. Or worse death. Those are irreversible too. Healthcare systems can fall apart if covid runs wild. Govs don't just shut down economies without thinking it through.

It's not a simple problem of just economics and covid. There's way more at stake, which is why a controlled easing needs to be in place rather than a straightforward easing.

&#x200B;

First off, since you seem to have never done NS or is a foreigner, NS men goes through basic training, vocational training, operational readiness assessment and military exercises. All this takes up a good year or so of the NS life, after attaining operational readiness would be the guys on standby in times of war. By the time all that is over the unit is almost ready to ORD. Obviously since the training time has now been cut, our manpower 1.5 years from now would be compromised due to the delay training now. However assuming a delay of 3-4 months training, most of the recruits who had their training delayed today would still be operationally ready by that time. It's a crisis situation, a compromise of sorts is expected

&#x200B;

2ndly I already pointed out, everyone is being ravaged by the virus, even it if goes away over the next few months, our potential aggressors will still have to due with an impending recession. They won't have that kind of time, money and energy to deal with us

&#x200B;

3rd, there is good reason why we keep a huge reservist force and why we do ICT for so long. In the event where manpower is an issue, the reservist can be called up

&#x200B;

"The virus has started spreading :OOOOO

The latest confirmed infected individual had visited gardens by the bay, marina bay sands, and orchard, which are all VERY CROWDED places. I believe there are infected individuals walking among us whom Sg can't find by tracing because how will they know who visited all those three places at the same time???

It's a critical period for Singapore. Let's play our part by taking extra precautions and going to the hospital when you have a fever. PLEASE do not assume you just have a cold and infect more people.

For those who have managed to buy the masks, please do share with others who couldn't buy them cuz some stores went out of stock. Sharing is caring :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: The reason why I said it has started spreading since there are a few of you questioning it, it's just my belief. I'm not trying to scare anyone. This is just my personal opinion, you can choose to disregard it. For those interested, here are my reasons why:

The first man to have been confirmed to have the virus, in Singapore did probably get infected in Wuhan, but his son didn't show any symptoms until his dad was tested and after he was quarantined, which could mean that he got it from his dad after arriving in singapore(honestly this point doesn't matter). What it means is the fact that there is a possibility people could get infected from him despite him staying inside the hotel this entire time(possibly the hotel staff or the cleaning staff who came in contact with their room. What about the people at the airport? At that time, he didn't have any fever so he could have had a few interactions with other people?). But I doubt this will be an issue since they were isolated soon after.

And the fact that the third case, a lady from Wuhan didn't show any symptoms till arriving in Singapore means that most who could have been possibly infected could show symptoms at a much later time from the time they were in contact with an infected person(in her case, probably a day or two since she left Wuhan). This just means that there is a high possibility someone could have been infected during the time she was strolling around Singapore and wouldn't know about it till a week or so later when he/she start showing the symptoms.

The fact that Singapore has disclosed the whereabouts of all three cases since they had arrived in Singapore could also mean they haven't excluded the possibility of Singaporeans/travellers getting infected from these people at the places they have been to. They want us to be careful and be aware.

If you all just want to believe in statistics, go ahead. I trust in Sg stats since they are openly telling us a lot of things. But if you are like me, you would probably think, stats are only showing reported cases. What about the unreported cases?

**If you know of anyone who has a fever or has similar symptoms to the virus, please do advise them to check it out at the hospital/a nearby clinic. All it takes is one person's negligence.**",2020-01-24 16:11:27

> SINGAPORE: Two more people have tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases to three, the Ministry of Health announced on Friday (Jan 24).

> The new patients include the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case, MOH said in media briefing on Friday afternoon.

> Advertisement

> The second new confirmed case is a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on a Scoot flight at 5.30am on Jan 21, and developed a fever, cough and chills in the afternoon, said MOH.

> She sought medical attention at Raffles Hospital the next day and was later taken to the emergency department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was immediately isolated.

> MOH was notified of a suspect case at 3am on Jan 23. The woman subsequently tested positive for the virus at midnight.

> The woman stayed at J8 Hotel and visited Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay, MOH said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> She is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and is in a stable condition.

> There have been a total of 44 suspect cases in Singapore; the patients are aged between 1 and 78 years old. Thirteen of them have tested negative.

> The latest update comes after Singapore announced on Thursday its first confirmed case, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Jan 20.

> He is in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and in a stable condition, authorities said.

> Contact tracing has been initiated to identify about 30 people seated near the man during his flight to Singapore. His nine travel companions have also been identified. One of them was his 37-year-old son, who is now confirmed as having the virus. The other eight have left Singapore.

> The man stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa and indicated that he kept within the hotel vicinity.

> The news of Singapore's first confirmed case came a day after Health Minister Gan Kim Yong announced the formation of a multi-ministerial task force to deal with the situation.

> Authorities also announced on Thursday that border screening will be expanded to all land and sea checkpoints, while a travel advisory has been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located.

> Earlier on Thursday, schools in Singapore sent out a notice to parents asking that they declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend beginning on Friday.

> Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines' budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan as a precautionary measure.

> Singapore businesses with a presence in Wuhan have also taken measures. ST Engineering, which has rail projects in Wuhan, has stopped all business commutes there.

> On Friday, China reported that the number of people infected by the SARS-like virus had exceeded 800, with 25 deaths.

> The National Health Commission said authorities were also examining 1,072 suspected cases of the virus that first emerged in central city of Wuhan.

> The markedly higher numbers were released just hours after the World Health Organization called the outbreak ""an emergency in China"", but stopped short of declaring the situation a global health emergency.

> China has effectively quarantined more than 20 million people across Wuhan and some nearby cities in response to the virus, and announced measures to curb its spread nationwide as hundreds of millions of people began travelling across the country this week for the Chinese New Year holiday.

> Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan, a major industrial and transport hub, are now eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the city of 11 million, where most of the cases have been identified.

> The virus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. That market has since been shut down.

> The virus has spread to Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, as well as provinces in northeastern, central and southern China.

> Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

> “She is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and her condition is stable,” MOH said.

> The Chinese national was “asymptomatic” during her flight to Singapore, MOH said, adding that she later developed symptoms on Jan 24 and taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Jan 26.

> “She was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated at NCID,” MOH said.

> “Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 27.

> “She has no known links to the other confirmed imported cases.”

> MOH said on Monday at noon, 62 of the suspect cases tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and four tested positive. The fifth case involving the 56 year-old female was confirmed at 2pm.

> Test results for the remaining 57 cases are pending, the health authority said.

> As of Monday at 12pm, MOH identified 115 close contacts from the first four confirmed cases. Of the 86 who are still in Singapore, 75 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated.

> The authority added efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 11 close contacts.

> “Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts,” MOH explained.

> “As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient.

> “In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.”

> The deadly virus has killed 81 people in China so far, with more than 2,700 confirmed cases.

> Earlier on Monday, a newly formed multi-ministry task force announced Singapore will have a new set of stringent measures in an effort to contain the Wuhan coronavirus. These measures include enhanced temperature screening and leave of absence for some.

The scary part is that 5 million of them left Wuhan before the lockdown, and they might be coming to Singapore from elsewhere and there's nothing we're going to really do about it short of monitoring their temperatures @ arrival...

> Banning visitors is pretty much a middle finger to China, and for a country of our size we really can’t afford to do that.

I really don't get this sentiment eh. China itself has been willing to lockdown entire cities to prevent the virus from spreading. Why would they be offended by us parroting the CCP's behaviour? 

So many Asian countries are doing this, if Carrie Lam is willing to do it for even Hong Kong, of all places, surely that means most of these governments do not perceive border-shutting as something that might incite CCP wrath?

> Prof Mak noted that there are a number of other patients who have the virus but are well, including at least three who are not showing any symptoms. Many continue to make good progress, he added.

> Two of the patients without symptoms were among the six new confirmed cases announced yesterday. There were 24 confirmed cases in Singapore as of last night.

Are these anti-viral drugs the only way to ‘cure’ the virus? Can our immune systems ‘fight’ out the virus without taking these drugs?,2020-02-05 08:39:13

2) Yes if it's working",2020-02-05 08:59:42
"We could but a longer time may be needed as the antibodies in your immune system fights it. To shorten the time, some help may be needed, hence the anti-viral drugs. 

I am guessing that those having the anti-viral drugs are ones with weaker immune systems and they aren't fighting it off. Mind you, most who died had pre-existing conditions after all.",2020-02-05 14:23:54
"The key is to prevent the virus from entering the cells and thus multiplying in the body by replicating itself. The HIV drug is one of the most effective and widely available ""receptor blockers"" to achieve this.

"Edit: Title of article has been modified by the author; it is now “Benefits of mask use by healthy people topic of debate in Singapore”

—-

SINGAPORE - In an ""utopian situation"" with an infinite supply of masks, everyone wearing one regardless of their health status will help contain the coronavirus swiftly.

But as this is not possible, and given the Covid-19 outbreak is a ""marathon"", healthy people under the age of 60 should not wear masks on a daily basis, infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam told The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 1).

The day before,The New York Times reported that the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was reviewing its guidelines on who should wear masks.


On Monday, Austria made the wearing of masks in supermarkets mandatory in a bid to stem the spread of the virus. The Czech Republic went a step further, making mask-wearing mandatory outside of the house.

Readers had also written in to ST asking that people be advised to wear masks despite not showing symptoms.

At a media conference on Tuesday, the Health Ministry's (MOH) Director of Medical Services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said the ministry was looking at evidence ""very carefully"" and conducting a review of its stance on masks, as it does with its other policies.

""As far as masks are concerned, we are in fact in the process of continuing to review the data that's available, both in the literature as well as the international experience,"" he said.


He added that recommendations would be made after the review is completed.

Dr Leong, who practices at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said on Wednesday the need for everybody to wear a mask regardless of their health might eventually be a requirement if Singapore is unable to control the spread of the virus here.

But, he noted, masks are still in short supply around the world.

"" I think it's a moot point to get people to wear masks when they're still in scarcity. It's like telling the poor, the way to get out of poverty is to get more money - but I don't tell you how to get that money,"" he said.

""The mask situation has improved, but we're not seeing endless supplies of masks. If all of us had to mask up today for one week, we might finish all our stock of masks immediately.

""The real science of it is, if everyone maintains their 2m distance, watches their hand hygiene, doesn't go out when they're sick, then we may not even need the mask. By keeping 2m away, I would have done what the mask can do,"" he added.


Those older than 60 can use a mask when they go outdoors as they are more vulnerable, he said, adding that they also have to bear in mind the need to conserve their own supply of masks as the outbreak may last for another six to nine months.

Infectious diseases expert Paul Tambyah from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine said at the moment, data on mask use is not entirely clear.

He noted that new data suggests the receptor for the virus which causes the Covid-19 disease, may be present in the nose and not just in the lungs.

""If this is confirmed, then (using) something which covers our noses may turn out to be important,"" he said, adding that more information would likely be available in a week or so.

Dr Wong Tien Hua, family physician at Mutual Healthcare Medical Clinic, said there is a need for ""situational usage"" of masks at the moment.

""On the bus, on the MRT... when you're queuing up or in a crowded place, wearing a mask is the smart thing to do,"" he said.

He noted, however, that Singapore has taken a multi-pronged approach to fight the virus, including using social distancing measures and closing down entertainment outlets.

""If you tell everybody to wear masks, it's kind of missing the point, because we have other measures,"" he said.

Another family physician, Dr Leong Choong Kit of Mission Medical Clinic, felt that getting everyone to a mask up might backfire.

""If mass wearing of masks is advised, the cost of masks will rise again and the public will buy them from unreliable sources. If they are of dubious quality, they will not serve their function. So it will end up as a futile attempt to control the virus,"" he said.

There is no need for a blanket call to mask up unless there is more community spread here, he added.

A growing number of people online had also called for people to make their own face masks from improvised materials.

Dr Leong Hoe Nam noted that cloth masks have proven to be less effective than proper surgical masks. However, he added: ""But I believe it confers some advantage rather than none, so if I couldn't get a decent surgical mask, I'd use at least a cloth mask.""

Dr Wong said: ""Wearing any kind of barrier is better than no barrier, especially for those who are talking or sneezing.""

But Prof Tambyah and Dr Leong Choong Kit disagree.

""Wearing an ineffective mask is far worse than not wearing one,"" said Dr Leong.

""If I do not have a mask at all, I will consciously avoid certain places, but i f I were to wear one, I may be less conscious and put myself at risk.""

Prof Tambyah said very few studies had tested different types of masks in clinical settings, and he did not know of any that involved patients coughing or sneezing.

""I don't think we should be specifically encouraging people to make their own masks, until there is good objective data on how effective such masks are under clinical conditions,"" he added.

No data exist yet that suggest asymptomatic transmission should be a concern, said the infectious disease experts.

Prof Tambyah said that while epidemiological data may suggest that people could be infectious the day before their onset of symptoms, more detailed molecular evidence had not yet been publicised on these cases.

Dr Leong Hoe Nam said that while asymptomatic cases of transmission may exist, they play a ""very, very small"" role in the transmission of the virus.

""If the epidemic were driven by many asymptomatic transmitters, the Chinese authorities wouldn't have been able to control it so quickly,"" he added.",2020-04-01 20:54:31

"For those worrying about the safety, here's the Pfizer press-release,

>To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination.

And here's the Moderna one:

>The interim analysis included a concurrent review of the available Phase 3 COVE study safety data by the DSMB, which did not report any significant safety concerns. A review of solicited adverse events indicated that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Grade 3 (severe) events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first dose included injection site pain (2.7%), and after the second dose included fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), headache (4.5%), pain (4.1%) and erythema/redness at the injection site (2.0%). These solicited adverse events were generally short-lived. These data are subject to change based on ongoing analysis of further Phase 3 COVE study data and final analysis.

You usually expect any safety signals to manifest themselves with 7-21 days from the last dose received and from a safety perspective, they appear to be well tolerated.

The only thing time will tell is how long the efficacy lasts. The effectiveness of most vaccines wane over a period of time and that is where, in my opinion, data is lacking.",2020-12-04 16:33:00

"I'm not a HCW, or working on the frontlines.

I am still on the fence because there are so many conflicting information that I am picking up all over.

Given that both Pfizer & Moderna are mRNA-based vaccines and their phase 3 results / data are released at about the same time with similar effectiveness, it gave me a bit more confidence initially.

However I am really a bit alarmed with how UK managed to approve the Pfizer one so quickly. Am interested to see how they roll it out starting from next week, if what they claim is true. And how they botched their response (have some colleagues in the UK) plus the errors with initial results and data from AstraZeneca undermines confidence in them recently.

I sure hope that other countries that do not have the virus under control are now not under pressure (especially looking at USA) to quickly approve vaccines without going through all the necessary processes.

Locally, virus situation considered calm (and I hope it remains that way for a long time), HSA will not be under pressure to confirm quickly. I do think the review will be done thoroughly and let's see what details are released finally.",2020-12-04 14:44:15
"Not in a rush. Don't see the need to rush for it honestly.

Singapore has handled the situation well after initial blunders. Let the world show if the vaccine is effective and whether it's the silver bullet to solve the crisis.

I fail to see what benefits I get out of it unless I'm working in a healthcare front-line job.

I see people online (not specifically here) commenting about how desperate they are for the vaccine so they can travel. That kind of reasoning just irks me. Even once vaccine rolls out, it will take months to a year before we can assess if the virus is under control.

I'm sure Singaporeans can wait a bit longer and let the countries STRUGGLING to get the vaccine first. Our single digit cases does not warrant a rush for vaccines.",2020-12-04 20:28:00
"Honestly I'll wait for a few months or so first, ok idk if I'll get flamed but I feel that as compared to the development of other vaccines I feel like this one is relatively more rushed hence if there were to be additional side effects, it may not be visible till say maybe a year later for example? I myself have a weaker immune system though I should be considered young and healthy for my age group, but because of this I'll wait and seek a doctor's opinion first. 
I know how vaccines are tested, manufactured and all and that there's volunteers who go to take the jab and they're fine, but with cases such as dengvaxia in Philippines for example, I guess this is why people are quite concerned about the potential effects hence they aren't willing to go for the jab. ( it's really not about anti vaxxers or what, everybody's body is made different and there are also health conditions that people may have which may induce even worse side effects hence they may have to rely on herd immunity) 
With that being said I acknowledge such incidences are like minority, most vaccines are quite safe and I would very much rather have people who are at higher risk of infection such as health-care workers and the elderly have the injection (of course, subjected to MOH's advisory too). In the meantime I just hope people keep it up with the proper hygiene thing, mask wearing, safe distancing and all, not everyone can be vaccinated and it can take quite some time for herd immunity to take effect too 🙏",2020-12-04 17:15:12
"I will take it when there is a real benefit to doing so. Only when there are specific restrictions lifted for those who are vaccinated, such as travel or access to specific events I’d be interested in, would I justify the need to get it. 

No point injecting myself with something that doesn’t then allow me some form of additional freedoms as a result.",2020-12-04 18:07:56
Wait for the UK and US people to try it first and see whether there are any side effects. The testing process feels a bit rushed and i am quite wary,2020-12-04 15:45:41
"Given how fast the development is and how every company is trying to rush their product on the market, I personally would wait.

Example, Pfizer claims they have 90% effectiveness then Moderna claims 95 effectiveness. Pfizer than claims 95 % effectiveness. All this in a span of 1 \~2 weeks.

Now both pressuring the FDA to give emergency approval and looking how serious its in US, I think the FDA might not be able to evaluate both vaccines seriously.",2020-12-04 14:49:23

Then it will be opt-in, free for Pioneer, then Merdeka, and at cost including distribution, or a slight markup, for those of that age group. There will be no further prioritising of age group other than pioneer.

I do prototype testing, and I always release preliminary results immediately after the test to my supplier, my design team, my project team and production team. This is so that everyone can effect their plans immediately. The proper and presentable are only released later which takes a few weeks after the test. Production is not going to wait 2 weeks for me to get my report ready when the completion timeline is tight.


Unless the results are marginal, then I will hold back everything and study the results in depth. What is the difference between 90 or 95? The expected rate for vaccine is 60% for a typical flu vaccine. 


Do note, the whole logistic chain to transport the vaccine needs as much a headstart as possible. 2 weeks is a long time when people are dying everyday.

Firstly, there is no such thing as a perfect vaccine or a perfect drug. There will always be side effects and people  that will be allergic to or not responsive to it. One of the worlds most common drug - Paracetamol (Panadol) has an efficacy rate of 97%. Are you going to stop taking it? The decision to take them are often weighed by side effects against benefits. The side effects at the moment seem to be pretty manageable.

Even if there is a ""perfect"" drug, no one in science will come out claim that it is because that is no such thing as 100% in science. Are you even in healthcare or pharm? Your claim of Pfizer marketing ploy 90%-95% also falls flat because of you don't understand the matric that determines the results. Numbers in this are tied heavily to the number of individual tested. When they released the 90% efficacy rates, testing was probably on-going because you cannot immediately determine the 43000 individuals results at the same time.

Moderna and Pfizer Vaccines require -20 and -70 degree storage temperatures which need a lot of specialised equipment that only larger institutions have.

So going by reasoning: It would be more practical for GPs to stock SinoVac's CoronaVac, cos of the reduced likelihood of Vaccines going bad and not needing new equipment.

It is believed that the mechanism was due to antibody dependent enhancement, or an overly exuberant immune reaction to the dengue virus if u will.

Mrna vaccines don't have that tried and tested safety record unlike inactivated virus vaccines.

"Mechanically speaking, mRNA vaccines seem very safe.

Ideally, they prefer specific immune cells, make virus proteins using the host cell machinery using a natural and quickly degraded information carrying molecule.

mRNA cannot integrate into the DNA, neither can it propagate itself. All it can do is tell your protein making machinary to make proteins based on the information encoded on it. The carriers of these mRNA are not viral particles, but rather bubbles of fat molecules, and I read some paper somewhere that says it can be designed to concentrate on the lymphatic system (important in generating immune response).

There’s no chance for the virus to reactivate itself, which is rare but not impossible for weakened virus vaccines, since there is no virus involved. There’s no risk of finding small amounts of intact virus like in inactivated vaccines with poor quality control, because there is no virus involved. Unlike a weakened virus vaccine, the mRNA fat bubbles aren’t going to go into the usual tissues or organs that the virus targets and risk provoking unwanted immune reactions there, since it contains no virus specfic proteins or receptors on the bubble, the proteins that help to direct the virus to its target, because once again, *no virus involved*.

It is synthetic. It’s not harvested using virus particles.

However, its not entirely without risk. One risk I came across was that apparently some COVID viral protein resembles the body’s own proteins, and in some severe covid cases, the body overreacted and was tricked into targeting friendly cells. If the mRNA vaccine manufacturer chose the right protein target, then this is unlikely. Also, if they unluckily chose that allegedly troublesome protein, you would have seen much more cases of severe effects as compared to placebo in trials. If they get it right, you won’t ever come across that unlucky protein. In comparison, you can’t guarantee that in vaccines using destroyed virus fragments or weakened versions of it, because one can be that unlucky.

Some drugs can cause long term side effects because you take it long term and it targets a certain important function in the body, which may be important in some way that wasn’t predicted. But the Pfizer one which we have right now does not do that. It doesn’t target any cellular function and it is unlikely to do so, and the most likely consequences are immune related ones. And as mentioned earlier, the mechanism of this type of vaccine would have made it more preferable than other traditional types of vaccine.

I don’t know you, but I would take those mRNA ones over those weakened or dead virus vaccines.",2020-12-23 17:10:57

"Long term side effects usually comes from long term use of a medication. It happens because the way modern medicine works. 

The body has lots of natural processes going on. Some of this processes, when out of “balance”, can lead to disease. Drugs target aspects of such biological processes to bring it back to “balance”, sometimes by blocking it, sometimes by enhancing it. 

Drugs are *small* molecules. The body doesn’t care about the atoms making up the molecule, the body cares about the *shape*. These specially designed drug molecules go into the protein (or other molecules) and do its “magic”, affecting the natural biological processes and bring it into balance.

One problem with this is that the body sometimes likes to reuse the same protein (or family of similar proteins) in different places to control different processes. A drug may unintentionally affect an otherwise unintended process(es) and cause long term unforseen problems.

Another problem is that a drug can target some completely unexpected target. As I said earlier, the shape is important. While a drug can be designed to fit a certain protein, there is chance that by coincidence, it can also hit some unrelated protein elsewhere and affect other processes and cause problems in the long term.

Also, ultimately, all drugs are poison and the only thing that differentiate medicine from poison is the dosage. Too much of an effect can be bad. There are drugs that can cause damage to organs at higher dosages, for example. 

Sometimes, the drug molecule itself can be chemically reactive, and can cause damage. Keep using it and you get long term damage. Rarely, if such chemically reactive drug damage the DNA enough over the years, people can even get cancer. Fortunately, people know some of the common reactive features and avoid those.

To complicate things, the body tends to do things to a drug molecule to make it easier to get rid of it. That thing can be inherently toxic (such as one of paracetamol/panadol’s metabolite), or it can have effects of its own.

There are a lot of ways for a drug to cause long term problems and side effects. However, does this mean mRNA vaccines can do so too? There are differences between mRNA and drug molecules and that makes things different.

Ultimately, mRNA is a naturally occuring information carrying molecule. You have it in your body and it comes in many different lengths. The mRNA in the vaccine is not going to be any more reactive than those you already have!

Compared to drug molecules, mRNA are huge. Things bind to sites on the mRNA, not really the other way around. It’s not very likely to trigger things you wouldn’t expect a normal mRNA to trigger.

Inherently, mRNA are not toxic, so that is one safe part.

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the viral product it encode for can target unwanted processes and cause effects, it isn’t something very likely. Given that mRNA is not very stable, it doesn’t stay for long and you are only exposed to the amounts injected. Even if the product is not harmless, it is transient and shouldn’t cause too much of an effect, and unlikely to cause a long-term one. Your body can take a bit of damage. You go out under the sun? Damage. Eat or touch stuff too hot? Damage. Etc etc.

It would be *far worse* to get the real deal, since the actual virus can replicate and make much much more potentially harmful viral proteins that a mRNA vaccine can cause your body to produce, on top of other problems associated with the actual covid virus.

To be honest, the most likely reactions are immune related ones and those most side effects are short term and not likely to be very harmful.

If you react very negatively to the mRNA in the vaccine and the protein it produces, I don’t think you would fare any better with the real virus.

The chances of the vaccine working as intended safely is high, probably better odds with that then the odds between mild and serious covid.",2020-12-24 01:41:54
"The answer is long term adverse effects are certainly possible. If you want certainty, then its certain that the risk is not zero. 

Did you know that the diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccine, which is compulsory in Singapore, is known to pose a long term adverse effect which includes long term seizures and permanent brain damage? Very very bad, yet we still take it.

"Your source is completely misinterpreted. Perhaps your UOU (or UOY) lecturer never teach you enough.

It talks about the RNA world, which is about evolution of life before DNA existed, hypothetically many billions of years ago. An RNA world must no doubt contain specialised proteins/RNA-based molecules to copy and make more of the RNA, make proteins out of it, etc. However, those genes and their associated proteins/special RNA molecules would have long been gone, since it no longer has a use in the DNA world.

Without the machinery to do so, your body cannot turn mRNA in the vaccine to viable hereditary information carrying molecules. And the vaccine *will not* contain any instruction to do so either.

>	The cells of the RNA world would presumably have been much less complex and less efficient in reproducing themselves than even the simplest present-day cells, since catalysis by RNA molecules is less efficient than that by proteins. They would have consisted of little more than a simple membrane enclosing a set of self-replicating molecules and a few other components required to provide the materials and energy for their replication.

DNA and RNA can only direct the cell machinery to do what the information on it tells them to. Even if you put an ancient RNA genome in the body and somehow give it all the cellular machinery to get it working, all you are going to get is what’s on that genome, and as the source had said, its just some simple lifeform that’s nothing like a fucking human cell. It’s not even comparable to a bacteria, and bacteria can be considered less complex!

Furthermore, you aren’t putting that information into the mRNA vaccine. *No one placed the sequence of nucleotides for an ancient RNA lifeform into a vaccine.* It’s not even a full viral genome in it!

No one placed the code for this completely hypothetical RNA baby into the vaccine. No one placed the code to give the body the ability to turn DNA into RNA.

Furthermore, RNA is inherently less stable than DNA, even in a similar double-helix form. It is fragile in single-stranded form. While possible to carry information in some RNA double-helix, its fragility meant that it requires upkeep and maintenance to repair it, just like DNA. *Unlike DNA*, you don’t have those specialised RNA repairing molecules lying around, because the vaccine doesn’t contain it and we don’t have it in our body because we don’t need it.

It ultimately boils down to personal choice and agency. After all, no one likes to be told what to do. People may feel more comfortable with inoculation if they have a say on when they get vaccinated and which vaccine they take.

I'm hopeful things will change over the coming months.

"Covid 19 no long term side effects? On the contrary, the long term side effects are clear at a personal and country level. Even if you are young and at a lower personal risk, you could still cause asymptomatic spread to your family, colleagues, etc. 

Then there is the side effect on society and the economy. The pandemic continuing until 2022 or whoever enough people are infected or vaccinated to achieve herd immunity is going to prolong the economic pain. I wouldn't expect the government to keep the stimulus taps open for another 2-3 years. 

The concerns about ""long-term risk"" do not factor these big picture considerations. Its not only about your personal risk. To have a full understanding of long-term risk requires a long term study. So ultimately its a risk tradeoff. Do I accept an unknown long-term risk, but one which isn't significant to the best of our knowledge, or should I be kiasee and wait for others to do first, so that they can do their part towards singapore achieving herd immunity.

Second, because everything is randomised, we also don’t know whether we have a better chance of resisting the virus. Should that matter at all? If you believe that Sinovac is only 50-75% effective, should people who get Sinovac be treated the same as those who got the other 2?",2021-01-13 11:05:57

mRNA vaccines merely turn your cells into factories to produce the spike protein (or the cell breaching mechanism) for your immune system to defend against which is what the virus would have done (+ viral material) if you were infected anyway. There is zero risk of infection with the virus you are supposed to be inoculated against with mRNA vaccines while it is a non-zero chance with inactivated virus vaccines.

"This, IMO a very important point to bring up. Previous roll-outs are much slower because not the whole world is affected by a pandemic and there is no lack of finances and brains this time round.

Many things are also moving in parallel instead of one after another.

A valid concern are the long term side effects, which is impossible to know because all the vaccines have just been developed. And there is no way around this besides continued studies & observations.

However weighing the pros and cons, the long term effects of the virus are also unknown, and there are many reports of long Covid.

If both are also unknown, I would think the potential side effects are less serious (looking at the \~30m people who have gotten the vaccine, obviously it's short-term details we can get for now) than actually catching the virus.

"Medical professionals does not equal to virology experts or vaccine experts. Doctors get their information from scientist and other experts. 

The data is as sufficient as possible because they tested on a larger group of people. The reason they cut short the testing is because it became a matter of ethics to let the control group not have the vaccine during this pandemic as the control group was slowly increasing with the amount of infected people. 

Other type of vaccines has small pool of data hence they took longer. 

Phase 1 of the vaccine was to prove that it is safe. Phase 2 is to prove that it is effective in protecting against the virus. Phase 3 is to see that the virus has no long term side effects. As it is an emergency phase 3 cannot be completed. But phase 1 proves that the vaccine is safe for use.

And even if the vaccine is bad for some people. The rule of thumb for such things is the good of the many outweighs the good of one.

And you don't quite understand where I was going with my reply to OP. Could doctors have reservations on vaccines, medications etc? Yes, absolutely.

You counsel the patient of the potential benefit vs risk then you keep providing information to the patient until the patient makes a decision to whether this benefit out weigh the risk. Plus discrediting a vaccine has serious consequence in having faith in whatever new vaccines that might be developed in the future (newsflash new vaccines are created every year and the vaccine you take this year will definitely be different from the one I take next year), I find it really irresponsible that OPs relative ""doctor"" ADVISED them against it.",2021-01-13 10:17:29

I think not wanting to be the early adopter is reasonable choice given that the number of covid cases here now is low. I don't think it is ethical to force another person to take a vaccine with unknow long term effect to combat the virus. People have to make their own decision. But the good news is, more people will take the vaccine as time goes by. I mean eventually old people and high risk groups will be given the vaccines and after awhile when nobody died or get severe side effect then the chances of people deciding to taking the vaccine will increase when they realise they are such a pussy.

"The real question is about the tissue trophism of the mrna vaccine itself. Because of the nano lipid particle used to encase the mrna itself, it is theorised that the vaccine may potentially be able to cross the blood brain barrier and enter into immunologically privileged sites. Where does the vaccine go? 

Not much study on that for now. 

And currently Pfizers phase 3 data was collected over a period of 2 months. Safety and efficacy cannot be established beyond that period of time but we generally assume it to be safe. 

If future doses are required to maintain immunity, will compounded doses result in a different safety profile? 

There is a reason why hcws may want to shy away from the mrna vaccine for now because they actually read medical journals and not pro vaccine messages from the mass media. 

Attenuated virus vaccines have been well studied. And we do know that the attenuated virus retains the trophism of the target virus (in this case, sars cov2).

Usually phase 3 takes longer, but a lot of what usually happens in phase 3 was done in phase 1 and 2 (funding, preparation, and even manufacturing of the vaccine), or done in parallel. My understanding is that certain non-essential steps in phase 1 to 3 were indeed skipped or changed (eg trial on animals), but not the critical ones, incl human trials.

The reason they cut short the testing is because it became a matter of ethics to let the control group not have the vaccine during this pandemic as the control group was slowly increasing with the amount of infected people.

"Before you come to a conclusion to this there are two burdens that we have to get past.

The first burden is to understand how does vaccines work and how long they take to work. This portion is where I feel a lot of you 'wait and see' people don't really get. Vaccines (even mRna) work by activating your body's immunity to fight against the virus. 3 outcomes can happen. 1 is that your immunity don't get activated, 2 is that the vaccine activates your immunity and it kills the virus, 3 is that the vaccine activates but starts attacking the everything including your vital organs - that is what we call an autoimmune disease. - the process and the timeline for this 3 scenario to happen is pretty short. You don't need to wait for a long time for this 3 scenarios to happen. Plus the Pfizer clinical trial has been past 3 months.
Where it gets tricky for the layman is that they confuse medication that causes long term effects with vaccines. Even medicine that causes long term effects don't cause long term effects with 1-2 dose. It causes damage with long term use.

The 2nd burden is to properly educate the public within these 3 months regarding the vaccines. That is the proper channel to go through. People with no understanding of how vaccine/medicine works should not comment and provide advice on how people should feel about them. Also note, when these expert talk about the wait and see, they are also trying to understand how long does this immunity last - because they have no idea.",2021-01-13 17:34:10

What happens if they do get infected with the virus after rejecting the vaccine. Who now has to bear those costs? Probably the government will still bear it. But is it fair since it was them who rejected the vaccine. 

And once it's determined to be safe, should we then allow the healthcare personnel to cut the queue since they are in the high risk sector? Or should we enforce a strict queueing system to put them at the end. If we allow them to cut the queue, is this then fair to those who wants the vaccine but now have to wait longer? What if someone among this group gets the virus because of the delay? What if as a result of being put at the back of the queue, the healthcare personnel gets infected? then whose fault will it be.

"HAHA gosh you are trying really hard to twist my words.

>You yourself have said it’s about risk assessment. A doctor can give their risk assessment of whether a vaccine should be taken based on their informed opinions. What you’re really asking for is that all doctors should push the vaccination, which then means there is no proper risk assessment done.

I am not a doctor yet but I'll give you an example of doing an unbiased risk assessment without giving my opinions. At the end of this test you will find that ultimately I have not influenced you in anyway.

With regards to the Pfizer Vaccine, it is a new technology. Unlike previous vaccines where they introduce a inactivated virus into your body which would activate your immunity system to fight against this Covid virus. Instead of inject a virus, they inject a protein into your body. It is supposedly safer because you are not injecting a virus into your body. There is a fear (not a risk) that this protein may cause some autoimmune issues, this is an opinion of some people there is no data of this happening. The technology has been studied for decades but they have not pushed this to the markets. The reason is that this technology is an expensive solution to the traditional solution (they ultimately do the same thing) but from a market perspective it is largely unproven. Whether it is safe or not, nobody has enough data to conclusively tell you whether it is safe to take or not. You have to decide on your own. Known side effects for the vaccines are also common there may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site. Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination. These normal vaccine reactions are usually mild and subside after a few days.

Ultimately, you should decide to take an unproven vaccine vs trying to return to a time where there is no fear of getting Covid.",2021-01-13 11:47:50

That’s why doctors have to explain the risks to their older patients because if they outlive the replacement, they then have to be on wheelchair or undergo another surgery which is highly risky at an even older age.

> SINGAPORE - Singapore received its first shipment of China's Sinovac vaccine on Tuesday (Feb 23). However, the product has not yet been authorised for use by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), said the Health Ministry on Wednesday (Feb 24).

> In a statement, the ministry said: ""Sinovac has started submitting initial data, and HSA is currently awaiting Sinovac's submission of all the necessary information in order to carry out a thorough scientific assessment of the manufacturing process, safety and efficacy of the vaccine under the Pandemic Special Access Route.""

> Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are currently being used in Singapore, have received interim authorisation under this route. Both vaccines involve injecting snippets of the virus' genetic material into the body to stimulate an immune response.

> In contrast, Sinovac's product is an inactivated vaccine, which makes use of killed virus particles. This method has been used in vaccines for diseases such as polio.

> MOH also said it received a fresh shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, and will continue to monitor vaccine supplies closely.

> In a Facebook post, the Chinese embassy said the delivery of the vaccine cements the agreement made by both countries to cooperate on issues related to the pandemic.

> ""China and Singapore have helped each other to meet the challenge since the Covid-19 epidemic broke out, setting a fine example for cooperation against the virus among countries,"" it wrote.

> It added that China will continue to work with Singapore to ""enhance cooperation on vaccine and epidemic control, build a global community of health for all, and win the final victory in the fight against the epidemic"".

""At Tuesday’s press conference, Palácios said Sinovac’s relatively low efficacy rate of 50% was due to its more rigorous standard for what counts as an infection among trial volunteers. The Butantan Institute said it included six types of cases in its results: asymptomatic, very mild, mild, two levels of moderate, and severe. (The Brazilian authorities stressed that the public should focus on the vaccine’s 100% efficacy in protecting against severe cases of COVID-19.) Western vaccine makers generally included only mild, moderate, and severe categories, and companies like Pfizer are doing additional studies to see if the vaccine will prevent asymptomatic cases.""

People want to compare other studies, but that’s like comparing a person that runs a 1-kilometer race on a flat stretch and another doing it on a steep and obstacle-filled stretch,” Palácios said.

"" There is some evidence to back up Palácios’ claim that Brazil’s trial standards are more likely to catch mild cases of COVID-19 than trials conducted elsewhere, which would result in a lower efficacy rate."" In the U.S.’s Food and Drug Administration’s evaluation of Pfizer’s vaccine trials, the agency found that there were up to 1,594 suspected but unconfirmed cases of COVID-19. Because the infections were unconfirmed, they didn’t factor into the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy rate.

“It’s true that other vaccine trials have not been able to confirm as many mild infections [as Sinovac],” says Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. “The [vaccine efficacy] against mild disease could be lower than 90%-95% for Moderna and Pfizer.”

He was discharged from the hospital 2 days later, and multiple nasopharyngeal PCR tests collected over a 10-day period beginning 2 days after symptom onset were negative.""

It clearly shows that the suspected cases had negative PCR test, but the results could be false negative based on the symptoms.

"Hi,
 
  I'm just trying to correct the record, hope this gets enough visibility. Happy to answer more questions if necessary. 

> We already know now that antibody immunity to a natural infection fades fast. 

  I am not sure what you mean by that, but I assume that you are referring to the studies that demonstrated that the antibody levels in recovered patients decrease after a few months. Thing is, the adaptive immune system (i.e. T and B cells) have memory. That means that once the adaptive immune system sees an pathogen or infection, they are likely to have a secondary response that is much faster than the original defense.

Hence, loss of detectable antibody in the blood/plasma doesn't mean that the memory B cells or plasmablasts are gone, nor does it mean that the patients that we can't find the antibody in can be reinfected by the virus (i.e. immunity may still be there) Truth is, we'll only know when it's put to the test.

> What the Singapore work shows is that the earlier SARS outbreak established very long-lasting immunity against SARS that also covers SARS-2. That also included CD8+ T-cells that play a key role in killing infected cells. As SARS-2 as similar to SARS, there is reasonable hope that these other new vaccines could also elicit long-term immunity. However, they did not study the S protein that those other vaccines are based on so we don't actually know if long-term T-cell immunity can be generated against that. It will be a ""game over"" downer for all candidates if it can't. Couldn't at least one effort have selected the NP protein instead? Groupthink.

The fact that the NP protein responses are being generated at a much higher frequency in COVID patients just means that for some reason, the SARS-COV-2 virus' most immunogenic protein is there. Why that is the case may have nothing to do with the antibody and the quality of the immune defense against the virus.

The S protein was chosen based on previous studies of similar viruses such as SARS and MERS. In fact, the main reason why we have clinical trials that quickly already is that much of the early work for developing a vaccine based off this target was already done. Based off this new study, we may need to look into NP. But a S protein based target may still work, since it doesn't [mutate as frequently] (https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02392-y), and still can [generate a response] (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483?query=featured_home). 

The main reason I am replying is to hope that you and others don't judge the work of the researchers based on hindsight. After all, hindsight is 20/20 for a reason.",2020-07-18 10:21:34
This is really interesting. I wonder what % of our population already has the wuhan-specific T-cell immunity due to previous infections from unknown coronaviruses. Is it possible to test for the presence of these T-cells?,2020-07-18 00:14:32
"The boldest part is important, so I feel that you are writing off the inactivated vaccines way too quickly. Inactivated vaccines will have all the proteins present in the virus particle, including the NP that you wanted, leading to a broad T cell response.

Inactivated vaccines are injected into muscle, contain a high dose of viral antigens all at once, don’t unleash various immune-suppressive tactics, may contain adjuvant etc. All in all, very different from natural infection in the respiratory tract. Most importantly, the inactivated vaccines consist of more than one shot (at least one booster shot will be give). While the response after the first shot may be kind of weak/transient, the booster shot should induce a much stronger secondary response.",2020-07-18 08:06:20

"Thanks for this! Very interesting.

Even without a vaccine, I'm hoping that treatment protocols can improve such that we get the death rate down to a flu-like %, such that life can resume as before... E.g. Resmevidir for early-stage Covid to fight the virus and dexamethasone for late-stage Covid to fight the cytokine storm which is commonly what ends up being the fatal blow. Long way to go of course, but hopefully a viable alternative to a vaccine.",2020-07-18 00:26:04
"This T-cell study (by Duke-NUS team again) is remarkable if the data holds out in subsequent investigations. Because it strongly suggests about 50% of us may have pre-exposure to animal betacoronaviruses, and this can generate cross protective T-cell immunity to CoV-2.

The implications of that are pretty wild. For one, we may have a much higher diversity of coronaviruses which spillover from the animal reservoir (esp in SE Asia with the high biodiversity), and which goes under the radar because they cause no symptoms or very mild symptoms. 

Secondly, this may explain the perplexing differences in mortality in for example SG, Vietnam, even South China, compared to Lombardy or the US. Some regional populations may have pre-existing immunity from prior ""angel"" spillovers.

"I'm no biomedical graduate, but I have serious doubts that we, as a species, could develop an effective vaccine against SARS2.

We have never develop a vaccine for a coronavirus. Ever. I believe the reason cited was that coronaviruses are highly seasonal and die off before any R&D into them can take flight. So without this experience, I have my doubts that we will have a proper vaccine for SARS2 before SARS3 comes out.",2020-07-18 11:28:15
Curious since you seem to know quite abit about this- what are your views on the vaccine candidates from jannsenn and MSD?,2020-07-18 15:10:50
Showing a T-cell response does not mean that you are immune to the coronavirus and cannot be infectious. It just suggests that you can mount a more effective immune response and perhaps have a lower chance of dying. You can still be infectious and infect your parents and grandparents.,2020-07-18 10:52:45

"Inactivated vaccines, in general, don't generate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses well and that's what you need to kill virus infected cells.  The problem is CTLs are MHC class I-restricted so the antigen to generate them must be derived intracellularly, for example, with an attenuated virus vaccine or such-like.  Inactivated vaccines provide extracellular antigen and those are processed via MHC class II - that pathway does not generate CTLs.

In principle, if you fiddled around with the inactivation just right so the inactivated virus particle is still capable of fusing with the target cell so antigen can get presented via MHC class I, you could potentially get some CTL response but is not the usual outcome.",2020-07-20 06:21:26

I complete agree with you. Moreover, we are 100 percent urbanized and only 720 sq km, which should make it easy to transport the vaccines to anywhere on the island.

They did it so that they can get salary and accommodations without actually doing their job. It's like a free extension of holiday to them. And the fact that the fatality rate of covid19 is low atm, it tempts FWs to just infect them and show minor symptoms to just get the accomdations. Smart move indeed",2020-06-09 13:22:59+00:00

"I strongly disagree that we use “incentives “ in whatever form to encourage people to vaccinate. Vaccination is to protect oneself, our loved ones, friends, our community and ultimately out country. These itself is an incentive ! Otherwise it’s pure selfish behavior. Why must we incentivize Singaporean for every single thing? What culture are we inculcating?

Singapore - because of smart policies and high discipline ! - has the luxury that we don’t have the Virus here and that people don’t die ! Therefore in Singapore it is possible that front line workers like in aviation and maritime can get vaccinated first! That is a hard earned privilege for the whole country to focus now on economic recovery! Most other (often Western) countries don’t have this choice !

"This is a terrible message. I can think of so many things that Singaporeans don’t like to do, but are forced to, for our own good.  Not to say measles and diphtheria  vaccinations are compulsory. This is therefore a nonsensical reason. No government is making it compulsory because the vaccine is still new, even if it’s proven to be safe and effective in the short term. And because no government is making it compulsory, the Singapore government will not be brave enough to be the only one to do so. If you can’t be straightforward, don’t make up nonsensical reasons. - CC",2021-02-16 05:26:24+00:00

"The health authorities said Monday that they had found no correlation between the COVID-19 vaccine and a number of recent deaths following the administration of AstraZeneca vaccinations. As of Sunday, 11 people with pre-existing health conditions have died after receiving the first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to the KDCA. The authorities said they are conducting investigations into the additional deaths while closely monitoring people for severe adverse reactions. Meanwhile, the family of a man who died four days after receiving a shot urged the government to conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of his death in an online petition on the Cheong Wa Dae website posted Saturday. The petitioner, claiming to be a family member of the deceased man in his 60s who was vaccinated Feb. 27 at a nursing home in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, wrote, ""My father began to show symptoms of a high fever and muscle pain in the evening, and was moved to a higher-level hospital two days later.""

"SINGAPORE - Singapore's vaccination drive has been brought forward for all seniors, and will also be extended to more high risk groups and essential workers including teachers, postmen and migrant workers. This is possible because more supplies of the vaccine have arrived, said the Health Ministry (MOH) of Monday (March 8). As or March 7, more than 596,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered. In total, about 379,000 individuals in Singapore have received at least the first dose; of whom more than 217,000 have received their second dose, MOH said. The Ministry had earlier announced that seniors aged 60 to 69 would get their first dose around the end of March. However, it said on Monday that all seniors in this age group will now get their invitation letters within the next few days. Each letter will have a weblink which can be used to register for vaccination, after which an SMS with a unique booking link will be sent to the senior's mobile phone for them to book a vaccination appointment. Seniors can also book their appointments for vaccination at any community centre or community club. So far, over 55,000 seniors aged 70 and up have received their first dose of the vaccine, while another 96,000 seniors have made appointments to receive their first dose in the next few weeks. MOH also said that the vaccine programme will continue to be extended to other higher risk groups, as well as essential frontline workers of critical importance to Singapore, including those who could pose risks to vulnerable populations and the community at large if they are infected.",2021-09-03 06:42:00

Contrary to the fake news TS is percolating the Pfizer vaccine is very effective but has a higher rate of allergic reactions than the flu vaccine. This means it will be off-limits for some people with allergic tendencies especially some seniors with pre-existing conditions who may not be able to manage it. A less powerful vaccine may be a benefit for some groups that might not otherwise be able to be vaccinated at all.

Hong Kong\u2019s second batch of Sinovac vaccines will arrive within the month, the city\u2019s health minister has said, while a source on Saturday revealed a chronically ill woman who had received the Covid-19 drug died days later after developing stroke symptoms. The insider said it remained unclear if the fatality was related to the vaccine, adding that an expert panel \u2013 which concluded earlier that the death of another Sinovac recipient was not linked to the jab \u2013 would hold a meeting on Monday to study the incident. Hong Kong was on Saturday facing fewer than 10 coronavirus cases, according to another source. On a morning radio show, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Shiu-chee had sought to allay concerns over the first death, following a drop in daily bookings for the city\u2019s inoculation drive. Chan noted the reduction in vaccination appointments after the February 28 death of a Sinovac recipient, saying it was understandable that residents would like to think thoroughly about the decision or consult their doctors. The expert panel had determined the death of the chronically ill man, 63, who had received the jab at Kwun Chung Sports Centre in Jordan, was not directly linked to the mainland-produced vaccine. The source said the other person who died \u2013 a 55-year-old woman with multiple chronic illnesses \u2013 received the vaccination on March 2 at the same centre and felt unwell on March 5, exhibiting stroke-like symptoms. She was admitted to Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei. She died in the early hours of Saturday, and the hospital was reviewing her medical record .",2021-07-03 19:17:00

On a morning radio show, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Shiu-chee had sought to allay concerns over the first death, following a drop in daily bookings for the city\x92s inoculation drive. Chan noted the reduction in vaccination appointments after the February 28 death of a Sinovac recipient, saying it was understandable that residents would like to think thoroughly about the decision or consult their doctors. The expert panel had determined the death of the chronically ill man, 63, who had received the jab at Kwun Chung Sports Centre in Jordan, was not directly linked to the mainland-produced vaccine. The source said the other person who died \x96 a 55-year-old woman with multiple chronic illnesses \x96 received the vaccination on March 2 at the same centre and felt unwell on March 5, exhibiting stroke-like symptoms. She was admitted to Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei. She died in the early hours of Saturday, and the hospital was reviewing her medical record .",2021-07-03 19:17:00

"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/...th-chronically Hong Kong health authorities on Tuesday night revealed that they were investigating the death of a chronically ill man two days after he received China\x92s Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine, but cautioned that no connection had been ascertained yet. The Department of Health said the 63-year-old man had received the shot on February 26 at Kwun Chung Sports Centre in Jordan, one of the government\x92s designated vaccination sites. He was sent to Queen Elizabeth Hospital on February 28 after suffering shortness of breath. A source said the man had suffered a cardiac arrest soon after he was admitted, and died on the same day after failed resuscitation attempts. \x93At the moment, the causal relationship with the vaccination cannot be ascertained,\x94 the department said in a late-night statement, adding that it was seeking more information from the Hospital Authority. The source said that when the man was admitted to hospital, clinicians were notified that he had been vaccinated with the Sinovac jab, but at that time they thought the conditions were unrelated, as the patient suffered from chronic illnesses. The department, meanwhile, said it would also pass the case details to a new expert committee for assessing clinical events to establish the causal links and publish a report in due course. A hospital spokesman said the man, who also had a record of respiratory tract diseases, was admitted at about 1.30am on Sunday. He was transferred to a medical ward at about 3am but his condition deteriorated rapidly and he died at around 6am. The Coroner\x92s Court would follow up on the death, the spokesman said. In a press briefing at about 12.30am on Wednesday, hospital deputy chief executive Dr Johnny Chan Wai-man said the patient told emergency unit staff he had received a jab, but personnel in the medical ward were not aware of the vaccination as they focused on his rapidly deteriorating condition. Chan said no signs of allergic reactions were detected during resuscitation attempts and staff believed from clinical judgments the patient had chronic bronchitis, for which he was treated. None of the patient\x92s conditions that day could be associated with inoculation, he said. The hospital alerted the health department the following day after reviewing his record and realising he had been vaccinated. Dr Ronald Lam Man-kin, controller of the Centre for Health Protection, stressed that it was too early to conclude there was a causal relationship and the expert committee would examine the incident. The vaccine was still recommended as the benefits outweighed the risks, he said, adding that the department\x92s monitoring mechanism was in line with international standards. \x93A vaccination programme cannot be arbitrarily stopped before a causal relationship is established,\x94 Lam said. Chan, however, admitted that communications could be improved. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory medicine expert at Chinese University and a government adviser on the pandemic, said whether the man\x92s death was related to the vaccination had yet to be concluded by a postmortem examination. He said the man had suffered from four risk factors of a coronary artery disease, including his smoking habit, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia and high blood glucose levels, which could pose threats to his health even without the vaccine. The diabetic man had been seeking treatment from a government outpatient clinic and was taking two kinds of medicine. His blood glucose levels were normal when he was admitted to the hospital emergency unit. \x93If the [diabetes] is well controlled, there is no problem in getting the vaccine,\x94 Hui said. Experts had said adverse reactions reported by several people after receiving shots of the mainland-made Sinovac vaccine were unlikely to be linked to the jab. Some 40,000 people have received the jab so far. Meanwhile, bookings for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was jointly developed by German and US firms, will open on Wednesday at 9am. With 140,000 slots available for priority residents, the jabs will be offered from March 10 to 30 at seven vaccination centres operated by the Hospital Authority. With another vaccine option available, Hui said earlier, one of the factors in choosing which jab to go for would be the recipient\x92s travel habits. He said people who needed to travel overseas frequently could benefit from the potentially greater protection offered by the BioNTech vaccine. Sinovac shots, he added, would be adequate for those who usually stayed in Hong Kong or only travelled to the mainland, where mutated strains of the virus were not yet prevalent. \x93The BioNTech vaccine could neutralise the mutated strains that emerged in Britain and South Africa,\x94 Hui said. \x93The coverage of protection could be wider.\x94 At least seven people had been sent to hospital after they developed complications \x96 such as a rapid heartbeat, dizziness and high blood pressure \x96 following Sinovac shots over the past few days. The University of Hong Kong\x92s Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai, co-convenor of the expert committee on adverse reactions to vaccines, said the conditions reported by the patients were also common in other situations. \x93Dizziness is a common response among some people who get injected for vaccinations or blood-drawing. Many people also have palpitations,\x94 he said, referring to the condition of a fast-beating or fluttering heart. He said the committee would meet on Wednesday to look into the adverse events. Hui also said those reactions were likely to have been caused by unconscious responses in the nervous system, such as rising heart rates due to a fear of needles or blood. \x93If you are afraid of needles, maybe don\x92t look at the needle,\x94 he told a radio programme. \x93There\x92s no need to worry, the needle is there to help you develop immunity.\x94 For the administration of the BioNTech shots, which must be kept long-term at minus 70 degrees Celsius and thawed and diluted before injection, each inoculation centre will be equipped with two pharmaceutical fridges to store the vials at temperatures between 2 and 8 degrees for no more than five days. To prevent spoilage, the jabs would be prepared in batches throughout the day, depending on the booking demand, said Angela Liu Hor-ki from the Hospital Authority\x92s Hong Kong East cluster, which manages the vaccination centre at Sai Wan Ho Sports Centre. \x93We will prepare the vaccines according to the bookings, we won\x92t [dilute] the vaccines all in one go,\x94 she said. Each vial contains five doses, and the shot in each syringe can be kept at room temperature no higher than 30 degrees and must be administered within six hours. With four to six pharmacists allocated at each vaccination centre, a maximum of 200 syringes could be prepared per hour, Liu added. Dr Luk Che-chung, chief executive of the authority\x92s Hong Kong East cluster, said health workers were confident about delivering a smooth vaccination programme even though many technical issues were involved in handling the BioNTech jabs.",2021-06-03 22:02:00

"At a press conference on Wednesday evening, Hung Fan Ngai Ivan, the convener of the committee assessing clinical events related to vaccines in Hong Kong, said committee members have concluded that the death was not directly related to the injections as autopsy results show that the man had serious chronic diseases, including ""central obesity"" - rounder stomach - and high blood pressure, and was suspected of having coronary heart disease. According to Hung, the man, 63, very likely died of heart disease, which caused myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. A detailed autopsy report will follow later, Hung said, noting that the vaccination plan in the city would continue as planned as no evidence shows the individual case was related to vaccination. Experts at the press conference suggest that Hong Kong residents with serious chronic diseases to see medical advice before accepting vaccines. https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202103/1217135.shtml",2021-06-03 22:02:00

The companies will focus on using technology to help governments and healthcare providers address potential supply chain disruptions through information sharing. Organizations can also use IBM\u2019s Digital Health Pass tool to verify health credentials of employees, customers and travelers, according to a joint statement. Earlier this year, Salesforce.com Inc, as part of a large coalition to digitize COVID-19 vaccination records, said it was launching a new product to help governments and healthcare providers maintain and manage such records.

"SINGAPORE - Singapore has launched a campaign to raise awareness of the national vaccination programme, as part of its push to get residents inoculated against Covid-19. The VacciNationSG campaign will also address misconceptions and debunk misinformation, said Minister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran on Tuesday (March 2). ""The first line of defence in our fight against misinformation is a well-informed citizenry who receive accurate communications, from reliable sources, in a timely manner,"" Mr Iswaran noted during the debate on his ministry's budget. Several MPs, including Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir) and Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), had observed that the Government's communications strategy has had to change in tandem with evolving needs. ""There is a need to ensure that all Singaporeans receive timely and accurate information that is relatable and capable of being understood by everyone with diverse needs,"" Mr Sitoh noted. He asked how the Government considers factors such as age groups and literacy levels when tapping digital means of communication, and stressed that all communication channels - digital or otherwise - should remain two-way in order to garner ground feedback. Responding, Mr Iswaran said the Government's ""foremost communications challenge"" in tackling the virus has been to ensure Singaporeans of all stripes can access trustworthy information. By leveraging both traditional and digital platforms - including Telegram, Instagram and TikTok - it was able to broaden and deepen the reach of official communications, he said. The Gov.sg portal is now available on 10 platforms, with its WhatsApp channel growing from 7,000 subscribers in January last year to 1.2 million subscribers today. At the same time, the People's Association and Silver Generation Office carried out face-to-face outreach programmes for those who were not on social media. ""This was to ensure that all segments of our population were informed of key developments of the pandemic, why certain measures were necessary and how they could play their part to protect the health and safety of all Singaporeans,"" Mr Iswaran said. He added that polls conducted by government feedback unit Reach indicated that more than eight in 10 people felt the Government provided enough information on Covid-19. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...vaccine-combat",2021-03-03 18:51:00

"china hawk speaks https://www.facebook.com/bilahari.ka...66118706978872 Bilahari Kausikan Let me draw a parallel which while imperfect, may nevertheless explain things. Since Deng Xiaoping, every Chinese administration has asked the Singapore government to do a project in China, the latest is the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative which is part of Xi Jinping\u2019s signature BRI. It has been some time since China has had anything significant to learn from Singapore\u2019s experience. But one \u2014 certainly not the sole \u2014 reason why these projects are useful to Beijing is that the Singapore government is what could be called a \u2018reference investor\u2019 and its participation is the \u2018good house-keeping seal of approval\u2019, assuring others of the integrity of the project. China has not released any data about the Sinovac vaccine. Data from Brazil and Turkey show wildly differing levels of efficacy. Hence doubts abound, although desperate countries will accept and use it. Singapore has Covid-19 under control and is not desperate. We are known for thoroughness and integrity. If we approve the vaccine, it will do much to calm the doubts of others. But HSA will certainly not approve Sinovac until it is sure that it poses no greater risks than the other already approved vaccines. It is ridiculous to suggest that the health of Singaporeans will be given hostage to diplomacy. If that was indeed China\u2019s intent, than it is yet another example of how Beijing misunderstands Singapore.",2021-02-03 12:44:00

Beijing sent its coronavirus vaccine to the city state before Singapore\u2019s health authorities approved the jab Some health experts questioned China\u2019s intent behind the move, suggesting that it might be \u2018unhappy\u2019 if Singapore is slow in approving the vaccine When the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccines arrived in Singapore in December, the moment was cheered by residents and politicians alike. Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung received the shipment with much fanfare and oversaw its delivery to a cold-chain warehouse, while Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called the arrival of the vaccines a \u201cwelcome present that we\u2019ve all been looking forward to\u201d. It was a similar story two months later, when the city state received its first batch of Moderna shots. Lee said he was \u201cpleased\u201d with the delivery, and reporters were forwarded a series of photographs showing the bulky vaccine boxes with a Singapore Airlines plane in the background. Yet there was no such fanfare to greet the arrival of the China-made Sinovac shots on Tuesday evening. Rather, the seemingly played-down event was only made known a day later by the Chinese embassy. Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health later confirmed that the Sinovac jabs had arrived but stressed that the vaccine has not yet been authorised by regulators and so cannot be used immediately, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna shots. Analysts said the uncertainty surrounding the Sinovac jabs likely contributed to the stark contrast in reactions, while suggesting that there could be unstated diplomatic pressure on Singapore to approve the vaccine. Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases expert, noted it was \u201cunusual\u201d that the vaccines had arrived before authorisation was granted. A vaccine shipment that arrives before authorisation could face a host of challenges, he said, including the risk the vaccines could expire before they are officially approved, although reports said the Sinovac vaccine has a refrigerated shelf life of three years. He questioned why China had sent the jabs, remarking that \u201cIt\u2018s almost like they are begging Singapore to use\u201d them. Singapore had hammered out an advance agreement with Sinovac on the vaccine, although no details about the scheduled delivery date were revealed. Khor Swee Kheng, a Malaysian specialist in health policies, said countries that receive vaccines before regulatory approval face concerns about the possibility of \u201cregulatory limbo\u201d and the risk of political pressure on regulatory authorities to approve the vaccine shipments. He said that countries around the world are struggling to balance the speed of regulatory approvals and expiring agreements with pharmaceutical firms, and suggested that if regulatory approval is too slow in one country, then another country that has already approved a particular vaccine could exercise its \u201ccontractual right\u201d and purchase the vaccines from the former. Singapore\u2018s Ministry of Health said Wednesday that Sinovac has started submitting initial data on the efficacy of the vaccine to the ministry\u2019s Health Sciences Authority. But Leong said there was no time frame for the process, and likened the approval of a vaccine without the needed data to back it up to endorsing the fiscal health of a company with no financial statements. \u201cOnly when all factors are met will the approval go through,\u201d Leong said. Chong Ja Ian, a political scientist and scholar of Chinese foreign policy at the National University of Singapore, said Beijing was eager to see the international adoption of its vaccines as part of its so-called vaccine diplomacy. He said the Tuesday shipment to the city state was part of the campaign. Chong said there was a chance that Beijing could be \u201cunhappy\u201d if Singapore does not \u2013 or is slow \u2013 in approving the Sinovac vaccine, given its eagerness to showcase its capabilities. \u201cHowever, the core consideration during this time of crisis should be [the vaccine\u2019s] safety and effectiveness \u2026 rather than whether particular governments or leaders are happy or not,\u201d he added. \u201cAny focus other than public health at this moment of crisis is irresponsible.\u201d The Chinese embassy in Singapore lauded the vaccine shipment as having added a \u201cnew highlight\u201d to the 30 years of Sino-Singapore ties. It wrote on Facebook that it believed the vaccine would contribute to Singapore\u2019s virus efforts, and that Beijing would continue to work with the city state to \u201cwin the final victory\u201d against the pandemic. Given Singapore\u2019s reputation for standards, Chong said, its authorisation of the Sinovac vaccine would be seen as a seal of approval for all China-developed vaccines. Victor Shih, an associate professor of political economy at the University of California San Diego, concurred that Singapore\u2019s approval would lend credence to the idea that Chinese vaccines are globally accepted, noting that these vaccines have mostly been used in developing countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Singapore is among the few wealthy countries that are considering the use or Chinese vaccines, alongside the United Arab Emirates. Shih said, however, that the main audience for Beijing\u2019s vaccine diplomacy was a domestic one. \u201cWhen China rolls out a mass vaccination campaign domestically, the government wants Chinese citizens to accept the Chinese vaccines, despite their lower efficacy compared to leading Western vaccines,\u201d he said. Trial data shows Sinovac having an efficacy rate of about 50.4 per cent, compared with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine\u2019s 95 per cent and Moderna\u2019s 94 per cent efficacy rates. Shih said that there could be \u201csome pressure applied behind the scenes\u201d for Singapore to approve the Sinovac jab, but added that even if it is approved there would likely be \u201cfew users\u201d in the city state given the supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The Singapore government has not disclosed how many doses of each vaccine it has, and said residents would not get to choose the shots they receive. Authorities said about 250,000 residents had received their first jabs as of last Thursday, and that over 110,000 had been inoculated twice, with vaccinations of elderly residents well under way. Meanwhile, Zha Daojiong, a professor at Peking University\u2019s School of International Studies, stressed that the decision made by the Singapore health regulatory authority on approving the Sinovac vaccine would be one based on scientific rigour \u201crather than diplomatic or political goodwill\u201d. He noted that the Sinovac vaccine has been through rounds of scientific and policy tests in different countries, and that talk of China pushing hard for a country to adopt its vaccine was \u201cdifficult to substantiate\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t see an impact \u2026 in any political and diplomatic sense that comes with an eventual decision by Singapore,\u201d Zha said. \u201cIt would be very unwise for China\u2019s agencies of diplomacy to appear [to be] pressuring any government to make a positive decision about Chinese vaccines and for any government to make a decision on political goodwill.\u201d",2021-02-03 12:44:00

"going to approve liao.. sinkies got no choice == https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-some-normalcy Prof Teo noted that public data on the effectiveness of the Sinovac vaccine is actually higher than the target efficacy of at least 50 per cent required by the World Health Organisation and a number of regulators, including the European Medicines Agency. But the effectiveness of Sinovac varies according to the clinical trials in different countries, and ranges from 50.4 per cent to 91.3 per cent. ""So there is a need for a proper assessment of the clinical trial data,"" Prof Teo said. This is what the Health Sciences Authority will be reviewing, before it decides on whether to approve for use. At present, all the data suggests that the vaccine's effectiveness meets the minimum requirement for population roll-out, Prof Teo noted. To put this in perspective, the influenza vaccine, which has been used globally across many countries, has an effective rate of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent, depending on the season and specific population segment, he said.",2021-02-03 12:44:00

"This is very clear cut and simple straightforward. Diplomacy manueveurs should never outweigh the lives of Singaporeans. MOH is the authority which can approve or disallow the use of vaccines in Singapore, and if Sinovac is deemed ""un-passable"", then it will not be used in SG. We can then either donate it to other willing nations, or return them to China together with the reasons, and the test results. With these in mind, I absolutely agree with Mr. Kausikan, the former senior diplomat to U.N. representing Singapore. We hold ourselves to very high standards, especially those regarding the health and wellbeing of Singaporeans, how would we ever sacrifice those of our own just for diplomatic plus points? I'm sure China will feel the same. So the issue is never about the government standing up to the CCP. It's all about the results of the vaccine's usability. If anyone thinks otherwise, I'm sorry to say your points are not and never will be valid in the Lion City. EDIT: Of course, if the Sinovac vaccine is approved by our MOH, i'll gladly use it. MOH is the, and the one and only authority in the world who has the final say.",2021-02-03 12:44:00

It's like say, "" You better go take ah, if not I take away your ricebowl. Oh if you take but something bad happen, don't say I force you to take okay? "" - Totally irresponsible. Not to forget, they won't be responsible for long term side-effects and treatment. They'll only pay your hospitalisation bill. So the gov totally ignoring those who cannot take due to history of allergies or have pre-existing condition which they have no data whether it'll affect them in long term. In the US, you can't sue Pfizer or Moderna even if you have severe vaccine side effects. They already have legal immunity from liability. So will SG government want to assume that legal liability by making vaccination mandatory? Wait long long. Anyway, now ish 158th media coming out with all this. Not SG government coming out directly to mention this. So that if got problem, they can flip and say, you don't kpkb fake news hor, I where got say until like that? Media come out say companies might do this de hor, not limbei ok? Don't anyhow anyhow. Got any minister say don't take vaccine might face limited employment opportunities? If you cannot find, I POFMA you throw you in jail ah! Cannot find, right? Better bow and say sorry, admit your mistake don't cover up!

It was a similar story two months later, when the city state received its first batch of Moderna shots. Lee said he was \u201cpleased\u201d with the delivery, and reporters were forwarded a series of photographs showing the bulky vaccine boxes with a Singapore Airlines plane in the background.

Have you heard of flu shots? You jab it every year if you want to be immune to it. There is no universal vaccine shot that is good against all (and future) variants of flu. So far, both Moderna and Pfizer's current vaccine are good against the UK and African Variants.  And these are the only 2 available vaccine in Sg. In any case, I dont think you need to worry about more shots after the current ones. Once covid is gone after transmission is stopped or curb with sufficient vaccinations, Covid will likely disappear like SARs and H1N1 (remember them?) and you wont have to go for further covid jabs.

At least half of Singaporeans will get their jabs purely because the need to travel. However, if u stay in country, stay home, stay safe with SOP, reduce contact. Vaccine not necessary. Your choice if u want to skip it. You are just same as those not qualified for vaccine. Fact is, eventually gov will open borders, and we will have more people visiting. Some will be carriers undetected, some will have fake vaccine/test documentation. So, even if you already jab, likely still have to wear mask follow SOP. Going forward, new mutations/variations will appear and old vaccines will not necessary protect you. so, its very likely that there will be another round of infections whether u jab or dun jab. worst case scenario, vaccines will be needed yearly just like flu shots.",2021-02-26 09:18:00

It is a choice or decision an individual undertake.

His swab taken on 3 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19.* He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested on 21 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day. An individual test was done on 23 February, and he was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 24 February. He was subsequently conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT \x96 the last being on 13 February \x96 were negative for COVID-19 infection.

Members of Parliament (MPs) have asked Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong about the staff member at the SNEC who was given the equivalent of five doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) asked why there was no dedicated staff member to handle ""this critical operation"" and no formal briefing with notes if a handover was necessary. According to the SNEC, investigations showed that the incident was due to ""human error"" resulting from a lapse in communication among the vaccination team at the time. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...ebate-14263198",2021-02-23 23:08:00

"The Johor state government hopes that Malaysia's Covid-19 Immunisation Programme will help drive efforts to reopen cross-border travel between Malaysia and Singapore. Johor Menteri Besar Hasni Mohammad said that the reopening of the border was vital in spurring the state's economy. ""Once people from both countries have been vaccinated, the movement between our two countries will be easier and safe, "" he said. The border with Singapore has been closed since the movement control order was first implemented in March 18 last year. Currently, only commercial vehicles ferrying goods cross the land border daily. Datuk Hasni added that the state government was ready to carry out the immunisation programme at designated vaccination centres in each district statewide. He added that for a start, he and his state executive councillors would be among the first to take the vaccine when the programme starts in Johor. Malaysia received its first batch of more than 300,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines on Sunday with another batch of 182,520 doses expected to arrive on Wednesday (Feb 24), according to Bernama news agency. Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin, who is also tasked with leading the national Covid-19 immunisation programme, said the vaccination roll-out would be brought forward to Wednesday from Friday. Malaysia recorded 2,192 more Covid-19 infections on Monday, bringing total cases to 285,761, says the Health Ministry. Six more people died due to the coronavirus, pushing Malaysia's Covid-19 death toll to 1,062. As at Feb 21, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in Johor stands at 33,382 with 91 deaths. https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se...g-efforts-with",2021-02-23 21:54:00

"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/artic...li-study-shows Quote: The Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE Covid-19 vaccine appeared to stop the vast majority of recipients in Israel becoming infected, providing the first real-world indication that the immunization will curb transmission of the coronavirus. The vaccine, which was rolled out in a national immunization program that began Dec. 20, was 89.4% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed infections , according to a copy of a draft publication that was posted on Twitter and confirmed by a person familiar with the work. The companies and Israel\x92s Health Ministry worked together on the preliminary observational analysis, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. The results, also reported in Der Spiegel, are the latest in a series of positive data to emerge out of Israel, which has given more Covid vaccines per capita than anywhere else in the world. Nearly half of the population has had at least one dose of vaccine. Separately, Israeli authorities on Saturday said the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was 99% effective at preventing deaths from the virus. The early results on lab-confirmed infections are important because they show the vaccine may also prevent asymptomatic carriers from spreading the virus that causes Covid-19, something that hadn\x92t been clear so far. Stopping transmission in this way is a key factor as countries seek to lift contact restrictions and re-open economies. https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/20/h...day/index.html Quote: Health experts have said that data so far has shown that Covid-19 vaccines prevent symptoms of the virus -- but a new study suggests that the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines may also prevent infections. A team at the Mayo Clinic health system looked at more than 31,000 people across four states who had received at least one dose of either vaccine -- and found the vaccines were upward of 80% effective in preventing infection 36 days after the first dose. Vaccine efficacy was 75% 15 days after the first dose , and it appeared to be 83% after a total of 36 days passed . But that number rose to nearly 89% when researchers examined only people who received two doses , according to the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. While the trials that Moderna and Pfizer used to win Food and Drug Administration authorization for their vaccines looked for symptomatic infection, the Mayo researchers said they looked for both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection.",2021-02-21 22:52:00

As of 18 February 2021, about 250,000 individuals have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Amongst them, more than 110,000 have also received their second dose of the vaccine, and completed the full vaccination regimen. Following the successful pilots in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar, we will commence COVID-19 vaccinations for seniors in the community from 22 February... ... COVID-19 vaccination for seniors will commence island-wide from 22 February. Over the next three weeks, seniors aged 70 years and above can expect to receive personalised letters inviting them to sign up for vaccination. We will start by inviting seniors living near polyclinics or vaccination centres, so that they can be conveniently vaccinated at a vaccination site near their home. By mid-March when we have opened a vaccination centre in each town, all seniors will be able to receive their vaccination. We expect all the letters to reach our seniors aged 70 years and above by the first week of March...",2021-02-20 03:14:00

"Case of S'porean who had cardiac arrest after vaccination taken 'very seriously', criteria & processes will be refined: Gan Kim Yong This is ensure there are no adverse effects post-vaccination. Editor\x92s note, Feb. 19, 7:05pm: An earlier version of this article reported inaccurately that the 72-year-old man has died after vaccination. The man, who suffered a cardiac arrest two days after vaccination, is now in ICU. The article has been corrected. We sincerely apologise for the error and the stress that it may have caused our readers. A 72-year-old Singaporean man who received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Feb. 16 suffered a cardiac arrest on the same night. The man was vaccinated on Tuesday morning, Feb. 16, and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) after suffering cardiac arrest on the same night, the Ministry of Health announced on Feb. 18. The man, who has a history of cancer, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, had been assessed by trained healthcare personnel to be suitable for Covid-19 vaccination prior to vaccination. Continue monitoring vaccinated patients At a media doorstop on Feb. 19 at Jalan Besar Community Centre, Minister for Health and co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce Gan Kim Yong addressed concerns which might arise from this incident. Gan reiterated that initial assessments showed that man's cardiac arrest was unrelated to the vaccination. However, he assured that steps were being taken to continue monitoring and collecting data on vaccinated patients. This is ensure there are no adverse effects post-vaccination. ""We do want to know about it, so we can collect the data and refine our criteria for vaccinations,"" he said. Gan added that they would monitor data ""not only locally, but internationally"" as well, so that vaccinations remain safe for people. Gan also highlighted the precautions currently in place for patients \x97 every person who takes the vaccination will be required to go through several thorough questionnaires on their wellbeing and a 30-minute post-vaccination observation period. Advice is also given to those who might experience any reaction to the vaccine. Once again, Gan emphasised the severity of such incidents: ""I want to assure Singaporeans that we do take this very seriously, whether they're related to the vaccination or not, we want to know if there are any such incidents so that we can investigate in depth and better understand the situation. And our criteria and processes will continue to be refined to ensure it can remain safe for anyone who wants to be vaccinated."" Making vaccinations available for more people Vaccinations for seniors aged 70 and above in Singapore will start on Feb. 22. Gan added that invitations letters to those aged between 60 and 69 would be sent out by the middle of March. Following this, vaccination slots will be opened to more groups of people, and the general public might be able to get their shots ""probably some time after April"". https://mothership.sg/2021/02/monito...-gan-kim-yong/",2021-02-19 20:48:00

Thought the medical staff and doctors will check all these before vaccine? If the doctors and medical staff approved the jab despite the old man declaring his medical conditions.....think should payout. If the old man didn't declare ...than another question.

"LONDON (REUTERS) - Rich countries are on course to have over a billion more doses of Covid-19 vaccines than they need, leaving poorer nations scrambling for leftover supplies as the world seeks to curb the coronavirus pandemic, a report by anti-poverty campaigners found on Friday (Feb 19). In an analysis of current supply deals for Covid-19 vaccines, the ONE Campaign said wealthy countries, such as the United States and Britain, should share the excess doses to ""supercharge"" a fully global response to the pandemic. The advocacy group, which campaigns against poverty and preventable diseases, said a failure to do so would deny billions of people essential protection from the Covid-19-causing virus and likely prolong the pandemic. The report looked specifically at contracts with the five leading Covid-19 vaccine makers - Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax. It found that to date, the United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan have already secured more than 3 billion doses - over a billion more than the 2.06 billion needed to give their entire populations two doses. ""This huge excess is the embodiment of vaccine nationalism,"" said Jenny Ottenhoff, ONE Campaign's senior director for policy. ""Rich countries understandably hedged their bets on vaccines early in the pandemic but with these bets paying off in spades, a massive course correction is needed if we are going to protect billions of people around the world,"" she added. The analysis found that, along with other Covid-19 vaccine supplies procured by the global Covax vaccine-sharing plan and in bilateral deals, the excess rich-country doses would go a long way to protecting vulnerable people in poorer countries. This would significantly reduce the risk of deaths from Covid-19, it said, as well as limiting the chances of new virus variants emerging and accelerating an end to the pandemic. The World Health Organisation on Thursday urged nations with vaccines not to share them unilaterally, but to donate them to the global Covax scheme to ensure fairness. https://www.straitstimes.com/world/e...-needed-report",2021-02-19 11:58:00

Not many people here actually realize they are taking a much bigger risk by choosing a vaccine that doesn't work. People that take ineffective vaccines will believe they are safe could just be a placebo and engage in more risky behavior by having fun. They can be barred from taking another better vaccine because they have already been injected if they get reinfected. Right now there's not enough transparency with Sinovac.

"Moderna vaccine lai liao https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...pore-on-feb-17 The first shipment of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine arrived in Singapore on Wednesday afternoon (Feb 17). It is another step forward in the Republic's bid to control the Covid-19 outbreak. Sources told The Straits Times that the vaccine was ferried by a Singapore Airlines plane that took off from Brussels in Belgium and transited at Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. The plane was expected to touch down at Changi Airport at about 2.15pm but arrived ahead of schedule. The Ministry of Health initially said on Feb 3 that the first shipment of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine would arrive around March, provided there were no disruptions to the shipment schedule. The vaccine is the second Covid-19 vaccine to be approved for use in Singapore after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was approved in mid-December. The Health Sciences Authority said on Feb 3 that its review of the available clinical data found that the Moderna vaccine demonstrated a high efficacy of 94 per cent, with the benefits outweighing the risks. This means that there is a 94 per cent reduction of symptomatic Covid-19 disease in a vaccinated group of people, compared with a similarly sized group of unvaccinated people, it said.",2021-02-17 15:10:00

"South Africa asks Serum Institute to take back 1 million vaccine doses - report BENGALURU (Reuters) - South Africa has asked the Serum Institute of India to take back the one million COVID-19 vaccine doses the company had sent in early February, The Economic Times reported on Tuesday, a week after the country said it will put on hold use of AstraZeneca's shot in its vaccination program. Serum Institute of India, which is producing AstraZeneca's shot, has emerged as a key vaccine supplier. One million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine landed in South Africa last week and another 500,000 were due to arrive in the next few weeks. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. South Africa's health minister has said the government may sell doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, after the country paused its rollout following a small clinical trial that showed it offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the 501Y.V2 coronavirus variant dominant in the country. AstraZeneca has said its vaccine appeared to offer only limited protection against mild disease caused by the South African variant, based on data from a study by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand and Oxford University. The African country, which is yet to launch its COVID-19 vaccination program, has decided to start vaccinating health workers with Johnson & Johnson's vaccine in the form of an ""implementation study"" with researchers. The Economic Times report also comes as the World Health Organization on Monday listed the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use.

"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news...being-n1257885 A 78-year-old woman died shortly after being inoculated at a mass vaccination site in Los Angeles County, health officials announced Saturday. The patient's family said she had a history of heart illness, said Dr. Michael E. Morris, director of Kaiser Permanente Southern California\x92s vaccination program, in a statement. The woman ""passed away unexpectedly"" Friday after receiving Pfizer's version of the Covid-19 vaccine about noon at the Kaiser-run site at Cal Poly Pomona, 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, the doctor said. ""While seated in the observation area after the injection, the patient complained of feeling discomfort and while being evaluated by medical personnel, she lost consciousness,"" he said. ""Paramedics on scene began CPR almost immediately and continued, but she ultimately could not be revived."" Her cause of death was yet to be determined, but the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said by email that there were no signs of allergic or anaphylactic reactions. ""Her death does not appear to be related to the vaccine,"" it said. The woman's husband of 57 years was also vaccinated Friday. ""Despite this tragedy, he is still urging that the COVID-19 vaccination effort continue, and said he intends to receive his second dose of vaccine in a few weeks,"" Morris said.",2021-02-14 16:58:00

"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...vid-19-vaccine PAP lumber 1! SINGAPORE - A staff member at the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) has been erroneously administered the equivalent of five doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. This occurred during a vaccination exercise on Jan 14, said the SNEC on Saturday (Feb 6). The error was discovered within minutes of the vaccination, when the staff member was resting in a designated area. ""Senior doctors were alerted immediately and the staff (member) was assessed and found to be well, with no adverse reaction or side effects,"" said SNEC. The staff member was warded at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for further observation, before being discharged two days later. The SNEC said it has been following up closely with the worker, who remains well. As a safety measure, the vaccination exercise at the SNEC was stopped immediately upon detection of the error. The rest of the SNEC staff were vaccinated at SGH. ""Our investigations showed that it was human error resulting from a lapse in communication among the vaccination team, who had been preparing and administering the injections at that time,"" said the centre. It said the worker in charge of diluting the vaccine had been called away to attend to other matters during the preparation of the vaccine. A second staff member had mistaken the undiluted dose in the vial to be ready for administering. The SNEC has apologised to the affected staff member and the worker's family, said Professor Wong Tien Yin, who is medical director of the centre. ""SNEC takes a very serious view of this incident. The safety of those receiving the vaccination during our staff vaccination exercise is of our utmost priority,"" he added. He added that the centre has done a thorough review of its internal processes and taken steps to tighten them so that such lapses do not occur again. SNEC is not involved in the vaccination exercise for other groups. As at Tuesday, more than 175,000 people have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. About 6,000 people have also taken their second dose of the vaccine and completed the full vaccination regimen.",2021-02-14 01:36:00

"Getting more than recommended dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine unlikely to be harmful: MOH The Health Ministry's comments come after an employee from the Singapore National Eye Centre was wrongly administered the equivalent of five doses of the vaccine due to a human error. File photo of a healthcare worker preparing a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Singapore. (File photo: Jeremy Long) SINGAPORE: Receiving more than the recommended dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to be harmful, said Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Feb 6), citing clinical trial data from the two pharmaceutical companies. This comes after an employee from the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) was wrongly administered the equivalent of five doses of the vaccine due to a human error. The recommended schedule for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is two doses, 21 days apart. \x93Clinical trial data from Pfizer-BioNTech has indicated that receiving more than the recommended dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to be harmful,\x94 said MOH in response to CNA\x92s queries. \x93The affected staff is well, and did not have any adverse reaction or side effects.\x94 MOH said the incident at SNEC is an isolated one due to a human error by a staff member administering the vaccine, adding that it has not been notified of any similar incidents at other vaccination sites. The error happened on Jan 14 during a vaccination exercise conducted at SNEC for its staff members. According to SNEC in an earlier media release, investigations showed that the error resulted from a lapse in communication among the vaccination team at the time. \x93The staff in charge of diluting the vaccine had been called away to attend to other matters during the preparation of the vaccine, and a second staff member had mistaken the undiluted dose in the vial to be ready for administering,\x94 said SNEC. The error was discovered within minutes of the vaccination when the affected employee was resting in a designated area after the jab. As a precaution, the affected employee was warded at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for observation as was discharged two days later. AFFECTED STAFF SCHEDULED FOR SECOND DOSAGE PENDING TEST RESULTS In response to CNA's queries, the eye centre said the affected employee remains well and is scheduled for the second dosage of the vaccine, pending the blood serology test results. ""We will continue to monitor the staff\x92s health closely and provide the necessary support to the staff and family. The staff is currently well and back to work,"" it said. On why it made the error public more than three weeks after the incident, SNEC said: ""Our immediate priority is the well-being of the affected staff. We were focused on ensuring that the staff remains well, with no adverse reaction or side effects. We also wanted to respect the privacy of the staff and the staff\x92s family members."" It added that after the vaccination exercise at SNEC was immediately suspended, it focused on investigations and putting in place measures to ensure that such lapses do not happen again. ""In the meantime, we kept the Ministry of Health informed on the health of the staff and on our investigation,"" said SNEC. The employee responsible for administering the erroneous injection has been counselled, it added. MOH said there are \x93robust medical protocols in place\x94 at all COVID-19 vaccination sites to ensure the safety of people who received the jab. \x93These include protocols for vaccination processes on dose preparation, dilution and vaccine administration, including the need for clear indication to differentiate diluted and undiluted vaccine vials,\x94 said the ministry. \x93Following the incident, we have reminded vaccination providers to adhere strictly to the protocols,\x94 it added. \x93The safety and health of those receiving the vaccine are our top priority. MOH will continue to work with vaccination providers to ensure the utmost safety in the vaccination process.\x94 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...7236?cid=FBcna",2021-02-14 01:36:00

"SIA's SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am, carrying a crew of 12.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG SIA's vaccinated crew before their flight to Jakarta.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG SINGAPORE - The first Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight staffed by pilots and cabin crew vaccinated against the coronavirus left Changi Airport on Thursday (Feb 11), marking a significant milestone for the battered national carrier. Flight SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am carrying a crew of 12, and is the first of three departing SIA Group flights with crew who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Scoot flight TR606 to Bangkok also left Changi at 9.30am with a set of 11 vaccinated crew members, while SilkAir's first vaccinated flight MI608 will leave for Phnom Penh at 4.30pm with a crew of eight. The crew members are among more than 52,000 personnel in the transport sector who have received their first dose of the vaccine as at Feb 10. The Ministry of Transport said more than 39,000 workers in the aviation and maritime sectors have gotten their first jab - over 90 per cent of the 43,000 front-liners in both sectors. More than 14,000 land transport workers have also received the first dose of the vaccine, with the remaining 66,000 scheduled to get their jabs in the coming months. In a statement, SIA Group, which has suffered billions in losses because of the ongoing pandemic, said it is among the first airlines in the world to operate flights with fully vaccinated crews. Noting that the Government has prioritised the aviation sector in the national drive to vaccinate Singaporeans and other long-term residents, SIA said this reflected the sector's importance and the national carrier's crucial role in Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against Covid-19. SIA chief executive Goh Choon Phong said: ""Vaccinations will be key to the reopening of borders and to enhancing travel confidence, in tandem with robust testing regimes and the wide-ranging safe management measures that are in place on the ground and in the air."" He added: ""They offer greater protection for our people and provide an added layer of assurance to our customers."" Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, who spoke to crew members operating SQ956 on Thursday morning, said the vaccination drive has been ""proceeding like clockwork"". He told reporters he is confident that a substantial number of workers from the aviation and maritime sectors will be fully vaccinated by the end of the month. Singapore's biggest vulnerability is its border, he said, given that the virus is under control here with very few community cases. ""If the border staff that come into contact with the outside world are all vaccinated, I think we would have really taken a very big step in securing our border and keeping Singaporeans safe,"" he added. Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung speaking to SIA\x92s vaccinated crew members on Feb 11, 2021. ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG Passenger traffic at Changi Airport, which has been decimated by Covid-19, fell by 82.8 per cent last year. Front-line workers in the aviation and maritime sectors started getting jabs on Jan 13 as part of an operational trial, before the mass exercise began in earnest on Jan 18. Bus and train workers started getting jabs from Jan 25. SIA said its operating crew members have responded very positively to the exercise, with more than 90 per cent of cabin crew and pilots signing up for the vaccine to date. Its milestone comes days after a 41-year-old cabin crew member on a turnaround flight to the United Arab Emirates tested positive for the coronavirus. The Singaporean woman was the fifth person on the flight to test positive, with preliminary test results showing that all five had contracted the more infectious B117 strain of the virus. The air stewardess had departed Singapore for Dubai on Jan 30 and returned on Jan 31 without disembarking from the aircraft. She then received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Feb 2. She lost her sense of smell two days later but did not seek medical attention. Her case was eventually picked up during routine testing as required by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. The Health Ministry reiterated on Tuesday that it takes a few weeks for individuals to build up immunity against Covid-19 after completing vaccination, and it is possible to get infected just before or after inoculation. Other airlines have also begun vaccinating their crew. Mr Ong said last month that SIA could be the first vaccinated international airline of the world. On Wednesday, Etihad Airways staked its claim as the first airline in the world to have inoculated all its operating pilots and cabin crew. The United Arab Emirates airline said in a statement that more than three-quarters of its workforce have already received at least one dose of the vaccine. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ource=facebook",2021-11-02 13:13:00

Flight SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am carrying a crew of 12, and is the first of three departing SIA Group flights with crew who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Scoot flight TR606 to Bangkok also left Changi at 9.30am with a set of 11 vaccinated crew members, while SilkAir's first vaccinated flight MI608 will leave for Phnom Penh at 4.30pm with a crew of eight.

"TOKYO Japan is unlikely to inoculate as many people with Pfizer Inc's COVID-19 vaccine as planned due to a shortage of special syringes capable of extracting the final dose from vials provided by the drugmaker, health minister Norihisa Tamura said Tuesday. The country said last month that it had secured doses for 72 million people based on the assumption that each vial could provide six shots. But without low dead space syringes, which minimize the amount of vaccine left in the syringe after use, a vial ends up yielding only five doses -- enough for 60 million people. ""The syringes used in Japan can only draw five doses. We will use all the syringes we have that can draw six doses, but it will, of course, not be enough as more shots are administered,"" said Tamura. The government is requesting medical equipment manufacturers step up production of the special syringes. Reuters reported last month that the United States and European Union countries have also been scrambling to secure enough low dead space syringes to squeeze more doses from the Pfizer vaccine, with manufacturers urged to boost their overall production capacity.",2021-10-02 13:38:00

Only grp is if you are > age 70, or in healthcare (very small grp relative to the general population anyway) Simply put, you decide now, is still way too early a decision. Anyway the below was recently modelled for Canada (red line for the B.1.1.7 variant) if current restrictions are still followed.  Green is for current variants.  Seems like in next few months shd that happens there and a few more countries around the world, there could be a possibility of higher pressure for the mRNA ones to be modified? It's possible the same story will unfold like last year in other countries as well (USA?), exponential growth etc, gone through that already. You won't have to wait long to know if that really shd happen, and as below age 70 pax, no change in current plans, regardless.

His swabs taken during quarantine and as part of rostered routine testing (RRT) - the last being on Jan 29 - were all negative for the virus. He developed fatigue on Feb 4 and a fever the next day, but did not seek medical attention, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). He was tested on Feb 5 as part of RRT and his test result came back positive the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). ""While his serological test taken on Feb 7 has come back positive, this is assessed to be a recent infection as he is symptomatic, and the Ct value for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was low,"" said MOH. It added that the patient's first dose of vaccine on Jan 27 accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination. ""As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been infected due to vaccination,"" said MOH, ""It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination."" The other unlinked community case is a 49-year-old bus driver who transports individuals placed on stay-home notice (SHN) from Changi Airport to dedicated facilities. His bus is disinfected after every trip, added MOH. The bus driver, who works at Cobb & Coach Services, developed a runny nose on Jan 31 but did not seek medical attention. He was detected when he was tested on Feb 5 as part of RRT. MOH added that his earlier tests from RRT - the last being on Jan 23 - were negative for Covid-19 infection and his serology test is also negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.",2021-09-02 12:07:00

"South Africa has put its roll-out of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold after a study showed ""disappointing"" results against its new Covid variant. Scientists say the strain accounts for 90% of new Covid cases in South Africa. The study, involving around 2,000 people, found the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases of Covid-19. South Africa has received 1m doses of the AstraZeneca jab and was due to start vaccinating people next week.",2021-08-02 09:04:00

"https://www.ft.com/content/e9bbd4fe-...3-be64140a3f36 Oxford/AstraZeneca jab fails to prevent mild and moderate Covid from S African strain, study shows Impact on hospitalisations and deaths caused by variant not yet determined, according to preliminary findings The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine does not appear to offer protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the viral variant first identified in South Africa, according to a study. Although none of the more than 2,000 mainly healthy and young patients in the study died or was hospitalised, the findings, which have not yet been peer reviewed, could*complicate the race to roll out vaccines as new strains emerge. In both the human trials and tests on the blood of those vaccinated, the jab showed significantly reduced efficacy against the 501Y.V2 viral variant, which is dominant in South Africa, according to the randomised, double-blind study seen by the Financial Times. \x93A two-dose regimen of [the vaccine] did not show protection against mild-moderate Covid-19 due to [the South African variant]\x94, the study says, adding that efficacy against severe Covid-19, hospitalisations and deaths was not yet determined. While all Covid-19 vaccines so far have largely held up against the B.1.1.7 variant that emerged in the UK, the strain that originated in South Africa has been more worrying. Both Johnson & Johnson and Novavax have said their vaccines were less effective against the strain in clinical trials conducted in South Africa. In trials, both vaccines offered complete protection against severe disease and death in relation to Covid-19. Moderna has said it will test a booster shot and a reformulated vaccine to target the South African variant, after studies showed its vaccine was significantly less effective. BioNTech/Pfizer said their vaccine was slightly less effective in a lab study using a pseudovirus with some mutations from the 501Y.V2 variant, but have not published results of tests against the variant itself. There are caveats to the Oxford/AstraZeneca study, as the sample sizes were relatively small. The study, led by South Africa\x92s University of the Witwatersrand and Oxford university, enrolled 2,026 HIV negative individuals, with a median age of 31. Half the group was given at least one dose of placebo, with the other half receiving at least one dose of vaccine.",2021-07-02 23:23:00

After six months of experiments, results showed that compounds from coconut oil and VCO decreased coronavirus count by 60 percent to 90 percent at low viral load. ""The results are very promising, as not only does it show that the VCO, by itself, can destroy the virus, but it also has a key mechanism in up-regulating the immune response against COVID-19.""",2021-07-02 23:23:00

"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...error-14126784 SINGAPORE: An employee at the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) was wrongly administered the equivalent of five doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine due to a human error, the public healthcare institution said on Saturday (Feb 6). The error happened on Jan 14 during a vaccination exercise conducted at SNEC for its staff members. \x93The error was discovered within minutes of the vaccination when the staff was resting in a designated area after vaccination,\x94 said SNEC in a press release. \x93Senior doctors were alerted immediately and the staff was assessed and found to be well, with no adverse reaction or side effects.\x94 READ: Getting more than recommended dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine unlikely to be harmful: MOH As a precaution, the affected employee was warded at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for observation. ""The staff\x92s condition remained stable throughout and the staff was discharged two days later. We have been following up closely with the staff, who remains well,"" said SNEC. The vaccination exercise at the eye centre was stopped immediately and the rest of its employees were vaccinated at SGH. \x93SNEC is not involved in Singapore\x92s vaccination exercise for any other groups,\x94 it said. READ: 4 out of 155,000 people vaccinated had severe allergic reactions, all have recovered According to SNEC, investigations showed that it was a human error resulting from a lapse in communication among the vaccination team at the time. \x93The staff in charge of diluting the vaccine had been called away to attend to other matters during the preparation of the vaccine, and a second staff member had mistaken the undiluted dose in the vial to be ready for administering,\x94 said SNEC. READ: Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine authorised for use in Singapore, first shipment expected around March The eye centre has done a \x93thorough review\x94 of its internal processes and has taken steps to ensure that such lapses do not happen again, said SNEC\x92s medical director Professor Wong Tien Yin, apologising for the incident. \x93SNEC takes a very serious view of this incident. The safety of those receiving the vaccination during our staff vaccination exercise is of our utmost priority. We are extremely sorry that this incident happened,\x94 he said. \x93We have apologised to the staff concerned and the staff\x92s family. We will continue to monitor the staff\x92s health closely and provide the necessary support.\x94 In response to CNA's queries, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said clinical trial data from Pfizer-BioNTech has indicated that receiving more than the recommended dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to be harmful. MOH added that the incident at SNEC is an isolated one, and that it has not been notified of any similar incidents at other vaccination sites. SNEC told CNA that the affected employee remains well and is scheduled for the second dosage of the vaccine, pending the blood serology test results.
